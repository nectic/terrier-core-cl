 WATERSHED PLAN: All of that bamboo-like arundo will come out. And state 
workers will pull any other weeds as part of an ambitious effort to restore the 
Ventura River estuary (B1) . . . . The California Coastal Conservancy may put 
up $400,000 for the project that will create a Seaside Wilderness Park, 
including a wooden trail over the sand dunes, a visitor center and 
amphitheater.Said Friends of the Ventura River's Mark Capelli: "It will be a 
major attraction for both visitors and residents." 
</P>
<P>
 RISKY BUSINESS: Professional beekeepers are becoming a rare species in Ventura 
County as a glut of imported honey makes commercial hives a sticky venture 
(B1). . . . And now beekeepers are worried about the arrival of aggressive, 
Africanized bees. The "killer bees" are just over the border in Arizona and 
expected to enter California during this spring's swarming season. 
</P>
<P>
 ONE GOOD TURN: Given $350 to help them replace classroom equipment broken in 
January's earthquake, a group of Simi Valley schoolchildren has decided to pass 
on the good will to Alabama tornado victims. Kids at Atherwood Elementary 
School raised about $150 for the Methodist Church that was flattened by a 
twister last month.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: TAXES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 TAXING DAY: Friday is the deadline for completing your 1993 income tax forms. 
It's the Postal Service's biggest day of the year for customer service and the 
third biggest for total mail. In all, the Internal Revenue Service collected 
$11.1 billion from Orange County taxpayers last year and expects about the same 
this year. . . . Most of the county's 1.2 million federal returns -- including 
an expected 75,000 requests for extension -- will be mailed, but filing 
electronically via computer gets more popular in Orange County every year. 
</P>
<P>
 CYBERFRAUD: Electronic filing -- with its promise of speedy refunds -- has 
attracted computer con artists who found they could make quick money by 
submitting returns with fake names and phony information. . . . Last year, the 
IRS lost $24 million that way, but a major crackdown is underway. The 
government has changed its computer programming to try to detect fraud before 
issuing refunds, says Internal Revenue spokeswoman Judith A. Golden in Laguna 
Niguel. "We'll be freezing any refunds up front electronically if something is 
wrong. We've also set up a similar pre-refund screening for paper returns." 
</P>
<P>
 HEFTY MAILBAGS: April 15 is the only time that 12 major post office branches 
in the county provide curbside service and stay open until midnight. (B2) At 
the main Santa Ana post office, where all county mail is processed, up to 2 
million pieces of mail are expected. . . . That's almost twice the normal daily 
load, but not even close to the several days in December when Christmas cards 
and gifts can push the daily mail count up to 3.1 million pieces a day. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST MINUTE: Those queuing up at the post office on tax night often are in a 
festive mood as they joke and swap stories, says postal spokeswoman Terri 
Bouffiou in Santa Ana, who expects this Friday to be "real crazy." . . . Many 
even wait to fill out their tax returns until they're at the counter -- because 
that's what they've always done, she says. "I suspect it's a sort of subtle 
protest against paying taxes." Taxes by Computer 
</P>
<P>
 The number of county residents filing electronic tax returns has more than 
doubled since 1989, although it still represents only about 6% of all returns 
filed. 1989: 30,180 1990: 41,910 1991: 58,990 1992: 64,625 1993: 69,135 Source:

GOLO MANN; HISTORIAN, SON OF NOVELIST THOMAS MANN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gottfried (Golo) Mann, a widely read historian who wrote extensively on the 
relationship between politics and literature and who was the last surviving son 
of novelist Thomas Mann, has died at age 85, his publisher said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann died in his sleep Thursday in Leverkusen, north of Cologne, said Wolfgang 
Mertz of the publishing firm S. Fischer. He had been suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 With the death of Golo Mann, the third of six children of Thomas and Katharina 
Mann, Germany has lost not only the last internationally prominent member of a 
family that left a huge impact on its intellectual scene but a historian whose 
heritage made him keenly aware of the place of poets and novelists on the world 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Golo Mann was 24 when he and his parents fled Nazi Germany in 1933. He lived 
in France and Switzerland before emigrating in 1942 to the United States. The 
Mann family lived with other German exiles in Los Angeles and Golo Mann taught 
history at Claremont College in California and then Olivet College in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Europe in 1957. After retiring from his political science chair 
at Stuttgart's university in 1964, Mann moved to Switzerland, where he lived in 
Kilchberg until shortly before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann was perhaps best known in Germany for his biography of Prince 
Wallenstein, a 17th-Century imperial general, and for his best-selling memoirs, 
which were published in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kirsch, the late Times book critic, found "Wallenstein: His Life 
Narrated," "a work not only of erudition but of art." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's 1958 book, "German History of the 19th and 20th Century," was a 
passionate but careful examination of the Nazi period. In contrast to other 
postwar historians, Mann never intimated that Nazism might have been determined 
by German character, historian Urs Bitterli wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann also had a popular talk show on public television in the 1970s, when he 
backed the Social Democratic government's detente with East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, he had grown more conservative; he called the battle against 
left-wing terrorists "a new civil war" and demanded that Germany close the door 
to Third World immigrants. In 1986, he suggested that Germany had done enough 
penance for the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's father, author of "The Magic Mountain" and "Death in Venice," won the 
Nobel Prize for literature in 1929. His uncle Heinrich was a famous 
anti-fascist polemicist and novelist. His sister Erika was an actress and 
essayist and his brother Klaus authored a novel, "Mephisto," before committing 
suicide in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Golo Mann, who never married, is survived by a sister, Elisabeth 
Mann-Borghese, a marine biologist living in Canada.

DOLE SAYS GOP READY TO FORCE WHITEWATER ISSUE IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans are ready to stall debate on health care and other issues if 
Democrats block efforts to set up hearings on the First Family's role in the 
Whitewater land deal, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said he would meet Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) today and 
was hopeful that they could work out a legislative agenda, including Whitewater 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not ready yet, but if it keeps dragging and we don't get results, I 
don't think we have any choice but to try to at least get our point across," 
Dole said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, appearing on the same program, said the Republicans risk alienating 
the public by filibustering action on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Dole is a good friend, and he is a very smart man. And I would not want 
to be him going to the American people and saying: 'We think Whitewater is more 
important than passing a crime bill, we think Whitewater is more important than 
passing a health care bill . . . and we're just going to stop this government 
cold until we get some satisfaction on Whitewater.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On another matter, Mitchell, a leading candidate for the upcoming vacancy on 
the Supreme Court, said he would have to consider leaving his Senate post if 
nominated to the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he had not been contacted by the White House about the seat and 
that he had made no decision on the matter.

YOUTH SLAIN IN VENICE GANG SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old man was fatally shot early Sunday outside a party at a Venice 
housing project, in what Los Angeles police are calling a gang-related 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a gunman drove past the Marionwood public housing complex about 3 
a.m. and fired several shots at Manuel Hernandez as the teen-ager tried to run 
for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who lived in the housing project and had been attending the party, 
was hit in the upper and lower body. He was pronounced dead at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center, police said.

 Police said Sunday that they had no information about the shooting from 
witnesses. "Everyone knows (Hernandez), but no one is talking," Detective 
Cedric Wilder said.

 Police said the shooting was gang-related but do not know what gang Hernandez 
belonged too.

GEORGE RAMOS: BATTLING UPSTREAM IN FROGTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 years ago, the big excitement around Birkdale Street in Frogtown was 
pickup games of soccer that Dolores Lopez's husband organized for neighborhood 
kids on a nearby empty lot. There were also the forays down to the Los Angeles 
River for a swim or to check out the croakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Frogtown was an obscure three-mile-long sliver of Los Angeles, located 
northwest of Downtown and wedged between the river and Elysian Park, where 
Dodger Stadium is. Few people know the area by its proper name -- Elysian 
Valley -- but many have heard of Frogtown, the nickname given in honor of the 
amphibian invaders from the river that routinely overran neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the frogs don't come around these days. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because there is a cleaning solvent factory on Birkdale that residents 
say makes their tiny corner of L.A. a living hell. In the last 10 years, the 
company has expanded, taking over the empty lots around it and cutting off 
access to the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-wheel trucks clog the narrow streets, creating safety hazards. 
Dolores Lopez says it has even cost her a job because the traffic made her late 
too often. Factory employees are forced to park on nearby streets. They 
sometimes leave trash on residents' lawns. Emissions from the factory stink up 
the air.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bring back the frogs," Birkdale's human residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Birkdale residents, such as Lopez and Odette Saliot, have been fighting 
the factory for more than 20 years. They've called the cops when traffic to the 
factory, Mission Kleensweep, backed up on the street, leaving residents to 
wonder when they could get out of their driveways. They called City Hall with 
each new intrusion in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did this happen?" Saliot growls, wondering how a factory is allowed to 
remain in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is not a good neighbor," Lopez adds. 
</P>
<P>
 If this situation had occurred in a more affluent part of Los Angeles, say 
Beverly Hills, the politicians would have acted quickly on the residents' 
complaints, Lopez and Saliot said the other night. It would not have taken 
years for their problems with the factory to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is Frogtown, a racially mixed community of 8,000 where things happen 
slowly. It's impossible to see Frogtown from the nearby Golden State Freeway 
because of sound walls built by the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists find Frogtown by mistake. That leads to a frequently asked question 
out on Riverside Drive: "How do you get out of here to Dodger Stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year fight has brought some rewards. Petition drives have turned back 
some expansion plans. Recently, truck deliveries that came as early as 3:30 
a.m. have been pushed back to 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 City and regional agencies have assured the residents that the company has 
complied with all laws regulating hazardous waste storage and disposal. And the 
company's fumes have never violated air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big deal," Lopez sniffs, sticking to her contention that a company such as 
Mission Kleensweep shouldn't be in the same neighborhood with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight heated up last month when Mission Kleensweep asked for a conditional 
use permit for a parking lot for its 45 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Its president, Bob Rosenbaum, sought it to address one of the residents' 
concerns, that employees park on nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frogtown residents wouldn't buy it. To them, endorsing the lot would be an 
invitation to expand the factory. Unified in their opposition, they found 
themselves talking of life before Mission Kleensweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here was like a big family," Lopez says of the area when she and her 
husband, Mario, both natives of Guadalajara, moved in 25 years ago. "The kids 
used to play soccer in a lot where the plant is now. The frogs used to come up 
from the river." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she remembers hearing the whistles of passing trains on the other 
side of the L.A. River. But those days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Her home on Birkdale, purchased for $17,500 in 1974, is worth about $160,000, 
but she figures that it has dropped $30,000 in value because of the factory. 
Potential buyers have been scared off by it and she admits, "We'd like to move 
but we can't afford to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frogtown scored a victory when the conditional use permit was denied by the 
city two weeks ago. But it's a small consolation for residents who are still 
upset because the factory can't be forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be too much to ask in an ever-changing L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take care of our neighborhoods," resident Jose Moreno said as he walked 
along Riverside Drive. "I'm proud I live in Frogtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Just then, a motorist asked him for directions to Dodger Stadium.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the government of Singapore proceeds as planned, a jailer trained in 
martial arts will presumably soon flog American student Michael Fay six times 
with a moistened rattan cane as punishment for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a harsh penalty that often leaves permanent scars and sends those being 
punished into shock. Yet, many Americans support the sentence and agree that 
Fay should take personal responsibility for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the institution of California's new "three strikes and you're out" law, 
it has become clear that Americans are fed up with rising crime rates and favor 
tougher punishment for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if those commenting in today's Platform are any indication, many 
Americans are not yet ready to advocate Singapore's method of corporal 
punishment as a way to deter crime in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There's yet another way to look at responsibility and punishment says Robert 
McLaren, professor of human development at Cal State Fullerton. He argues that 
the only way to hold people accountable for their crimes is to eliminate jail 
terms altogether and force criminals to pay direct restitution to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mere revenge doesn't solve the problem and it only costs the taxpayers. You 
put a person in jail, it costs $25,000 to $30,000 a year to keep him there and 
his victims have not been helped," McLaren says. "The whole issue of 
responsibility is what society needs to enforce." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of responsibility is also the topic of Youth Opinion. A number of 
unwed fathers tell how they came to have kids at an early age and how they are 
handling what for most of them was an unexpected -- and in most cases -- an 
unwanted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, most of the young men did not expect the consequences of 
their actions to be a child. Experts believe this self-absorption and lack of 
awareness is eroding the nation's moral structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost sight of the common good," says Russ Gough, professor of 
philosophy and ethics at Pepperdine University. "Because we have so many 
opportunities, liberties and guaranteed freedoms, some of those freedoms have 
actually evolved into vices." 
</P>
<P>
 The experts also see the increasing lack of commitment to religion as another 
reason for the erosion of moral and ethical values. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apart from a belief in God, there is no foundation for morality," says David 
Wilkinson, pastor of Moorpark Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gough and Wilkinson agree that increased involvement in religious 
activities would do much to improve American moral values. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the increasing erosion of individual responsibility, the breakdown of 
the home and the dwindling numbers of people attending religious services, 
youngsters are getting their moral values on the street and at the playground," 
Gough says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because moral education in many cases is not being taught at home, Gough 
argues that public schools should help fill the vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must talk about, embrace, affirm and teach universally accepted moral 
values such as honesty, respect, self-restraint and truthfulness," he says.

 "I used to come almost every day to do homework in the coffee shops. It's fun 
to look down the street -- there's a '50s-looking grill, then a barber shop, 
then next to it the folk music store.It's a creative place. People seem to be 
expressing themselves, building their own little businesses. It's a quiet town 
that seems almost surreal sometimes. You can look up and see snowcapped 
mountains. It's so different from the Midwest where I grew up. When I got off 
the plane from Minneapolis last vacation, it was 80 degrees warmer!"

 Claremont Village began in 1887 as a depot for shipping citrus by rail. Today 
it's a college town known as the "Oxford of the Orange Belt" because of the 
highly regarded Claremont Colleges of Pomona, Harvey Mudd, Claremont McKenna, 
Pitzer, Scripps and Claremont Graduate School. The village was redesigned to 
encourage walking, sitting and people watching. The village is located about 35 
miles east of Downtown, north of the I-10 freeway. Metrolink serves the Spanish 
Colonial Revival train depot weekdays; buses operate daily. For information,

'DOES IT REALLY DETER ANYTHING?'

 Letters from newspaper readers and broadcast interviews indicate that many 
Americans agree with Singapore's decision to flog an Ohio teen-ager convicted 
of vandalism. Would that be an appropriate punishment here for graffiti tagging 
and like crimes? The following is a sampling of views. HOWARD GARBER 
</P>
<P>
 Interim director, American Civil Responsibilities Union, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 We have been afflicted by a pervasive permissiveness unequaled in our history 
and, as a result, have been on a downward spiral morally and sociologically, 
despite record anti-crime and welfare expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACRU submits that punishment is not the solution, rather we must challenge 
those promoting unrestricted freedom, which is really license to disrupt and 
destroy orderly society. KATIE WAITMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary, Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think flogging would be particularly effective because, like 
high-school swatting, it basically breeds resentment. Does it really deter 
anything? A lot of the people who are committing petty crimes were beaten 
themselves while growing up. It's just more of the same. I've always thought 
it's more effective taking away privileges, especially if you're dealing with 
kids. Beating their bodies gives a really bad signal: It says, "Don't do as I 
do, do as I say." That's silly. PAUL JONES 
</P>
<P>
 Community Youth Gang Services, South-Central Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 When you look at such things as flogging and corporal punishment in dealing 
with some of the kids and their behavior, what gets overlooked time and again 
is are we really addressing the root causes of what makes kids do what it is 
they're doing? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that we are looking for easy ways to solve problems that have 
been with us for God knows how long. It's quite obvious to me that many youths 
are getting in trouble and doing all kinds of crazy things because they haven't 
got anything else to do. Some years ago we used to have about 135 teen posts in 
L.A.; now maybe we've got four or five. I think that speaks for itself in terms 
of kids and idle time. CHARLES WHITEBREAD 
</P>
<P>
 Professor, USC Law Center 
</P>
<P>
 Flogging sounds so severe to me. My own view is, though, that a number of 
punishments that are quick and don't have a stigma to them might make sense. 
Might corporal punishment be added to the range of penalties under the criminal 
justice system? It would probably be lawful to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me the question is whether or not we want to try a variety of 
short punishments which might include corporal punishment instead of our 
present use of prisons, something I find very unsuccessful. I'd be willing to 
experiment with a variety of penalties. MARK SINAGUGLIA 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Mayflower Ballroom, Inglewood 
</P>
<P>
 Corporal punishment has its place for children, teen-agers who made a mistake 
in school. I do not believe that corporal punishment would be good for adults. 
They've gone beyond that point. I think jail sentences should be given and 
adhered to: If you commit a crime, you do the time. Monetary restitution should 
be mandatory, along with community service. ROBERT GALLEGOS 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher, Belvedere Middle School, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I am most strongly opposed to incorporating corporal punishment either into 
the school system or society at large for misdemeanor crimes. I'm against the 
flogging of the American teen-ager in Singapore simply because I'm opposed to 
the flogging of any human being under similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 If America were not so outraged at its own inability to control graffiti, 
American sentiment would have immediately condemned this flogging incident.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE AGENCY'S APPROACH: ADVOCATE FOR SENIORS IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California has more residents 65 years and older than any other state, 
according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The figure is likely to rise as baby 
boomers age. Many will come to rely on long-term care from nursing or 
retirement homes and residential board and care facilities. To protect 
residents' interests in these licensed facilities, federal law mandates that 
each state provide advocacy services for them. In California that translates to 
a Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program in each county, with the largest two 
programs in Southern California. These programs, WISE Senior Services in Los 
Angeles County and the Orange County Council on Aging recruit, train and 
supervise volunteers to serve as advocates for residents of long-term care 
facilities. They become long-term care ombudsmen after completing 36 hours of 
instruction about the aging process, long-term care laws and regulations and 
complaint documentation, mediation and resolution. Ombudsmen are certified by 
the state and spend about 20 hours each month visiting facilities in an 
assigned area to meet with residents and to investigate and follow-up on 
concerns about everything from cold food to stolen property to the worst kinds 
of physical abuse and neglect. Some facility administrators and staff bridle at 
their unannounced visits and recommendations for change, but as a Los Angeles 
ombudsman explained, "A few don't like us much, but the smartest ones say they 
want us to mingle with the residents. They see us as an asset. If I bring 
something to their attention it can help make them more responsive to their 
residents' real needs." INTERVENTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Ombudsmen are trained to respond to residents' expressed wishes or complaints 
and, in certain cases even if concerns are not directly expressed, to act in 
the best interests of a resident. They act as a liaison between residents and 
facility administrators, care providers and family members and provide an 
on-going social contact for a group of people who often live in isolation. 
While they have no enforcement powers they may report their findings to 
government enforcement agencies. Examples of ombudsmen responses include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Working with nursing home staff to incorporate ethnic foods into facility 
menu 
</P>
<P>
 -- Informing a facility administrator that residents have the right to have 
drapes drawn in rooms before having their clothes changed 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reminding staff that urine bags must be changed regularly 
</P>
<P>
 -- Confirming and reporting that family members are withholding a resident's 
Social Security check THE NEED FOR OMBUDSMEN

 "Volunteering as a senior ombudsman is not for the faint-hearted, but it is 
for the big-hearted. It's demanding and sometimes sad, but there's a tremendous 
reward in helping people who often have no one else there for them."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Chandler, Irvine, coordinator of volunteers, Orange County Council on 
Aging RESIDENTS' RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of long-term care facilities have state and federal-mandated rights 
within several broad categories: 
</P>
<P>
 Self-determination -- including the right to choose a personal physician and 
to participate in planning and making changes in their own care and treatment 
</P>
<P>
 Privacy -- including the right to have private medical treatment, personal 
visits, written and telephone communications and confidential personal and 
clinical records  
</P>
<P>
 Freedom from abuse -- including the right to be free from physical or mental 
abuse or threats, corporal punishment, involuntary seclusion, restraints or use 
of drugs for discipline  
</P>
<P>
 Information -- including the right to receive written information at admission 
and throughout their stay about services and charges at a facility 
</P>
<P>
 Visits -- including the right to receive visits by relatives, friends, clergy, 
ombudsmen  
</P>
<P>
 Protection of personal funds -- including right to written record of all 
transactions if facility is responsible for resident's funds TO GET INVOLVED 
</P>

Program. Call (800) 334-9473 or (310) 394-9871. Bilingual ombudsmen are always 
in need, and there is an urgent need for ombudsmen in the East San Gabriel 
Valley and in Central, South-Central and East Los Angeles.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TESTIMONY; ONE 
PERSON'S STORY ABOUT PREVENTING VIOLENCE; 'WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER; Billie Weiss is the director of the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health Services' Injury and Violence Prevention Program 
and co-founder of the Violence Prevention Coalition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm an epidemiologist by training. I track diseases, I look at what causes 
disease and who's at greatest risk to get them. Then I try and find ways to 
intervene and prevent it.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1981 I began to look at the leading causes of death in L.A. County. And the 
more I looked at this data, the more I realized that homicide is the leading 
cause of death for the population under 45. Particularly among the male 
population aged 15-34, and particularly African American and Latino males. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about an epidemic. Since 1981, about 5,000 more people have died 
because of violence than were killed by AIDS. And the public health resources 
that have been poured into AIDS are incredible compared with what has been 
poured into violence prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence may not seem like a disease, but public health professionals have 
learned that we can isolate by age and sex and geographic location where 
violence is most likely to occur, and we've found that if you can get in and 
intervene, violence appears to be preventable in the way that other public 
health problems are preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll give you an example of a very successful violence-prevention approach. 
Jordan High School, which is in the middle of the most violent parts of L.A., 
has a very low level of violence. They have some very successful programs. They 
have an excellent peer-counseling program. When kids have problems or disputes, 
most schools provide adult counselors. But at Jordan they have trained students 
to do the counseling, and kids are more willing to go to their peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan High School and its immediate surroundings have far less violence, far 
fewer homicides and fewer expulsions for carrying weapons than other schools in 
the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 So we have successful models, but people haven't given them enough support. 
What if every business in Los Angeles of over, say, 150 people, adopted a 
school and allowed employees to produce an after-school program and bring kids 
into the business and begin to train them? Kids want jobs, desperately. They 
are just not available. 
</P>
<P>
 When you talk to kids who grow up in poor, violent environments and come out 
OK, you find that there are concrete reasons why they made it. Studies on what 
gang-proofs a kid, for example, have found that these kids have had at least 
one person who they felt really cared about them. It might be a teacher, a 
parent, or just a close friend. And they have had a job. And they have had 
after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 These are pretty concrete things, and a lot of kids living in violent 
neighborhoods don't have or don't know how to accept these things. Things the 
rest of us take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 If you talk to gang kids you find an extremely high-proportion of them have 
been abused, or have witnessed violence in their homes, and kids who witness 
and are victims of violence are much more likely to be involved with violence 
as they get older. 
</P>
<P>
 Many children are growing up believing that violence is a normal way of life. 
We need to change that perception. 
</P>
<P>
 But we haven't taught that violence is unacceptable. We've glorified it. We've 
glorified it in movies, our heroes are violent. 
</P>
<P>
 I was at a meeting where a woman stood up and said, "Why don't we bring the 
National Guard into the schools?" And my first reaction to that was, well, 
we'll just declare war on our kids and take care of the problem that way. 
</P>
<P>
 When you send a young person to prison, what you give them is a master's 
degree in how to continue to perpetrate criminal and violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes and you're out" proponents want to lock these kids up 
forever, just write off a generation. Who is going to pay for keeping people in 
prison all of this time? It currently costs $30,000 a year to keep a person in 
prison in California. How are we going to pay for that? That means the programs 
that are likely to be cut are the programs that could provide long-term 
solutions.  
</P>
<P>
 There are people who say we've coddled poor communities, that we've given them 
a fair shot and they didn't take advantage of it. I would like to say to those 
people, "Spend a day going to school and living in a violent neighborhood, just 
a day, and see if you still believe if they've been coddled." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I was talking to a kid from Compton, and this kid said to me, "You 
know, I can buy guns on my street, I can buy drugs on my street, but I can't go 
to a movie" -- because there are no theaters in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 We have got to understand that people living in poor neighborhoods are no 
different than anybody else, they are simply in different circumstances and 
they are trying their damnedest to protect themselves and their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a lot of them have lost control of their kids. But a lot of people in 
middle-class neighborhoods lose control of their kids too, they just don't use 
social programs because they are able to pay for the kinds of programs, like 
psychological counseling, that can turn their kids around, or help the family 
turn itself around if necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 To people who say to me, let's write these people off, just keep in mind we 
spend approximately $3 billion a year in this county on the results of 
violence, and most of it is paid for by the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>

240-7785. The coalition is planning a march to "Stop the Violence Now" at 10 
a.m. Saturday at Olvera Plaza in Downtown Los Angeles.

 Being a father does put a lot of pressure on me. Even though I'm just a child, 
I have to act like a man now. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't gone to school for a year. I dropped out to start looking for a job. 
I want to get back into school because having a McDonald's-type job won't help 
me take care of my family. My girlfriend doesn't accept any help from the 
government. My mother really helps out by letting us live with her and at the 
same time Carla (his girlfriend) works too. As soon as we got together Carla 
got pregnant. We didn't use protection because we planned to have this baby. We 
were sure about each other. JARROD HETTLER

 I am a father now. It happened February 22. (Stephanie) gave birth to a boy. 
His name is Dru Nathan Hettler. (Being a dad and going to high school) is a 
little tiring at times, because not only do I work and go to high school, but I 
also parent now. I'm a sales representative, part-time at a (video store). And 
aside from that, I work on movies once in a while, building sets, and that's 
very stressful. But the money is there. I'm still living with my parents, and 
she is living with her Mom in Glendale. My parents were very supportive at the 
time, my father was extremely supportive financially and emotionally. He was 
there for me. Her parents were a little shocked. LAWRENCE DANTE KLINE SR.

 Being a father don't make you a man. I know I have to take care of what I 
made. I don't want my son to grow up in a house without me. We didn't plan to 
have a baby, temptation got us. I regret not using protection, but I have no 
complaints. We both have jobs, and we know the baby comes first. When I told my 
Mom she went off on me. Nobody was really happy because of my age. Me and my 
mother hardly spoke. The baby really came in-between us until she accepted it 
-- when my girlfriend was about seven months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 We plan to marry later. But right now I'm not thinking about marriage 'cause 
we are both in school. It looks dumb for people in high school to be married.

 Having a baby really didn't affect my everyday life. It's just you have a baby 
and you attend to that baby. I didn't want a baby this soon, but my baby's 
momma trapped me.  
</P>
<P>
 The only regret I have is that now my baby's mother gets to bug me when I 
don't want to be bothered. I have to listen because it's always about my baby. 
I'm very active in my child's life. Having a baby this young really hasn't 
changed my plans. I'm still going to be a rapper. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't really run into financial trouble because my family helps out 
whenever the baby needs something. I'm not working yet because I want to wait 
until I'm 16.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MULTICULTURAL 
MANNERS; TRIBAL LOYALTY AT HEART OF THE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORINE DRESSER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fascination with art of the Southwest attracts Mickey to Native American 
culture. He believes society can learn from their values of community and 
sharing.Consequently, he forms an organization to support tribal activities in 
that region and provide cultural exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey arranges for an intercultural meeting and promotes a distinguished 
Indian leader as the featured speaker. Tickets sell out for the event, but on 
the set date, the guest of honor doesn't show. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Mickey was angry until he discovered that the Indian leader faced a 
tribal emergency. Regardless of the pay or recognition he was to receive, the 
leader's community came first. Ironically, the very reason why Native American 
life appealed to Mickey -- strong family ties and a solid sense of community -- 
was precisely why the tribal leader stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 Through this experience, Mickey learned to adjust to the reality that Native 
American allegiance to the tribe was more important than honor for individual 
accomplishment. At subsequent events, he dealt with last-minute changes in 
personnel that frequently occurred by not printing names of specific 
individuals on programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans themselves know how to cope with no-shows. When scheduled 
musicians can't make it to powwows, someone will announce, "Are there any males 
who have drumming experience?" Invariably the needed number of musicians will 
be found in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Among Native Americans, family and tribal loyalties have priority over 
recognition for individual achievement.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GRIPE; HOW PARENTS 
CAN BAT ZERO

 It's that time of year again: Little League baseball is beginning. The sound 
of aluminum bats hitting horse hide, or horse hide hitting human batters, is in 
the air. But the most compelling sounds you might hear at some ball parks are 
not those of baseball being played, but of parents yelling their version of how 
it should be played, coached or umpired. 
</P>
<P>
 All parents know how to play and coach baseball. Never mind that some of them 
never played, never coached and certainly never umpired it. It's a mother and 
father thing. When your kids get to be Little League age, you know baseball. It 
just happens. It's also in the parents manual, the chapter that says, "Don't 
worry, overnight you'll be an expert on study habits, dating, puberty and 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 How else to explain the crazy, embarrassing, rude and insane comments and acts 
of some parents? The Dad with thick glasses telling the umpire that he's blind. 
The loudmouth who tripped coming back from the snack bar and spilled his soda 
on everyone yelling at his son to stay alert and watch what he's doing. Mom 
telling the coach he shouldn't yell at the kids, and then turning to her 
youngest in the stands and yelling, "If you don't sit down and behave, you'll 
never play Nintendo again!" 
</P>
<P>
 I've been coaching youth sports for seven years and I'm constantly amazed by 
parents. They've approached me to tell me that they would like to play catch 
with their kids, but with work and all, they just don't have the time. Yet 
somehow they find two hours for two games a week to sit in the stands and 
second-guess me. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, yeah, I can hear you parents saying, "What about the stupid things you 
coaches, players and umpires do?" This is true. We lose our temper, we make 
bonehead decisions and some games we just totally mess up. We have a bad day. 
It kind of sounds like home, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a lot of time and effort to put together a successful Little League 
program, all from volunteers. So parents, chill out this spring and summer. If 
an overwhelming urge comes over you to yell something obnoxious, take some 
coaching advice: Just walk it off!

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
DOES MINORITY MEAN INFERIOR?; 'DESPITE NOBLE INTENTIONS, MULTICULTURALISM 
MARGINALIZES THE CULTURES IT HOPES TO HIGHLIGHT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

lectures at Loyola Marymount University.

<P>
 In the United States today, the words ethnic and cultural have become 
household terms. We live in an environment that is increasingly defined by its 
cultural, ethnic and racial diversity. Our schools have implemented bilingual 
programs and miss no opportunity to declare cultural preservation as a primary 
goal of their teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The awareness of the links between culture and learning has also prompted our 
universities to design multicultural programs that integrate perspectives from 
different ethnic and racial groups in curricula across disciplines. There is a 
general willingness to cross over cultural lines and to redraw boundaries. 
Indeed, the moment seems perfect for us Armenian Americans to take a good look 
at ourselves and to (re)negotiate our own orders as an ethnic minority in a 
so-called majority culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines ethnic as, "of or 
relating to races or large groups of people classed according to common traits 
and customs," it is no secret that in the United States, "ethnic" generally 
refers to anybody who is nonwhite or non-European American, and consequently, 
inferior and marginal. As one student so tellingly put it, "The word when 
defined doesn't hurt, but the way it is expressed hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 I am particularly concerned with the classification of the literature by 
writers of Armenian descent as minority, and, therefore, second-rate. Although 
it is true that good writing is hard to come by, it is also true that most 
mainstream anthologies do not include the works of William Saroyan, winner of 
America's own measure of greatness, the Pulitzer Prize, and arguably one of the 
dominant personalities on the American literary scene during the Depression and 
World War II eras. Saroyan's "A Time of Your Life," a superb play that deals as 
much with the modern American reality as it does with universal human concerns, 
is seldom anthologized. Nonetheless, it is deemed worthy of study in our 
"ethnic literature" classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in effect, instead of integrating the large variety of cultures that 
come together to make up this country, the focus on multicultural education 
has, despite noble intentions, resulted in the exclusion of these cultures. I 
realize that deploring the absence of literature from the core culture is a way 
of paying homage to the dominant culture. Yet, we cannot ignore the fact that 
the creation of the ethnic/mainstream dichotomy has helped perpetuate the 
marginal position Armenians, as an ethnic group, have found ourselves in 
America since the beginning of the century.

AS SCIENTIFIC PUZZLE UNRAVELS, A LEGAL ISSUE TANGLES MORE; NEW GENETIC FINDINGS 
POSE RISING PROBLEMS IN AREA OF PATENTS AND BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early discoverers of and experimenters with electricity could hardly have 
imagined how their work would ultimately transform the world. A similar 
technological upheaval awaits us now as private business starts to exploit the 
revolution in molecular biology to bring new cures, therapies and 
we-know-not-what. Just four decades after James D. Watson and Francis H. C. 
Crick solved the central mystery of inheritance with their discovery of the 
double helix structure of DNA, the genetic material, investors are pouring 
hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that see potential profits where 
Watson and Crick saw only basic science. 
</P>
<P>
 Few disagree that this science is now ripe for use, to the potential benefit 
of all humankind. But the rules of the game have yet to be drawn. For patenting 
and controlling the human genome and its parts present special problems without 
good precedent in law, a situation that has left both government and industry 
confused and divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago the federal government launched the Human Genome Project, a 
costly long-term plan to chart and catalogue the entire human genetic 
endowment. Only about 5% of each person's DNA is used in the actual genes that 
result in expressed traits, such eye color; the purpose of the rest of the DNA 
is still unknown. One of the researchers in the project, J. Craig Venter, then 
with the National Institutes of Health, devised a short cut. He went to the 
heart of the matter and began to focus on just the crucial 5%. Now new robotic 
machines in government and industry are busily deciphering the exact sequence 
of chemicals of thousands of these gene segments. Their specific genetic tasks 
are mostly still uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the NIH stirred a scientific tempest by filing applications for 
patents on 6,869 of Venter's sequences. This was done as part of the Bush 
Administration's and Congress' commitment to "technology transfer" of 
government-supported basic research into commercial applications. The theory 
was that patents would allow the government to bring a more orderly licensing 
of discoveries than if the work were just thrown into the public domain. 
Enraged at the notion that the genome project's results might not be available 
to all scientists, Watson quit as its director.  
</P>
<P>
 The Patent and Trademark Office rejected the applications on the ground that 
the required utility of the sequences had not been demonstrated. Before the 
issue could be appealed to federal court, however, the Clinton Administration 
on Feb. 11 withdrew the applications as "not in the best interest of the public 
or science." But now several private companies have revved up their own 
gene-sequencing machines and are applying for patents. These include Human 
Genome Sciences Inc. (HGS) of Rockville, Md., with which Venter is now 
connected, and Incyte of Palo Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Full genes whose function is known have been granted patents, and all agree 
that concrete end products of genetic engineering, such as drugs, are also 
patentable. But the partial sequences whose utility is uncertain present 
difficult problems. Leaders of companies like HGS say they need patent 
protection or they will have to keep their work secret, even from basic 
researchers. They say the sequences do have utility, to wit HGS' crucial role 
in helping medical researchers at Johns Hopkins University discover a gene for 
colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Others fear that patents will impede basic research and say the gene sequences 
should be public property, a kind of basic common alphabet available to all. 
The biotechnology industry is divided; everyone seems to want strong patents, 
except when the patents belong to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue piles layer upon layer of scientific, legal and ethical uncertainty 
and complexity. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has requested an analysis from 
the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. It may be that Congress -- 
in collaboration with Britain, France, Japan and other major research countries 
-- must write new patent or copyright law to guide us through the biological 
revolution.

PUNISHMENT IN SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harsh penalties may well deter crime in Singapore (April 2). But before those 
favoring "three strikes and you're out" and other such nostrums get carried 
away, I would also point to that country's full-employment economy, rapid 
economic growth, and a solid basic educational system as much more important 
contributors to its safe streets. In the past two decades, Singapore's 
manufacturing wage has risen from roughly one-eighth to one-third of the U.S. 
level, part of the general East Asian economic success story. 
</P>
<P>
 A population with good opportunities for jobs at rising wages will not be 
crime-prone. That is Singapore's real lesson for California and the United 
States.

 As the former U.S. ambassador to Singapore and current honorary consul general 
of Singapore in California, I believe that it is only fair to state my position 
on the possible caning of Michael Fay in Singapore. For your information, I was 
in Singapore at the time of the offenses by Fay and met with the U.S. Embassy 
personnel as well as one of the principals of the Singapore American School. 
First, there is no question that Fay was guilty of the offenses even though he 
told his father that he was innocent.  
</P>
<P>
 Singapore officials believe in protecting the innocent citizens of Singapore 
and punishing the criminals. As you are probably aware, they are also 
criticized for the death penalty for drug pushers. They have checked how the 
current laws in the United States are enforced and feel that there are far more 
innocent people killed in the United States because of drugs than could ever be 
hanged in Singapore. Because of the strict deterrents, there is very little 
graffiti, drug-pushing, drug usage, crime or other acts of violence in 
Singapore. It appears to be inappropriate for the President of the United 
States and others to ask the Singapore government for leniency for an American 
when it is mandatory for Singapore citizens. I am a strong believer in 
deterrents.  
</P>
<P>
 I lived in Singapore for 2 1/2 years, from 1987 through 1989, and assure you 
that everyone in Singapore is able to walk the streets of Singapore at night 
without fear. The majority of Singaporeans support the Singapore laws, as well 
as the majority of calls that the Singapore Embassy in the United States has 
been receiving concerning Michael Fay's sentence. I feel that it is not 
appropriate for the United States government and the media to get so involved, 
and I can assure you that it will not make Singapore change its mind.

 Your article on the Caining (please leave this spelling) of Michael Fay 
mentions that only 45 of 1,416 acts of vandalism in 1992 alone were "punished" 
in Singapore. It is difficult and somewhat unacceptable to discuss the 
unempirical subject of race in the press, but it is obvious that this young man 
is being singled out for such a cruel and unusual punishment (for the crime of 
spray-painting cars) because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 People who say they support this ridiculous consequence are voicing their 
justifiable anger about crime, especially in this country. They are also 
denying their outrage at the physical and emotional scarring of this young man 
from such a place as Ohio, whose very shape is symbolic of the heart of this 
great nation.

 It is a good thing the ACLU has no clout in Singapore. Michael Fay deserves 
the "woodshed" treatment for vandalizing cars with spray paint and eggs and 
tearing down signs. Maybe getting flogged on the buttocks six times by a 
martial-arts expert will make a believer out of this kid. Were it not for the 
likes of the bleeding-hearts ACLU, this kind of old-fashioned punishment might 
be just what we need in this country to straighten out some of our rebellious 
teen-agers.

<P>
 I was dismayed to learn that many letters have been written in support of 
Singapore's planned caning of Michael Fay for allegedly committing acts of 
vandalism. I am sure that those in favor of caning do not realize that this 
punishment is quite clearly torture. The individual is tied down naked, usually 
goes into shock from the intense pain within a few seconds, is often revived so 
that the process can continue, loses large amounts of blood and bares permanent 
physical, not to mention psychological scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably most of those in favor would change their vote if it were their son 
in Michael Fay's frightening position.

THAT ASTONISHING NONCHALANCE; 'BRADY II' BILL AIMS TO ALTER AN AMERICA THAT'S 
GUN-HAPPY BEYOND BELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fatal shooting of two Japanese college students in a San Pedro supermarket 
parking lot last month evoked feelings of outrage and disbelief from people 
around the globe who cannot understand why the United States has failed 
repeatedly to enact stringent controls on the manufacture, sale and possession 
of firearms. Ordinary people are simply astounded that deadly weapons are 
bought and sold so nonchalantly here. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex answer to why that happens can be found somewhere in a tangle of 
reasons: the virtually limitless supply of firearms, an abundance of legal 
loopholes, inadequate enforcement and special legal protections afforded gun 
owners. But perhaps the more basic -- and more unsettling -- explanation is 
that Americans have yet to reach a pain threshold on the gun-violence issue. 
Appallingly, many lawmakers in Congress have been willing accessories to this 
masochism. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, it took Congress 25 long and bloody years to pass a major gun 
law -- the rudimentary five-day handgun waiting period known as the Brady bill. 
In the meantime, more than 700,000 Americans lost their lives in gun-related 
homicides, suicides and accidents. One hopeful sign is that more Americans than 
ever -- over 50% -- now favor gun control. Congress should take the hint and 
send a message. 
</P>
<P>
 One unmistakable way would be to pass the Gun Violence Prevention Act of 1994. 
"Brady II," introduced last week by Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and 
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), is the most 
comprehensive and far-reaching piece of gun legislation introduced in Congress 
since the Gun Control Act of 1968. The measure's major provisions include 
rigorous new national gun licensing and registration requirements, limits on 
gun possession, restrictions for gun dealers and a federal ban on semiautomatic 
assault weapons and cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials. In 
addition, an individual would be barred from accumulating more than 20 firearms 
or more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition without a federal license.  
</P>
<P>
 Other provisions of Brady II would require the states, with $200 million in 
federal funding, to set up a system that licenses handgun buyers, a procedure 
including a fingerprint-based background check and a handgun safety course 
(California recently became the first state to implement such safety 
instruction). 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation also gives the federal government greater liberty to inspect 
gun dealers by raising the number of surprise inspections to three from one and 
extending the time the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is allowed to 
conduct background checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun laws by themselves do not stop violence and lawlessness. But trying to 
attack those problems without reforming gun laws will only ensure a future of 
casualties and more shame.

CONDORS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "3 Condors With Bad Habits Face Capture, Return to Zoo" (March 29) proves 
evolution (survival of the fittest) is alive and well.Those condors show 
superior intelligence for they will now live without danger, be assured 
sustenance and given companionship. Why risk lonely existence in the wild 
instead of the easy life at the zoo? 
</P>
<P>
 The condor recovery program has spent $15 million over 12 years and there are 
80 condors; that's more than $15,000 per year for each bird. How wonderful it 
would be if we had money like that to help our disadvantaged youth.

CRAYONS THAT DON'T PUT YOU IN A BOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lives there a child who hasn't chewed a crayon? Crayons are nibbled so often 
by the young that they could be considered snack food. That's why, when some 
lesser-known brands imported from China were found to contain hazardous levels 
of lead and were recalled, the reaction of most people was "there oughta be a 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, there is a federal law -- in existence since 1990 -- 
forbidding toxic ingredients in any art supplies intended for use by persons 
under age 12. But the crayons with lead, which enhances colors, were not 
discovered until a Phoenix infant was poisoned and the Arizona Department of 
Health Services tracked the source. A spokesman for the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission says enforcement is less stringent during a "transition 
period" while manufacturers learn the law and adjust. It's time for the 
commission to put makers and importers of art supplies on notice: Comply with 
the law or face punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, what's a parent to do? After all, a major toy chain was 
unintentionally selling lead-tainted crayons in a box clearly labeled 
"nontoxic." One solution is to buy U.S.-made art supplies, because American 
makers are more likely to be aware of the law. Another is to look for the 
phrase "Conforms to ASTM D-4236" on the container. Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 The product safety commission should use clearer language. When the kids show 
up with burnt sienna smeared on their teeth, parents shouldn't have to decipher 
gibberish to know whether it's safe.

DREIER ON CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Cut the Capital-Gains Tax to Get Money Flowing and Create Jobs," 
Commentary, March 25: 
</P>
<P>
 The pleaders for big money and the corporate bottom line never give up. 
Despite the total failure of Ronald Reagan's biggest tax cut in history to 
accomplish what he promised, and George Bush's defeated assurances that 
capital-gains tax reductions would end the recession, here now comes David 
Dreier (R-Covina), repeating the same old tired arguments and proven fallacies: 
A capital-gains tax cut will increase investment and economic growth; it will 
pair new factories with our pool of unemployed skilled workers; and it will 
increase workers' wages along with state and local government revenues.

 Would that it were so, but what happened when Reagan, with similar promises, 
dramatically cut taxes on very high incomes and took "government off the backs 
of business"? The facts are well established. Multibillion-dollar savings and 
loan and bank failures that the rest of us paid for. The number of billionaires 
trebled, the biggest wealth concentration in history; real wages of workers 
went down; more plants moved to Mexico and to overseas, low-cost labor markets; 
unemployment went up; crime doubled and "contract workers" with no benefits 
became institutionalized. For the first time in history, Social Security was 
taxed. Wherein lies the magic of a new tax cut that will largely benefit the 
same wealthy individuals and corporations?

 Dreier's article should be "must reading" for all politicians and economists. 
However, he seems to disregard his own evidence when he says that "cutting the 
capital-gains tax is the best way" to improve the economy; because he later 
points out that "to achieve deficit reduction and job creation simultaneously, 
the best approach is to reduce the capital-gains tax rate to 15% and index the 
rate to inflation." I assume he meant to say "index the gain to inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the stock arguments of those who oppose lowering the tax on capital 
gains is that it unfairly lowers the tax on the profits of stock and commodity 
speculators. And this is a justifiable argument. Another stock argument against 
lowering taxes on capital gains is that it would benefit only the wealthy. 
Anyone who believes that hogwash is sadly uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the very best and fairest way to tax capital gains is to index the 
gains to inflation (as determined by the Consumer Price Index), and tax the 
corrected gain at the same rate as other earnings. I suggest that this would 
create more jobs and lower the deficit more effectively than any of the other 
proposals, and would be the most fair and equitable system.

PERSPECTIVE ON 'MIDDLEMARCH'; A HEROINE IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT; GEORGE ELIOT'S 
STORY AFFIRMS THAT WOMEN MAY FIND THEMSELVES AT THE PEAK OF THEIR POWERS IN THE 
FLAMING 50S.

By GAIL SHEEHY, Gail Sheehy is the author of The Silent Passage: Menopause 
(Random House).A chalk portrait of George Eliot in 1864 by Sir Frederick W. 
Burton.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'll never guess what is on the top of the bestseller lists in England -- 
"Middlemarch" by George Eliot -- a huge 19th-Century novel of provincial life 
in the Victorian era. Now PBS is gambling that the American public will embrace 
the remarkable BBC adaptation that began last night on PBS' "Masterpiece 
Theatre." When it aired in England last fall, it caused one-quarter of the 
population to cancel dinner plans and stay home to watch the series. But who is 
George Eliot, and what relevance does she have to women today? 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Evans -- alias George Eliot -- refused to marry until she was 
middle-aged, living an independent existence as a journalist and novelist until 
she found a "second spring" with an already married man -- George Henry Lewes, 
a literary giant in his own right -- with whom she lived openly in defiance of 
that rigid society. Theirs was not a passionate or romantic love, but one 
committed to the duty of literature. 
</P>
<P>
 She took a man's name as a protective pseudonym. By the time she wrote 
"Middlemarch," her knowledge of science, philosophy, history and four languages 
-- but most important of the inner psychological truths of the human heart -- 
had earned her the regard of Dickens, Trollope, Congreve and all Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 I was intrigued to learn that Eliot turned 50 just as she was beginning 
"Middlemarch." It made me sympathetic and curious: Since 50 has been 
historically the age when women go through the passage of menopause, what 
impact might that have had on her masterwork? The Victorians were obsessed with 
women as reproductive creatures; 19th-Century obstetricians taught that "the 
change of life unhinges the female nervous system and deprives women of their 
personal charm." 
</P>
<P>
 Up against that prescription George Eliot started off with her usual fanatical 
discipline. "I mean to begin my novel at once," she wrote to her editor in 
February, 1869: But progress on the novel soon lapsed -- why? 
</P>
<P>
 She and Lewes had been living happily together for more than 10 years. But 
Eliot's plan to write a novel about her hero -- Dr. Lydgate, a man of science 
and the future -- was interrupted by a trip to Rome with her unlawful husband. 
Lewes was suffering from strange neurological symptoms and unable to get on 
with his own great work. Her brother was dying. Soon after her 50th birthday, 
Eliot wrote: "I have a deep sense of change within. And I have a permanently 
closer companionship with death." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's fitful wanderings continued around Europe, while the writing of 
"Middlemarch" languished. Her husband wrote, "We are in a vacillating state of 
mind as to the arrangements we should make for our short lives." 
</P>
<P>
 What we see here is George Eliot and her beloved editor-husband in the 
"middlemarch" of their own life's journey. They had come to the border -- which 
is the meaning of middlemarch -- of what Victorians believed lay on the other 
side of middle age: the abyss of old age and death. 
</P>
<P>
 But something else had happened on their trip to Italy. Strolling in an 
Italian garden with her husband in that enchanted April of 1869, Eliot had a 
chance encounter with a young admirer, John Cross, a tall, handsome, vivacious 
American banker 20 years her junior. In John Cross, I submit, she finds a 
fantasy of middle age, and gives him life in her novel as the young Ladislaw -- 
the passionate artist who falls in love with Dorothea in "Middlemarch." 
</P>
<P>
 But young Dorothea, hoping to gain by osmosis the education to do great works 
in the world, has made a disastrous marriage with the elder scholar Casaubon. 
If the Casaubon character represents withered age, shriveled sexuality and 
self-willed isolation -- exactly what Eliot feared for herself -- Ladislaw is 
all youth and fire. And it is in Ladislaw that we see the projection of Eliot's 
own possibilities after her inevitable widowhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting in Italy with Cross also gave her the ending to her novel. She had 
in mind from her earliest notes that she was going to give Dorothea a young 
lover to marry, a man of passion, at the end of all of her self-sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of Eliot's 51st year, post-menopausal zest seems to have kicked 
in. She finished Book One in August, 1871, and sped on through seven more 
volumes, published bimonthly. So by December, 1872 -- in the year after her own 
middlemarch across the border of menopause -- George Eliot had written and 
published 799 pages of one of the great works of world literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story affirms, once again, that what I call the Flaming 50s is a stage of 
life in which women may find themselves blazing with renewed energy and at the 
peak of their powers. Contemporary women now moving into the Flaming 50s are 
redefining the whole concept of middle life -- from decline to rule. So George 
Eliot becomes, to me, a heroine in a whole new light. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband died in 1878. She was inconsolable, retreating from the world for 
a couple of months. The first caller that she received was not Dickens or Henry 
James or any of her other erudite literary or intellectual friends -- but John 
Cross, her young, devoted admirer. They read Dante together. George Eliot 
announced six months later that she was going to marry Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 You might say that a 60-year-old Dorothea married a 41-year-old Ladislaw. So 
George Eliot finished her life, as she had lived much of it, like a man. She 
comforted herself in her age, like Casaubon did, with a much younger spouse who 
boosted her ego, offered her intimacy and companionship and promised to become 
her literary executor. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eliot, it was her first authentic marriage, and perhaps her first fully 
sexual union.

INVITATION TO A TEA PARTY; TAXES: PAYING THEM HAS NEVER BEEN MORE ONEROUS OR 
UNFAIR; THE 'RICH' ARE FAR FROM IT.

 Congress did a real job on us last summer. They raised our tax rates and made 
them retroactive to the beginning of 1993. If you had a really good year, 
that's good. But the bad news is you may be subject to the new 36% and 39.5% 
tax brackets. For example, if you are single and have a taxable income of more 
than $70,000, you are in the 36% bracket. Washington thinks you're rich. In 
California, that will give you enough to live in a small bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't there something in the Constitution about Congress passing laws that 
are retroactive? It's bad enough for the living, but the estates of those who 
died last year between Jan. 1 and the mid-summer passage of the law will also 
suffer because Congress raised the federal estate tax rate. As an enrolled 
agent (a tax expert designation granted by the Internal Revenue Service), I 
don't remember a year in which there was so much discontent and grousing about 
the amount of taxes that people have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rogers said he didn't make up jokes about what the government does; all 
he did was to report facts. Even the federal tax commissioner made a funny the 
other day when she said that she "runs the biggest fund-raising business in the 
United States: the Internal Revenue Service." 
</P>
<P>
 I also like the jokes at the beginning of the tax form where it tells us how 
many hours and minutes it takes to gather the data and fill our various 
sections of the tax returns. Of course, the IRS office in Washington offers tax 
preparation service to members of Congress without charge. Staffers even go up 
to Capitol Hill to provide that convenience. It will make the bedraggled 
taxpayer even madder to learn that only 10% of the members of the committee 
that writes the tax laws fill out their own tax returns.  
</P>
<P>
 Just think how we could increase our national productivity and international 
competitiveness if we didn't have to spend endless hours filling out tax 
returns because of the complexity of our current law. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I have three sons: a doctor, a lawyer and a graduate of Stanford 
University. When "the grad" got his first job, he called us all excited because 
he was "instant middle class." "What do you mean, Dave," we asked. "I am paying 
28% in federal taxes and 7% in Social Security," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't initially surprised by his "sticker shock," but I was when I 
researched how much taxes I paid when I got my first professional job in 1951: 
My highest federal tax bracket was 6% and my Social Security payroll tax was 
1%. 
</P>
<P>
 People in the highest federal tax bracket -- almost 40% -- will be little 
amused to learn this little historical fact: In the debate on the 16th 
Amendment to the Constitution in 1913 authorizing the federal income tax, 
critics were assured that the highest rate would never exceed 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Our forebears dumped a lot of tea in Boston Harbor over the British Crown's 
"taxation without representation." Now we have representation, and things are 
worse. Over the past 39 years, the federal budget has been in deficit 33 years 
and now our national debt is $4.5 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 We the people will pay for the deficit one way or the other -- either in taxes 
or inflation. Interest on the national debt -- more than $200 billion -- now 
exceeds the projected budget deficit of $176 billion for next year. The current 
rise in interest rates is undoubtedly based on fear that inflation will again 
be a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
 As an enrolled agent, I am working hard helping taxpayers to calculate the 
cost of securities sold during the past year and to recall the exact date of 
purchase and sale. Therefore, I was shocked to learn that the President's tax 
return did not provide the exact price Hillary Rodham Clinton paid for those 
future cattle contracts purchased nor the specific dates of purchase and sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it wonderful, though, that she parlayed $1,000 into $100,000. Let's see 
now, if the Treasury Department gave Mrs. Clinton $5 billion and she increased 
it 990%, that would pay for almost one-third of the federal budget of $1.5 
trillion and we could abolish all income taxes on individuals. Well, I can 
dream, can't I?

USE CARROTS, NOT STICKS, TO MOVE COPS BACK TO L.A.; POLICE RESIDENCY: MORTGAGE 
INCENTIVES AND RENT SUBSIDIES WOULD CUT OUT-OF-TOWN NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MASTERS, Lee Masters is chairman of the ACLU Foundation of Southern 
California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No report published by the ACLU of Southern California has generated as much 
controversy as the one released on police residency last week. The report, 
"From the Outside in: Residency Patterns Within the Los Angeles Police 
Department," detailed, for the first time, that more than 83% of LAPD officers 
live outside the city that employs them. It has been criticized for waging an 
unfair attack on the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than knock police about where they live, we did this report because we 
believe in community policing and feel confident that in-city residency 
promotes the concept. The report is the start of a dialogue with the city on 
ways to enable more officers to live within its borders and to give them 
incentives to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the incentives we propose are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Low interest -- even no interest -- mortgages to officers who move into the 
city. The program would be underwritten entirely by private lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rent subsidies or rent-free apartments in high-crime neighborhoods, 
underwritten by the federal government or other public agencies or private 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 These in-city residency incentives would have no direct cost to the city. In 
these strapped financial times, we agree that the city cannot afford to fork 
over large housing subsidies to police officers. But these programs are free. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unfortunate that our key recommendations -- low-interest mortgages and 
rent subsidies -- have been missed in the debate over the report. Some of the 
recommendations have already been embraced. The mortgage-incentive program, for 
instance, has been endorsed by a City Council committee, the Police Protective 
League and LAPD command officials. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, speaking at a town 
hall meeting with U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, urged city officials to find ways 
to encourage officers to live within Los Angeles. She cited the important link 
between residency, which creates a strong sense of being part of a community, 
and community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the recommendations made in the report were developed by 
other jurisdictions, not the ACLU. Four years ago, Columbia, S.C., successfully 
implemented a low-interest mortgage program. Similar programs are running in 
Illinois, Virginia and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The program we envision would be entirely voluntary. No officer would be 
forced to move into the city; no officer would be penalized, financially or in 
career advancement, for deciding to live outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we couldn't agree more that it's the heart and mind of an officer 
rather than an address that makes the biggest difference in police work. And 
most of the cops in this city are good cops. 
</P>
<P>
 In-city residency is an important component of many community-policing plans. 
By living in the city, officers and their families must avail themselves of the 
same city services that other residents must use -- everything from schools to 
fire to pothole repair. As members of the body politic, cops would help elect 
city government and would share the responsibility of apportioning scarce city 
resources. Being a city resident gives cops a real stake in the city in which 
they work. 
</P>
<P>
 Our report is beginning to have the constructive effect we intended. Let's 
continue to move the discussion forward.

STOP THE DRUGGING OF OUR CHILDREN; TOBACCO: INCREASE SMOKE-FREE AREAS, TAKES 
STEPS TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION AND GET THE NICOTINE OUT OF CIGARETTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WAXMAN , Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) is chairman of the House 
subcommittee on health and the environment.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year, some of the world's most powerful corporations will hook millions 
of American children on a drug that is as addictive as heroin or cocaine -- and 
far more deadly than either. Unless we act now, many of these children will die 
from their addiction decades from now. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is nicotine. And the corporations are America's tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies market image, but the cold statistics show that 
cigarettes kill nearly half a million Americans every year. The annual cost to 
our health-care system is tens of billions of dollars in preventable expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies' success -- and the sickness and death that result -- 
start with kids. The companies spend billions on advertising campaigns that 
entice young teen-agers to smoke. Each year hundreds of thousands of teen-agers 
become lifelong addicts, destined to die of lung cancer, heart disease and 
other tobacco-related causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those kids who reject cigarettes are not safe. Their health is threatened 
by exposure to other people's tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overwhelming evidence of the risks of smoking, the tobacco 
companies have been chillingly effective in stopping proposals to regulate the 
use of tobacco. It's time to fight back. Four simple measures would protect all 
of us, especially our children: 
</P>
<P>
 The first and easiest step is a law requiring smoke-free public areas and 
workplaces. I have introduced the Smoke-Free Environment Act, which would 
restrict smoking to separately ventilated rooms in virtually all 
non-residential buildings. Last month, the federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration proposed to achieve the same result by regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Enactment of the legislation or adoption of the OSHA regulation would produce 
enormous benefits at minimal cost. Nonsmoking people would be protected from 
carcinogenic tobacco smoke. Hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children could 
go to restaurants, bowling alleys and other public places without fear of a 
life-threatening attack. And building owners would save billions by avoiding 
the costs of cleaning up cigarette smoke and ashes. Even smokers would benefit, 
because quitting is much easier in smoke-free environments.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, compliance with a 
national smoke-free policy in public and workplaces would, each year, save 
38,000 to 108,000 lives and produce $11.5 billion to $29 billion in medical and 
economic savings -- all for a cost of less than $1 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The next two steps are to raise the tax on tobacco and to restrict cigarette 
advertising. These measures share a common goal: to protect health by reducing 
the consumption of cigarettes. According to some estimates, increasing the tax 
on a pack of cigarettes by $2 could reduce tobacco use by 23%, eventually save 
the lives of 2 million Americans and raise more than $23 billion each year for 
health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising restrictions are particularly important for children, who are 
the targets of cigarette ad campaigns featuring "Joe Camel" and Marlboro's 
"Adventure Team." The Tobacco Education and Child Protection Act, which I 
introduced last fall, would stop the tobacco industry's most abusive tactics, 
such as advertising and distributing free samples near schools. New and bigger 
warning labels would also be required on all advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 The last reform is to get nicotine out of cigarettes. Among adult smokers, 70% 
say they would quit if they could. Removing addictive nicotine from cigarettes 
would allow these smokers to choose for themselves whether to continue to 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 For children especially, nicotine-free cigarettes would be a literal 
lifesaver. If there were no nicotine, youthful experimentation with cigarettes 
would not lead to addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 These four reforms -- all overdue -- would end the special treatment tobacco 
companies receive from the federal government. And they may now be possible. 
Public sentiment is surging against the tobacco companies as never before. 
Almost daily another company or state or local government announces new 
restrictions on smoking. Indeed, last month, Congress passed legislation to ban 
smoking in schools, day-care centers and medical clinics that receive federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 We must face a reality too long ignored and finally take decisive action 
against tobacco. Nothing less than the lives of hundreds of thousands of our 
children are at stake.

BOOK REVIEW / SCIENCE; BUILDING A BETTER MOUSETRAP -- THE BRAIN; BRAINMAKERS: 
HOW SCIENTISTS ARE MOVING BEYOND COMPUTERS TO CREATE A RIVAL TO THE HUMAN BRAIN

<P>
 It never occurred to me a decade ago when I was writing about the roles 
parenting and sexual selection play in evolution that these theories would one 
day be adapted by a different group of researchers -- people interested in 
building machines that think. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did it occur to me then that building such machines would be possible. I 
was living in a world apart from men such as MIT's Marvin Minsky, who were 
already devoting their careers to the idea that artificial intelligence 
(usually called AI) was not only possible but desirable. That was the '80s. 
Since then, I have been inundated by a veritable tidal wave of books, articles 
and TV specials describing computers that can not only direct industrial robots 
-- machines that repeat the same action -- but can, it is hoped, learn to adapt 
to new situations. Theoretically, such autonomous machines will be able to 
navigate the craters of distant moons and make independent decisions in ways 
analogous to human thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Brainmakers," Boston-based science writer David Freedman sums up the facts 
and hopes surrounding what he sees as two generations of AI research. The first 
generation, he explains -- which was led by Minsky, among others -- got off to 
a swift start, then lost momentum and ground to a halt when it became clear 
that abstract logical computer programs could not approach the flexibility and 
speed of the human brain. Computers could play excellent chess, but they could 
not initiate projects. The first generation, Freedman says, struck out. The 
next generation, what Freedman calls "nature-based" researchers, includes 
molecular biologists, neuroscientists and physicists, as well as computer 
scientists. They base their efforts, in part, on the model of neural networks 
-- the way individual neurons fire multiple connections inside the brain.  
</P>
<P>
 Freedman believes that they will succeed where their predecessors failed 
because they acknowledge complexity as the key to how nature works and use what 
they believe is natural (an interpretation open to debate) as their model. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleshing out these new approaches, Freedman describes the work of several 
varied research projects in New England, California and Japan. In lean prose, 
he provides vivid descriptions of the major players -- their biographies, their 
laboratories, their machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Profiling scientists trying to build a microelectronic brain on the scale of 
quantum mechanics, Freedman explains: "The main motivation for moving to the 
molecular scale is not merely to speed up existing approaches, but to be able 
to create new approaches using the same building blocks that nature does . . . 
biomolecules." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman introduces us to UCLA's Chuck Taylor, a biologist doing nature-based 
research on a larger scale. Taylor is using the tenets of Darwinian evolution 
to "breed" robots. His aim is to bridge the gap between what Freedman calls the 
idealized world of the computer and the hopelessly complex world of real-life 
animals.  
</P>
<P>
 Taylor and his colleague David Jefferson, a computer scientist, have started 
with a herd of 20 robots which, they hope, will grow to 100 in the next year 
after they follow the model of biological evolution, "killing" off those that 
perform poorly and mixing the best traits of the brightest. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this leads to some pretty basic questions. How smart will these 
artificial brains become? If they evolve as predicted, will they develop a 
sense of their own identity and mortality, as the late Isaac Asimov projected 
in his fiction (and demand a code of ethics and perhaps civil rights 
protection)? Freedman does not tackle this. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does pose the question: Why build artificial brains at all, when we 
have so many good human brains around? The practical reasons are obvious. 
Autonomous robots will be able to work where humans cannot -- in radioactive 
infernos or on distant moons. And in the laboratory, artificial brains can 
provide models for studying natural ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists seldom work with practical goals in mind. Freedman understands 
this and offers an explanation akin to what climbers say about Mt. Everest: 
They scale it because it is there. Brainmakers build artificial minds because 
they can. Where this will lead, they acknowledge, is unpredictable. That's what 
makes it so exciting.

DANCE REVIEW; FAMILY LIVES IN 'URBAN SCENES'; DAVID ROUSSEVE'S CONTINUING STORY 
LINKS HIS TIMES WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS' IN A MEMORABLE OUTING AT WADSWORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not every manchild grows up to become his own grandmother -- but David 
Rousseve is blessed in many, many ways. Since 1987, this disarming young actor, 
dancer, choreographer, director and storyteller has turned his family history 
into memorable performance events, each time linking his life and times with 
those of his grandmother, the late Thelma Arceneaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Announced as the final segment in the series, "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams" 
arrived at the Wadsworth Theater on Friday with a number of familiar 
components. Once more, local audiences heard endearing tales of Rousseve's 
first day in a newly integrated Houston school and his love for his " 'flicted" 
pet rat. Once more, Rousseve and his REALITY company (augmented by local 
dancers) depicted horrific instances of rape and revenge -- as well as noble 
acts of love and solidarity -- among desperately poor sharecroppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Local gospel diva B. J. Crosby again delivered a roof-rattling rendition of 
"Amazing Grace," and Rousseve again achieved a remarkable fusion of voice and 
sensibility with his dead grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, an accomplished choir led by Ron Hasley served as a 
collective social conscience, whether powerfully announcing a call-to-battle 
"against misogyny, race-hatred and AIDS" (singing music composed by Ysaye M. 
Barnwell) or detailing through chant the layering of oppression and corrosive 
rage that eventually destroyed Rousseve's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 This latter sequence found the choir members deployed at the back and sides of 
the stage, accompanying themselves with hand claps and a pole struck against 
the floor. In the center, Rousseve joined his six company dancers and five 
guests in propulsive choreography emphasizing shared weight, pieta poses and 
outbursts of furious trembling. At the end, the naked body of Van Vereen hanged 
from a noose overhead: a classic image of American brutality presented as a 
Rousseve family heirloom. 
</P>
<P>
 More nudity occurred in an initially enigmatic bathtub sequence serving as a 
premonition to the rape of Thelma's beloved cousin Bobbie. More nooses appeared 
during a spectacular fantasy-in-the-clouds dramatizing nothing less than the 
conquest of death through love and memory. For all his stand-up-style 
looseness, Rousseve structured his work carefully, tying sequences together to 
draw parallels between the precarious existence of his grandparents and the 
perils of the ongoing AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of frequent, unbearable loss links these generations, but in 
his family's continuity-against-the-odds, Rousseve discovered something like 
salvation: "Turn to your ancestors to find hope." 
</P>
<P>
 You could argue that "Urban Scenes/Creole Dreams" tells deeper truths about 
his grandmother than about himself, but he also makes it easy to believe that 
she's become the best part of him -- allowing him to speak with personal 
authority about the love and pain of a lost world. In the process, a family 
legacy becomes a national cultural monument.

THEATER REVIEW; BAITZ'S 'END OF THE DAY' FORGETS TO SAY GOOD MORNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The title of Jon Robin Baitz's play at the Coast Playhouse, "The End of the 
Day," sounds elegiac, meditative. Forget all that. It's a bitter little cartoon 
that evokes sharp, sour laughter but stops short of any fresh insights. 
</P>
<P>
 Baitz aims his barbs at Los Angeles in the first act and London in the second. 
He sees both societies as rotting, venal, corrupt. He makes his point early and 
keeps repeating it. 
</P>
<P>
 His caricatures wisecrack their way through an outlandish plot. At its center 
is Graydon Massey (D. W. Moffett), who fled London as a young man and landed in 
Malibu. He married into a wealthy Beverly Hills family, who paid for his 
medical practice. In the first scene, set in 1988, he rehearses his tribute to 
America, which he'll speak at a brunch in honor of his new citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this brief, supposedly hopeful scene, it's clear that Massey's primary 
interest is America's plenty. Here, he notes, you can always go back for 
seconds. Then, before we've hardly glanced at anyone's illusions, the play 
jumps ahead to 1994, when everyone has lost them. 
</P>
<P>
 Massey's psychiatric practice in Beverly Hills is kaput, for reasons that are 
never adequately explained (he says he almost lost his license). He loathes his 
new job as an epidemiologist at a county-funded clinic in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he's besieged by his ex-father-in-law and his ex-wife, a patient who 
believes he's dying of AIDS, a formerly idealistic classmate who now smuggles 
cocaine, and the clinic's tough administrator. They all make demands -- some of 
them for lots of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Massey hops back to London to see what he can finagle out of his grotesque 
family. With one exception, the same actors who played Massey's supplicants in 
San Pedro now play his potential British benefactors and their servant. The one 
exception is the actor who played Massey's patient in San Pedro. He now plays 
the young pre-California Massey in a brief daydream by the older Massey, who 
takes the role of his own deceased father in the same dream -- the weakest 
scene in the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the action lurches back to Los Angeles, as everyone becomes tied together 
in a multinational conspiracy. Finally, the American and British characters 
mingle in the same room at an event that sounds -- probably inadvertently -- as 
if Baitz were satirizing the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coast, Ian Falconer designed a simple, immaculate stage, highlighted by 
a few askew angles, cool lighting by Michael Gilliam, and amusing knock-offs of 
contemporary art in the London scene. Don't look for grunge in the San Pedro 
clinic. Presumably the intent was to establish how artificial it all is, so we 
can take it as satire and leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some wicked, funny moments, performed to the hilt in David Warren's 
staging. Moffett alternates masterfully between snippy venom and sad irony. 
Although Eve Gordon looks too fresh-faced to be the survivor of a rocky 10-year 
marriage, she seizes every possible laugh out of her exasperating talk with her 
ex-husband, then becomes an even more acquisitive English aristocrat with equal 
aplomb (though without as many good lines). 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brandenburg does sterling double duty as Massey's growling father-in-law 
and his alcoholic stepfather. Christina Pickles rips through two tough women, 
both of whom enjoy good fights, despite radically different accents. Patrick 
Kerr swoops across the stage as the desperate cocaine dealer, then totters 
across it as an ancient English servant. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as Massey's patient, Neil Patrick Harris takes the play's few moments 
of gravity (underlined here with added lines about a death wish) and hushes the 
laugh track, ever so briefly. His quick second act appearance isn't as 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 In a couple of interviews, Baitz said he has rewritten the play extensively 
since its 1992 New York production, but a reading of the New York text reveals 
that most of his alterations are a line here, a line there. Jokes have been 
freshened with topical references. But some of them still sound snide or 
strained, such as the lines about exotic California eating habits. To quote a 
line from the play, Baitz is "teasing his lessers." 
</P>
<P>
 The basic problem remains: For the sake of its own dramatic momentum, "The End 
of the Day" focuses too much attention on ends, not enough on beginnings. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A REAL HARMONIOUS CONVERGENCE IN CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They may be museum pieces, but at least they're the originals. The Four Tops 
(their personnel hasn't changed since they started out as the Four Aims in the 
1950s) and the Fifth Dimension (they've suffered shake-ups and breakups but 
reunited for touring purposes in 1991) sang the same old songs Friday at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, both with their trademark sounds 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 And because those sounds rely on vocal harmony, a craft largely forgotten in 
these days of mumbled raps and overly styled solo singers, both groups sounded 
as if they had discovered something new. Though there were probably few in the 
audience who couldn't name every song that either group performed, the double 
bill's overall effect was as rewarding for its voicings as it was for nostalgic 
value. (The concert was also repeated Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not that such tunes as the Tops' "I Can't Help Myself" or the Dimension's "Up, 
Up and Away" were refurbished like the Sistine Chapel with spiffy, new 
arrangements. Both groups, backed by a 14-piece orchestra, hung close to the 
fabric of the originals, giving the evening the feel of a visit from old 
friends. Likewise, both groups sounded remarkably like they did when these 
tunes were recorded some 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dimension was at its best as a unit, weaving harmonies and exchanging 
leads as they did on "Stoned Soul Picnic" and "Sweet Blindness." Their 
trademark blend of male and female voices, sometimes in unison though an octave 
apart, sometime in four-part harmony, is still richly layered and colored with 
unexpected mixes of timbre and resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Less rewarding were the individual features: Marilyn McCoo's "Wedding Bell 
Blues" and "I Didn't Get to Sleep at All," Florence LaRue's "Never My Love," 
Ron Townson on "MacArthur Park" and Billy Davis Jr.'s "The Worst That Could 
Happen." Though each has attractive solo pipes, their performances underscored 
the fact that the Dimension is greater than the sum of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' strong gospel colorings continue to be the group's strongest individual 
element, and though he rang and shouted during "A Change Has Got to Come," his 
best-known vehicle, "Let the Sunshine In" from the musical "Hair," was 
strangely missing from the program. Instead, the fivesome bounced around the 
revolving stage to a funky "Ticket to Ride" and a tiresome "Those Were the 
Days" that only seemed to underline the fact that the group's pinnacle was 
reached a quarter century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In similar fashion, the Four Tops were at their best spinning around the stage 
(in a contest of choreography, the Tops win hands down) while singing as a 
quartet. The group's enthusiasm for such warhorses as "Reach Out I'll Be There" 
and "Bernadette" helped get them across, and though there was some roughness 
along the edges of their harmonies, their collective sound had the depth and 
strength that made them so successful in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The voice of lead singer Levi Stubbs still carries the weight and plain-spoken 
conviction that propelled "Baby I Need Your Lovin' " onto the charts in 1964. 
But Levi also fell victim to the solo showcase, delivering, by himself, tired 
versions of "I've Got You Under My Skin" and "Teach Me Tonight." His 
introductory references to Sinatra made his delivery of the standards seem even 
flatter by contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tops did a thorough job of covering their hits, but they closed the set 
surprisingly enough with a medley of the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction" and 
"Jumpin' Jack Flash." As inappropriate as this seemed -- even a ballad 
rendition of Tommy Edwards' "All in the Game" would have been more in line with 
the Tops' legacy -- the group's vitality and irresistible stage moves had the 
crowd up on its feet for dance steps that hadn't been seen in public since "I 
Can't Help Myself" high-stepped to No. 1 in 1965.

OPERA; SLEEPWALKING WITH RIEDEL, BONYNGE IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "La Sonnambula" is a bel-canto masterpiece. The plot may have seemed a bit 
creaky even when the opera was new in 1831, but nobody cared. Bellini's arching 
melodies are so glorious they defy the listener not to take Felice Romani's 
period text seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 This naively sentimental essay on amorous intrigue and the triumph of purity 
in romantic Switzerland has survived the rigors of time primarily because of 
the title role. The soprano cast as Amina, a sweet village lass with an 
innocent penchant for nocturnal wandering, has brought out the best in such 
diversely dazzling prima donnas as Pasta, Malibran, Patti, Tetrazzini (no 
chicken when it came to high notes), Pons, Callas, Scotto and Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturing the mellifluous challenge for the first time, the San Diego Opera 
entrusted the diva duties to a highly promising newcomer from Australia, 
Deborah Riedel, and the musical direction to a long-waving bel-canto expert, 
Richard Bonynge. Nevertheless, the local authorities tried to sell their show 
as an exercise in lurid scuzz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sleepwalker ends up in a stranger's bed," teased an ad. "It's a tender love 
story with a twist," gushed the follow-up, "when a sleepwalking fiancee with a 
preference for rooftops and other people's bedrooms, a perfect stranger, a 
rumor-mongering gossip queen, and a citizenry that's seeing ghosts all cross 
paths. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh. Golly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the number of empty seats at the Civic Theatre at the opening 
Saturday, the pitch caused no box-office stampede. But those who came did have 
a good time. Encouraged to ignore the lofty score, they laughed a lot at Sonya 
Friedman's literal supertitles, which automatically accentuated sight at the 
expense of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The sights were quaint. Zack Brown's canvas decors, borrowed from Washington, 
dealt in antiquated picture-postcard realism. Leon Major's stage direction 
concentrated on let's-pretend theatrics and efficient traffic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The play was not the thing. Contrary to commercial promises, this "Sonnambula" 
represented a vocal exercise first and foremost. At least it was a rewarding 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-stylish Bonynge may well be an old Svengali in search of a new Trilby 
now that his wife, Joan Sutherland, has retired. If that is the case, his 
collaboration with Riedel could turn out to be very interesting at worst, very 
fruitful at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The young soprano certainly is no chirping windup doll, no fragile, 
pretty-pretty songbird. Her voice, essentially a lirico-spinto, is big and 
bright, pliant and strong. The repertory listed in her program biography 
suggests no history of coloratura typecasting. She comes from relatively heroic 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one should not expect absolute perfection, or total 
security, in her flights of fioratura fancy. Not yet, anyway. She does command 
an amazing top extension, however, and she already maneuvers her ample sound in 
the dizzy stratosphere with remarkable agility. Even better, she traces long 
legato lines with skillful ease, not to mention dynamic sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Her performance at this juncture is more notable for daring than for suavity 
(one wonders if she ever ventured "Sonnambula" before). She finds the 
introspection of "Ah! non credea mirarti" more congenial than the climactic 
fireworks of "Ah! non giunge." She portrays the troubled protagonist 
essentially as a plump-and-pleasing person, and her hand-me-down costumes make 
her resemble nothing so much as a pink-and-pretty birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she serves notice of a flamboyant yet poignant talent. Deborah 
Riedel. Remember the name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Campbell surrounded his compelling heroine with a remarkably imposing 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Vargas, a sympathetic lyric-tenor from Mexico, made his local debut as a 
rare Elvino who could capitalize on warmth, finesse, steadiness and ardor, and 
on fearless top tones as well. Julien Robbins' suave basso-cantante served him 
elegantly as Count Rodolfo. Sylvia Wen's pert virtuosity (note those spiffy 
trills) made one doubly grateful for the restoration of Lisa's breathless aria 
in the last act. 
</P>
<P>
 James Wood, Patricia McAfee and Adam Russell lent solid support in minor 
roles. Martin Wright's chorus enlivened the mock-rustic rituals, and the 
orchestra responded sensitively to Bonynge's enlightened commands. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Sonnambula" may not have been good soap opera, as advertised. In its 
unabashedly old-fashioned way, however, it was good opera. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bellini's "La Sonnambula," presented by the San Diego Opera at the Civic 
Theatre, 202 C St., San Diego. Remaining performances Tuesday at 7, Friday at

POP; TIMMINS EMERGES AS A FORCEFUL COWBOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Step by gradual step, Cowboy Junkies continue to come out of the whispering 
dark of "The Trinity Session," the hushed and intimate 1988 album that brought 
the Toronto band fame and acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 If singer Margo Timmins stays on the tack she took on Saturday at the Coach 
House, brightening the band's 90-minute early show with many a digression into 
engaging, low-keyed humor, Cowboy Junkies may yet end up doing an album called 
"The Comedy Session." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the capacity crowd into her confidence, Timmins introduced songs with 
gently beguiling stories based on family lore and the Junkies' pre-"Trinity" 
scuffling days on the road. Back then, she recalled with a chuckle, they would 
play deserted bars where "the cash register and the pinball machine and any 
slightest little noise was way louder than we were." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is hardly the case now. Besides turning into a shy-but-overcoming-it 
raconteur, Timmins has developed into a much more forceful and confident 
singer. At times she failed to bring characters to life (and character 
portrayal is crucial to the narrative writing of her brother Michael Timmins). 
But she regularly summoned enough heft to cut through a controlled but credible 
instrumental attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from all five Junkies albums, the show ranged from wistful country to 
furtive blues and alarmed rock-outs. Timmins smiled frequently and fetchingly, 
conveying a sincere pleasure in singing, and created some visual interest with 
her understated, languidly wafting movements. Many choruses brimmed and surged 
with hearty vitality. Surprising stuff from a singer we first heard murmuring 
in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cowboy Junkies play on Tuesday at the Palace, 1735 N. Vine St., 8 p.m. $20.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; L.A. DEBUT BY GOLDEN-VOICED KEITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took Salif Keita all of three notes at the Wilshire Theatre on Saturday to 
show why phrases like "the golden voice of Mali" are constantly attached to the 
veteran singer. High and pure, full-bodied and piercing yet not shrill, his 
voice was the centerpiece of an impressive, 90-minute L.A. debut before 1,500 
enthusiastic fans  
</P>
<P>
 But Keita's seamless African-jazz-funk-Europop-R&B hybrid hardly qualified as 
a typical African music performance.The intricately woven vocal parts and the 
complex, shifting rhythms induced constant movement in the audience, but were 
equally compelling on a pure listening level.  
</P>
<P>
 On "Mandjou," Peter Tholo Segono's muted trumpet solo strongly evoked the late 
Miles Davis -- a reminder of Keita's high standing among jazz artists. The most 
clearly recognizable African "roots" elements surfaced in Ousmane Kouyate's 
spidery guitar lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Every musical and dramatic nuance in the finely honed set was delivered with 
split-second precision. Keita was a canny showman -- one moment, he was on his 
knees in supplication, the next striding across the stage with the mike stand 
over his shoulders, then standing still in a devotional stance with hands 
clasped as if in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the sophistication, power and drama of the music, it was the 
stop-'em-dead-in-their-tracks quality of Keita's voice that ruled. DON SNOWDEN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; NAKAI'S FLUTE PLAY ENERGIZES JACKALOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last 10 years, R. Carlos Nakai has pretty much established the 
siyopanka , a red cedar flute traditionally handmade by the Lakota people, as 
one of the most popular sounds on new age/ world music/meditation recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Native American flutist was the featured performer with the Arizona-based 
group Jackalope at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall on Friday.During those moments when 
the dark, evocative tones of Nakai's instrument were front and center at the 
concert, the music was alive with emotion and energy. Unfortunately, Nakai's 
solos were limited to a few brief but captivating segments in which he 
performed several lovely, unaccompanied melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Audience members expecting to hear more of the atmospheric traditional tunes, 
chanting and drumming typical of Nakai's recordings were presented instead with 
the marginally engaging playing of Nakai's ensemble: guitarist-keyboardist 
Larry Yanez, bassist-guitarist Richard Carbajal and percussionist Darrell 
Flint.

 Yanez, whose self-satisfied attempts at humor were a continual distraction 
from the music, described Jackalope's style as "Synthacousticpunkachinavajazz." 
But most of the pieces were simplistic, riff-oriented tunes that only came to 
life during the too-infrequent passages when Jackalope's clanging rhythms and 
rudimentary harmonies gave way to the sweetly mournful sound of Nakai's flute.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; GOLIA QUINTET FLOWS IN WIND AT LACMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Windy conditions forced Vinny Golia's quintet to break out the clothespins to 
keep their charts from blowing away at the County Museum of Art on Friday, but 
the supple, inventive music was in no danger of being gone with the wind. The 
L.A. reedman's sparkling 75-minute performance incorporated everything from 
bedrock jazz swing to unusual textures that never interrupted the organic flow 
of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Flow was the operative word -- the five originals segued seamlessly into one 
another. But the ensemble never simply settled for a static, 
solos-over-rhythm-section approach -- the moods and textures within the pieces 
shifted constantly yet the music never sounded forced. 
</P>
<P>
 Golia's bass clarinet and Jon Fumo's trumpet suddenly dropped in a brief 
passage to spur on guitarist Nels Cline's solo -- later they hit a couple of 
sustained low notes to complement bassist Joel Hamilton's solo. Golia engaged 
Hamilton in a bass clarinet/bowed bass duet, joined halfway through by drummer 
Alex Cline using mallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were only a handful of the creative change-ups during a performance in 
which all five members excelled. Golia, who also played baritone and soprano 
sax and piccolo, has stripped his soloing down closer to the melodic core -- 
the explosive flurries that once dominated his playing now serve as expressive 
embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Golia returns to the County Museum every Friday evening in April, with a 
different lineup featured each week. DON SNOWDEN

MOVIE REVIEW; FAITH AND BE GORY, 'LEPRECHAUN 2' BETTER THAN THE FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1992 original "Leprechaun" proved that if you've got a good enough gimmick 
you can get away with minimal proficiency in all other aspects of a film. The 
gimmick was, of course, a leprechaun from hell, a diminutive figure with an 
evil simian countenance and a crazed sense of humor as jaunty as his quaint 
period attire. He was played with unstinting panache by British actor Warwick 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leprechaun 2" has it all over the first film, for its makers have been smart 
enough to plow back profits from the original into a better script, stronger 
cast and richer production values. This time all the elements are much nearer 
Davis' own bravura level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once again the Leprechaun is enraged over one missing gold coin, but this time 
he's also concerned with getting married and starting a family, heaven forbid. 
In a prologue set in Ireland a millennium earlier a father, who'd been foolish 
enough to be tempted by the Leprechaun's pot of gold, has sacrificed his own 
life to spare his daughter from becoming the Leprechaun's bride.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the Leprechaun has tracked down that daughter's direct descendant, a 
pretty teen-ager named Bridget (Shevonne Durkin) who lives in L.A. and whose 
enterprising boyfriend Joe (Charlie Heath) works for his shrewd but boozy uncle 
Morty (Sandy Baron), the proprietor of Darkside Tours, one of those tourist 
magnets that purport to guide you to the sites where Hollywood celebrities 
died, preferably in a macabre fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leprechaun 2" unfolds in a classically mythical manner with the young suitor 
determined to save his lady fair from a fate worse than death. Faced with an 
inevitable plot, writer Turi Meyer and Al Septien have balanced with 
considerable humor, well-drawn and engaging characters and some smart 
one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath and Durkin are a totally believable, down-to-earth young couple coping 
gamely with horrendous supernatural events. Best of all, Meyer and Septien have 
written one of the best movie roles ever for Baron, that protean veteran who's 
perfectly cast as an outrageous yet endearing sharpie, a relentless con man 
with a Charles Bukowski seediness and street smarts who nonetheless genuinely 
loves his orphaned nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leprechaun 2" is especially gratifying for us longtime Sandy Baron admirers. 
Although not for little kids, "Leprechaun 2" in its gore is in the theatrical, 
comically obvious Grand Guignol tradition. Its pace never flags, thanks to 
director Rodman Flender, a Roger Corman alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for violence and nudity. Times guidelines: Its violence, 
although of a tongue-in-cheek variety, is too graphic for youngsters; there is 
also one scene with a bare-breasted woman. * 'Leprechaun 2'

MUSIC REVIEWS; OPPENS UNDAUNTED IN EL CAMINO RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when Marsee Auditorium -- the largest concert hall, with 
2,054 seats, at the South Bay Center for the Arts -- operated as a 
distinguished purveyor of the pianistic arts. In this room, we have heard the 
likes of Rubinstein, Larrocha, Slobodyanik, Achucarro and Freire, as well as 
many others worthy of note. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are gone, but not over. After a long hiatus, a major pianist in a 
connoisseur's program appeared in the El Camino College venue, Saturday night. 
Ursula Oppens, one of the more accomplished performers and imaginative 
program-makers in her generation -- she turned 50 two months ago -- pleased a 
sizable but boorish audience with a difficult agenda comprising music by 
Beethoven, Harbison and Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
 This listening contingent seemed disconnected to the musical proceedings, yet, 
except for its puny applause, behaved well, proved attentive and stayed to the 
very end, when Oppens gave an encore in Tobias Picker's touching "Old and Lost 
Rivers" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
 The performance proper made sense, though on paper it looked daunting. Oppens 
approached Beethoven's final Sonata, Opus 111, with workmanlike directness, 
creating this monument note-by-note from the composer's blueprint. She did not 
sweat or suffer; neither did she commune with angels. She simply gave the work 
the respect of its score and the honesty of its details. The result -- 
surprise! -- sounded like the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 At another extreme of pianistic styles, Oppens lavished on Ravel's "Valses 
Nobles et Sentimentales," and on his "La Valse," many possible colors in many 
different hues. Here, she accomplished without self-consciousness the sweep the 
composer must have envisioned, as well as an abundance of subtleties other 
pianists -- seeking glory rather than illumination -- simply ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 There was disappointment, not in the performance but in the work, in Oppens' 
well-considered performance of John Harbison's Sonata No. 1, "Roger Sessions in 
Memoriam" (1985). The piece, a very old-fashioned, four-movement sonata in 
endless shades of gray, may very well evoke Sessions' 1940s heyday; what it 
does not deliver is Harbison's own vivacity, pungency and inventiveness. DANIEL

THEATER REVIEW; 'MAME' LOSES ITS KICK IN ALEX STAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mame" looks tired at the Alex Theatre. Let's give her a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about how Juliet Prowse looks in the title role. She looks 
sensational. She moves magnificently. She sings -- badly, with an especially 
wobbly lower range and uncertain intonation. But two out of three ain't bad. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we're talking about the show itself. To borrow a phrase from the title 
song, "Mame" no longer charms the husk right off the corn. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, takes it for granted that 
everyone should adore the title character almost to the point of idol worship. 
This culminates in the big number at the end of Act 1, when her name is 
repeated about a million times, like a mantra, in Jerry Herman's lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 The backdrop in this number, a depiction of a star or a sun from which rays of 
light flow, contributes to the feeling that we're at some sort of a coronation 
or even a canonization. Yet the scene actually depicts Mame's unlikely triumph 
at a fox hunt on her suitor's plantation and his subsequent proposal. It's one 
of the silliest sketches in musical theater, one that takes "Mame" down to the 
level of the "Lady Astronomer" show that's lampooned in the script. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Mame gave great parties, and she took in her young nephew. Swell. Then she 
virtually abandoned the kid through most of Act 2, only to go out of her way to 
break up his impending nuptials near play's end. Does he resent her for any of 
this? Not much -- Mame never takes the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Mame's adversities are depicted as mere hangnails. She loses all her money in 
the Depression -- but she keeps her Beekman Place penthouse. "Mame" makes its 
immediate precursor, "Hello, Dolly," seem deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman's score contains rousing numbers, but many of them actually create more 
drama when they're performed outside the context of the show itself. That 
context is so shallow that it diminishes the songs. This is especially true of 
the great "If He Walked Into My Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Prowse's voice just wasn't up to that song on Saturday, nor did her 
performance take it anywhere beyond the usual Mame-style posing. Then again, 
the sound quality wasn't nearly as good as it was at a performance of 
"Sayonara," the Alex's first musical, in February. Steven Smith's pit band 
overwhelmed the lyrics too often, especially in the delicate "My Best Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 John Christian Graas, a Glendale native, is a ray of light as the young 
Patrick Dennis, but his successor in the older stages of the role, Ted Deasy, 
is out of his league. Marsha Kramer is a lovable Miss Gooch, and Gretchen Wyler 
goes skillfully through Vera Charles' second-banana shtick. Peter Kwong has to 
speak the annoying pidgin English of Mame's Japanese servant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mackie designed Prowse's glamorous outfits. But the rest of the costumes 
are credited to Eaves Brooks Costume Co., with the sets coming from Southwest 
Scenic. A real personal touch, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was decided that "Mame" simply isn't worth rethinking. John Bowab, 
who has directed as many as 20 women in this role, apparently saw no need to 
tinker, and the results look as if they came off an assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mame," Alex Theatre, 216 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m.; Saturday-Sunday matinees, 2 p.m. Ends April 24. $10-$42. (800-233-3123) .

TV REVIEW; 'BROKEN PLEDGES': A MOTHER'S CRUSADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The true story of a mother's unflagging crusade against hazing rituals in 
college fraternities, NBC's "Moment of Truth: Broken Pledges" aims to 
illustrate the extraordinary and positive impact an ordinary person can have on 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 When we first meet Eileen Stevens (Linda Gray), she's an unassuming homemaker 
from suburban New York.But this all changes after her son Chuck (David Lipper) 
dies from acute alcohol poisoning during a particularly brutal fraternity 
initiation. She refuses to rest until state legislation is passed against such 
irresponsible and sometimes lethal campus activity.  
</P>
<P>
 On this front, "Broken Pledges" is an occasionally moving and inspiring story 
about one woman's sense of moral conviction and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gray probably wasn't the best choice to portray Eileen. At times 
Gray adequately expresses the heartache and frustration of a mother struggling 
to come to terms with her son's death, while simultaneously trying to penetrate 
an often unyielding government bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former star of the "Dallas" TV series doesn't always effectively 
convey her character's obsessive drive. As a result, the tension that's 
supposed to exist between Eileen and the family she neglects never reaches the 
proper crackling point. 
</P>
<P>
 This conventionally constructed TV movie also fails to capitalize on its 
potential as a social critique. A number of opportunities to really examine the 
attitudes and values behind the more reckless college fraternities are missed 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Broken Pledges" dances around the tougher social and psychological 
issues that might have illuminated the insecurities and desires that caused 
Chuck -- who is portrayed in almost angelic terms -- to pledge his allegiance 
to one of the rowdiest houses on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Moment of Truth: Broken Pledges" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 
and 39).

WASHINGTON INSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LEGAL STATUS: Democratic insiders are snickering about the latest Washington 
status symbol -- or at least White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty's 
failure to achieve it: a subpoena from Whitewater special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. While a subpoena might be seen as an onerous thing -- what with its 
discomforting overtones of potential criminal liability -- in Washington, at 
least, it's proof of something crucial: that its recipient is "in the loop." . 
. . That McLarty is so far without the dreaded piece of paper is a 
demonstration to some insiders of his detachment from day-to-day White House 
operations. "What's this chief of staff doing?" asked one Democratic 
strategist. "They've subpoenaed practically everyone over there." McLarty has 
hired a lawyer, and co-workers have said, perhaps hopefully, that they expect 
him to be subpoenaed -- eventually. 
</P>

<P>
 CALMING A CLASH: For decades, the FBI and CIA have been seethingly critical of 
each other largely because of a clash in cultures between the two agencies. The 
CIA is filled with tweedy, Ivy League types bearing four names and blueblood 
pedigrees, while FBI folk tend to be more street-level and middle-class. . . . 
Until recently, top officials of the two agencies believed that they had at 
least papered over the tensions. But the case of alleged CIA turncoat spy 
Aldrich H. Ames has regenerated conflicts, especially among the worker bees. 
Among other things, CIA regulars believe that that the FBI has leaked stories 
critical of their internal counterintelligence protections. . . . Now, Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh and CIA Director R. James Woolsey 
are working once again to calm the waters. But with key members of Congress 
suggesting that the FBI take over counterintelligence operations, some fear 
that the tensions may only worsen.

 GOLDEN STATE PLAYERS: Ever more Californians are making an imprint on the 
Clinton Administration. Lon S. Hatamiya, who ran a Sacramento consulting firm 
and helped operate his family's farm in Marysville before moving to Washington, 
heads the Agricultural Marketing Service at the Agriculture Department. Among 
other duties, he's in charge of overseeing marketing agreements and orders, 
those arcane but all-important tools used to carve up commodity markets. 
Hatamiya knows plenty about commodities, having managed 1,200 acres of prunes, 
peaches, walnuts and almonds on a farm his family has tilled for nearly a 
century. . . . Demetri Boutris, a Los Angeles banking and securities lawyer who 
headed Greek Americans for the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992, has been named 
executive director to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Boutris and his 
family emigrated from Greece to California in 1972.

<P>
 CHANGE OF HEART: Last spring, when President Clinton considered making 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt his first appointment to the Supreme Court, 
pressure from pro-Babbitt environmentalists helped kill that idea and led to 
the selection of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. . . . But after watching Babbitt 
fail to keep his early commitments to raise grazing fees and tighten mining 
restrictions on public lands, many environmentalists have soured on their 
erstwhile hero. Even before the latest vacancy on the high court, a bumper 
sticker reading "Babbitt for Supreme Court" was distributed by an environmental 
group calling itself People of the West. PAUL HOUSTON

STREET SMART: CONFUSING REFERENCE IN SAN DIEGO FREEWAY SIGN TO BE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When we first arrived in California, signs on this state's freeways were 
useful, helpful and logical. Today, nearly two decades later, we see some of 
the most illogical, if not downright stupid, signs -- signs that mislead and 
confuse anyone who isn't familiar with the area. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, on the northbound San Diego Freeway nearing Beach Boulevard, 
there is a sign that says "Beach Boulevard, Westminster, XXX miles." This leads 
one to believe that the off-ramp leads in only one direction, Westminster, and 
that perhaps there is another off-ramp to go the opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
 However, once you get on the off-ramp, you see another sign that says that 
there are really two ways to get onto Beach, one northbound to Westminster and 
one southbound to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to this illogical signing is to remove the word "Westminster" 
from the first sign. In other words, it should read just "Beach Boulevard, XXX 
miles." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the signs on the northbound San Diego Freeway approaching 
Beach Boulevard, Caltrans engineers agree with you that the sign "Beach 
Boulevard, Westminster, XXX miles" might be confusing, said Rose Orem, a 
Caltrans spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' maintenance branch has been asked to remove the name "Westminster" 
from the sign located in the median, Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I travel on the San Diego Freeway from Irvine to Carson every day for work. 
Just last week I started ride sharing.  
</P>
<P>
 The question I have is how come the car-pool lane stops at the Los Angeles 
County border? Are there plans to continue it to Long Beach? I think more 
people would car pool if the lane was extended through the Long Beach area. 
</P>

 Caltrans is in the final planning stages on two projects that will extend the 
car-pool lanes on the San Diego Freeway from the Orange County line to the 
Harbor Freeway, said Joe Shaw, a Caltrans spokesman in Los Angeles. Final plans 
for both projects will be completed by July, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the first project, from the Orange County line to the Long 
Beach Freeway, pending funding by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, would begin in 1995, Shaw said. The second project, 
from the Long Beach Freeway to the Harbor Freeway, if funded, would be 
constructed at the same time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During April, the Orange County Transportation Authority is inviting the 
public to call in with suggestions for improving the bus system in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus system has changed little in 12 years, though Orange County's 
population has increased dramatically and bus ridership has soared. 
</P>
<P>
 The public can call OCTA Customer Relations at (714) 560-5700 to offer their 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions will be collected by telephone, survey, through the mail and in 
focus groups. A consulting firm will integrate the suggestions into a plan to 
improve the system. The study is expected to be completed in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the report, the OCTA Board of Directors will decide on 
improvements. The public can expect to see the improvements by summer, 1995.

STREET SMART:

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: After the Big Medium One, I've noticed that the freeway 
overpasses in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys -- where the freeway 
goes over something -- are higher than the rest of the freeway, causing a 
sudden rise when you reach the overpass and a drop thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 My question is simple: Did the overpass rise up in the earthquake? Or did the 
rest of the freeway settle down? (A chicken and egg problem?) And regardless of 
what did what, my second question: Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kotch

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are a very perceptive driver. There is indeed a slight rise in the 
pavement when you reach certain bridges near the epicenter of January's 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to your first question, the bridges stayed right where they were, 
but the rest of the freeway settled half an inch or so during the shaking, 
according to Caltrans spokesman Joe Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it happened: Freeway roadbeds are built on top of a layer of highly 
compacted dirt that is 10 to 12 feet deep. During the initial 6.8 jolt and the 
subsequent aftershocks, the less-compacted dirt underneath the layer put down 
by the California Department of Transportation settled slightly -- causing the 
roadbed to drop with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because bridges are built on separate foundations, they stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said crews will be working over the next few weeks and months to smooth 
out the height difference so it is less noticeable to drivers. That will be 
done either by putting another layer of pavement down or by injecting 
pressurized mud underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there is no structural danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Why would we spend millions of dollars on the Metrolink rail system that only 
runs in one direction in the morning and afternoon? Is this state of the art? 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Taraborelli 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to your question is pretty simple: Metrolink follows existing 
commuting patterns. Consider that the Golden State Freeway heading into 
Downtown is a lot more crowded every morning than it is heading out. In other 
words, more people want to get to Downtown than to, say, Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, Metrolink officials want to provide the most bang for your 
buck. Trains heading into the hinterlands would not have enough riders to make 
financial sense, according to Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 At least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that the Metrolink system is slightly more than a year old. In that 
time, it has expanded into all five Southern California counties. Now, Hidalgo 
said, plans are in the works to run more trains along its existing lines -- 
including weekend trains, evening trains and even trains that run opposite to 
traditional commuting patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 It all comes down to time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "No new system can be everything to everyone right when it's open," Hidalgo 
said. "But we gradually want to phase in more and better and faster and safer 
service. You will not see Metrolink operating only during rush hours for very 
much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The two traffic lights on Hollywood Way at the north end of Burbank Airport 
still stop traffic on this busy street 24 hours a day, even though the Lockheed 
parking lot (which is served by one of the lights) is almost empty. The few 
cars there now could well wait for gaps in traffic and do not need traffic 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Campbell 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 We took your question to Mike Moss, senior civil engineer for the city of 
Burbank, who told us that the two signals are scheduled to stay in operation as 
long as the parking lot is in use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Lockheed completely leaves that area, we're almost locked in," Moss 
says. "There's a number of people who are still parking at that parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 But take heart: Word is that the parking lot may be discontinued by the end of 
the year. And until then, the signal does employ a "loop-detection" system that 
switches the light to red for traffic on Hollywood Way only when a car is 
waiting to exit the lot. Otherwise, "it should stay on green," Moss says.

been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, at 348 W. Commonwealth Ave., offers programs for youths ages 6 to

SWEEP SHOWS BRAVES ARE A CUT ABOVE FALTERING DODGERS; BASEBALL: ATLANTA 
UNBEATEN IN SEVEN GAMES AFTER RALLYING FOR 6-3 VICTORY IN SERIES FINALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's way too early to panic, but not too soon to ponder about the Dodgers, who 
take to the road knowing they are no longer in the same division, or class, as 
the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is there are 156 games left to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after wasting a solid starting effort from Kevin Gross, the Dodgers 
left Orel Hershiser out to dry in the Sunday sun as the Braves scored four 
seventh-inning runs against relievers to beat the Dodgers, 6-3, before a Dodger 
Stadium crowd of 49,294. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Dodgers and the seventh victory 
without a loss for the streaking Braves. Mark Wohlers, who entered in the sixth 
to retire Mike Piazza in the game's telling moment, picked up the victory in 
relief of starter Tom Glavine. Greg McMichael pitched a scoreless ninth to pick 
up his second save. Jim Gott (1-1) suffered the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser has given up three earned runs in 12 innings of work in two starts, 
but has yet to be involved in a decision. He departed Sunday for a pinch-hitter 
in the sixth, his team clinging to a 3-2 lead but threatening to bust the game 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is everything in baseball, and the Dodgers right now need their 
carburetor adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bases loaded and one out in the sixth, they went belly up. Brett 
Butler popped to second. Wohlers was then summoned to stare down Piazza, who 
blasted his first home run of the season in the third, a solo shot to right 
that measured 460 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Piazza flied softly to right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wohlers coming in with the bases loaded, and getting one of the toughest 
hitters in baseball out, that was the turning point right there," Brave Manager 
Bobby Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said, "We had chances to put them away, 
but let them get away," he was speaking of the fateful sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 You could almost sense the air being sucked from the Dodgers at that moment, 
and the game's mood swinging toward the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hershiser gone after giving up two runs through six innings, Atlanta 
jumped on the relief corps. Gott soon departed with runners on second and third 
and one out after giving up consecutive singles to Bill Pecota and Deion 
Sanders and a sacrifice bunt to Jeff Blauser. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Gary Wayne entered and gave up a run-scoring single to 
pinch-hitter Dave Gallagher that tied the score at 3-3. Fred McGriff then 
scored Sanders with a sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, Tony Tarasco then capped a great homecoming day by wrapping 
a two-run homer around the foul pole in right. It was the first career home run 
for the 23-year-old outfielder from Santa Monica High.  
</P>
<P>
 Tarasco had already doubled twice after replacing David Justice, who left in 
the fourth after fouling a ball off his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarasco's home run was about 130 feet shorter than Piazza's mammoth blast, but 
style points don't count in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't say 'mammoth' in the book, does it?" Tarasco said of the 
difference between the homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarasco and Ryan Klesko, from Westminster High in Orange County, have been 
asked to fill the considerable cleats of Ron Gant, who roamed left field before 
an off-season dirt-bike accident ended his career with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "For losing Ron Gant, they're not missing a beat," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox has only the dilemma of getting Tarasco more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy gets hurt (Justice), and we have a guy who gets two doubles and a home 
run that sort of iced it for us," Cox said, almost apologetically. "We've got 
some depth. They're young, but they're good." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Klesko, he touched Hershiser for an opposite-field, two-run home run to 
left in the first inning to give Atlanta a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser recovered and appeared to be cruising before Lasorda pinch-ran for 
him in the sixth. Hershiser reached on a fielder's choice after failing to 
advance the runners with a sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little cautious with him," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser didn't argue the decision after throwing 94 pitches through six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time to come out," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser also said he is confident that Dodger relief will not always betray 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll come around," he said. "We've got guys with solid arms. It'll be all 
right."

KINGS COME LIMPING HOME AFTER 2-1 LOSS; HOCKEY: AFTER FALLING TO CHICAGO 
DESPITE STAUBER'S 33 SAVES, TEAM WILL FINISH ITS SEASON WITH TWO GAMES AT THE 
FORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goaltender Robb Stauber did his part, making 33 saves, including seven on 
breakaways, but the battered and bruised Kings still lost to the Chicago 
Blackhawks, 2-1, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidelined by an assortment of injuries or ailments were Wayne Gretzky, Doug 
Houda, Robert Lang, Dave Taylor, Tony Granato, Dave Tomlinson and Marty 
McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, losing on the road for the 26th time this season, have lost 13 
times in their last 23 games, going 5-13-5 record during that span. They have 
lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings conclude their season with home games against Calgary and Edmonton 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour made 28 saves in recording his 36th 
victory of the season. He now has 77 over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After Belfour stopped John Druce at 14:11 of the third period on a breakaway 
with a glove save and stopped Alexei Zhitnik from the right point at 12:16 for 
his 26th and 27th saves, Chicago had to kill off a two-man advantage for 1:32. 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour's luck ran out at 11:07, when Kevin Todd tipped in Zhitnik's 50-footer 
from the right point on the Kings' 28th shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, only their third in their last 10 games, left the Blackhawks in 
the sixth playoff slot of the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks were assured of finishing no better than sixth when St. Louis 
tied Dallas, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chelios' 16th goal of the season at 5:49 of the first period gave the 
Blackhawks a 1-0 lead. He scored from 55 feet on the left point. 
</P>
<P>
 His assist at 12:51 of the second period with four players on each side set up 
Joe Murphy's 31st goal, a 28-footer from the deep slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour, with only one stop in the first period, made a big save at 18:34 of 
the second period on Warren Rychel from the left faceoff circle. Then, in 
rapid-fire succession, Belfour stopped Keith Redmond at 14:06 from barely 
outside the crease, then Rob Blake's 17-foot wrist shot from the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour said he was able to stay focused despite the lack of activity in the 
first period. "It can make you lose your concentration and give up a couple of 
easy goals," he said. "But my guys did a good job defensively, and I was able 
to stop a lot of shots." 
</P>
<P>
 King Coach Barry Melrose, meanwhile, was happy with his team's performance, 
despite the loss.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The Kings) probably played their best game in Chicago in the two years we've 
played here (under Melrose)," he said. "We out-chanced them in the second and 
third periods. Robb Stauber came up big, and for a guy who has only been in 21 
games, he showed us he can be a real force next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky suffered a twisted left knee in the Kings' 4-3 loss at Winnipeg on 
Saturday, and his status is day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be examined (today)," Melrose said. "We'll check him out real good and 
if we find he shouldn't play, we won't let him. He got in a real collision."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 Any day now, the Atlanta Braves should clinch a National League playoff berth. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' nine-hit explosion Sunday rocketed their team batting average 
from .134 to .158. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the Braves don't re-sign third baseman Terry Pendleton, the Dodgers ought 
to be ready with pen in hand. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They had their chance in 1991 when Pendleton left the St. Louis Cardinals. He 
was born in Los Angeles, graduated from Channel Islands High, attended Oxnard

offer three years ago because the front office still felt Jeff Hamilton was 
their third baseman of the future. . . .

<P>
 Ryan Klesko -- the Braves' 6-3, 220-pound, left-handed hitting rookie 
outfielder from Westminster High -- is so powerful that he hit an 
opposite-field home run off Orel Hershiser in the first inning with what 
appeared to be little more than a check swing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Have all those pitches caught up with Mark Langston, who is the only active 
major leaguer to have worked at least 223 innings each of the last eight 
seasons? . . .

 Calvin Hill isn't the only former Dallas Cowboy whose son went on to play at

</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a lack of talent is a problem," said Arum, who will promote a 
minimum of 24 shows in the next 12 months at the Olympic. "The problem has been

be missed.

<P>
 Top-seeded Pete Sampras won the Japan Open for the second consecutive year, 
defeating second-seeded Michael Chang, 6-4, 6-2, Sunday at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras broke Chang's serve once in the first set and twice in the second on 
the hard court, earning $156,000 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang won $82,100. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Kimiko Date overcame a slow start to defeat American Amy Frazier, 7-5, 
6-0, and win her third consecutive women's title. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, seeded fourth, took a 4-0 lead in the first set, but the top-seeded 
Date rallied to win seven of the next eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Date won $27,000, Frazier $13,500. 
</P>

<P>
 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands defeated Carlos Costa of Spain, 6-4, 7-6 
(8-6), 6-2, to win the Conde de Godo tournament at Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Krajicek's first singles event since taking five months off to recover 
from tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here just to test my knees and my physical condition, but I was not 
expecting that much," Krajicek said. "I should keep that attitude more often." 
</P>

<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario was a successful defender in the Bausch & Lomb 
Championships, defeating Gabriela Sabatini, 6-1, 6-4, at Amelia Island, Fla., 
to end a streak of 15 consecutive tournaments without a singles title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always great when you finally win," said the top-seeded player in the 
clay-court event. "I played my best, moved the ball well and dominated the 
match." 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the first of the year for Sanchez Vicario, who won four 
tournaments in 1993, but had gone 0-5 in finals since last May -- including 
losses to Steffi Graf in this year's Australian Open and Virginia Slims of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario dedicated the victory to her father, Emilio, who had a heart 
attack in Spain five days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's feeling much better, and I'm sure he'll be proud of me," she said. "He 
wanted me to stay and win. I did it for him."

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; CAPRIATI CONSIDERS A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati, who celebrated her 18th birthday on March 29, has accepted 
an invitation to be an alternate on the U.S. team that will play in the 
Federation Cup July 18-24 at Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "She indicated that, after high school, she's really going to start thinking 
about tennis again," said Marty Riessen, captain of the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who hasn't played since August, said in January that she was taking 
a break while rekindling an interest in the sport. She indicated, however, that 
she probably would return after graduating from Pascual County High in 
Saddlebrook, Fla., on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon starts 11 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who has earned almost $1.5 million on the WTA Tour and won a gold 
medal in the 1992 Olympic Games, has moved back with her family after living on 
her own in a nearby apartment for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know she's been out hitting the ball and working out a little bit, getting 
back slowly, at her own pace," her mother, Denise, said from Wesley Chapel, 
Fla. "Obviously, she wants to play again. It's just a matter of getting school 
over and done with, then totally focusing on whatever she wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing it the smart way, just kind of enjoying the rest of her senior 
year and hanging out." 
</P>
<P>
 Riessen said Capriati was receptive to the idea of being an alternate on a 
team that will include Mary Joe Fernandez, Zina Garrison Jackson, Gigi 
Fernandez and another high school senior, Lindsay Davenport, 17, of Murrieta 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who helped the U.S. team win the Federation Cup in 1990, will be 
called upon only if one of the others is injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we couldn't pick Jennifer for the team because she's not playing," 
Riessen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed reviews: Riessen welcomes the transformation of the Federation Cup, 
which next year will drop its one-week, one-site-a-year format to adopt a 
schedule similar to that of the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's eight quarterfinalists will make up next year's World Group, with 
the non-qualifiers relegated to zonal competition. Ties consisting of four 
singles matches, followed by a doubles match, will be played over two days at 
sites chosen by the host nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterfinals will be played in April, semifinals in July and the final in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the one chance for the event to grow into being a serious 
event," Riessen said. "Right now, it's a nice event, but it doesn't get that 
much coverage and notice in the total calendar. I think it needs a jump-start." 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi Fernandez, the world's No. 1 doubles player, wasn't happy about the 
placement of the doubles match, believing that it should be played before the 
last two singles matches. Most contests, she said, will be decided before the 
doubles match is played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really upset about it," she said. "If doubles is going to be dead, why do 
I want to schlep all around the world to cheer?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Passage from India: Tom Gullickson, in his first year as captain of the U.S. 
Davis Cup team, was prepared for the worst before he made his debut against 
India last month at New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fears, the U.S. team of Jim Courier, Todd Martin, Patrick McEnroe 
and Richey Reneberg was a 5-0 winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody got sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our own chef and we took a lot of our own food and all of our own 
water," Gullickson said. "And we even had the guys brush their teeth with Evian 
water, so they didn't use any water from the hotel tap system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I thought everything went quite well. Everybody stayed healthy, and 
when we got down there, all the boys worked pretty hard. There was a real good 
team spirit and a real camaraderie between the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullickson said Courier and Pete Sampras have expressed interest in playing 
against the Netherlands in a quarterfinal match July 15-17 at Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let's play five: The WTA Tour is not expected to oppose the decision by the 
Australian Open to change the format of its women's final from a best-of-three 
to a best-of-five-sets event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will help showcase women's tennis a bit," said Gerard Smith, the 
tour's executive director. "I've spoken to several of the top players and there 
doesn't seem to be any objection to it. I think the players are capable of 
staging a very exciting five-set final." 
</P>
<P>
 The season-ending Virginia Slims Championships has been the only event with a 
best-of-five women's final. 
</P>
<P>
 It has gone to five sets once, Monica Seles defeating Gabriela Sabatini in 
1990.

CONTRERAS BREATHES LIFE INTO CSUN, BUT SAN DIEGO STATE RALLIES FOR SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than two weeks ago, Cal State Northridge Coach Bill Kernen pronounced his 
team dead and criticized his players' heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at San Diego State, the Matadors came alive and then died, defeating 
the Aztecs, 7-2, in the first game before losing, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The split gave the first-place Aztecs (23-15 overall, 8-4) two victories in 
the three-game series and left Northridge (19-19, 7-5) one game out in the 
Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The results might not have been exactly what Kernen sought, but he said he 
"didn't have any problem with the effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six players he benched for lack of intensity, the three non-pitchers -- 
Keyaan Cook, Kevin Howard and Josh Smaler -- had all seen action by the end of 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to have another shot at it," Kernen said. "And they said they 
were going to come together as a team, play hard every day and take care of 
their responsibilities in the classroom and off the field. So I'm giving them 
another chance to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, senior Marco Contreras (5-4) went the distance for the 
ninth time in 10 starts and picked up the victory, allowing seven hits, 
striking out three and giving up no earned runs. A passed ball and a dropped 
fly ball helped the Aztecs score their only runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Up 2-0 in the top of the sixth, the Matadors made it 5-0 when center fielder 
Joey Arnold drove in two runs with a double to the warning track and then 
scored on a single to right by Tyler Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Northridge collected 13 hits, led by two-hit performances from 
Arnold, Cook, Jason Shanahan and Jonathan Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2 was a wild one. The Matadors fell behind 4-0 but then sent three Aztec 
pitchers to the dugout during a seven-run third. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, who finished three for four, clubbed a three-run home run, his 
sixth. Smaler tied it with an RBI single. Another run came in on a sacrifice 
fly from Campbell. And Eric Gillespie and Arnold followed with RBI singles to 
make it 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Aztecs came back, scoring three in the fourth, four in the fifth and 
another in the sixth to take a five-run lead. Matador starter Aaron D'Aoust 
gave up eight earned runs in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the third inning, Northridge slumbered at the plate the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explain to me how you can get eight zeros and a seven," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he added, "we hit the ball OK. We got enough to win all three games if 
we had quality pitching. That's something we haven't had all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ERA is about double what it usually is. And we've had that happen quite 
bit. We've scored enough runs pretty much all year long. We just haven't gotten 
the pitching that would win those games." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering two of Northridge's starting pitchers are out with injuries, 
Kernen said he doesn't think they will contend if their ace, Contreras, doesn't 
win the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I'm taking it," he said. "I have to win every single one of my 
games from now on and keep the run total down. They gave us seven runs today, 
we gave up 12. We can't be doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he will be feeling extra pressure the rest of the way, he said: "I 
think I pitch better that way, because when I'm more relaxed I give up a lot of 
runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is now halfway through its 24-game WAC schedule and will travel to 
Hawaii this week for a three-game series against the Rainbows.

JONES POWERS NORTHRIDGE TO SWEEP OF ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Third baseman Shannon Jones tied two Cal State Northridge softball records 
Sunday by hitting two home runs and driving in six runs in the second game of 
the Matadors' doubleheader sweep of Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN won the first game, 2-1 in eight innings, and the second, 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who also homered in the first game and has eight for the season, hit 
the fourth grand slam in Matador history in the sixth inning of the second 
game. It was the sixth two-homer game by a Matador player. Her six runs batted 
in tied the mark set by Leslie Barrett in March 1982 and tied 10 years later by 
current Matador outfielder Beth Calcante. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante won the first game by hitting her fifth homer of the season to lead 
off eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-ranked Matadors (33-6) led, 1-0, in the first game on the strength 
of Jones' homer before Arizona State (16-29) scored an unearned run in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Windmiller (18-1) allowed seven hits and struck out seven to earn the 
victory in the first game. Kathy Blake (10-5) was the winner in the second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Calcante finished the day with five hits apiece. Catcher Scia 
Maumausolo had three hits in the second game.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CANSECO POWERS RANGERS TO 8-7 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Canseco found the perfect way to break out of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco, undaunted by a one-for-14 start, didn't change a thing Sunday -- 
except for the results. 
</P>
<P>
 He had three hits, including a home run, as the Texas Rangers defeated the 
Baltimore Orioles, 8-7, at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco had a perfect day at the plate, reaching five times and scoring three 
runs. He started the season 0 for 13 in the Rangers' first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when you're backed up against a wall you have to fight your way out 
of it. You just can't give in to it," Canseco said. "I've just tried to stay 
consistent and not really make a whole lot of changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Rodriguez homered and had three runs batted in, while Dean Palmer had 
three hits and drove in two runs. Texas first baseman Will Clark sprained his 
right ankle in the first inning and left the game in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he'll be all right," Ranger Manager Kevin Kennedy said. "We'll wait 
and see how it goes after 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro had a homer and three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Jeffrey Hammonds also homered for the Orioles, who lost two of three to 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 12, Seattle 6 -- Joe Carter hit a three-run home run and drove in five 
runs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Johnson (0-1), who threw seven no-hit innings in Seattle's season opener 
before tiring, gave up a career-high and club-record 11 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stewart (2-0) gave up four runs and eight hits in seven innings. He is 
19-5 against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 White singled leading off the first, Roberto Alomar walked and Carter homered. 
Johnson then walked four consecutive batters, including Alex Gonzalez with the 
bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson fanned Mike Huff in the second for his club-record 1,079th strikeout, 
passing Mark Langston, but Toronto made it 8-1 in the second on Carter's fly, 
Darnell Coles' run-scoring single and Randy Knorr's two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 15, Minnesota 5 -- Geronimo Berroa, a non-roster player who made the 
team in spring training, drove in five runs with a homer, a double and three 
singles for the Athletics at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Steinbach drove in four runs with a double and single for Oakland, which 
outscored the Twins, 39-14, in three games after opening the season with two 
losses at Milwaukee. The A's had 20 hits Sunday, 50 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Berroa, a good minor-league hitter for 10 seasons who has had only four brief 
stints in the majors, is hitting .692 with two homers and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 8, New York 3 -- Cecil Fielder snapped out of a two-for-23 slump with 
two home runs at Detroit and Lou Whitaker collected his 1,000th RBI.  
</P>
<P>
 Fielder tied the score, 2-2, with a one-out homer in the sixth. After the 
Tigers moved ahead, he hit a two-run homer in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Limited to only two hits through the first six innings by Melido Perez, 
Detroit rallied for three runs in the seventh against Sterling Hitchcock (0-1) 
and Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Gibson walked, Alan Trammell sacrificed, pinch-hitter Juan Samuel walked 
and Tony Phillips singled for a 3-2 lead. Whitaker followed with a sacrifice 
fly for his 1,000th RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, Boston 0 -- Alex Fernandez pitched a six-hitter at Chicago for his 
first shutout in nearly a year. 
</P>

Red Sox helped Chicago by making three errors.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; REDS RALLY LATE, SWEEP PHILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One week into the season, the Cincinnati Reds have done something no one could 
last year -- sweep the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Dykstra's error in center field handed Cincinnati its go-ahead run 
Sunday and let the Reds rally for a 7-5 victory and a three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had swept the Phillies since September of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykstra's misplay and a three-hit, three-RBI game from Roberto Kelly gave the 
Reds their fourth consecutive victory and the kind of start they needed. The 
Reds lost 89 games last season and were under pressure to open strong. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a good day for two starting pitchers making their first starts for 
new teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati's Erik Hanson opened the game by giving up singles to Dykstra and 
Mariano Duncan and a homer to Darren Daulton. Loser Jeff Juden walked the first 
three batters he faced to set up a four-run first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies went ahead with two runs in the fourth against Hanson, but 
Dykstra's misplay turned the game around. Kelly singled home the tying run with 
two out in the sixth and scored from first when Dykstra got a late break on 
Bret Boone's sinking liner, then let it skip past him for his first error of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "No excuses," Dykstra said. "Once I realized I was not going to catch it, I 
tried to play it on the hop and it skipped by." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly added a run-scoring double in the eighth, his third hit of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 6, New York 1 -- Andujar Cedeno homered for the second consecutive 
game, and had two doubles and three RBIs at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Donnels, who also homered for the second game in a row, had two hits and 
scored two runs. His single against Pete Smith started a two-run second inning, 
capped by Cedeno's two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Drabek (1-1) went seven innings, giving up a run on five hits while 
striking out four and walking three. Smith (1-1) gave up six runs on 10 hits in 
five innings, striking out two and walking two. 
</P>
<P>
 New York third baseman Bobby Bonilla suffered a dislocated left shoulder while 
trying to field Cedeno's decisive double. The Mets said the injury was not as 
serious as a ruptured ligament in the same shoulder that cut short Bonilla's 
1993 season, and would not require surgery. It was not known how long he will 
be out of action. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 8, Chicago 2 -- Ken Hill continued his April brilliance and the Expos 
shook up their batting order to avoid a three-game sweep at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill (2-0) gave up one run and four hits in seven innings. He struck out four 
and walked four. Hill is 6-0 in April starts the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Manager Felipe Alou juggled his batting order, moving Marquis 
Grissom, the team's normal leadoff hitter, to the third spot in the lineup, and 
batting Mike Lansing first. Wil Cordero, who batted in the sixth spot in 
Saturday's game, batted second. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, San Francisco 1 -- Rheal Cormier gave up three hits in seven 
innings and Bernard Gilkey homered at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Cormier (1-0) left in the eighth after he was hit in the left foot by a Dave 
Burba pitch. He limped to first and was replaced by a pinch runner. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco threatened in the eighth against Vincente Palacios and Rob 
Murphy. Palacios issued a one-out walk to Royce Clayton, who stole second and 
took third on a fly-ball out. With two outs, Murphy retired pinch-hitter Dave 
Martinez on a sinking liner caught by Gilkey in left. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 8, San Diego 5 -- The Marlins' Gary Sheffield homered twice, doubled, 
tripled and drove in five runs against his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield, who entered the game with no homers, hit a two-run homer in the 
first inning, a two-run double in the third and a solo homer in the fifth, all 
against Wally Whitehurst (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield also tripled in the ninth and scored on a wild pitch by Gene Harris, 
giving him a team-record 13 total bases for the day.

 When starter Mark Leiter is introduced today at the Angels' home opener, 
standing along the third base line with the rest of his teammates, he would 
like everyone in Anaheim Stadium to realize his sincere gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter joined the Angels only three weeks ago, but he and his wife, Allison, 
have been overwhelmed by the compassion and affection of the Angel organization 
and its fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can not say enough for what they've done for me and my family," Leiter 
said. "It was like they had known me all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Alexander Leiter, 9 months old, died Monday in Anaheim just two hours 
after his father boarded the team charter for Minneapolis. Tim Mead, assistant 
general manager, immediately left his office and stayed with Allison and 
three-year-old Mark Jr. until Leiter arrived past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels paid for Leiter's flight back to Anaheim. They told him he could 
take as much time off as he needed. When he decided to make his scheduled start 
Saturday, the Angels picked up the expenses for Allison and Mark Jr. to 
accompany him to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization has been so great to us," Allison Leiter said. "It's been 
unbelievable the way they've welcomed us. Everybody has treated this with the 
respect and tenderness it deserves. It's hard to thank everyone individually, 
but please, extend our gratitude to everyone." 
</P>

 Angel left fielder Bo Jackson was the self-appointed fashion security guard 
Sunday, making sure that no one left the clubhouse until everyone's ties had 
proper knots. "Come on, some of you guys are looking like sportswriters," he 
yelled. . . . Wayne Gretzky will throw out the first pitch today at the home 
opener. They're expecting a crowd in excess of 30,000. . . . John Farrell 
yielded only two hits while pitching six shutout innings Saturday against Salt 
Lake City in triple-A Vancouver's 2-1 victory. BOB NIGHTENGALE

KEY MISTAKES BEDEVIL CAL STATE FULLERTON; BASEBALL: TITANS SQUANDER A LEAD AS 
LONG BEACH STATE WINS, 4-2, TO TAKE TWO GAMES OF THE THREE-GAME WEEKEND SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton seemed to be well on its way to a crucial victory over 
Long Beach State on Sunday at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Ricabal, making his first start for the Titans since late February, was 
pitching almost flawlessly and outfielder Dante Powell hit a leadoff homer in 
the sixth inning to give Fullerton a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost from out of nowhere, those devilish baseball demons rose up in 
the eighth inning to grab Fullerton by the throat. Long Beach State scored 
three unearned runs in the inning for a 4-2 Big West Conference victory and a 
2-1 advantage in the weekend series that matched two of the nation's top-ranked 
college baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal had given up only four hits through seven innings before the 49ers' 
Tim Falsken opened the eighth with a single and the Titans went to the bullpen 
for stopper Ted Silva. But the defense went south at the same time. Rolando 
Avila reached base when Titan first baseman Adam Millan tried to get the lead 
runner at second on the bunt. His throw, however, was in the dirt and both 
runners were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The next batter, Eric Martins, laid down a bunt that Silva fielded cleanly, 
but second baseman Jeff Ferguson was three feet behind the bag when he caught 
the ball, loading the bases. On the next play, shortstop Jack Jones mishandled 
Ryan Miller's ground ball, allowing two runs to score. Long Beach's final run 
of the inning came on Ramon Smith's single. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the first bunt, our first baseman made an aggressive play . . . and on the 
second bunt it was a matter of confusion between the first and second basemen 
about who was to cover the base," Titan Coach Augie Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Coach Dave Snow felt the mental miscue was especially costly. "When 
they don't get an out on that bunt, it's a big play," Snow said. "Going into 
the eighth we were just trying to get some people on base and see what would 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory lifts Long Beach State to 25-8 for the season and 6-3 in the Big 
West. The Titans, who went into the series ranked No. 1 in the nation by 
Collegiate Baseball, fell to 27-8, and 6-3.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither coach put more emphasis on the outcome of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to minimize the importance of winning and losing, but the real 
issue is still out in front of both of us," Garrido said. "But I'm disappointed 
that we lost the game. There were a lot of things offensively we could have 
done that would have helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow said he feels both teams still will be ranked in the top 10 this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had an early 1-0 lead in the second inning. Millan singled to open 
the inning and moved to second on D.C. Olsen's sacrifice bunt. Bret Hemphill 
grounded out, but Jim Betzsold's double to right center drove in Millan. 
Betzsold, however, was thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple, ending 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had a good chance to build on the lead in the fifth but failed to 
capitalize. Hemphill had a leadoff single and moved to second on the sacrifice. 
Jason Gill singled to right, but was caught rounding first after the throw to 
the plate kept Hemphill at third. Long Beach starting pitcher Michael Hernandez 
was able to get Jones on a bouncer to short that ended the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the one-run lead, Ricabal gathered steam after giving up two hits but no 
runs in the first. He coasted through the second, third and fourth innings with 
three strikeouts during that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-out error by Gill, the Titan third baseman, put Ricabal in trouble in 
the fifth. Two walks by Ricabal didn't help matters, either, before Martins' 
RBI single. Powell, however, threw out Falsken, trying to score from second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had a chance to do more damage after Powell's leadoff homer in the 
sixth, his sixth of the season. Tony Miranda walked and Ferguson reached base 
on an infield hit, but pinch-hitter Sal Mancuso hit into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans wound up leaving eight runners on base. Silva took the pitching 
loss, falling to 3-2; Gonzalez (3-1) logged the victory.

<P>
 The New York Islanders strengthened their hold on the final Eastern Conference 
playoff spot by defeating the New York Rangers, 5-4, on Sunday at Uniondale, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Islanders 82 points, two more than the Florida Panthers 
for the eighth position in the Eastern Conference. The Islanders hold the first 
tiebreaker advantage with 35 victories, three more than the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Malakhov scored twice for the Islanders. Other Islander goals were 
scored by Ray Ferraro, Mart McInnis and Benoit Hogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Goals by Don Sweeney and Glen Murray only 2:19 
apart in the second period lifted the Bruins at Philadelphia, mathematically 
eliminating the Flyers from the playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, Dallas 2 -- Petr Nedved scored with 7:52 remaining to give the 
Blues a tie at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedved scored his fifth goal since joining the Blues on March 7 on a slap shot 
from the left circle that beat goalie Darcy Wakaluk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 6, Tampa Bay 4 -- Robert Kron and Pat Verbeek each scored twice to 
help the Whalers overcome an early three-goal deficit at Hartford, Conn.

 Jocelyn Lemieux and Geoff Sanderson also scored for the Whalers, who scored 
five unanswered goals after falling behind, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 4, Quebec 1 -- Alexander Mogilny's third-period goal broke a 1-1 tie 
and Dominik Hasek stopped 21 of 22 shots for the Sabres at Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Mogilny's goal came 1:45 into the third period during a Sabre power play. His

Alexei Gusarov and dribbled through the legs of goalie Stephane Fiset into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 3, Vancouver 1 -- Ray Whitney scored one goal and assisted on another 
at San Jose.

sent a backhand, between-the-legs pass to Ulf Dahlen, and Dahlen scored from 
five feet away at 6:23. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 9:03, Whitney picked up the rebound put it back in for his 14th goal

give the Oilers the victory at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Primeau scored for the Red Wings in the final second of play, but

of the game.

NBA ROUNDUP; SUPERSONICS GET RECORD VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics' franchise-record 57th victory meant something extra 
because it came against the team that kept them out of the NBA finals last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a season-high 29 points from Kendall Gill, the SuperSonics clinched 
the Pacific Division title by rallying to beat the Suns, 111-108, on Sunday at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics overcame a 17-point deficit in the final quarter to win for 
the 11th time in 12 games. Clinching the division for only the second time in 
history, the SuperSonics came back after trailing, 92-75, early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great win for us," Seattle Coach George Karl said. "I think we're 
snowballing some spirit into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Beating the Suns for the third time in four games this season, the SuperSonics 
(57-18) broke their club record for victories set in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley had 23 points and 14 rebounds, Cedric Ceballos 21 points and 
Dan Majerle 20 for Phoenix. Shawn Kemp added 21 points and 15 rebounds for the 
SuperSonics, who also got 18 points from Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 93, Denver 92 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 31 points, including a 12-foot 
baseline jumper with five seconds remaining at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon helped the Rockets erase a 17-point deficit midway through the third 
quarter, scoring 21 of his team's final 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss left Denver four games ahead of the Lakers in the race for the eighth 
and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 107, New York 88 -- Kenny Anderson scored 12 of his 16 points in 
the first quarter as the Nets grabbed a big early lead at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Nets' fourth in five games with the Knicks, notable 
because the two teams might be paired in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks (52-22) missed a chance at clinching the Atlantic Division title. 
The Nets (40-35) took a major step toward nailing down a playoff spot with the 
victory, which moved them into a tie with Miami for the sixth-best record in 
the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey shot 54% against the defensive-minded Knicks in leading from almost 
start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson added 10 assists, while Derrick Coleman led New Jersey with 17 points 
and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing had 28 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 116, Detroit 111 -- Dino Radja had 25 points and 10 rebounds, and 
Xavier McDaniel scored 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter at Auburn 
Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Hunter scored 22 points for Detroit, while Mills and Cadillac Anderson 
had 21 each.

PATIENCE PAYS OFF FOR POSSIBLY PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the $212,800 Santa Barbara Handicap didn't unfold as expected, the 
result was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, Possibly Perfect figured to go to the front Sunday and lead her four 
rivals for the entire 1 1/4 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kent Desormeaux was content to keep the 7-10 favorite Possibly 
Perfect in second behind Waitryst for most of the way, before taking the lead 
and going on to a half-length victory over Pracer in 2:00 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning the Santa Barbara, Possibly Perfect joined Lakeway as the only 
winner of two Grade I races at the meeting. Before Sunday, she had won the 
Santa Ana on March 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel hasn't seen either one of the victories by the 
4-year-old Northern Baby filly. He was in Louisiana saddling You And I in the 
Louisiana Derby last month, and Sunday he didn't come to the races after being 
at his barn in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, the way things are going, Frankel will stay away when Possibly 
Perfect returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby told me that Desormeaux knows how to ride this filly and not to worry 
about that," assistant trainer Humberto Ascanio said. " . . . Kent rode her 
with a lot of confidence."

MAGGERT'S DOUBLE-EAGLE TURNS BAD MASTERS INTO A MASTERPIECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Maggert, faced with the ignominy of having the worst golf score in the 
field heading into the final round, made a little Masters history Sunday. 
Maggert became the third person ever to score a double-eagle in the tournament 
when he sent his second shot on the 13th hole 222 yards from the side of the 
fairway to the bottom of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert stared in disbelief for a second, then raised his arms. He gave his 
caddie, Brian Sullivan, a high five and strode up the fairway to several 
standing ovations from the early arriving crowd surrounding the green. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first double-eagle in tournament play at the 13th hole. The other 
double-eagles came in 1935 by Gene Sarazen on the 15th and by Bruce Devlin in 
1967 on the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing so bad and all of a sudden everyone started yelling and 
screaming," Maggert said. "It felt like I was leading. It was a good 
experience. It took the sour feeling out of my mouth about this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert was playing with a marker (a non-scoring competitor) in the first 
group of the day. He was 19 over par when he hit the shot. The ball struck 
about 20 yards from the pin, on the front of the green, took a bounce as if it 
was checking up, took another small bounce and rolled swiftly the final six 
feet into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert, who had never had a double-eagle and still hasn't had a hole in one, 
removed the ball from play and hopes to find a place for it. "I'll probably put 
it on a shelf, so I can keep the kids and dog from it and maybe it'll last a 
while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert finished the round with a three-over 75 and four-day total of 305.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: THINGS ARE FINALLY LOOKING UP FOR GARDNER FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recruiting process has changed 180 degrees in the Gardner family. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1963, Tom Gardner, a 6-foot-3 guard, was an all-state 
selection as a high school senior in Columbia, S.C. With segregation still a 
fact of life for black athletes in the South, Gardner's college options were 
limited. He considered a handful of all-black schools, including Morgan (Md.) 
State, Johnson C. Smith (N.C.) University and South Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
 All-expenses-paid campus recruiting visits? Not in his wildest dreams. Gardner 
hadn't even met the head basketball coach or seen the campus the day he showed 
up at Morgan State to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to the spring of 1994. On Friday afternoon, in the gymnasium at 
Bellflower St. John Bosco, Tom Gardner's youngest son, Jelani, a highly skilled 
6-6 point guard, will announce his college destination this fall. The monthlong 
spring signing period for basketball players starts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who averaged 25.7 points this past season while leading St. John 
Bosco to its first Southern Section championship in any sport, was one of the 
most heavily recruited players in the country. He is a natural ballhandler, 
shoots accurately from three-point range, and has proven to be a leader on the 
court. Gardner will choose from among three schools -- UCLA, Arkansas or 
California -- after also considering Syracuse, Minnesota, Arizona and Arizona 
State, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more confused than ever," he said with a laugh by phone from his hotel in 
Troy, Mich., while preparing to play in Sunday's Magic Johnson high school 
all-star game at The Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of factors are weighing heavy on Gardner's mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Arkansas, which recently won its first national basketball championship, 
he could be a key performer on a deep and talented team capable of winning a 
few more titles. But he also would be far from Southern California, in miles 
and lifestyle. And the school, academically, is not on a par with the other two 
finalists. Still, with the nation's No. 1 fan, President Clinton, cheering them 
on, and a sparkling new 20,000-seat arena, Coach Nolan Richardson's program is 
the hottest in the country right now. "I was really happy for the guys," 
Gardner said, "but them winning the national championship is not going to 
affect my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 * At Cal, he would probably inherit the starting point guard position as a 
freshman, replacing Jason Kidd, who decided to forgo his final two years of 
college eligibility to enter the NBA draft. As they did with Kidd, the Bears 
have made a strong late run at Gardner, who for a long time rejected Cal 
because of the expected media and fan scrutiny likely to follow Kidd's 
successor. But a big factor favoring the Bears is 30-year-old Coach Todd 
Bozeman, who is "like a big brother," Gardner said. "It would be nice to have 
that kind of relationship with your coach." 
</P>
<P>
 * At UCLA, it's the chance to play at home, in front of family and friends, 
for a team he admits has long been his favorite. "Coach (Jim) Harrick and I 
have had a friendship since he first saw me play in eighth grade," Gardner 
said. "In my mind, I signed my letter of intent with the Bruins back then." 
UCLA coaches have told Gardner that he would compete for Shon Tarver's vacant 
guard position next season, then could be shifted to point guard a year later, 
after Tyus Edney departs. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski had a dual purpose in Southern California over the 
weekend: accompany his senior All-American, Grant Hill, to the John R. Wooden 
Award ceremonies Friday at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and pay a visit to 
the home of Ventura College forward Brandon Jessie, the former Edison High 
standout. The 6-6 Jessie will visit Duke this weekend, and is scheduled to take 
official trips to Georgetown (April 22-24) and Arizona State (April 29-May 1). 
He visited Utah and Nevada Las Vegas last week, and probably will make 
unofficial visits to UCLA and UC Santa Barbara before signing. Georgetown Coach 
John Thompson also dropped by to see Jessie last week . . . Add Ventura: The 
Pirates, one of the state's most successful community college programs under 
former Cal State Fullerton assistant Phil Matthews, have two other Division I 
prospects: 5-10 Joey Ramirez, who will sign with Pepperdine this week, and 
forward Michael Tate (6-5, 215), who will choose from among UC Irvine, Utah, 
Utah State, San Diego State and Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State has received an oral commitment from 6-6 forward Joe Zaletel of 
El Camino College, an outstanding shooter. Zaletel picked the Sun Devils over 
USC. Other recent commitments: 6-6 forward Zerrick Campbell of Long Beach Poly 
to San Francisco; 6-5 forward Pharoah Davis of Palmdale Highland to George 
Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and 6-8 forward Mark Sanford of San Diego 
Lincoln to Washington . . . Add Pac-10 hoops: 6-9, 250-pound forward Ben Davis 
of Hutchinson (Kan.) Community College, one of the top prospects in the 
country, is trying to decide between Arizona and Georgia Tech. How much does 
Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins covet the powerful but well-traveled Davis, 
who began his college career at Kansas and also stayed briefly at Florida? So 
much so that, sources say, he might offer an assistant's position to Davis' 
coach at Hutchinson, Steve McLain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, with four scholarships to give, would like to sign Long 
Beach Poly point guard Dion Holton (6-0), a defensive specialist. Holton was a 
weekend visitor to Portland, which is still without a head coach (former 
Arizona assistant Tony McAndrews and Maryland-Eastern Shore Coach Rob Chavez 
are the front-runners). Titan coaches, disappointed at not getting Zaletel, who 
they had recruited all season, and in need of immediate help, will probably 
offer their remaining scholarships to out-of-state community college prospects 
. . . Two standouts from Magnolia High, 6-6 Brandon Harvey, and 6-4 Frank 
Henderson, are expected to sign with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 All-American forward Willie Mitchell of Detroit announced after the Magic 
Johnson game Sunday that, as expected, he would attend Michigan. All three of 
the West's front-court starters -- Mitchell, 6-8 Maurice Taylor (22 points, 
five blocked shots, team MVP) of Detroit and 6-9 Maceo Baston (13 points, nine 
rebounds) of Dallas -- are now headed to Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Add all-stars: Jelani Gardner scored 10 points, including two NBA 
three-pointers, and had seven assists in the East's 141-135 victory.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; MILUTINOVIC FACES TOUGH TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World Cup decisions that once appeared clear cut for U.S. national team Coach 
Bora Milutinovic have clouded of late, what with injuries and tight 
championship races in various European leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic has 35 players on his roster, the majority of them at the Mission 
Viejo training facility and about a dozen playing overseas. In the case of U.S. 
players in the English first division, good news for their clubs is bad news 
for Milutinovic. For example, midfielder John Harkes plays for Derby County, 
which is in contention for a spot in the playoffs that could earn it a 
promotion to the Premier League. Same goes for Tab Ramos with Real Betis in the 
Spanish second division. 
</P>
<P>
 What this means to Milutinovic is that he may not get some of his key 
offensive players back until the end of May, less than three weeks before the 
World Cup begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the rash of injuries U.S. players have suffered lately. Roy 
Wegerle, who plays for Coventry City in the Premier League, has suffered the 
most recent and potentially devastating injury. Last week, Wegerle had surgery 
on his right knee, for the second time since January. He is not expected to 
return to the team before the end of the season, the first week in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team's general manager, Bill Nuttall, said last week that the team 
would like Wegerle to return to Mission Viejo for rehabilitation, as he did 
after the first surgery in January. But, Nuttall conceded, Coventry is unlikely 
to release its highest-paid player to rejoin his national team, even if he is 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Other injured players are recovering, just in time. Harkes missed 10 games 
with an ankle injury and is now playing again, as is Ramos, after missing three 
weeks with a calf injury. Cle Kooiman's knee injury seems to have gotten 
better, but he is not yet back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic will have all this to consider when he cuts his roster to the 
final 22 on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting that had been scheduled last week between World Cup Organizing 
Committee and Internal Revenue Service officials has been reset, after the IRS 
determined that its Los Angeles office, not its Washington, D.C. office, should 
handle the examination of WCOC's 1991 and 1992 tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The WCOC had asked the IRS for a ruling after some members of the World Cup 
board of directors grew concerned about the amount of money flowing from World 
Cup coffers to the accounts of Major League Soccer, the proposed new 
professional soccer league. Because the WCOC is a nonprofit entity, they 
reasoned, it might be construed as improper to transfer money to a for-profit 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one tax attorney has called the practice "risky, at best." The WCOC's 
tax-exempt status may be at risk if the IRS determines the as-yet undefined 
gifts or loans were outside tax guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cause for concern, board members say, is the appearance the payments 
of more than $3.5 million leave: WCOC president Alan Rothenberg also heads the 
proposed professional league. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Now The News: 
</P>
<P>
 Item: The European soccer authority, UEFA, last week endorsed FIFA President 
Joao Havelange's bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Let's see, how was that done? Havelange already had courted the 
African confederation in 1990 by awarding it a much deserved third place in the 
World Cup finals. He'd already increased the field from 16 teams to 24 in 1982, 
adding slots to Asia, Africa and CONCACAF. 
</P>
<P>
 After a flurry of deal-cutting, Havelange has spent just about all of his 
political capital to buy his support. Now, there are two separate but parallel 
realities: Both the Asian and CONCACAF regions believe they will gain another 
place in the 1998 finals, presumably coming from Europe's 13 slots, and UEFA 
President Lennart Johanssen told the Associated Press last week that, "We have 
guarantees that no (World Cup) places will be taken away from Europe" and that 
some might even be added. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Havelange has promised so much to so many, just where are all those 
World Cup places coming from? 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: Reports surfaced last week of Havelange's wish to expand the World Cup 
tournament to 32 teams. Wonder if there's any connection? 
</P>
<P>
 Item: The English Football Assn. last week backed out of the match against 
Germany in Berlin that had come to be known as the 'Hitler's Birthday Game,' 
citing fears that German neo-Fascists and English hooligans would disrupt the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Why did it take so long to figure this one out? And who did the 
Germans think they were kidding when they maintained that Hitler's birthday, 
April 20, carried no symbolism. Isn't there another day available for what 
could have been an exciting match, absent the political overtones? Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Major League Soccer, the proposed first division professional league, has 
cleared a major hurdle on its way to legitimacy: it has a television contract. 
The three-year agreement calls for 35 regular-season and playoff games to be 
televised on ESPN and ESPN2 and the championship game on ABC. . . . Single-game 
World Cup tickets are expected to go on sale May 1. These tickets are among 
those returned by sponsors and other national federations. . . . The World Cup 
Legacy Tour has officially started. Thirty skills events for children will be 
held in each of the nine venue cities. The winners of those events will 
participate in Soccer Celebration at the Santa Monica Pier, April 22 and 23. 
For registration information, contact the World Cup office in Century City. . . 
. World Cup's mural program is in progress on underpasses and walls near 
freeways throughout the city. Five murals are expected to be completed. . . . 
Tourism officials in Chicago and Dallas report World Cup hotel reservations are 
running well below expectations. In Chicago, half the 10,000 rooms set aside 
for World Cup-related tourism were unreserved. A venue spokesman in Chicago 
said the failure of France, England and Japan to qualify has reduced the 
expected number of visitors.

JACK SMITH: NOW, IF ONLY THEY COULD GET HIS HOUSE IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I have for the past several years, I had lunch the other day at the 
Pasadena Showcase House of Design in advance of its opening to the public 
(April 17). 
</P>
<P>
 It has become the most delightful social event of my season. My luncheon 
companions are all attractive young Pasadena matrons, members of the Junior 
Philharmonic Committee. (Since she is obliged to drive me where I go, my wife 
went with me this year for the first time. She loved it.) 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon is served with champagne and always produces bright conversation 
and laughter. I like to go a week or two before the opening, because at that 
point the house is in a state of chaotic disorder. Canvas drops cover most of 
the floors. Painters and carpenters are at work in every room, and landscapers 
are working outdoors. The whine of saws is pervasive. One is likely to bump 
into a painter at work on a delicate fresco or stumble over a bucket of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have ever remodeled your own house, you know the muddle that prevails. 
I am not going to predict again that the house will not be ready for its 
opening date. I have done so every year and every year been wrong. Just let me 
say that it will take the usual miracle for the house to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The women of the committee must have a way with men (especially their 
husbands, who are abandoned during the annual event). If you have ever 
remodeled, you know the maddening delays that can interrupt the work. My wife 
and I are remodeling for the fourth time, and we have not seen a worker for a 
week. Meanwhile, her bathroom and closet are unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Showcase house this year is a stately Georgian Colonial mansion on a large 
estate known as Pegfair, in the Linda Vista heights of Pasadena. It was also 
the committee's 12th Showcase House in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1883, John and Hannah Yocum came to Pasadena from Iowa with their son, 
Nathan, and his wife, Lynda, and built the first house on the hill, a large 
farmhouse called Hillcrest. It is said that Nathan, looking out over the 
neighborhood one day, named it Linda Vista, Spanish for "pretty view." (If you 
can believe a Spanish-speaking Iowan.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1907, Marshal D. Fiscus bought the land, restored the Yocum house. In 1929, 
Robert J. Richards, known as the Lettuce King, and his wife, Arabella, tore 
down the Hillcrest house and built the present residence for $33,000. They 
called it Fairview. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley I. Dumm, a founder of Voice of America, bought Fairview in 1939 andj 
renamed it Pegfair, in honor of his wife, Margaret, and Mary Pickford, who with 
her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, had built the famous Pickfair. 
</P>
<P>
 The present owners acquired the estate in 1990. Obviously, they have taken up 
temporary residence elsewhere. Meanwhile, do the owners have anything to say 
about the remodeling? No, except for major changes, such as floor coverings, on 
which the owner may not only be heard but may also pay some of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The house has everything a modern gentleman like me could want. Its windows 
afford spectacular views of the San Gabriel Mountains. It has a tennis court, a 
swimming pool -- of course -- and a guest house large enough for a family of 
four. The committee wisely has chosen to preserve such original touches as 
ceiling frescoes and mahogany woodwork. Some original tile is preserved, but 
the new tile work in the kitchen and the several baths is rich and dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 29 years, the Showcase Committee has raised more than $5 million for 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Committee, plus financing various youth music 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Showcase opens with a gala on Sunday, beginning at 6 p.m., including a 
performance by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and will remain open to the public 
through May 15. (Closed Mondays. No parking except at Pasadena Rose Bowl Lot 
No. 1, for the shuttle bus. For tickets and information call (818) 792-4661.) 
</P>
<P>
 When you tour the house, be sure to look in on my favorite room, the library. 
It's Victorian in style, with walnut paneling, an antique secretary and an 
English bachelor chest, plus a shelf of leather-bound antique books. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had to, I could live in the pool house, as long as I had access to the 
library and the kitchen. For that matter, I could probably be content in the 
children's playhouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy the tour but, sorry, I can't help it. No matter what the Junior Phils 
say, be careful you don't step in a bucket of paint. I see no way that the 
house can be finished and the workers all cleared out by Sunday, if the speed 
with which our house is being remodeled is any gauge.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: CIVIL WAR BUFFS FORM ROUND TABLE TO DISCUSS THEIR PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the second Tuesday of each month, a small group gathers in a Van Nuys 
bookstore to discuss warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not, however, hashing over any of the current world hot spots, but 
instead are fixated on events of 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For this disparate band of avid historians, the Civil War is an addiction. 
They gather to discuss everything from Union Maj. Robert Anderson's surrender 
to Brig. Gen. Pierre G. T. Beauregard at Ft. Sumter to the end of the war when, 
at Wilmer McLean's home at Appomattox Court House, Robert E. Lee, impeccably 
attired in a full dress uniform, surrendered to a muddied and disheveled 
Ulysses S. Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The group started at Book Grinders about five months ago, the brainchild of 
two longtime Civil War buffs, Russell Kean and Steve Phenow. 
</P>
<P>
 Phenow, a writer with a degree in history, asked Kean if he could organize a 
Civil War round table. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are groups meeting in Long Beach and Los Angeles, but nothing in the 
Valley," Phenow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Civil War Roundtable was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phenow was the perfect person to start the group because he is so active in 
so many Civil War historical activities," said Kean, a Civil War buff for about 
45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Phenow, 39, is perhaps best known in the Los Angeles area for his miniatures, 
which are used to recreate Civil War battles at the Drum Barracks Civil War 
Museum in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember getting interested in the war when I was about 10 years old," 
Phenow remembers. "Life magazine, in about 1962, ran some reconstruction 
pictures of battles and I was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 1982, when I was living in San Diego, I had joined a group called the 
Second Virginia Regiment that held re-enactment battles with other Civil War 
units at Big Oak Ranch in El Cajon," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 When he moved to Los Angeles in the mid-80s, he began re-enacting battles with 
friends using miniatures of soldiers he created. Phenow showed some of the 
miniatures to Marge O'Brien, the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum director in 
1990. Her enthusiasm over his skilled craftsmanship led to the Special Studies 
in Battles project that Phenow still heads at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do battle re-enactments for special groups, but the public is often 
welcome," said Phenow, a North Hollywood resident. "If people are interested, 
they can call the museum to find out when the next re-enactment will be." 
</P>
<P>
 He says everyone is welcome to join the Book Grinders group. "All you have to 
have is an interest in the Civil War." The next meeting is at 7 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Dunn, a Reseda resident and retired Gas. Co. employee, will be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn's interest in the Civil War started in a dentist's Hollywood office in 
the early 1950s when he was nervously leafing through magazines trying to take 
his mind off the dreaded drill. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in a now-forgotten periodical caught his eye and suspended dread 
for a while as he read that many of the most learned scholars in Britain's 
esteemed universities of Cambridge and Oxford considered the speeches of 
Abraham Lincoln to be some of the finest prose ever written in the English 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "That article led me to start reading Lincoln's words and then to want to 
learn more about the Civil War, Lincoln's biggest challenge," said Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 He even named one of his sons Lawrence Lincoln Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn says his studies have led him to many encounters, one of the most 
interesting with a man he met at the Lincoln Library in Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been sitting reading a treasured old book called "The Letters of a 
Confederate General," when I noticed a gentleman looking at me and the book," 
Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he was interested in looking at the book when I had finished, 
and he smiled and said that he would. He told me that he had come all the way 
from Cambridge, Mass., to see it," Dunn remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, over coffee, I learned that he was Samuel Eliot Morison." The utility 
company employee and Morison, a renowned naval historian and Harvard scholar, 
had a good talk, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn's wife Mary doesn't share the same passion, but she is the owner of some 
Civil War relics, including the dress sword and commission papers of her 
ancestor, Justin Turner, who fought for the Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, according to Dunn, was wounded in the battle of Gettysburg, and died 
on a troop train taking him back to his native New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Another round-table enthusiast is aircraft parts buyer Bill Culver of Valley 
Village. In 1992, after inheriting some money, Culver spent several months 
touring about 40 Civil War battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a longtime Civil War buff like me, it was a dream of a lifetime," says 
Culver, whose travels took him through much of Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, 
Mississippi, the Carolinas and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most interesting trips was the Colonial Parkway which links many 
areas of American history including Williamsburg, Jamestown and Yorktown, where 
Cornwallis surrendered to the American troops." 
</P>
<P>
 He expects memories of that trip to stay with him for a lifetime, and shares 
brochures and pamphlets from the visit with round-table members. Culver says 
most of the group members are men, but women have begun to attend too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many of them are interested in learning more about their genealogy. 
They're looking for relatives who fought in the war," he says. Parks Event 
Offers Chance for Stardom 
</P>
<P>
 If your newest ambition is a part on television's "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," 
head out to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area on Sunday 
between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a drawing for just such an adventure at the "March for Parks, 
Head for the Hills" event sponsored by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who attends will have a chance to win the part by way of a drawing, 
said Jean Bray of the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 If you just want to take a walk, ride a pony, look at the exhibits or listen 
to the stories of Charlie Cook, a chief of the Chumash, that's all right too, 
Bray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will pay for bus transportation and on-site naturalist programs for 
inner city and local children. The event will be held at Paramount Ranch, where 
the television show is taped. Artist to Reveal the 'Nature of Naval Uniform' 
</P>
<P>
 We often get news releases from CalArts in Valencia about its much-lauded 
productions that include all kinds of arts and artworks. But a recent release 
about Rob Calentine's Saturday production called "Suiting a Sailor" has us in 
the head-scratching mode. 
</P>
<P>
 It says that "Calentine's work will unveil the absolute truth about the 
homoerotic nature of the naval uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be unveiled at 8 p.m. at the Hollywood Moguls Live Theatre-Gallery, 
should you be inclined to check it out. Study Tour to Follow Tracks of Wild 
Horses  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Wechsler, an associate instructor of animal sciences at Pierce College and 
a driving force behind the school's annual rodeo, has come up with a new way to 
entice people to saddle up. 
</P>
<P>
 Wechsler will be leading a four-day UCLA Extension study tour tracking wild 
horses in the Pizona area of Inyo National Forest beginning June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will ride out by horseback from base camp each day to observe, 
photograph and examine the social behavior of mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sissies need not apply. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wechsler, the program is limited to 20 participants who will 
enjoy up to six hours of riding each day from the Rock Creek Pack Station in 
Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 The adventure costs $545, which includes tuition, instruction, horses, tack, 
tents and meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring your own chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour coordinator is Herbert London, who owns the Bishop pack station. 
London has been active in training government personnel for wilderness packing 
situations. He says early June is an ideal time to track mustangs. "We're apt 
to see foals at this time, anywhere from one day old on up." Overheard

ANN CONWAY: CHARITIES FEAR POSSIBLE 'GO' ORDER FOR TACO BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County society is holding its breath: Will Taco Bell CEO John Martin 
take his Irvine-based company to Texas and thereby take with him the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars the corporation annually generates on behalf of local 
charities? 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks ago we were this close to announcing a move to Texas," Martin said 
on Friday in the Turtle Rock home he shares with his girlfriend, Stefanie 
Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then Gov. Pete Wilson became very much involved (in trying to keep the 
company here) and (Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown, too. Big time. And 
developers Don Bren and Don Koll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are finally recognizing that there will be a big hole in this 
community -- houses on the market, for example -- if we leave." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Taco Bell Corp. has made a donation of $500,000 to the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, endowed a $500,000 chair at UCI's Graduate 
School of Management and made a commitment to raise $500,000 on behalf of Hoag 
Hospital's new emergency care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, Martin helped Taco Bell Corp. raise upward of $150,000 on 
behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. of Orange County. During the festivities 
at the Hyatt Regency in Irvine, Martin was presented with MDA's prestigious 
Gift of Hope Award. 
</P>
<P>
 If Taco Bell decides to leave Irvine for Dallas or Ft. Worth (Martin will 
announce his decision in one week), the company will remain in Orange County 
for 2 1/2 years. "And while we are still here, we will continue to be an active 
part of the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it will have to wind down. What will happen is, we will have to rev up in 
Texas, which will be our new home. We will need to give back to the community 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin doesn't want to leave the Golden State. "My druthers would be to stay 
in California. We are a California company; we were born here 32 years ago. 
There's something about the West Coast -- a creative energy, the access to the 
Pacific Rim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Texas is beckoning with arms open so wide that Martin is torn. "Texas is 
the most aggressive state I've ever seen in terms of giving tax incentives, 
training incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told Gov. Wilson, 'You've got to understand. This is not about Taco Bell 
trying to squeeze blood out of California or Orange County. I have an offer on 
the table today from (Gov.) Ann Richards of Texas that is millions of dollars 
better than the best you guys can do. 
</P>
<P>
 And in addition to that, they love business.'  
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, it comes down to a decision I have to make . . . a tough 
decision," he said. "The reality is that Southern California is never going to 
be able to match the land cost of doing business in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martin, who says he works 80-hour weeks, traveling 50% of the time, 
will continue to use his hilltop Irvine digs as an escape from his 
pressure-cooker career. (Since joining Pepsico in 1983, he has taken Taco Bell 
from a regional Mexican food chain with 1,500 outlets and $500 million in sales 
to an international business with 10,000 points of access and sales of $3.9 
billion. His goal: "To be the ultimate feeder -- be in 250,000 places in 10 
years.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I would keep this house if we went to Dallas, " he said. "My wonderful 
13-year-old daughter lives close by. I would want a grounding point." 
</P>
<P>
 When Martin leads you through his newly renovated, 27-year-old home, he is 
careful to point out its rounded architectural edges. "Nothing comes to a point 
here; everything is rounded. It's supposed to be some great spiritual thing. I 
don't know if it's true or not." 
</P>
<P>
 What is true for Martin, 48, who has been twice married and twice divorced, is 
the special relationship he shares with Mayer, 28, a blue-eyed brunette he met 
two years ago when she was a hostess at Bistro 201 restaurant in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very nice, very respectful. And she has a heart of gold," Martin said, 
sending a shy smile Mayer's way. "We're both very patient people. That's why it 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayer: "We get along well because he is very caring. He cares about my 
feelings. He has respect for people in general. You can tell it comes from his 
heart. There are not a lot of men out there who are real nice, who understand 
and care about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin calls their friendship the most unique relationship he has ever 
experienced. "We spend enormous amounts of time together. We go out of our way 
to spend time together. With the pace we have, the chance for friction is 
enormous, but it's not there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine why anybody, with the schedule I've got, the stress, would 
want to be with me. She's a young lady with a future. She could do anything she 
wants. Yet she's signed up for something that's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer can't imagine life without Martin. "I've thought about it. I'm young. I 
could be doing other things right now, like pursuing a career. But I feel I 
want to do this, support him. It makes me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For down-time, Mayer and Martin ride the Harley he parks in the garage next to 
his 600SL Mercedes ("We love Sunday rides down the coast," he said); sample the 
fine wines he keeps in a tiny cellar ("See this one? It was bottled in 1962, 
the year Taco Bell was born"); and dine out several nights a week at favorite 
restaurants that include Gustaf Anders, Five Feet, Antonello, Pascal and Trees 
("A quiet dinner together -- that's our favorite thing to do," he said). 
</P>
<P>
 And Taco Bell, of course. "She's the Taco Bell Queen," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to always go there for my birthday dinners with my pals," said Mayer. 
"And I still could eat there every day. I always order a taco and a bean 
burrito with no onions." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, their May-December romance raises eyebrows on the social 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't mind. "I don't even pay attention to it very much," Mayer said. 
"When people see that we're really happy, it kind of goes away. I really don't 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Martin: "It tends to be the more insecure women who react that way -- 
women who have been divorced or separated. I can tell they are looking at us 
and saying, 'Well, there's no doubt in my mind that she, somehow, came between 
him and his wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not true. "I was divorced years before I met Stefanie," he said.

CULTURE WATCH; A VIDEO TRILOGY FOR LIFE WITH HIV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first of a planned trilogy of instructional videos for people with HIV is 
out from Lifeforce, a local nonprofit organization founded to help people with 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tape, available for $39.95, focuses on diet and nutrition, said 
Lifeforce Director Steve Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
 A second video will explore holistic therapies and a third will look at 
various stress reduction techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The diet video, titled "The HIV+ Survival Guide: Diet for Living in the Age of 
AIDS," does not endorse a particular protocol but deals with specific concerns 
of HIV-infected individuals, such as chronic fatigue, yeast infection and 
malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel said proceeds from the video sales will fund a free nutritional 
lecture series produced by Lifeforce. 
</P>
<P>
 The video can be purchased by calling (800) 788-8823. SHARI ROAN

BEAUTY AMID BLOODSHED; FOR THE WOMEN OF SARAJEVO, TRYING TO LOOK THEIR BEST IS 
ONE WAY OF DEFYING THE TRAGEDY AROUND THEM -- AND OF CLINGING TO SOME NORMALCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amra Zulfikarpasic's sequined cocktail dress glistens as the late afternoon 
sunshine passes through windows sheathed in plastic, the only visible reminder 
that a war is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother's wedding reception is warming under the influence of rakija 
(homemade brandy), and guests in pressed white shirts and little black dresses 
over lace stockings indulge in tea cakes baked with ingredients scrounged from 
humanitarian aid packages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surreal elegance defies the reality of survival in a city where 
running water has been an intermittent luxury; where electricity is supplied 
sporadically; where simply being clean entails hauling water jugs from central 
pumping points in the city and, until only the last few weeks of a cease-fire, 
exposing oneself to shelling and snipers. 
</P>
<P>
 During nearly two years of war, appearing elegant has been a sub-battle of the 
cosmopolitan women of Sarajevo -- a move of personal defiance against the often 
baffling powers that surround their lives. Here, women cling to the wish to 
look their best, groping for normalcy in a city pocked by mortar fire and 
constrained by an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 But because not all of war's battles are fought with guns, Zulfikarpasic and 
other women in Sarajevo have sought a more personal expression of their resolve 
to remain free. The 47-year-old graphic designer says that it has been her own 
fight within Sarajevo's war to look as she chooses, rather than have 
circumstances dictate her appearance: 
</P>
<P>
 "It always meant a lot when you saw people on the street, because it meant 
they were alive, that they hadn't left the city. So, I always wanted to be 
clean. I didn't want to seem dirty. I always felt bad when I ran into someone 
who had really deteriorated." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other women trapped within the siege, Zulfikarpasic has snitched items 
from humanitarian aid packages to create the staples of her daily regimen. She 
has combined yeast and cooking oil with water to make face masks; other women 
just used the oil straight as a moisturizer. Some women have sold their food 
allotments to buy items on the black market, although a single tube of mascara 
can cost more than five times the average monthly salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have glued together slivers of old emery boards to eliminate any waste, 
and have begged from families of those who have left the city for creams and 
other priceless items that might have been left behind. Some have substituted 
beer for hair mousse, while others have mixed precious supplies of sugar with 
water in place of hair spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Most women, including Vesna Musovic, draw on supplies purchased before the 
war, desperately clinging to old routines. Women received haircuts while shells 
fell, and paint their nails in startling shades of red and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The affinity for style and fashion displayed by the women of Sarajevo comes in 
stark contrast to the babushka-clad women of Bosnia's hinterlands, who also 
have suffered enormously during the war and whose pictures have graced the 
front pages of newspapers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But Musovic, 40, a switchboard operator, notes that the urbane Sarajevans have 
much in common with women in the West in terms of style and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, particularly during the city's first lasting cease-fire, women in 
business suits teeter in high heels along the shell-pocked sidewalks of their 
city, drawing distinctions between past and present as they stroll beside the 
brittle facades of buildings destroyed by bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just Muslims that were killed here. It was the death of everything 
beautiful," Musovic says, explaining daily efforts to keep up her appearance. 
"Beauty is the only thing that gives you hope to go on. Times are bad. There's 
a war on. It's better, in times like this, to try to hold on to beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Musovic, who lost an arm two years ago when a shell slammed into a crowd 
waiting for a bus, says working on her appearance has been part of her personal 
struggle to move beyond the injury. She has handled the absence of running 
water, for example, by learning to balance a canister between her knees, 
pouring the water onto her hand and splashing it up into her face. Although it 
takes her longer than it once did, she still never goes to her job without 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't give up," she says. "Now, in a time of war, this is 
something you really understand. . . . Women used to be beautiful here. But to 
me, they seem more beautiful than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many have survived by clutching the little indulgences of the past; some women 
have even insisted on applying lipstick before racing off to the bomb cellars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe owner Ermina Music, 34, says she has refused to walk out the door without 
a few spritzes of Magie Noire or whatever else she had around: "If nothing 
else, I had to have my perfume. Even when everyone was going to the shelter. I 
wanted (others) to smell the trail of my perfume on the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the basics of daily hygiene have dominated. Zulfikarpasic can tell you 
just how many liters of water it takes for a bath; she's been carrying that 
water in huge plastic jugs, uphill and up stairs to her family's flat in 
Sarajevo's old town. 
</P>
<P>
 So precious were those five requisite liters that she would race outside in 
the middle of the night if it began to rain, collecting water to wash her hair. 
And when there was no rain, she could only sprint to central water-pumping 
stations, literally risking death, to avoid looking disheveled at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to leave the impression of a woman people would have faith in," she 
says. "I didn't want anyone to feel sorry for me." 
</P>
<P>
 While looking good has helped some women keep their spirits, at times the 
challenge of sheer physical survival must prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Casually -- as easily as mentioning that she would rather go hungry than give 
up her face cream -- Zulfikarpasic says that one morning last winter, she 
burned all her shoes except the ones she now wears and a spare pair. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother used the heat to bake bread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoes burn really well," she says. "People die in a few seconds when a shell 
falls. Why would I feel sad over a few shoes?"

A RABBIT'S FEAT; AFTER 50 YEARS, 'PAT THE BUNNY' REMAINS A DEVELOPMENTAL 
TOUCHSTONE FOR MILLIONS OF BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a lot of new parents, the first sign of intelligent life comes when the 
baby -- heretofore a drooling blob -- lifts its teeny-weeny finger and lightly 
touches a furry bunny. (As in: "Judy can pat the bunny. Now you pat the 
bunny.") 
</P>
<P>
 Yesssssss! Mom and Dad quietly cheer. Little Precious can do something other 
than eat, poop and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if Little Precious doesn't? More than a few parents have panicked 
after their 10th suggestion to "Pat the damn bunny!" goes unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it too early to hire a tutor for bunny patting? 
</P>
<P>
 This may seem neurotic, but this isn't just any book. After more than 50 years 
in print, "Pat the Bunny" continues to be an important development touchstone, 
so to speak, that babies are people too. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole generations have cooed as they imitated characters Paul and Judy lifting 
a piece of blue cloth in a game of peekaboo, peering into a miniature mirror, 
touching Daddy's scratchy beard (actually a piece of sandpaper) and putting a 
finger through Mommy's (cardboard) ring.  
</P>
<P>
 With 200,024 copies sold last year, "Pat the Bunny" remains a bestseller -- 
second only in all-time sales to "The Tale of Peter Rabbit." Which may have 
philosophers pondering: What's with rabbits? But really, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
 According to a press release from Golden Books, which publishes the perennial 
"Pat," 2,266 yards of white acrylic fur for the bunny -- enough fur to coat and 
warm about 1 1/4 miles of the Alaskan landscape -- is used every year in "Pat 
the Bunny" books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat the Bunny" has been such a huge success that it has inspired not only 
imitators but a whole "pat" genre of touch-and-feel books. 
</P>
<P>
 The style has been so enduringly popular that '90s publicists have been know 
to refer to the late Dorothy Kunhardt, author of "Pat the Bunny," as the 
originator of the "interactive children's book." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunhardt, who died in 1979, certainly would have gotten a laugh out of that 
one, says her daughter, Edith Kunhardt, author of "Pat the Cat," "Pat the 
Puppy" and 60 other non-pat children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The genius of 'Pat the Bunny' is that it allows babies to do what they are 
just discovering they can do -- touch, smell, look," says Kunhardt, 57. "I'm 
not sure it's any more complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Kunhardt began writing children's books to support her family after 
her husband lost his job during the Depression. Her first big hit was 1934's 
"Junket Is Nice," with crazy drawings of people guessing what an old man was 
eating out of a bowl. It sold a million copies in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, Kunhardt wrote a book for her baby Edith, the youngest of her four 
children. She took paper and pencils and drew the simple figures of Paul and 
Judy and the itinerant bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first edition, Judy could make her doll's ball squeak; in the second 
edition, Judy could shake Mommy's button box ("Rattle rattle go the buttons"). 
By the third edition, the squeaker and the buttons were gone and the mirror and 
flowers had appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, Edith Kunhardt, who grew up 
in New Jersey, talked about the enormous effort her mother put into 
researching, drawing and writing her books. In particular, she recalled the 
research for a now out-of-print book, "Billy the Barber." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember she went visiting a barber school where students were learning by 
shaving balloons," Kunhardt says. "If the balloon popped, they failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunhardt had no intention of becoming an author herself -- although she was 
married until 1971 to the son of Lavina Davis, a well-known children's book 
writer and author of "Hobbyhorse Hill." After her divorce, Kunhardt worked as 
an editor at Golden Books.  
</P>
<P>
 "I considered Mother the writer," she says. "I was the editor." 
</P>
<P>
 But after her mother died, Kunhardt took up the craft and her mother's passion 
for research. She tells delightful stories of getting up at 3 a.m. to follow a 
milkman on his route and of spending time with a family living on a Long Island 
farm for "I Want to Be a Farmer." 
</P>
<P>
 After writing 20 books for different publishers, Golden Books approached her 
in 1984 to write a sequel to "Pat the Bunny." At first, she resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt 'Pat the Bunny' should stand on its own," she says. "But then I came 
to feel that there was a reason to publish a companion. It would enhance rather 
than compete if it was by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had never illustrated a book, she decided to give it a try for 
her mother's legacy. In fact, Martha and Neddy of "Pat the Cat," who do such 
modern things as go to the ATM with their parents and scratch and sniff ginger 
snaps, look like urbane cousins of Paul and Judy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Kunhardt wrote "Pat the Puppy," which is not only updated, it's 
downright politically proper: Grandpa makes brownies, Grandma jogs, and Tom and 
Sarah are invited to help Grandma unfasten her Velcro sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do that to be politically correct," Kunhardt says. "But I also 
didn't want Grandma to be baking brownies." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of displaying expensive coffee-table books in her living room, 
Kunhardt has artfully laid out all her "Pat" books, as well as a hardback about 
Abe Lincoln, a Kunhardt obsession. Kunhardt's grandfather owned one of the 
largest collections of Lincoln photographs; her mother was a Lincoln scholar, 
and her brother, Philip, a former managing editor of Life magazine, wrote a 
television series with his son about the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, following the death of her son, Neddy (he died of a bacterial 
infection at age 27), Edith Kunhardt briefly put aside her career in children's 
literature. Although she admits that her best tribute to her son was naming one 
of the characters "Neddy" in "Pat the Cat," she is also writing an 
inspirational book about his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since writing "Pat the Puppy" last year, Kunhardt doesn't rule out taking the 
"Pat" legacy into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing she does rule out -- vehemently -- is the notion that the popularity 
of her mother's classic has nothing to do with its compelling story line or 
appearance.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps so many copies are sold because families buy multiple copies? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few facts "Pat the Bunny" publicists don't supply is the average 
number of copies owned by the average family or, better yet, the statistical 
evidence of what is destroyed first: the peekaboo flap or Judy's book, as in: 
"Judy can read her book. Now you read Judy's book." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that people buy two or three copies," Kunhardt says. "I don't like 
to think of people pulling them apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, perhaps. But Little Precious isn't quite "people" just yet.

LOCAL HERO / GRAND BUSH: A REAL-LIFE DRAMA; HIS SPEEDY RESCUE OF A MAN SHOT AND 
LEFT BLEEDING IN THE STREET EARNS AN ACTOR CREDIT FOR SAVING A LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Grand Bush, an actor frequently seen in film and on television, 
came to the aid of accountant Robert Nimmons after he was critically wounded in 
a racially motivated shooting. For saving Nimmons' life by rushing him to the 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center emergency room, Bush will be honored with the 
district attorney office's Courageous Citizen's Award on April 22.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's returned the fire of desperate criminals and been showered with police 
bullets -- it's all in a day's work for a film and TV actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Bush has seen action in countless character roles, such as the detective 
Little Johnson in "Die Hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But no screen role could have prepared him for the drama that unfolded on the 
upscale residential streets of Los Angeles' Cathay Cirle. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny St. Patrick's Day last year, Robert Nimmons took a lnch-hour stroll 
from Wilshire south toward Cathay Circle Park. He could not have known that 
Darryl Arnold was stalking him. Arnold would later tell police we hoped to 
start a race war by shooting a white person. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush was returning from an interview, accompanied by his friend, Terri Ross. 
He drove Ross' car south on Crescent Heights Boulevard. He could not have known 
that just past the Wilshire commercial stretch, he would see Nimmons, seconds 
after he had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Arnold) shot me from behind. I turned around and saw him -- eight, 10 feet 
away, still pointing this gun, a smile on his face," Nimmons recalls. "I 
staggered across the street, onto the median. I was bleeding. Cars continued 
past until Grand Bush came." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush caught sight of Arnold walking away, gun still at his side. Bush wheeled 
the car around and pulled to the median. "Get in, man!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I just piled into the back of his car," Nimmons recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush worried that the gunman might turn to see the rescue, and "I didn't know 
if he would fire on us." 
</P>
<P>
 As the trio headed for 3rd Street, Bush asked, "Are you all right?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Nimmons responded with a weak, "I guess so," Bush pulled out, dodging 
oncoming traffic and red lights on the way to the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush followed Nimmons inside and watched. "They were tearing his clothes off. 
I waited to see that he was all right and, a few days later, Terri and I 
visited him in the hospital." Nimmons would never had made it without the 
speedy rescue, a doctor said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimmons, a distinguished, gray-at-the-temples father of two, would come to 
consider Bush, a solidly built bachelor with an easy smile, a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men had put the incident behind them until this January, when Arnold 
pleaded no contest to attempted murder and a civil-rights charge of committing 
a hate crime, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. But in Arnold's rambling 
confession and statement, the two saw signs of hope. Arnold wrote, "I realized 
I care a great deal about every race of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush recalls Nimmons saying: "I'd like to see this guy rehabilitated. The 
justice system doesn't make rehabilitation a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush has felt that way since the late 1980s, when he worked as a counselor at 
a juvenile offenders camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were so hungry for something to inspire them. I wondered: What'll 
they do when they get out -- couldn't they take a car thief and teach him auto 
repair?" 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to do his part, Bush invited fellow actors to perform for the 
youngsters. But the offer of a recurring role on TV's "The Young and the 
Restless" pushed his counseling work into the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, a teen-ager approached him at a film audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember you actors at the camp," he recalls her saying. "When I got out, I 
told my mom I wanted to be an actor." The teen-ager, auditioning for a role, 
told him that he had been the key to her rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got goose bumps," Bush recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the camp experience, "I've addressed assemblies at a dozen Los Angeles 
schools," Bush says. "I don't talk about the shooting incident; my platform is 
fine arts and education. If one wants to become an actor, one must have an 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the benefits of education wasn't enough for Bush, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just before the shooting incident, (screenwriter) Shane Salerno and I had 
begun writing a script critical of the lack of criminal rehabilitation, 'The 
Darkness and the Light.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Oddly, I was researching the criminal justice system when I got caught in the 
middle of that shooting incident and met Bob." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy District Atty. Rhonda Saunders nominated Bush and Ross for the county's 
Courageous Citizen's Award, given to those who thwart a crime, stop a criminal 
or aid a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 What about all those other passersby who didn't stop to help? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't resent the people driving by," Nimmons says. "One emerged from the 
pack, a good Samaritan. A black man shot me; a black man rescued me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush concludes: "I never considered myself a hero, but if no one else does 
something, I will . In this case, no one else (did)." 
</P>

ROYALTY STARS AS OLD ALLIES REUNITE; CHARITY: PRINCE ANDREW JOINS HONOREE BOB 
HOPE IN BEVERLY HILLS AT A BENEFIT FOR THE AMERICAN AIR MUSEUM IN BRITAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All was quiet on the Western Front (read Beverly Hills) Thursday night as old 
allies came together to remember those who fought the good fight back in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton Heston and Bob Hope were joined by His Royal Highness Prince Andrew, 
Duke of York, at a benefit party for the American Air Museum in Britain, held 
at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Andrew mingled graciously with movie stars, war veterans and aviation 
enthusiasts at a pre-dinner VIP reception. It appeared that the shrewd security 
measure of the day was to pepper the crowd with British Secret Service agents 
who looked exactly like the prince, a move that happily made for a handsome and 
dashing affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the evening, however, was more on military glory than on the 
sartorial kind. As Heston pointed out in his address, Andrew was "the youngest 
person in the room to have seen combat." (He may also have been the youngest 
person in the room period, but no matter.) 
</P>
<P>
 The prince introduced himself to the dinner crowd of 300, who paid between 
$500 and $1,000 to attend, "as an aviator who has seen, felt and smelt the fear 
and anxiety of combat." 
</P>
<P>
 He praised the longstanding ties between the United States and Britain, 
saying: "Our two nations stood hand in hand for the purpose of destroying the 
Nazi domination of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Los Angeles Rams and co-chairperson of the 
Dinner Committee, best expressed the purpose of the museum: "We had the team 
over there and took the boys out to visit the RAF bases. Walking into the 
buildings we saw the pilots' signatures on the walls. The emotion of it, when 
you see movies you think these things never happen, but seeing the planes it 
was brought home to me that it really did." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is scheduled for completion in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the 
end of World War II, and will house a dozen vintage American fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will serve as a memorial to those half a million American troops who 
served in Britain," said Lord Bramwell, chairman of Britain's National Museum 
of Conflict in Duxford, where the 7.5 million museum will be built. "It's a 
stunning building, designed by Sir Norman Foster." Indeed, even Andrew's elder 
brother, the architecture critic, must be pleased with this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening, which raised close to $250,000, concluded with the unveiling of a 
bust of Gen. James Doolittle, followed by a tribute to Hope that included clips 
from his 50 years of USO performances and a letter of congratulations from 
President Clinton, as well as some off-the-cuff gems from the honoree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get over there as soon as they get (those old planes) all there," 
Hope wisecracked, "because I want to look under the seats. I might have dropped 
a lot of things in there."

GETTING FUNNY WITH 'PAT THE BUNNY' 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are even sendups of the "Pat" books, such as "Pat the Beastie" with its 
green-furred monster and its own Paul and Judy, who look and act like members 
of the Addams family -- as in: "Judy pulls Beastie's fur. Will you pull 
Beastie's fur?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, these books are not written for Little Precious. And "Pat the 
Beastie" says as much. On the back flap is the warning: "Not suitable for 
children under 3 -- contains small parts." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sendups such as "Pat the Beastie," which sold a successful 75,002 
copies last year, and "Pat the Stimpy," an offshoot of Nickelodeon's animated 
cult cartoon "Ren and Stimpy," and "Pat the Yuppie" seem to be written for 
parents or, at least, much older kids. But it's hard to believe that even a 
3-year-old would want to "touch my hairball" or "lick the Gritty Kitty Litter" 
or "poke Beastie's worm boogers." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess imitation is the greatest form of flattery," Edith Kunhardt says.

MENENDEZ LAWYERS SEEK A HALT TO TV FILMS; BLACKOUT: ATTORNEYS WANT TO PREVENT A 
SCREENING IN L.A. COUNTY, FEARING JURY BIAS. LEGAL PRECEDENTS MAKE EFFORT 
UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED. 
</P>

<P>
 Attorneys for the Menendez brothers, hoping to ensure a fair retrial for their 
clients, are making a desperate effort to prevent Los Angeles residents from 
seeing a two-hour television movie about the sensational shotgun killings of 
Jose and Kitty Menendez that Fox plans to air next Monday night. The lawyers 
are even more up in arms over a four-hour miniseries on the subject that CBS 
has scheduled in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez's new public defenders are expected to file an injunction in 
federal district court today to prevent the Fox Broadcasting Co. from airing 
"Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Mendendez Murders" in Los 
Angeles County, where Lyle and Erik Menendez will stand trial again for the 
1989 murders of their Beverly Hills parents. In January, mistrials were 
declared because separate juries for each brother could not agree on verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy public defenders Terri Towery and William D. Weiss -- along with Leslie 
H. Abramson, attorney for Erik Menendez -- fear their clients will suffer 
irreparable harm when potential jurors for the retrial see "Honor Thy Father 
and Mother," which they perceive to be a pro-prosecution docudrama loaded with 
inaccuracies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will seek to show that the falsities in the script will damage the 
potential jury pool and so taint it that we will not be able to get a fair 
trial," said Towery on Friday. She intends to file a similar injunction next 
month against the CBS miniseries, "Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills," 
starring Edward James Olmos and Beverly D'Angelo as the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers face legal precedents that show that any effort to block 
television broadcasts is unlikely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Mendendez attorneys sent a hand-delivered letter to Gary 
Hoffman, Fox's vice president of movies and miniseries, strenuously objecting 
to "Honor Thy Father and Mother" based on the second draft of a script they had 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox refused their request not to air the TV movie, citing numerous legal 
precedents involving prior restraint, when the media's First Amendment right to 
free speech was upheld over a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair 
trial. The last major decision occurred in 1987, when "Billionaire Boys Club" 
founder Joe Hunt failed to prevent NBC from airing a docudrama about his gang 
of wealthy thrillseekers when Hunt was appealing a murder conviction and 
awaiting trial in another murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal authorities acknowledge that TV projects torn from the headlines can be 
powerful in swaying public opinion, but have dealt with that. During jury 
selection for the first trial, the judge excluded the use of any jurors who had 
seen tabloid TV re-enactments of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer away they are from the actual trial date, the less likely there 
will be an impact" by the Fox and CBS docudramas, said Laurie Levenson, a 
Loyola Law School professor in Los Angeles. A Superior Court hearing Friday 
will determine when the Menendez retrials will take place -- probably at least 
a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, it means there really has to be a very close examination of the 
prospective jurors to determine what kind of exposure they have had to all 
types of pretrial publicity," Levenson said. "The movies just add to the burden 
that will be involved in getting a fair jury for the retrial." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pugsley, a professor of criminal law at Southwestern University School of 
Law in Los Angeles, said public opinion is colored by all coverage of the 
criminal proceedings -- including the trial itself, which was carried live each 
day like a soap opera on some broadcast stations and the cable channel Court 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugsley said the live court coverage enabled Abramson to polarize public 
opinion, which was weighing heavily against the brothers at the time, with a 
defense that wrapped Erik Menendez in the "mantle of sexually abused children 
everywhere." He also noted that Abramson herself made the rounds on network 
news programs to publicize her personal perspective after the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went on with what she called 'her' jurors, those who were on her side," 
Pugsley said. "Other times she went on with her newly adopted infant. During 
the course of the trial, she adopted a baby, and on some TV appearances she 
brought the baby, cuddling and cooing on the program. My only point is that the 
media has been a carrier of all messages, both sympathetic and antagonistic to 
the brothers' case." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Abramson calls Fox and CBS unconscionable for planning to broadcast an 
account of events that she perceives to be strongly biased against Lyle and 
Erik Menendez, who could face the death penalty if they are convicted of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The power of these entertainment creeps to completely position the public 
view when these boys' lives are depending on public opinion is just appalling," 
Abramson said. "If they stuck with public record, at least they could produce 
an unbiased account and let the public decide. But they're not willing to do 
that. They're insisting on a vicious fictionalization of everything that 
bolsters the prosecution case -- nothing else exists. There's no favorable 
fictionalization of the defense and the defendants." 
</P>
<P>
 The Menendez attorneys attack "Honor Thy Father and Mother," for example, for 
portraying Jose and Kitty Menendez sitting on the couch eating blueberries and 
ice cream at the time they were shot, although a prosecution expert 
acknowledged it would have been impossible for the couple to have suffered the 
wounds they did unless they were standing. The depiction hurts the Menendez 
brothers' position that they acted in self-defense, their attorneys claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers of both docudramas defend the objectivity and balance of their 
work, and point out that their projects dramatize examples of parental abuse 
the Menendez brothers say they suffered. The producers believe the defense 
attorneys have early versions of their scripts, which went through many 
revisions and then further changes during filming and editing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honor Thy Father and Mother" is based on the book "Blood Brothers" by Los 
Angeles Times reporter John Johnson and former Times reporter Ronald Soble, who 
has said in interviews that he believes the brothers are guilty of murder. But 
Hoffman at Fox said the public record was the true measuring stick for the 
movie, which dramatizes the highlights of the trial and some key points in the 
lives of the family that led the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV movie began shooting in January when the trial was still going on. "So 
the story had to be jury proof," Hoffman explained. "We had an ongoing trial. I 
did not want to be in a position of advocating something, a viewpoint, which 
may not be in agreement with the jury. In other words, if we took a position 
that the boys deserve to be convicted of murder, and the jury deadlocked, I 
didn't want to be involved with a movie that was rewriting history." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Moran, Court TV's on-site reporter for the Menendez trial, will host a 
commentary and critique of "Honor Thy Father and Mother" tonight on Court TV, 
including a comparative analysis of fictional and authentic trial footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty fair movie," said Moran, who has seen an early 
videotape of the film, which Hoffman says is slightly different than the final 
version. "But at crucial points, where a choice had to be made over contested 
evidence -- when the prosecution and the defense had differing opinions -- the 
movie consistently chooses to take the prosecution's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, meanwhile, has just finished its miniseries based on the contributions of 
Dominick Dunne, who did some scathing reporting for Vanity Fair, and the story 
of Judalon Smyth, the former lover of the Beverly Hills psychologist to whom 
Erik Menendez confessed the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Braun, producer of the CBS program, does not hide his feelings about the 
killings. "My belief is they're guilty of murder in the first degree," he said. 
But he added, "I would like to believe that our miniseries takes an objective 
point of view. We tried to objectify it by sticking to public record, court 
record and police record." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky was concerned when the 
trials resulted in two hung juries, and he even considered holding the 
miniseries back. "But ultimately everything has already gone public," Braun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Killing in Beverly Hills," scheduled to air May 24 and 25 on CBS, did 
revise its ending as a result of the hung juries by going behind closed doors 
and fictionalizing jury deliberations. "This country is torn -- there's a lot 
of people who feel a great deal of sympathy for the brothers," Braun said. "The 
two juries were split evenly. They are a sort of microcosm of America, or a 
Greek chorus, if you will. So we go in and see the struggle that 24 angry 
Americans are having, trying desperately to do the right thing."

THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT 'LIES': LATE AND OVER BUDGET; MOVIES: 'IF THIS MOVIE IS 
AS BIG AS WE THINK IT IS, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHEN IN THE SUMMER IT 
OPENS?' FOX EXECUTIVE SAYS OF FILM THAT RETEAMS CAMERON, SCHWARZENEGGER.

<P>
 Late Friday afternoon it became clear that, after an intensive week in the 
editing room, director James Cameron would not be delivering his megabudgeted 
"True Lies" in time for 20th Century Fox's intended July 1 release date. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Fox has had to push back the $100-million Arnold Schwarzenegger 
action adventure -- the linchpin of its summer schedule -- to July 15 and to 
reshuffle the rest of its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby's Day Out," written and produced by John Hughes, will replace "True 
Lies" as Fox's July 4 holiday weekend release. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron and Fox insist that all talk of a specific release date on "True Lies" 
had been tentative and that the two-week postponement will have a negligible 
impact on the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this movie is as big as we think it is, what difference does it make when 
in the summer it opens?" asks Tom Sherak, Fox senior executive vice president, 
citing the case of "The Fugitive," which opened last August and eventually 
grossed more than $180 million in the United States and Canada alone. Still, 
the move intensifies the buzz on a movie already under the microscope. "True 
Lies" -- which reteams the "Terminator 2" duo of Cameron and Schwarzenegger -- 
is the superstar's first outing since last summer's "Last Action Hero" debacle. 
No one but the crew, a few Fox executives and some pals of Cameron have seen 
any footage. And by the studio's admission, it is Fox's costliest project yet 
released under the 17-month reign of chairman Peter Chernin. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, for that matter, is among the costliest in film history, and added 
post-production time required to complete the picture will bloat the budget 
millions of dollars more. Though Fox claims that the estimated $100 
million-plus production cost is inflated, Chernin admits that, with at least 
$25 million for a marketing campaign, the studio has a lot on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he maintains, the fate of "True Lies" won't make or break the studio. 
"Coming off 'Mrs. Doubtfire,' the No. 2 movie of last year, the studio is 
incredibly strong," he says. "The fortunes of Fox aren't riding on any one 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, which is the first to be delivered by Cameron's Lightstorm 
Entertainment since the director signed a deal with Fox two years ago, tells 
the story of a top-secret government agent (Schwarzenegger) trying to save his 
country and hold on to his wife (Jamie Lee Curtis). 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron is said to have received between $6 million and $7 million for 
writing, producing and directing the film, which originally had been budgeted 
at $60 million but greenlit at about $10 million more. When the budget swelled 
into the $70-million range, however, Cameron reportedly kicked back a portion 
of his fee. Schwarzenegger, for his part, pulled in $15 million against 15% of 
the gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, which has all domestic rights plus France and Switzerland, put up the 
lion's share of the budget, and sources estimate the studio's exposure on the 
movie may be as much as $60 million-$70 million. Universal Pictures kicked in 
approximately 30% of a capped budget of about $60 million in exchange for the 
rest of the foreign rights with the exception of Japan, Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Cameron's contribution, Fox was responsible for all overages on the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film will need to gross $100 million (domestically) for the studio to 
break even," says one industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the original Lightstorm deal, the studio was only 
responsible for a portion of the financing, with the balance to come from 
Cameron's foreign partners. When Lightstorm failed to secure the necessary 
funding last year, Fox became the primary financier. In exchange for putting up 
more capital, Fox not only received more worldwide distribution rights to "True 
Lies" but additional Cameron films. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two to be produced by Cameron, the first is "Strange Days," directed by 
Kathryn Bigelow and starring Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes, which goes 
before the cameras in six weeks. Cameron will also direct another film for Fox 
after completing "Spider-Man" for Carolco Pictures next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron, a noted perfectionist, started shooting "True Lies" last August and 
wrapped less than two weeks ago -- way behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we went over," admits Rae Sanchini, Lightstorm president and an 
executive producer of the film. "Most big films with this many moving pieces 
do. We had to transport a company of this size to six different cities and 
encountered a major earthquake while shooting in Van Nuys." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron, for that matter, is no stranger to chaotic post-production demands. 
His other $100-million movie, "Terminator 2," also went down to the wire and 
eventually grossed more than $500 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailers for "True Lies" are scheduled to appear in selected theaters soon and 
the final trailer will surface around Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, based on excellent word-of-mouth and obvious star power, the studio is 
convinced the movie will speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have Arnold and Cameron, that's all the hype you need," Sherak says.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE GHOST OF SERIES PAST IN '704 HAUSER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one will accuse "704 Hauser" of subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 Black college student Thurgood Marshall (Goodie) Cumberbatch wraps his white 
sweetheart, Cherlyn Markowitz, in his arms and asks: "Do we dispel the myth 
about black man and Jewish women or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of that "myth" is a bit gauzy. What is clear is that tonight's 
premiere of Norman Lear's latest CBS comedy series has attic smells. Unlike the 
often funny and appealing episodes that follow in this six-week trial run, it 
reeks of Archie Bunker's musty spirit, as if Lear were seeking to reinvent his 
greatest success as something fresh and startling in 1994 merely by changing 
its skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong opening, right series? Well, that's not entirely the case, for just as 
"All in the Family" did -- and succeeded wildly nevertheless -- "704 Hauser" 
stamps bigotry with a happy face that's undeserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Television remains a black hole (pun intended) when it comes to prime-time 
drama series built around black characters. When proposed to network 
decision-makers (who are inevitably white), such projects almost always sink 
from sight, never to resurface. Of course it's a race issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, paradoxically, prime time's landscape of black comedies is not only 
widening (thanks largely to Fox) but finally even diversifying. That means more 
depictions of upscale and middle-class blacks plus -- in contrast to the 
hip-hopping burlesque of some of the black comedies -- new meaty half-hours in 
Fox's bracing "South Central" and the heavily politicized "704 Hauser." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter title refers to a fictional address in working-class Queens. 
Located at 704 Hauser is the weathered old house where white-skinned, 
red-necked Archie once calmly spewed ignorance about blacks and other 
minorities on "All in the Family" in the 1970s. Instead of the Bunkers, though, 
the present occupants are black: auto mechanic Ernie Cumberbatch (John Amos), 
his caterer wife, Rose (Lynnie Godfrey), and their 23-year-old son, Goodie (T. 
E. Russell). Almost a resident -- although treated as an outcast by Ernie -- is 
Cherlyn (Maura Tierney). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to this mixed-race-and-religion courtship, the twist is that Ernie 
and churchgoing Rose are supposed to be liberal, Goodie conservative -- the 
very opposite of Archie's situation with his live-in liberal son-in-law, Mike 
Stivic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the irony should be obvious, "704 Hauser" delivers it with a 
sledgehammer, for who should visit the Cumberbatches tonight and stay for 
dinner -- trailing Archie anecdotes like bread crumbs -- but Mike's grown son, 
Joey (Casey Siemaszko). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ernie calls the white-liking Goodie an "Oreo," and Goodie calls 
Ernie a bigot. Ernie smirks: "Black man can't be a bigot, son." Goodie retorts: 
"Tell that to a Korean." A little inside joke for L.A. viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Much, much funnier is the second episode, which finds cash-strapped Ernie 
angering Rose when trying to qualify for a big tax exemption by naming himself 
a minister and his garage the Church of Eternal Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the episode ends awkwardly in seeking to elevate Rose's spirituality 
over Ernie's cynicism, it features Amos at his comic finest as a mock black 
preacher and demonstrates just how good "704 Hauser" can be when Ernie and Rose 
hold center stage. Amos and Godfrey really have it going. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Amos' first turn as patriarch of a sitcom family clinging 
desperately to the lower fringes of the middle class. But as the unemployed 
father in Lear's "Good Times," in the mid-1970s, he never showed the range that 
he does as Ernie Cumberbatch, executing rip-roaring physical comedy and quiet 
poignancy with equal craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos has some of his best dramatic moments later in the run, one when Ernie 
feels humiliated when Rose's high-achieving sister offers her a free trip to 
Paris that Ernie himself could never pay for, and later when he admonishes 
Goodie for doing something that deeply hurt him. Instead of outrage, it's 
devastation that you see on Ernie's face as he ends the episode ambivalently by 
kissing his son on the cheek and walking away. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's the home-front debates and name calling -- at times the series feels 
as much like CNN's "Crossfire" as a comedy -- that make the most noise, and are 
bound to generate the most controversy for "704 Hauser." That includes its 
dialogues about Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 In that regard, both Rose and Ernie are burdened by inconsistencies. For 
example, the same politically sophisticated and eloquent Rose who unleashes a 
passionate defense of Anita Hill in one episode innocently asks Cherlyn in 
another: "When you people go to temple and you don't pray to Jesus, what is it 
you do there?" 
</P>
<P>
 And calling Ernie liberal illustrates the meaninglessness of such labels. 
Ernie does ridicule conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. 
But he also repeatedly refers snidely to Cherlyn's Jewish last name, and her 
Jewishness is at least as much a target here as is her whiteness. Ernie's 
cracks about bagels and gefilte fish, in fact, have the tone of a watermelon 
reference in connection with blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would Cherlyn hang around and accept Ernie's insults, turning the other 
cheek with a graciousness that belies believability? The answer lies in the way 
the character of Ernie is written. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn early in the series that Cherlyn's own white parents have rejected 
Goodie because he's black. Having not met them, we can immediately assume the 
worst and color them racist. But Ernie we have met. And despite his 
narrow-mindedness in some areas, he remains somehow as likable as Archie Bunker 
-- yet another benign bigot whose essential decency softens the edges of 
prejudice in a way that blurs reality. 
</P>
<P>
 After drawing early criticism in some circles, Archie got away with it, 
ultimately becoming a seminal character in the history of television, and 
perhaps there's glory ahead for Ernie too. A crack here about Jews, a crack 
there about whites, glazed by laughter. Perhaps it's harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet you view "704 Hauser" with the same clashing emotions that you felt at 
times when watching "All in the Family," feeling a bit uneasy while laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 * "704 Hauser" airs at 8:30 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

'LETTICE' WAS DESIGNED TO BE SERVED SANS DRESSING; THEATER: PETER SHAFFER SAYS 
THE DIALOGUE OF HIS COMEDY, OPENING THIS WEEK AT SCR, IS MEANT TO MAKE 
AUDIENCES "SEE WITH THEIR EARS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Lettice Douffet in his 1987 comedy "Lettice & Lovage," Peter Shaffer 
never seems at a loss for words. But in a recent interview he worried about 
sounding glib, something that wouldn't bother her in the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discover what I mean as I write," the eminent British playwright said by 
phone from New York, where he lives half the year. "That can be both 
terrifically exciting and very dangerous, because when you look at your words 
later you wonder, 'Did I really mean that, or am I just making verbal 
patterns?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Playgoers will have a chance to make up their own minds when a revival of 
"Lettice & Lovage" opens Friday at South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured by his three best-known plays -- "Amadeus," "Equus" and "The Royal 
Hunt of the Sun" -- Shaffer needn't concern himself too much. Though some 
critics claim he fits high-flown ideas to middlebrow taste and therefore lacks 
profundity, a legion of admirers point to his rare talent for turning serious 
subjects to account on the commercial stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Royal Hunt" (1964) abandoned conventional naturalism for an epic style to 
evoke the 16th-Century subjugation of the Incas by Francisco Pizarro, the 
death-obsessed conqueror seeking immortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equus" (1973) explored the intersection of religion, mythology and psychiatry 
through its ritualistic dramatization of a youth's aberrant sexual awakening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amadeus" (1979) dealt with the relationship between man and deity -- a 
frequent theme for Shaffer -- in its tale of the 17th-Century composer Antonio 
Salieri, whose fame cannot compensate for the bitter recognition that God 
prefers the music of his rival, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere in his work is Shaffer's consummate theatricality and passion for 
language more evident than in the title role of "Lettice & Lovage," a character 
originally written for the British actress Maggie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettice is a middle-aged tour guide at a stately mansion with a history so 
uneventful that her canned lectures are putting listeners to sleep. Bored to 
tears herself, she begins to embroider the dull facts and soon is regaling tour 
groups with fantastic tales made of whole cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings her into conflict with Lotte Shoen of the Preservation Trust, 
which runs the place. Lotte is shocked by Lettice's flights of fancy, of 
course, and she calls Lettice on the carpet -- not unlike the historical 
preservationists who accused Shaffer of taking creative liberties in both 
"Amadeus" and "The Royal Hunt of the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 Lettice refuses to back down. She explains that "fantasy floods in where fact 
leaves a vacuum." She has adopted the credo of her late mother, a dauntless 
Shakespearean actress: "Language alone frees one. History gives one place." 
Lettice's motto, which could just as well be the playwright's, is: "Enlarge! 
Enliven! Enlighten!"  
</P>
<P>
 As though to underscore the point, Shaffer has made the play a delicious 
debate, among other things, between fabulist and factualist. And he has dressed 
it to the nines in comic charm. Both characters have reams of wonderfully 
literate dialogue, with the emotional Lettice given to compulsive Wildean 
bursts of wit and the intellectual Lotte to cooler Shavian eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the plays we see today are verbally undernourished," said 
Shaffer, a two-time Tony Award winner (for "Equus" and "Amadeus"). "It's not 
the amount of words they use. It's a different sort of malnutrition: They do 
not stimulate the communal imagination of the audience. Our function as 
playwrights to some extent is to make audiences see with their ears, because 
films make us see with our eyes much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer wrote "Lettice & Lovage" for Smith, a longtime friend, after she 
complained to him about a dearth of leading roles for middle-aged actresses in 
the British theater. She had appeared in three of his early one-act comedies -- 
"The Private Ear" and "The Public Eye" (1962) and "Black Comedy" (1965) -- but 
hadn't had a role in any plays of his since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the impression we were in a taxi, but we may have been at dinner," 
recalled Shaffer, who turns 68 next month and is this year's Oxford University 
visiting professor of contemporary drama, an endowed chair whose previous 
occupants include Stephen Sondheim and Alan Ayckbourn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said to me, 'What are you doing now? Are you writing one of those plays 
you write for men?' And I said, 'What do you mean?' 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Oh, you know what I mean! All of my contemporaries who are men are 
now starting on their Falstaffs, their Lears, their Macbeths. What is there for 
me? I've done Viola. I've done Rosalind. There's nothing left for me but 
freaks, the Lady Bracknells, that sort of thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have whined a bit or done something of the kind. But on the way home I 
thought, 'My God, she's right.' American actresses have Tennessee (Williams), 
who wrote glorious parts for women. Who do we have?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer didn't just write "Lettice & Lovage" to give an old friend a role. He 
wanted to vent his feelings about England's declining cultural heritage, 
particularly his anger at the architectural rape of London by developers and 
timid political conformists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I went back to London, it was more ugly year by year," he 
explained. "A lot was destroyed by the German bombs, but a great deal more has 
been destroyed since then by the British themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, taken up most famously by Prince Charles, became the nation's cause 
celebre. 
</P>
<P>
 The original British production of "Lettice & Lovage" premiered in Bath and 
transferred to the Globe Theatre in London's West End, where Smith starred in 
it for a year opposite Margaret Tyzack's Lotte. A smash hit, the production won 
the 1987 Evening Standard Drama Award for Best Comedy and ran for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show opened on Broadway in 1990, it again starred Smith and Tyzack. 
Both won Tonys for their performances. Shaffer, who had revised the script 
slightly to make the ending more plausible, received a Tony nomination for best 
play.  
</P>
<P>
 Because he intended Lettice for the inimitable "sound of (Smith's) voice and 
for her ability to phrase and to time," Shaffer said, other performers with 
less flair may be intimidated by the role. 
</P>
<P>
 So his advice is simple: "Go with the language, with the flow of it. The 
rhetoric is the key to the character. It's the verbal music of the piece. If 
it's naturalistic and broken up or very 'you know-ish,' I don't think it will 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 For Kandis Chappell, who is playing Lettice in the SCR Mainstage production, 
size and brio represent two crucial aspects of the character that she is still 
trying to fathom. What she wants to avoid, she says, is playing larger than 
life in a comically grand dame way reminiscent of Judith Bliss, a role she 
portrayed at SCR last season in Noel Coward's "Hay Fever." 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone once said to me that the definition of panache is when too much is 
just enough," Chappell noted in an interview last week. "Well, that's Lettice." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't believe her approach to the role will be anything like 
Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maggie Smith is a very eccentric actress and I'm eccentric too, but in a 
totally different way. She is mannered. She can take things past the limit and 
still make it believable. That's not my instinct at all. I can do broad, if 
that's what is called for. But my instinct is to work very small." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Chappell's results tend to be large. She is the only actress to 
have won three Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards in the 25-year history 
of the prizes -- all for her performances in leading roles at SCR (in "The 
Crucible," "Woman in Mind" and "Shadowlands"). 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing David really wants," she said, referring to director David Emmes, 
"is the idea that when Lettice is insecure she covers it with absolute bravado. 
The only way you know she's insecure is that her bravado is a little more than 
she needs it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Megan Cole faces a different proposition as Lotte, who masks her 
vulnerability by putting on a stern countenance.  
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these women are out there in a high wind," said Cole, who won an 
LADCC award (for "The Playboy of the Western World" at SCR). "This play is the 
story of how each of them copes, and they both cope by hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lettice uses bravado. Lotte adopts an authoritarian veneer, which is all it 
is. She's actually a woman of tremendous passion, and that's not my overlay. 
It's in the script." 
</P>
<P>
 If Cole's description makes Lettice and Lotte sound more dramatic than comic, 
she hasn't done them an injustice. The play does have a certain heft even in 
its giddiest moments, not unlike its author. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shaffer: "I combined my fury at the condition of London and my wish to 
write a comedic fantasy for Maggie. One absorbed the other." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lettice & Lovage" continues in previews Tuesday through Thursday and opens 
Friday at South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Previews:

 A Family Affair: Actor Martin Sheen scored a rare triumph at the box office 
over the weekend without appearing in a movie. His sons star in the top two 
films. "D2 The Mighty Ducks," with Emilio Estevez, was in the No. 1 spot at the 
box office during the weekend. The Walt Disney Pictures film grossed $5.7 
million, according to early industry estimates. "Major League II," the baseball 
comedy from Warner Bros. featuring Charlie Sheen, dropped to second place with 
$5.4 million. Third place, meanwhile, went to Universal's "The Paper" with $4.6 
million. Gramercy Pictures' "Four Weddings and a Funeral," the film starring 
Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, made an impressive leap to No. 4 with $4.2 
million. In fifth place was TriStar's new release, "Threesome," with $4.1 
million.

 An Official Regret: The U.S. State Department said it regrets that some 
foreign countries are aiming to keep the film "Schindler's List" out of their 
theaters. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Friday at a briefing: 
"The department believes that this film should be available to people worldwide 
and that the most effective way to avoid the recurrence of genocidal tragedy is 
to ensure that past acts of genocide are never forgotten."

'TALES' AUTHOR: PBS IS BEING PRESSURED BY RELIGIOUS RIGHT; TELEVISION: 
ARMISTEAD MAUPIN FEELS THAT PUBLIC NETWORK HAS PULLED THE PLUG ON A SEQUEL IN 
FACE OF PRESSURE. A SPOKESMAN DENIES THE CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the fate of a sequel to Armistead Maupin's acclaimed PBS miniseries 
"Tales of the City" up in the air, the public-television network is facing 
accusations by the famed San Francisco writer that it pulled the plug on future 
funding to accommodate the Religious Right. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I have to offer is my bewilderment and the personal belief that they have 
capitulated to pressure from extremists," Maupin said by telephone from his 
office-home. "I think they're running scared at PBS when it comes to criticism 
from the Religious Right and chose simply not to get embroiled in the 
controversy one more time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Lawson, PBS' executive vice president for national programming, 
denied that content had anything to do with not funding an additional six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not made it a practice of simply doing sequels (even on) the most 
successful programs," she said Saturday from Denver. "I can understand 
Armistead Maupin's disappointment (but) before it came at a much lower price, 
and we still have to consider other priorities (to bring) a real diversity of 
programming." 
</P>
<P>
 The first six-hour miniseries was adapted from the author's international 
bestseller that stemmed from his fictional columns in the San Francisco 
Chronicle about the everyday lives and loves of gays and straight people in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Airing on three consecutive nights in January, "Tales" drew about 7% of the 
national viewing audience, according to A. C Nielsen Co. ratings -- double what 
PBS usually gets in prime time. It was PBS' highest-rated dramatic series in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Rev. Donald Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., urged members of his 
American Family Assn. to write Congress to protest tax money going to such 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Channel 4 picked up almost the entire $8-million tab on the first 
"Tales," according to Maupin, with PBS' "American Playhouse" contributing less 
than $1 million. This time, Maupin noted, the British commercial network was 
asking PBS for $4 million, or about half the production costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maupin said that scripts on "More Tales of the City" circulated at PBS and 
"American Playhouse" last week, and said the content must have caused 
apprehension. In the proposed sequel, one of the storylines involves a 
character telling his mother that he is gay after she has become involved in a 
fundamentalist campaign against homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lawson and spokesman Harry Forbes say PBS had never committed to a 
sequel, and cited other funding priorities, including "Ready to Learn," its 
expanded commitment to educational children's programming, and "Democracy 
Project," a new news and public-affairs programming initiative leading up to 
the 1996 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me put it this way," said Maupin, when asked why he didn't believe money 
was the issue. "Lindsay Law ('American Playhouse' executive producer) spoke 
directly to Lawson and asked her if PBS would be willing to run 'More Tales of 
the City' if 'American Playhouse' found the means to finance it 
(independently); she refused to give him an answer. In other words, when we 
eliminated all financial considerations (as a hypothetical), we were 
stonewalled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, who did not dispute the conversational account, nevertheless said she 
doesn't discuss "hypotheticals."

COUNTERPUNCH: A CYNICAL BUT NECESSARY EVIL

 Click Click Click. The sound you may hear in the future are "V" chips encoded 
into TV sets that automatically turn off programs that contain excessive 
violence. This is a sound that would be music to the ears of many Americans. 
"V" chips are still years away from production, and Howard Rosenberg suspects 
they will ultimately prove to be a "cynical, quick-fix strategy that will yield 
few actual benefits" ("A Chip Off the Same Old Block," Calendar, Feb. 4). But 
Rosenberg does say, "Sure, why not give them a try?" Why not, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-eight percent of American homes have TV sets. The estimate is that the 
average American watches 20 to 30 hours of TV weekly. It has also been 
estimated that a typical youth by age 12 will have witnessed more than 40,000 
murders or attempted murders and 250,000 violent acts on the screen. And media 
critics have noted that TV crimes are likely to be more violent than real-life 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1982 study by then Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop confirmed that youths 
repeatedly exposed to screen violence were more likely to commit violent acts 
in real life. TV violence also serves as negative reinforcement -- that 
violence is the accepted method to solve problems and achieve gains. In 1969, 
the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence said pretty 
much the same about TV: "It can also be suggested that good triumphs over bad 
through violence -- the manly, as well as the only, course of action." 
</P>
<P>
 With black youth, it's even worse. According to Nielsen Media Research, they 
spend more hours in front of the tube than whites. (For example, a recent 
Nielsen survey found that black teen-agers average 5 hours, 14 minutes daily in 
front of the tube compared to 3 hours, 26 minutes for all American teens.) For 
many youths, TV serves as a combination of entertainment, escape vehicle and 
surrogate parent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TV violent characters who seem to be "getting over" or beating the system can 
have a perverse appeal to many youths who are angry and frustrated. Add to this 
the bloody toll that shows up regularly on news programs and one has to ask if 
television isn't placing a social and cultural imprimatur on real-life 
violence. I say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 With their heads stuffed with a combination of TV realities and fantasies, 
it's a short step for some youngsters to translate screen violence into street 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is certainly compelling that the streets have become more deadly. 
During the past quarter century, according to the National Center for Health 
Statistics, more than 1,000 black male teens have have been murdered annually. 
Young black males are seven times more likely than whites to be murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, some felt the medium became the message. Immediately after the 
riots, 56% of news directors surveyed by Nielsen Media Research claimed that TV 
coverage sparked the violence in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 TV programs alone don't pull triggers or ignite riotous passions. But they 
clearly contribute to the climate of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals kicking around in Congress are sensible. They include: 
restricting programs with violent content to late-night hours; periodic FCC 
reports that list the TV programs that contain the greatest violence and their 
commercial sponsors; requiring warning labels on TV shows, and advance notice 
in published TV schedules of those programs with "violence or unsafe gun 
practices." 
</P>
<P>
 The bills may not be perfect. Some may even strain First Amendment precepts, 
but are on the congressional table because the industry refuses to police 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno appeared before the Senate Commerce 
Committee and challenged TV executives to "do more" to cut violence. What was 
the response? TV executives aired a special on alternatives to violence. They 
promised to formulate anti-violence guidelines and establish an advisory panel 
to monitor TV violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes: They also promised to produce more comedies. But these strike me as 
nothing but half-baked ploys to get Reno and Congress off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't work. The public is fed up with the TV industry's foot-dragging on 
violence. If Congress ultimately decides that it's politically expedient to 
keep its hands off the industry, which is likely given the risk and money 
involved, technology may yet save the day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why if the "V" chip were on the market today, my guess is that many 
Americans would use it to do what neither politicians nor TV executives have 
done -- click off the violence on their sets.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'V' CHIP SOLUTION A COP-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN VAN TASSEL, Joan Van Tassel is an assistant professor of 
telecommunications at Pepperdine University and the media writer for the Malibu 
Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Rosenberg's lukewarm support for the "V" chip is a hesitant step in the 
wrong direction ("A Chip Off the Same Old Block," Calendar, Feb. 4). I would 
summarize his argument as, "Gee, if people want it, what the heck, what harm 
can it do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Au contraire, Mr. Rosenberg, the "V" chip can do plenty of harm. Forget that a 
technically feasible solution is further away than some think, that rating 
systems depend on network cooperation, that people who can't program a VCR will 
probably have some difficulty programming a "V" chip, that the parents who 
won't control their kids' viewing are the problem anyway, and that two-thirds 
of American television households don't have kids under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Put out of your mind that there are many alternatives already out there. You 
can order a set-top box from your cable company that will let you block 
programming. You don't have cable? SuperVision, TV Allowance and TimeSlot all 
offer products that will let you budget TV time and block channels and programs 
you don't want your kids to see. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's suppose the "V" chip were actually implemented and working, in every 
TV set in America. With control handed decisively to the viewer, programmers 
would be free to schedule anything, no matter how violent or sexual its 
content. As Rosenberg points out, these programmers are the same ones who are 
rushing to bring you the Menendez murder case and who featured three TV movies 
about Amy Fisher. With responsibility firmly saddled onto viewers to block 
channels and programs, constraints on programmers would diminish to 
invisibility. 
</P>
<P>
 What about feature films? One reason cable has borne the brunt of criticism in 
this debate is that cablecasters' reliance on movies make them the chief 
purveyors of violence. If it were removed from television, we could count on an 
active videocassette rental business filling viewers' appetite for blood, guts 
and gore. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the "V" chip is a cop-out. It lets politicians, programmers and the 
public wipe their hands in a pseudo-victory over violence. "That's it," they 
will say. "We've solved the problem." Sadly, we have not yet begun to fight the 
real battle. The real territory we must conquer is cultural -- and the real 
enemy is the greed, callousness and indifference of today's cultural life. 
</P>
<P>
 We face a paradox. On the one hand, research increasingly supports the idea 
that TV violence creates a more violent society. An analysis of crime 
statistics by Brandon S. Centerwall at the University of Washington, as 
reported in Public Interest, shows that homicide rates in the United States, 
Canada and South Africa doubled in the 10- to 15-year period after television 
appeared. On the other hand, regulation is becoming impossible. In the 100-plus 
channel future, regulation implies a bureaucracy none want to support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smart agent" software, a kind of genius "V" chip that will allow us to 
program our TV sets to channel-surf for us and bring back only what we want to 
see, is one, maybe two, decades away. That's too long to wait to do something 
about violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We need to support the letter-writing campaigns to networks and advertisers 
protesting violent programming. Martha Bayles, former Wall Street Journal TV 
critic and author of "Hole in Our Soul: The Loss of Beauty and Meaning in 
American Popular Music," offers other actions we can take to counter violence 
in programming. She suggests we consider how to limit the export of very 
violent programming, examine funding for the arts that legitimize violence and 
attack the glamour of violence, its very stylishness, which is the basis of its 
seductiveness to our youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the "V" chip in our sets allows us to kid ourselves that technology 
will solve the problem. It tempts us to turn our attention away from the steps 
we must take to reduce the acceptance of violence as a way of popular culture 
and as a way of life.

 A rich and powerful Hollywood icon and a chance encounter with an attractive 
and talented comer to the industry. The basic ingredients for a Hollywood 
romance? Not if the icon happens to be female and the sweet young thing is 
male, at least according to this apparently dead-serious remake of "Sunset 
Boulevard" playing at the Shubert in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 Film has given us a parade of sweet young things who, having been mentored or 
protected by an older, successful man, find themselves falling hopelessly in 
love with him ("Mad Dog and Glory," "Pretty Woman," "My Fair Lady," etc.). In 
this melodrama, the male lead's attachment to this older, powerful woman is 
portrayed as the consummate journey into degradation for our hero. The older 
woman, now 50 ("ancient," proclaims a bit player), is by all show-biz standards 
now unbeautiful. Her attempts to woo her young love interest with her wealth 
and connections are portrayed as pathetic at best and sinister at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 History has given us examples of younger men who are attracted to older women 
for their inner beauty as well as their worldly power, the most prominent among 
them Catherine the Great. Yet the underlying notion here is that the bonds that 
tie December-May female-male romances are based on narcissism in the former and 
some wretched weakness in the latter. According to the subtext of the plot, it 
is wicked for the mature woman to wish to be loved for her wealth, and thus we 
can assume only morally proper for her to wish to be loved for her beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the main character's efforts to become beautiful are mocked in scenes 
depicting the futility of her rigorous beauty regimen. (We even witness a scene 
in which the studio mogul, presumably 20 years her senior but still in his 
prime, condescendingly feeds her hopes of making a comeback in what seems to be 
part maudlin sentiment and part catty private joke among himself and his 
youthful staff.) Our star is condemned as narcissistic for her attempts to meet 
the very standards that her culture dictates. In short, she is sinister to wish 
to be loved for her wealth and vain to hope to be loved for her beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we given here another plot in which women are blamed for their own 
obsolescence? How can the mature woman garner a modicum of respectability? The 
play's ending portrays the author's vision of the answer: She should remain 
loyally tied to the older, powerful men who bestow success upon her in the 
first place. According to the plot line, she might have had a chance at 
happiness had she remained married to the man who directed her early work and 
presumably constructed her career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, we learn that he is her only loyal remaining fan. It is hard to 
imagine this now wimpy man once in the male dominant position, first as her 
director, then as her husband/lover. The star's divorce and venture into 
independence seem to break both her and her maker. 
</P>
<P>
 The message? Women shouldn't expect to be taken seriously into midlife, so 
we'd better attach ourselves to a powerful man who will be. Without male 
direction, our star seems doomed to a tragic downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine instead a happy ending in which she remains married to the man who 
made her career -- now, sadly, her butler. Perhaps if she were cooking his 
meals, the domestic picture would seem less deranged. She'd give up her notions 
of being sexy at 50 (or of becoming a writer or director herself for that 
matter). Then we could have a grand musical finale. 
</P>
<P>
 It would celebrate the joys of marriage and momhood!

FOR SOME GOLFERS IT'S WORSE THAN A BOGEY: PRIVATIZATION; RECREATION: L.A.

 Among the regulars at Los Angeles' public golf courses, Mayor Richard 
Riordan's helicopter tour quickly became the stuff of legend -- and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The city employees who tend the starter's windows or mow the grass at the 12 
courses were sure they were about to lose their jobs. Fanatic golfers were 
convinced that their beloved public links, such as those at Griffith Park -- 
where duffers have held forth since before Colonel Griffith gave the land to 
the city -- were about to become virtual private courses for the "golfing 
elite." 
</P>
<P>
 And both groups whispered about how the helicopter trip had been arranged by a 
multimillionaire crony of the mayor, a man who had brought that most dreaded of 
concepts -- privatization -- to the golf courses of New York, Atlanta and other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is the last stronghold of public golf," declared Marty Tregnan, 
the longtime leader of the golfers at Griffith Park, who at 76 still dresses up 
as a leprechaun to run a St. Patrick's Day tournament. "They'll do anything to 
get a foothold here. . . . Did you hear about the helicopter tour?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like most any tale passed around a circle, the one about the mayor and the 
helicopter was part fact and part fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan had flown over several of Los Angeles' public courses and -- for 
comparison's sake -- Pasadena's privatized courses next to the Rose Bowl. He 
had commented on how the Pasadena grounds were a wondrous green while Los 
Angeles' were duller and less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan had not been personally ferried by David Price, the founder and 
CEO of Santa Monica-based American Golf Corp., which began operating golf 
courses two decades ago and now runs 172 countrywide -- most of them taken over 
from municipalities. And Riordan was not -- at least not yet -- talking about 
turning over all city courses to private operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was plenty of ammunition for the golf conspiracy theorists, who 
did not have to look far to see the writing on the clubhouse wall, the clear 
trend in public golf: 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Los Angeles County completed the decade-long privatization of its 
20 courses, with officials saying the move had improved conditions -- and 
profits. Last month, one of the last Orange County communities still running 
its courses, Anaheim, collected proposals from private firms to take over its 
two locations. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if they had not coptered together, Riordan was hardly unacquainted 
with Price, the crown prince of golf privatization. As young lawyers, they 
practiced in the same Los Angeles firm before leaving to pursue entrepreneurial 
passions, both becoming the sort of self-made men who believe that private 
enterprise can do it -- almost any "it" -- better than government. 
</P>
<P>
 As Price put it: "Where has government ever efficiently operated . . . a 
business similar to a restaurant, hotel or a golf course?" 
</P>
<P>
 In February, he wrote to Los Angeles officials, predicting that private 
management could earn the cash-strapped city up to $6 million a year more from 
its golf courses, which netted $2.2 million for city coffers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is L.A. the last major city to figure this out?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleadings of an old friend, though, were hardly needed to persuade 
Riordan, an occasional golfer who is better known as a bicyclist and tennis 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization was a centerpiece of his campaign when he spoke even of leasing 
Los Angeles International Airport to pay for more police. In December, he 
declared that "dramatic budget pressure" called for other pilot privatization 
projects and listed a series under consideration -- refuse collection, 
custodial services, information systems, parking enforcement, workers' comp 
administration . . . and golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan knew that some of the ideas -- such as leasing the airport -- were 
sure to draw flak. But he had no way of anticipating the fallout from his 
initial proposal for golf: to turn a single city course over to a private 
operator as a test, a practice round in privatization, so to speak. Last week, 
mayoral aides were working on what bureaucrats call an RFP, request for 
proposal, from private firms, with the course at Hansen Dam considered the 
front-runner for the pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 Protest petitions at city courses. Flyers warning of "Increased Costs" and 
"Decreased Accessibility." Golf activist Tregnan appearing before the City 
Council to state: "Let's not turn our public lands into a playground for the 
gentry." 
</P>
<P>
 It had one mayoral aide muttering in disbelief. "All we want to do is try it 
on one golf course!" 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate over the future of public golf in Los Angeles was on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well into the 1950s, golf was essentially a country club sport in the United 
States. Then came Ike and Arnie (golfing President Eisenhower and swashbuckling 
pro Palmer), and increasing popularity among the burgeoning middle class. By 
1983, 61% of the nation's 12,197 golf facilities were public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was long assumed that such courses would be sorry imitations of 
the rich folks' clubs -- the cow pasture analogy was common -- there also were 
alternate images of public golf, especially in California. The famed Pebble 
Beach course was open to anyone with a checkbook and, in 1952, the city of San 
Diego unveiled Torrey Pines, with cliffside holes worthy of hosting the 
nation's best pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles had two showplace layouts: at Rancho Park, which still hosts a 
senior tour event, and the Wilson course at Griffith Park, near where settlers 
had hacked out the area's first golf holes in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 California also was where Price decided there might be a lucrative business in 
transforming the way public courses were run. 
</P>
<P>
 He started in 1969 in Yorba Linda, then looked nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning," he said, "we'd go to many cities . . . and nobody wanted 
to hear what we were saying, (that) under private operation the facilities will 
be better maintained . . . and more profitable to the municipality, which 
normally in those days was losing money (from golf)." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the savings would come from replacing government employees with 
private workers not getting the same extensive benefits. But Price rattled off 
other arguments that foreshadowed the Ronald Reagan era: how government 
operation meant that it took three years to buy a new lawn mower, and you could 
not fire a groundskeeper who kept showing up drunk, and how with private 
enterprise, "we don't make a lot of money when we don't please the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 His company put employees in uniforms with name tags, brought in new electric 
golf carts and "overseeded" fairways with rye grass, which is lush green in 
winter, when other grasses turn brown -- a purely cosmetic touch that Los 
Angeles' greenskeepers eschew because of expense, but which was exactly what 
drew Riordan's eye as he flew above Pasadena's courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach sold. In the last two decades, governments have steadily gotten 
out of the golf business and hired private managers such American Golf, which 
runs seven courses in New York City and 45 in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Under privatization, the courses remain open to the public and government 
officials continue to set greens fees, so the operator cannot charge unlimited 
amounts. The government gets a percentage of everything: 25% of golf cart 
rentals, perhaps, 8% of liquor, 6% of pro shop sales and such, usually with a 
yearly minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the county's 13 full 18-hole layouts, its take ranges between 
$335,000 and $875,000. In the county, privatization was prompted by the passage 
of Proposition 13 in 1978, which limited revenues from property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our (golf) system was losing money, $1 million (a year)," said Steve Duron, a 
county contracts manager. The first course was privatized in 1982 and the 
process completed two months ago, with Lakewood's conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last fiscal year, the county reported a $9.3-million profit from golf. 
Although not all contractors do an equal job, Duron said, the security of 
30-year leases has given them incentive to make capital improvements, such as 
new irrigation systems, that cash-poor governments could not consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County officials report similar experiences after privatizing their 
two courses in 1983, going from subsidizing golf operations to earning $392,000 
last year from one course in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena took the plunge in 1986, when its two Brookside courses were "a piece 
of crap," recalled Dick Freeark, a retired construction executive active in the 
men's club there. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, the complex by the Rose Bowl is "better than many county 
clubs," noted Freeark, 73. Indeed, Brookside has become American Golf's calling 
card, the place it takes potential customers to show what it can do. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a price to the upgrading. Although Pasadena residents pay $20 to 
play on weekends, outsiders are charged $30 -- well above the flat $21 weekend 
fee charged everyone on Los Angeles County courses and the $19.50 on Los 
Angeles city links. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also "a lot of dissatisfaction with all the tournaments," Freeark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to a frequent consequence of viewing golf courses as profit 
centers: The operators are tempted to recruit business and charity groups that 
want to stage tournament outings, in which golfers pay $5 to $10 extra per 
head, rent electric carts and have lunch at the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday at Brookside, 4 1/2 hours of tee times at the championship 
course were reserved for two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize of Los Angeles County's privatized courses -- Los Verdes, atop the 
scenic Palos Verdes Peninsula -- similarly is a hotbed of tournaments. Tee 
times have become so cherished that golfers sleep in the parking lot on Friday 
nights to secure a place at the starter's window -- to reserve a time for the 
next week.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith Park on a recent morning was a melting pot of municipal golf. Several 
city firemen warmed up on the driving range. On the first tee were four 
retirees in their 60s who started playing together years ago when they all 
worked in the Downtown garment district. A Koreatown real estate man approached 
the starter's window to pay for his weekly game with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen bucks is the best deal in town," he told the starter, Dan Hill, 
referring to the weekday greens fee. 
</P>
<P>
 A bulletin board featured a notice ("Keep Public Golf Courses Public") urging 
golfers to lobby City Council members, who would have to approve any pilot 
project in privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Most everyone was aware of the debate at City Hall. Many golfers admitted that 
privatization had one appeal -- maybe a company like American Golf could 
finally fix the greens on Wilson, where the crush of play has taken its toll, 
as has salt in reclaimed sewage water used by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the golfers fear the unknown. Creeping prices. All those tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have seen park workers scramble to improve the courses on their own. 
Impressive stone hole markers were recently added and the city supervisor for 
Griffith Park, Manuel Mollinado, vows to start rebuilding the greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Mollinado said golf course employees "see (privatization) as a very personal 
thing," although they have been assured "the city would be very aggressively 
looking at (new) positions for them" if outsiders took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees in the golf system are private contractors -- in the 
restaurants, pro shops and driving ranges. But 132 full-time city workers and 
240 part-timers continue to administer the courses, staff the busy starter's 
windows and handle the extensive groundskeeping chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the almighty dollar," said Ralph Hyde, a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 That theme was echoed a few days later when a tournament drew one of the 
area's leading golfer-activists, Craig Kessler, spokesman for the 22,000-member 
Southern California Public Links Assn. He complains that golfers have had 
little say in the privatized Los Angeles County courses while greens fees have 
more than doubled over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Kessler was encouraged by a meeting with mayoral aides, who seemed open 
to forming a advisory committee of golfers, he saw government setting a 
dangerous precedent when it "started talking about making money" off parkland. 
Golfers were an easy target, he said ("somehow golf is not politically 
correct"), but why stop there? 
</P>
<P>
 "Is government now going to charge real market rates for other open space 
activities . . . beaches, all parks and (nature) interpretive centers?" Kessler 
asked. "It's one thing to talk about making them more efficient . . . but 
what's next? Meters on the swings you push your kids on?" Playing Through 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan has proposed privatizing at least one of the 12 city of 
Los Angeles public golf courses. The courses would remain public, but would be 
run by private firms in an attempt to improve conditions -- and make more 
money. Here is a look at the 12 courses, on which more than 1 million rounds

<P>
 Who knew that Marle Marl was dissing copyright law and opening up a gaping 
pothole on the information superhighway when he began using digital computer 
technology to make rap music nearly a decade ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1985, I just started recording kicks and snares of drummers and rearranged 
them" to create new beats, said Marl, who rose from working as a club DJ to 
recording and producing for the House of Hitz label in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 As an avid and early practitioner of "sampling" -- using digital recorders to 
copy snippets of other people's performances, electronically manipulate them 
and then include the sounds in new musical works -- Marl expected to ignite 
dance fever, not controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But sampling has created a multibillion-dollar legal morass -- confusion that 
underscores the difficulties of defining issues as fundamental as ownership and 
power in a digital age where information can be copied or altered with a few 
keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 With silicon microchips, an exact electronic replica can be made of virtually 
any medium -- images, sound or data. The February cover of Scientific American 
magazine, for instance, featured a digitally altered photograph that showed 
Marilyn Monroe flirting with Abraham Lincoln. Two years ago, pop singer Paula 
Abdul hoofed it up with a youthful Gene Kelly in a Diet Coke commercial, thanks 
to digital imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with personal computers and digital recorders, entrepreneurs around the 
globe are using digital technology in more foreboding ways. They are making 
unauthorized copies of billions of dollars' worth of music, movies, software, 
pharmaceutical formulas and other so-called intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to the growing matrix of global computer networks, they can zap the 
appropriated works to consumers around the world in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Such technological feats are testing the effectiveness of the U.S. patent, 
trade secret and copyright laws. The challenge comes amid final consideration 
of a new global trade accord aimed, in part, at extending intellectual property 
protections that help generate more than $50 billion a year for the U.S. music 
and film industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The spread of digital technology is quickly eroding the political and 
geographic boundaries that have allowed industry and governments to maintain 
control over information through legal measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason this nation's copyright laws appeared to work so well for so long 
was because it was physically hard to make a book or a record; you had to have 
the physical product to pass it around," said John Perry Barlow, a songwriter 
for the Grateful Dead and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a 
Washington group that lobbies on cyberspace issues. "Now you don't have to have 
that anymore. Information is becoming liquid. It can no longer be contained." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, news articles and other documents routinely are distributed on 
computer networks to millions of people. That, say experts, should give pause 
to entrepreneurs who have been excitedly talking about offering U.S. households 
movies-on-demand and other pay-per-view fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will just pick stuff off the (TV) screen like it's nothing," said 
Hal Varian, a University of Michigan economics professor -- and then copy and 
distribute to friends and neighbors for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the ease of copying artistic and intellectual works have been 
around since the advent of the printing press. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing musicians have been feeling the effects of recording technology for 
at least half a century -- ever since jukeboxes and taped music began replacing 
bands in many restaurants and bars. Music licensing organizations such as BMI 
and ASCAP police bars, suing owners who do not pay royalties for each recording 
they play. The conflicts only have grown with new advances, such as audio- and 
videotape recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 But VCRs and non-digital, or "analog," audiotape machines have limited 
capabilities. When an original film or master recording is re-recorded, the 
quality is diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital technology ended all that. A digital recorder transforms information 
-- sounds, images or data -- into an electronic code that can be reconstructed 
by a digital playback machine with no loss of quality. A bootlegged copy of a 
fifth-generation digital recording is virtually indistinguishable from the 
master tape stored in the vault at corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 This technology is finding its way into many more hands via the personal 
computer revolution, making it easy for ordinary Americans to make the kind of 
mirror-image duplicates that once required costly equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Mitchell, dean of the School of Architecture and Planning at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers a troubling glimpse of quandaries 
about the very building blocks of information that could arise in a digital 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he asked in the February issue of Scientific American, what 
should one do if presented with a sharp, detailed "photograph" of Elvis Presley 
in a contemporary setting? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can either maintain our confidence in the reliability of the prior 
evidence that Elvis is dead and reject the image as a visual falsehood," 
Mitchell wrote, "or we can accept the new evidence before us and 
correspondingly modify our beliefs. Such judgments will be increasingly crucial 
and increasingly difficult to make with confidence in a world where convincing 
visual evidence can be faked with ease." 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs represent only the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a host of things, ranging from credit cards to phone calls, that can 
be digitally recorded, altered and reproduced in a form that is 
indistinguishable from the original. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, law enforcement officials say they have their hands full chasing the 
enterprising criminal who uses a computer scanner to copy checks or money 
orders and then digitally substitute his or her name after adding a few zeros 
to the amount to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious problem," said Varian, the Michigan economics professor. 
"Right now I could take a photograph from Playboy, scan the picture and send it 
out over the entire Internet," he said, referring to the fast-growing global 
matrix of computer networks. "This can be done completely anonymously, without 
a trace. But this sort of behavior could cause serious economic problems, 
(because) . . . if you don't protect intellectual property, people will have 
little incentive to develop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Playboy Enterprises successfully sued a computer bulletin board in 
Florida last year that was making it possible for personal computer users to 
download pictures of Playboy magazine models. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Patent and Trademark Commissioner Bruce H. Lehman says he is not quite as 
alarmed by such copying. But he concedes that digital technology "is raising 
important legal questions . . . and posing a real challenge to anyone seeking 
to maintain the copyright integrity of their work." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton appointed Lehman to serve as chairman of a government 
intellectual property task force. Lehman said the group is exploring proposals 
to boost legal protection in the digital age, including development of some 
sort of "electronic envelope" that would prevent unauthorized persons from 
perusing or copying information. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to encrypt data with an inseparable electronic code that would 
determine who could gain access. A New York City company called Wave Systems 
Corp. already is testing a technology that not only determines who gets access 
to information but can automatically charge someone's credit card for using the 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it digital vending," said Jim Kollegger, marketing vice president at 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Only lately have electronic envelopes emerged as a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two centuries, the United States has made it a matter of policy 
to provide broad legal protections that allow individuals to reap financial 
rewards from their inventions. Patents, for instance, are property rights 
granted to inventors, providing a 17-year right to exclude others from making, 
using or selling the protected product. Trademarks and copyrights confer 
similar protections. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the digital age, many groups -- including the Recording Industry Assn. 
of America, the Washington-based trade group -- say the old intellectual 
property laws need to be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
 With the RIAA's backing, a bill has been introduced in Congress to grant 
copyright owners of sound recordings the exclusive right to control the 
transmission of their works by cable TV owners, computer hackers and others 
with access to digital recording and transmission devices. The measure is aimed 
at creating a new performance right for artists and record companies so they, 
like songwriters and music publishers, would be compensated for the 
dissemination of music they create. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such protections, "we will be unable to compete in this emerging 
digital era," said RIAA President Jason S. Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the wild, wild West," agreed Dan L. Burk, a George Mason University 
law professor who has written about patent and computer law. "There's a whole 
lot of unsettled legal problems out there in cyberspace." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not for lack of trying that there are no guidelines. In 1988, for 
example, the United States levied $39 million in annual tariff increases on 
Brazilian pharmaceutical imports after U.S. drug makers alleged that Brazilian 
firms were stealing formulas and producing medicines even before U.S. 
manufacturers could offer them for sale in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, pharmaceutical patent theft in Brazil -- which the U.S. drug 
industry claims cost them more than $500 million in sales last year -- has 
continued, prompting the Brazilian government to announce recently that it will 
seek passage of tougher laws by June. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar crackdown in the music world seems to have had little effect on 
copying. Three years ago, a federal judge in New York issued an opinion against 
rapper Biz Markie admonishing him, in biblical terms, that "thou shalt not 
steal." The judge granted an injunction against Markie for the unlicensed use 
of Gilbert O'Sullivan's 1972 song, "Alone Again (Naturally)." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that high-profile precedent, recording industry observers say 
appropriation of music continues. Some samplers are careful to get copyright 
clearance. But others are able to forgo such legal niceties -- in part because 
digital technology enables them to manipulate original compositions beyond 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last nine years, Marl says he has amassed recordings of more than 1,000 
different drum beats on 3 1/2-inch computer disks, using those samples in 
records he has produced for artists such as L.L. Cool J and Heavy D. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the very first to use it," said Russell Simmons, the rap music 
mogul who is chief executive of Rush Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Marl's $2,500 E-Mu Systems SP 1200 sampling drum machine allows him to 
translate the "wave form" of any sound -- from a snare drum to breaking glass 
-- into digital code. That code then can be manipulated by a digital 
microprocessor so the original sound is changed in syncopation or altered in a 
host of other ways, all by simply twisting a few knobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of rap's reputation for gritty lyrics, Marl said, "some people won't 
give me permission to sample their music." But having successfully borrowed 
from so many others, he said he doesn't get mad when people sample his works 
without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an art form," Marl said of rap music, "and I just want to see the music 
get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, his music publisher, EMI, has a different attitude. Said Marl: 
"They usually go after people" who don't get clearances.

NATO AIR STRIKE BACKS WORDS WITH ACTION 
</P>

<P>
 Sunday's air attack by two U.S. F-16C fighters on Bosnian Serb forces outside 
the besieged Bosnian city of Gorazde crossed a line from which Western 
political leaders had tiptoed away from for two years: It suddenly escalated 
the role of the United States and its European allies in the intractable 
Balkans warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing run had only a limited military purpose, but its political message 
packed a wallop. After two years of idle threats to halt Serbian aggression in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the West at last supported its words with deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had said we would act if requested to do so," President Clinton said. "We 
have now done so and will do so again if we are requested." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Air Force intelligence officer who was at the Pentagon as the raids 
were being carried out said later in an interview: "You've crossed a divide 
here. Finally, finally, they ran in U.N. troops and said, 'If you fire on them, 
we're going to bomb you.' The Serbs tested them, and NATO passed the test." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. aircraft had tangled briefly in February with six Bosnian Serb airplanes 
that violated a "no fly" zone, and four of the Serbian planes were shot down. 
And U.N. forces threatened air strikes to enforce a call for Bosnian Serb 
forces to pull their heavy artillery back from the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. 
The Bosnian Serbs complied before any strikes were ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday, North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces had not been involved 
in close air support directed at protecting U.N. troops hemmed in on the ground 
by Bosnian Serbs -- a role similar to that performed by U.S. Air Force fighters 
bailing out ground troops under fire a generation ago in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials made the point of differentiating between Sunday's mission, 
intended to quickly give 12 U.N. observers some breathing room, and formal air 
strikes, which are often planned well in advance and are intended to destroy an 
enemy's weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 The air raid came after a week of mixed signals from senior Clinton 
Administration military and foreign policy officials as Gorazde, a largely 
Muslim community designated as a haven from Serbian attack, came under 
increasing military pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Defense Secretary William J. Perry ruled out the use of U.S. 
troops to prevent Bosnian Serbs from capturing additional territory as Bosnian 
Serb forces bombarded Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, where 65,000 people were 
trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the United States would consider air strikes or armed 
intervention to prevent the fall of Gorazde, Perry said: "We will not enter the 
war to stop that from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Clinton pledged that NATO would provide air support for U.N. 
peacekeeping troops about to be dispatched to Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, said the 
Administration would not be willing to use U.S. air power to stop Serbian 
attacks on the city before U.N. troops arrived there. But he also said neither 
the President nor his advisers "rules out the use of NATO power to help stop 
attacks such as those against Gorazde." 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sunday morning, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on the NBC 
news program "Meet the Press" that if the U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. 
Michael Rose, asked for NATO air support, "we're going to be paying a lot of 
attention to that and responding." 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, the F-16Cs had struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for the air support went up the NATO chain of command and, in 
sharp contrast to an incident last month, approval was granted within 25 
minutes. When French peacekeepers asked for air support in March, authorization 
was granted more than three hours later, and by then the Bosnian Serb forces 
had already taken cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's raid was conducted by aircraft from the NATO base at Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a picture-perfect one," said Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations, during an interview on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said the two fighters were under the direction of a U.N. forward 
air controller -- a soldier on the ground near the site of the target. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Air Force intelligence officer took this to mean that the West had 
been planning a low-scale message-sending operation for at least several days, 
because of the time it takes to place a skilled air controller on the ground. 
NATO Strikes 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatched by NATO, two U.S. F-16C fighter planes struck Bosnian Serb targets 
near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use: Multipurpose tactical fighter-bomber 
</P>
<P>
 * Top speed: Over 1,000 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weapons: Can carry 12,000 pounds of nuclear or non-nuclear weapons

KEY FIGURE IN COLOSIO KILLING FREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Mexican judge Sunday freed a key figure in the alleged plot to assassinate 
ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, but ruled that two 
other suspects should be held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of Rodolfo Rivapalacio brings to four the total number of men held 
for trial in connection with the March 23 killing of Colosio, who was shot 
after a campaign rally in a Tijuana neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 One other suspect is still being sought, and another has been questioned but 
not arrested. Three of those being held were members of the crowd-control 
forces for the rally, a group that is distinct from the security -- similar to 
the U.S. Secret Service -- that guards the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth, Mario Aburto Martinez, the 23-year-old factory worker believed to 
have pulled the trigger, is now being tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto has confessed to the killing, focusing most of the attention in the 
investigation on the possibility of a conspiracy and the question of who might 
have masterminded the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Alejandro Sosa's ruling that special investigator Miguel Montes Garcia 
had not provided sufficient proof of Rivapalacio's involvement to justify 
trying him as an accessory to murder provided another twist in efforts to 
unravel the supposed plot. 
</P>
<P>
 As the person in charge of crowd control for the rally, Rivapalacio had been 
considered a key link tying the alleged conspirators to the local organization 
of Colosio's own Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the party, known as the PRI, has not lost a presidential election 
since its founding 65 years ago, Colosio was assured of becoming Mexico's next 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 However, deep rifts within the PRI were evident even before Colosio's murder. 
Surveys show that about one-third of Mexicans believe that factions within the 
PRI were responsible for the candidate's death. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Rivapalacio's arrest -- and the judge's decision to free him 
-- were critical to the investigation. He is an important figure in the Baja 
California PRI organization and formerly the head of burglary investigations 
for the judicial police in that state. 
</P>
<P>
 A former bodyguard for Margarita Ortega, the first PRI gubernatorial candidate 
to lose an election, Rivapalacio was one of several former officers linked to 
the PRI who organized the 45-member crowd-control team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivapalacio was accused of recruiting for the crowd-control forces the three 
men accused as accessories to murder, altering the name of one and adding the 
name of another in handwriting in the left-hand margin of the recruitment 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The special investigator is free to arrest Rivapalacio again on the basis of 
new evidence. The statement indicated that Montes also plans to appeal the 
judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa did find that there is sufficient evidence to try Vicente Mayoral 
Valenzuela and his son, Rodolfo, as accessories to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he found that there is no reason to believe that Colosio was the 
victim of an ongoing organized crime ring, as the special prosecutor had 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicente Mayoral, 47, is believed to have opened a path through the crowd, 
allowing Aburto to move toward Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Mayoral is accused of pushing a key member of Colosio's security 
forces, thus diminishing his effectiveness. The younger Mayoral was seen 
talking before the rally with Aburto and a fourth suspect, Tranquilino Sanchez 
Venegas.

STANDOFF HEIGHTENS KOREAN AMERICANS' FEARS FOR HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A standoff between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear 
program has rekindled long-smoldering fears and worries among Koreans here -- 
especially those with roots in North Korea -- about their relatives and the 
possibility of a war in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Many with families in North Korea have not seen or communicated with their 
relatives for nearly half a century and do not know whether they are still 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are truly trying times for separated families like me," said Kee Deok 
Kim, 74, who last saw his mother, three brothers and their children nearly 44 
years ago. "My only wish is to see my family before I die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of the 400,000 people of Korean ancestry in Southern California 
trace their origins to what is now North Korea, a hard-line Stalinist state 
with which the United States has no diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 For Koreans from South Korea, home is a nine-hour plane ride from Los Angeles, 
and contact with family a phone call away. But for Koreans from the north, 
their native land might as well be on the moon. For nearly five decades, they 
have not been able to write or phone their relatives in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body is here but my heart is still in Pyongyang -- a place I can't even go 
for a brief visit," said Bong Keon Kim, 66, president of the Los Angeles-based 
U.S. Federation of Korean Americans From Northern Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Though separated by 7,000 miles, Koreans in Southern California feel every 
tense development on the Korean peninsula as if it were happening next door. 
Because Koreans are generally newer immigrants, struggling with the barriers of 
language, culture and insulation from the mainstream, they maintain strong ties 
to their homeland. Their connections are bolstered by the heavy emphasis on the 
news from home in the local Korean news media and constant communication 
between relatives here and in South Korea by telephone and visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Like 11 million separated Korean families worldwide, Kee Deok Kim, executive 
secretary of the federation, bemoans the tragedy of his divided homeland, the 
last remaining partitioned state from the Cold War. There is little he or other 
Koreans can do to influence international politics. But Kim hopes his 
organization's nationwide campaign to ask the United Nations to help locate 
separated families will finally attract the attention he believes the subject 
deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview, Kim wept as he recalled how he became separated from his 
relatives as they tried to escape Communist North Korea to the south in the 
winter of 1950, when U.N. soldiers were retreating from advancing Chinese and 
North Korean troops. 
</P>
<P>
 They had taken to the rooftop of a train because there was no room inside. 
After traveling a short distance, the train came to a stop. After hours of not 
being able to find out when it would leave again, his anxious relatives decided 
to walk to South Korea. Kim remained on the train with his wife because of 
their two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way we could walk, carrying our children and belongings on our 
backs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train left the next morning and brought Kim to his destination, but he 
never saw his relatives again. Years later, he heard from a pastor from his 
hometown, who had escaped to South Korea, that his older brother was sent to a 
work camp because he was a Christian and that his mother followed him there. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping his tears, Kim said: "I pray to God every day that there will be 
peaceful reunification of Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he came to the United States in 1988 from Seoul because he thought it 
might be easier to track down his family in North Korea from this end. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent months have seemed like an endless ride on an emotional roller coaster 
for the 1 million Koreans in the United States, be they from the south or 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 They were hopeful in mid-February when Pyongyang reached agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on inspections to ensure that no diversion 
of nuclear material took place during the past year. But their hopes were 
dashed a month later, when North Korea reneged and prevented inspectors from 
completing their rounds. Then, in late March, when the Clinton Administration 
announced that it was sending Patriot antimissile interceptors to South Korea, 
and North Korea threatened to turn South Korea into a "sea of fire," their 
disappointment turned to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after North Korea last week angrily rejected the U.N. appeal for complete 
inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons manufacturing sites, Koreans are 
once again overcome with the frustration of their homeland's fate, which has 
been tied to international power politics because of its strategic location. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are haunted by two conflicting emotions and scenarios right now," said K. 
W. Lee, retired editor of the Korea Times English Edition and a respected 
Korean American commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very thought of another war is unthinkable because it will destroy 
everyone and everything in our homeland. But at the same time, we know from our 
past experience what (North Korean President) Kim Il Sung can do. That's what 
haunts us -- the unpredictability and ruthlessness of Kim Il Sung and the 
possibility that, pushed into the corner, Kim will inflict a holocaust on his 
own people as his last hurrah." 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans are among the world's most homogenous people, having shared a common 
language, history and culture for nearly 5,000 years. Korea, which became a 
Japanese colony in 1910, was partitioned by the United States and the former 
Soviet Union after World War II. What was to have been a temporary demarcation 
along the 38th Parallel to receive the surrender of Japanese troops in the 
north by the Soviets, and in the south by Americans, has lasted nearly five 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he took power with the help of Soviet leader Josef Stalin in 1948, Kim 
Il Sung, 81, has purged countless numbers of Koreans in order to maintain 
control of the isolated state. Kim started the Korean War on June 25, 1950, 
when his troops, armed with Soviet weapons and riding in Soviet tanks, crossed 
the 38th Parallel to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 As for South Korea, it achieved a democratic government under a civilian 
leader in 1993, after three decades of military rulers. Since Kim Young Sam, 
66, took office last year, South Koreans have enjoyed unprecedented freedom, 
including freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Chae-Jin Lee, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and a Korea 
specialist, said there is still a chance for a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the United States let North Korea know specific incentives 
it will provide in return for Pyongyang's concessions on the nuclear program. 
Until now, the only concession the United States has agreed to was to forgo the 
annual U.S.-South Korean war exercises, which is not enough, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including many from North Korea, who tend to be fiercely 
anti-Communist because of their experience under Communist rule, disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing the government of Kim Il Sung understands is might," said Bong 
Keon Kim of the federation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the United States should dispatch not only Patriot anti-missile 
interceptors but also warships, and station them in the waters surrounding 
South Korea as a clear deterrent to possible North Korean aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they may disagree on how to handle North Korea, there is no 
disagreement on the observation that U.S. foreign policy suffers from a lack of 
a Korean American perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks, Jews and the Irish all have strong representation in what happens in 
South Africa, Israel and Ireland, but with Koreans there is thundering 
silence," K. W. Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in part, is why Korea has been of "marginal concern" to the United 
States except when its self-interest is at stake, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing standoff between the United States and North Korea has provided 
the momentum to launch a local petition campaign. The federation's 2,000 
dues-paying members are gathering signatures in hundreds of Southern California 
churches, businesses and social and fraternal organizations to urge the U.N. 
panel on human rights to press North Korea to help re-establish contact between 
separated families. They hope to broaden the effort to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Koreans in Southern California with relatives in North Korea 
cannot visit even when they know their whereabouts because they are at the 
mercy of North Korean officials, who issue visas only to a select group of 
people, said Meong Shik Ahn, vice president of the federation, founded in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, some Korean Americans have traveled to North Korea 
through Beijing. But some have returned to regret it because of the spotlight 
their trips put on their relatives in the north and financial pressures exerted 
on visiting Korean Americans by North Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-to-do Korean American who visited her relatives twice said: "I feel 
like I have to keep giving them money or they'll mistreat my family." 
</P>
<P>
 If a way could be found to arrange visits under the aegis of the United 
Nations, such predicaments could be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we are asking of the United Nations is to help us confirm whether our 
loved ones are still living," said Bong Keon Kim, who last saw his sister in 
1947. "If they're alive, we want to write to them, and visit them on holidays. 
If they're dead, we want to go there, cut the grass on their grave and put 
flowers on it."

10,000 DIE IN RWANDA; MANY FOREIGNERS ESCAPE; AFRICA: BODIES ARE STREWN ALONG 
CAPITAL'S STREETS IN THREE DAYS OF CARNAGE. BELGIANS APPEAR TRAPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With as many as 10,000 dead in their blood-soaked capital, warring ethnic 
groups in the Central African nation of Rwanda resumed fighting following a 
brief cease-fire Sunday, as Americans and other foreigners arrived in the 
relative safety of neighboring Burundi after harrowing overland journeys and 
air evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days of unabated violence took their toll on the Rwandan capital of 
Kigali, with fires burning on the outskirts, aid warehouses looted, doctors 
accusing soldiers of slaughtering patients in hospital beds and sketchy reports 
of a massacre at a Roman Catholic Franciscan mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of 400 Belgian troops assigned to a 2,500-member U.N. 
peacekeeping force said Sunday morning that the Rwandan Patriotic Front, 
dominated by members of the minority Tutsi, and the Rwandan army, dominated by 
the Hutus, had stopped shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 10 o'clock this morning there was a cease-fire, and it seems to be 
holding," said Col. Luc Marchal in an interview with Belgian television. "The 
two sides agreed to a cease-fire. . . . There is a certain stabilization." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed at 7:30 p.m., however, he said the fighting had flared again. 
"Expatriate (Belgians) are remaining in their homes," he said. "Belgians are 
among the casualties, but (in Kigali) this seems to be more because they have 
been trapped in cross-fires by warring groups and not because they have been 
specifically attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,500 Belgians in Rwanda are considered in the greatest danger among the 
foreign residents because Belgium was the nation's colonial power until 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Philipp Boisserie, reporting for French television from Kigali, said fighting 
was continuing Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are still shooting," he said. "We don't know where the shooting is 
coming from or whom they are shooting at." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel leader Theogene Rudasingwa said in remarks broadcast by a French 
television network that "we have little option" but to press southward toward 
Kigali from positions in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, reports broadcast by Tanzanian radio and monitored by the British 
Broadcasting Corp. said ethnic violence was erupting in Burundi. According to 
the radio report, Hutu residential areas of Bujumbura, the capital, were 
attacked, prompting about 500 Burundians to flee the tense capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has flared in the wake of an airplane crash Wednesday that killed 
President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprian Ntayamira of 
Burundi, who were returning from a regional conference in Tanzania intended to 
halt the years of violence that have racked the rival Hutus and Tutsi. Both 
leaders were members of the Hutu tribe. Rwandan government officials said 
rocket fire brought down the airplane as it approached the Kigali airport. 
</P>
<P>
 While about 300 U.S. Marines, deployed from the amphibious assault ship 
Peleliu in the Indian Ocean near Somalia, stood by in Bujumbura, troops from 
NATO allies in Western Europe took up positions in Kigali to oversee the 
departure of the European and U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium dispatched 600 paratroopers aboard a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy to 
reinforce the 400 Belgian troops who departed Saturday to evacuate their 
compatriots from Rwanda. The first of seven Belgian C-130 aircraft landed late 
Sunday afternoon in Kigali after having been prevented from landing Saturday by 
obstacles placed on the runways, apparently by Rwandan army units. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere in Kigali has been completely anti-Belgian," Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes said in Brussels. "We recommended Belgians not try to 
leave by road, but to wait for aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Rwanda's majority Hutus believe that Belgian diplomatic efforts have 
favored their enemies, the Tutsi, since a peace agreement last August stopped 
fighting between the two ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Belgian soldiers serving as U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda were killed 
Thursday, apparently by extremist Hutu members of the elite Presidential 
Guards. They had been attempting to protect the acting prime minister, Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, a Tutsi. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other Westerners trapped in the initial fighting appeared to be safe by 
late Sunday evening. The French government reported Sunday evening that the 
majority of its 600 nationals had been evacuated, either to Bujumbura or to 
Bangui, in the Central African Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arriving in the Burundian capital was the Mueller family of 
Kalamazoo, Mich. Scott Mueller, a Baptist missionary, said he, his wife and two 
children dashed three miles by car to the Kigali airport Sunday morning during 
a brief lull in the shooting. "We passed about 20 bodies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Mueller, his wife, said they huddled in fear in their house for three 
days. While they hid on the roof, she said, a mortar round landed in the back 
yard, killing the family dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Before mustering the courage to flee, Julio Gamba, the World Bank 
representative in Rwanda, and his wife, Amelia, said they spent four days under 
mattresses in their hallway. Bullets riddled their home, pieces of the ceiling 
had fallen, and windows were shattered. The Argentine couple arrived in Kenya 
after sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is such a thing as luck in this world, we've got it," Amelia Gamba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday morning that the 258 
Americans in Rwanda -- about half of them diplomats and dependents, and the 
rest missionaries -- had been contacted by the U.S. Embassy and that "all of 
the Americans who wanted to leave Kigali have just now finally left." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that some of the Americans were being flown from Burundi to Nairobi, 
the capital of Kenya, and that others had crossed overland into Zaire or 
Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an evacuation that's gone very well," he said, and only "one or two" had 
chosen to remain in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of the carnage and chaos of the previous three days were everywhere in 
Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one report, drunken men with machetes, knives and grenades built 
roadblocks, and the Red Cross was asking people to dig mass graves because more 
than 1,000 bodies had piled up at the central morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't find words -- the weather is nice, it's green, the lovely scenery, 
but you have all this violence in front of your eyes," Patrick Gasser, deputy 
head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the Associated 
Press. "And there is a smell to it. It's strong, penetrating." 
</P>

 Eric Bertin, a coordinator for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, 
was quoted by the Associated Press in Kigali as having said he and his 
colleagues arrived at a hospital to find that patients they had treated had 
been killed by soldiers overnight. Some were in beds in tents set up on 
hospital grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have decided it is no use to work here anymore," he said. "It is useless 
to cure someone who is going to be killed anyway. They were just lying in their 
tents dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the city, bodies were strewn about the streets -- the remnants of 
a horrific rampage in which citizens were shot or hacked to death. 
</P>
<P>
 After escaping to Bujumbura, Canadian missionary Vernon Demille told Canadian 
Broadcasting Corp. that "people were being pulled out of our church and 
slaughtered out in front of the church. We're seeing people running for their 
lives, houses being grenaded, people being shot. Some of them are being 
butchered by machetes." 
</P>
<P>
 The report of the massacre at the Franciscan order came from a spokesman for 
the Oxfam humanitarian group in Oxford, England. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman, John Magrath, said three Oxfam workers -- from the United 
States, Britain and the Netherlands -- saw Hutu forces enter the mission in 
Kigufi. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looted it, they flushed out all the Tutsis who were there and killed 
them all," Magrath said. He said the three aid workers escaped across the 
border to Zaire.

DEMOCRATS FACE UPHILL FIGHT IN NOVEMBER VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About every week, 10 or so Democratic strategists planning President Clinton's 
role in the 1994 election campaign gather in the White House basement under the 
leadership of Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble-shooter Ickes' new job as campaign overseer, which drains time away 
from his efforts as political point man for the Administration's health care 
reform proposal -- the White House's No. 1 legislative priority -- testifies to 
Clinton's awareness that this fall's balloting is likely to go a long way 
toward defining his political future. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first midterm election since 1978 in which either party has had 
control of the White House as well as both houses of Congress. This means, said 
Gerald Pomper, a Rutgers University specialist on elections, that "the 
Democrats won't be able to blame the Republicans. They will be running on their 
own record." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans, who share Clinton's view of the importance of this November's 
election, say they intend to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the talk by the President about the end of gridlock, he has made it 
clear to the American people that the Democrats are in charge of the White 
House and the Congress," said New York Rep. Bill Paxon, chairman of the House 
Republican Campaign Committee. "And when it comes to Congress, the public is 
not happy with the job they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 By most reckonings, Republicans have only an outside chance of gaining control 
of the Senate and no chance at all of taking the House. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real danger for Clinton is that the Republicans will make significant 
inroads, leaving the Democrats in nominal control and Clinton facing what 
Pomper views as the worst of all political worlds: "He will still have 
Democratic majorities in both Houses, but it will be more difficult for him to 
get his legislation through," Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are also talking boldly of winning governorships in key states, 
thus making them more difficult for Clinton to win in his expected 1996 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 To curb the GOP threat, Democratic candidates will point to the improving 
economy and seek to exploit the power and prestige of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Already Clinton is contributing to their effort by raising enough money to 
allow the Democratic National Committee to dole out $7 million to state party 
organizations and another $2 million to House campaigns. Democrats concede 
that, even with such funds available, they are not likely to outspend the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with financial support, Democrats are counting on Clinton's ability to 
deliver on his campaign promises. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans intend to turn Clinton's record against him and his party. 
Recalling Clinton's depiction of himself during the campaign as "a different 
kind of Democrat," Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour said: "People 
have learned that a new kind of Democrat is one who campaigns as a moderate and 
governs as a liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 As the autumn battle lines emerge, history suggests the obstacles facing the 
Democrats. Not since 1934, when a grateful electorate rewarded President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Democrats for checking the ravages of the 
Depression, has the party controlling the White House gained ground in a 
midterm election. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the voters appear to be in a particularly sour mood. Despite upbeat 
economic indicators, polls show that by margins of 2 to 1 or more, Americans 
believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction. And in a Gallup Poll 
released last month, only 29% of those interviewed approved of Congress' 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater controversy does not help. At the least, the tangled affair, 
which is rooted in a failed Arkansas land investment involving the President 
and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, has hampered Clinton's efforts to focus 
public attention on his policy goals and accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 More seriously, the allegations of abuse of power and conflicts of interest 
have the potential for feeding public cynicism. "It puts the issue of trust in 
government on the political agenda in a more forceful way than most incumbents 
would prefer," Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year in which they seem bound to lose seats, Democrats are hoping that 
the enactment of health care reform will hold down their losses. "But let's 
assume that Congress refused to pass a health bill the President can sign," 
Ickes said. "The President will campaign on that against the Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour said his party's office-holders will not suffer "as long as 
Republicans oppose Clinton when he's wrong and tell why and offer our own 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than six months to go before this argument is settled, here is an 
early look at the major battlegrounds. THE HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans last had a majority in the House in 1954, the year Paxon was born. 
Now Paxon is saying that his party, which has 176 House members to 257 for the 
Democrats, is on the road back to controlling the House by 1996 and will take a 
giant step in that direction on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, seeking to lower expectations, are eager to agree. "When I look at 
all the retirements and all the other odds, we could easily reach a scenario 
where we could lose 25 seats," said Rep. Vic Fazio of West Sacramento, chairman 
of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 While that number, in the view of politically neutral analysts, is probably 
too high, most said they expect the GOP to make healthy gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics help explain why. Of the 42 open seats that, as of now, will be up 
for grabs in November because of retirements, 24 are now held by Democrats and 
18 are in the hands of Republicans. These are typically the seats that are most 
likely to move from one party to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Democrats' 24 open seats include 13 where the incumbent won by 
less than 5% of the vote in 1992. Only four of the Republican open seats meet 
this description. 
</P>
<P>
 The most vulnerable incumbents each year tend to be freshmen running for 
reelection for the first time. The statistics in this category weigh also 
against the Democrats: Sixty-four of this year's huge freshmen class are 
Democrats, compared to 49 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge of reelection is likely to be tougher than usual, even for many 
experienced incumbents, because of the redrawing of House districts after the 
1990 census. Unlike past congressional district boundaries, which in many 
states were devised by Democratic legislators and governors, the 1992 lines 
were more often drawn impartially by courts and intended to create competitive 
districts. THE SENATE 
</P>
<P>
 As in the House, the numbers in the Senate are on the Republicans' side. Of 
the 34 seats up for reelection in November, 21 are now held by Democrats and 
only 13 are in GOP hands. Five of the Democratic incumbents have already 
announced their retirements, while only three Republicans have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 Some GOP gains seem all but certain in the chamber, where Democrats hold a 
56-44 edge. As Republicans see it, the most likely states to turn over include 
Maine, where Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell is retiring, and Ohio, 
where veteran Democrat Howard M. Metzenbaum is calling it quits. Other 
possibilities for Republicans have been created by the retirements of Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. in Michigan, Harlan Mathews in Tennessee and Dennis DeConcini in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Democrats are conceding that at least three of their incumbents 
face particularly difficult challenges: Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania, Charles 
S. Robb in Virginia and Frank R. Lautenberg in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Democratic officials say believe that they have a chance to 
pick up seats in three races where Republicans are retiring, particularly in 
Minnesota, where Dave Durenberger is leaving, and to a lesser degree in 
Missouri, where John C. Danforth is stepping down, and Wyoming, where Malcolm 
Wallop is leaving. THE GOVERNORS 
</P>
<P>
 Because campaigns for governor are generally contests between high-profile 
state personalities arguing over state issues, no President is likely to have 
much impact on their outcome except by contributing his fund-raising abilities 
to the candidates of his party, which Clinton has done. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, political professionals contend that if a party's 
candidates for governors do well in key states, the presidential nominee of the 
same party stands to benefit. "Governors help shape public opinion in their 
states and can help deliver the vote," said Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh, head of the 
Democratic Governors' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's races, the Democrats are also fighting numbers that are the 
price of past success. Of the 36 governorships on state ballots, 21 are held by 
Democrats, 13 by Republicans and two, Alaska and Connecticut, by independents. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1996 presidential election on the horizon, the most significant 
contests this year are in the eight states with the most electoral votes -- 228 
of the 270 needed to win the presidency. In the state with the most votes, 
California, incumbent Republican Pete Wilson trails the front-running contender 
for the Democratic nomination, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, but Republicans 
say Wilson will bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second-place state, New York, Republicans say they are intrigued by the 
apparent weakness of three-term Democratic incumbent Mario M. Cuomo, but no 
strong contender has emerged from the GOP field of aspirants -- and none 
probably will until the primary in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also say they hope that George W. Bush, son of Clinton's 
predecessor, can unseat Democrat Ann Richards in Texas even as his brother, 
Jeb, seeks the GOP nomination to run against Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats say they believe that they have a chance to oust Republican 
incumbents John Engler in Michigan and Jim Edgar in Illinois. In Ohio, 
Republican Gov. George V. Voinovich appears relatively secure. In Pennsylvania, 
where the state constitution bars incumbent Democrat Robert P. Casey from 
seeking reelection, the stage is set for a close fight.

ARISTIDE'S STRONGHOLD FACES TERROR FROM OPPOSITION; HAITI: RESIDENTS OF FETID 
CITE SOLEIL ARE BEING TARGETED TO THWART ANY ORGANIZING ON BEHALF OF OUSTED 
PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It has become part of the early morning ritual, like going to get water or 
opening a stall for business. The people who exist in this fetid slum head out 
at daybreak to count the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks and months, mutilated bodies have turned up regularly, almost daily, 
at 15 Soleil, the address of the half-square-mile garbage dump located inside 
the slum, sometimes two and three at a time, all with multiple bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have been sliced open, and the faces of several have been horribly 
disfigured, as unspeakable reminders to Cite Soleil's 200,000 residents of who 
is and will remain in control of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.N. officials, diplomats and independent human rights 
organizations, there is no question about who that is, of who the executioners 
are -- "the Haitian army and its paid following of civilian-dressed thugs," in 
the words of one diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said at least 53 people were killed in and around Haiti's 
capital, Port-au-Prince, in March by the military or its civilian allies, 
mostly by a group calling itself the Front for the Advancement and Progress of 
Haiti, or FRAPH. More than 30 of those bodies were discarded in Cite Soleil, 
which sits on a mud flat adjoining the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll in February was 58, also mostly from Cite Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," said Colin Granderson, a tall, elegant diplomat recruited from 
Trinidad's foreign service last year to head the U.N. operation here, "there 
have been more since, and we can only guess at how many have been killed in the 
countryside" where there are no human rights monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, according to various human rights organizations, as many as 3,000 
people have been killed since the Sept. 20, 1991, coup that overthrew Haiti's 
first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still being targeted, followed, arrested and killed," one resident 
said. "Only now they are shot and taken out of the city. . . . They (the 
military and its civilian following) are trying to avoid the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all victims are taken out of Cite Soleil. On Thursday just after midnight, 
four armed men broke into the shack of Louis LeDeffe, a 25-year-old former 
soldier who had deserted when Aristide was exiled. 
</P>
<P>
 He was shot in the head in front of his wife and sister-in-law, and his body 
was left for the neighbors to see. Human rights activists said they suspect 
that FRAPH and the army are targeting former military personnel to thwart any 
organizing activity on behalf of the ousted president by anyone with army 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 But this appears to be a phantom fear rooted more in paranoia than in reality. 
There is no real evidence that anyone in Cite Soleil -- an enclave of 200,000 
residents that is the stronghold of Aristide's popular support -- has the 
resources to stage an armed uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbarism is widespread and indiscriminate, Granderson said, "aimed at 
cowing the entire population, not just the supporters of Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 Women routinely report rapes by soldiers and armed civilians, and shootings 
and fires terrorize a country already reeling from fear, hunger and 
hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodshed and brutality always have been part of Haitian politics and society, 
but the current wave has reached a level that equals, if not surpasses, the 
murderous record of longtime ruler Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is worse than under Papa Doc," said Father Antoine Adrien, a Roman 
Catholic priest and the most prominent surviving leader of the movement 
supporting Aristide, who was run out of the country after only seven months in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvalier and his successor son, Jean-Claude, a dictator in his own right until 
he was overthrown in 1986, were considered nearly unparalleled butchers who, 
with their personal army called the Tontons Macoutes, ruled Haiti with guns, 
machetes and religious fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there were limitations then," said Adrien, who was forced by the 
Duvaliers into a 14-year exile. "The Duvaliers targeted only individuals who 
opposed them or were seen as specific enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, everyone is a target; young men, children, women, anyone seen talking to 
two other people. It doesn't matter if you did or didn't do anything," Adrien 
said during an interview in one of the many houses he uses to evade the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are after is to intimidate the entire population," he continued. 
"To say this situation is awful, terrible, is to understate reality. Haiti has 
reached its lowest point." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of this horror is the ironically named municipality of Cite Soleil 
-- City of the Sun -- where the air is thick with a gag-inducing stink and the 
streets are so filled with refuse that four-wheel drive jeeps slide almost out 
of control. Some of the poorest people in the world live here. 
</P>
<P>
 But as oppressed and impoverished as Cite Soleil is, and as unlikely an 
incubator for rebellion and armed resistance, it frightens the armed men who 
have commandeered control of Haitian life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly," one foreign official said, "what they are doing in Cite Soleil 
means they are afraid, that they feel weak. Otherwise, why do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The people seem to stand almost every degradation," a human rights worker 
here said. "It seems to me their hope, what takes them past gut survival, is 
Aristide. They haven't acted yet, but they could, and that's what frightens 
Black." 
</P>
<P>
 Herve Black is a 42-year-old, whip-thin man who heads FRAPH in Cite Soleil and 
is identified by U.N. officials as the head of an execution squad. Black, whose 
cold eyes never seem to change expression, spoke openly in an interview of 
being "a police informer for anti-gang" -- a reference to the most ruthless of 
the uniformed police squads -- and of leading "a technical committee" to root 
out Aristide followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Black and his committee are blamed for a January incident that established 
FRAPH as the most brutal civilian power here and also helps explain the 
strategy of the group's military masters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare challenge to the army and its civilian wing, someone who was never 
identified killed a FRAPH organizer. The reaction was fast and sickening. 
</P>
<P>
 FRAPH members openly burned to the ground an area of Cite Soleil the size of 
four football fields. More than 3,000 people living in that area were driven 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such acts, FRAPH members exhibit an odd affinity for the very people 
they brutalize. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with Black, whose filthy clothes and rotted shoes are set off by a 
faux-gold necklace, two bracelets and a gold-colored watch, took place in a 
shack. He lives in Cite Carton, a mostly cardboard "city" within the larger 
slum of Cite Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
 His headquarters are a three-sided shack with walls and ceiling made of tin so 
bent and disintegrating that birds flew through it. The floor was festering 
mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "These FRAPH people don't seem to be in it for the money or even the power," 
Granderson said. "Just look at the way they live. I think many of them really 
believe they are saving the country." 
</P>
<P>
 What separates Black from his followers is the automatic pistol clearly 
outlined in the back waistband of his pants. "There is no armed uprising 
because there are no arms," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people who want to mobilize and drive out FRAPH and the military, or 
who at least say they do. One is a 31-year-old former soldier who belonged to 
the army's elite Palace Guard at the time Jean-Claude Duvalier was driven from 
power, but who grew disenchanted and joined Aristide's followers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, this Bible-carrying man, who begged not to be identified, 
told of his membership in an organization called MR-6, the initials standing 
for Revolutionary Movement and the "6" for the number of men in each of the 
group's cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization sounds tougher than it is, even by this man's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are organizing all over the country," he said, "but it could take a long 
time. We're not well organized, and we're not well led. We don't have any 
money, and almost no arms." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his cell once had an Israeli-made assault rifle, a machine gun and 
several grenades. But a failed attack on a FRAPH office in February "put us on 
the run, and the guy with the assault rifle ran away and took it with him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a foreign official, the story underlines the military's power and 
the weakness of Aristide's followers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time, the fear the army and FRAPH has is justified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be an organized uprising, but one day a stray bullet is going to 
kill a baby, or an army truck is going to kill a woman trying to earn a dollar 
or just knock down her stand. Then (things) will explode, and I don't think 
anything will stop it."

U.S. JETS BOMB BOSNIAN SERB POSITIONS AT MUSLIM ENCLAVE; BALKANS: DIRECT HITS 
ARE REPORTED ON A COMMAND CENTER AND A TANK POSITION OUTSIDE GORAZDE. REBEL 
SHELLING IS HALTED, OBSERVERS SAY. IT IS UNCLEAR IF ARTILLERY UNITS HAVE BEGUN 
A PULLBACK. 
</P>

<P>
 Two U.S. jet fighters bombed Bosnian Serb artillery positions outside the 
eastern enclave of Gorazde on Sunday, halting a fierce rebel offensive in its 
tracks and delivering the first punishing air strikes after months of U.N. 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched by NATO, the bombing run was the alliance's first-ever air attack on 
ground positions. It came more than three hours after a final U.N. warning to 
the Bosnian Serb military chief that demanded an immediate end to the current 
offensive, which has claimed more than 100 lives in the enclave over the last 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the United Nations said that the rebel shelling had suddenly put 
the lives of its peacekeepers and other personnel at "direct risk." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry said two F-16C warplanes took off from 
Aviano Air Base in northern Italy. They dropped a total of three 500-pound 
bombs under the direction of a U.N. forward air controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic claimed that the air attacks scored 
direct hits. U.N. sources said a command post and a tank position were bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian shelling of the mostly Muslim enclave of Gorazde, one of six 
U.N.-designated safe areas in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, ceased two hours 
later, said Michael Williams, spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force, quoting 
reports from U.N. military observers in the town. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known whether the Serbian forces that have harassed 
Gorazde with tank and mortar fire had begun withdrawing from territory seized 
in the offensive, as demanded by the U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, expressing the hope that the limited military operation 
would bring the Bosnian Serbs to a peace conference, emphasized that the 
international community is united in its resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear expression of the will of NATO and the will of the United 
Nations," he said in a brief statement and question-and-answer session with 
reporters on the White House grounds. "We were retaliating. The United Nations 
made it absolutely clear that there were U.N. personnel in Gorazde, that an 
attack on the town would be interpreted as a clear violation of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the air strikes was released only after nightfall, but the Bosnian 
government expressed confidence that the use of force would have the desired 
effect of driving the rebels back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know their reaction. They are bullies. They react to force," Silajdzic 
told reporters shortly after news of the attack, thanking the United Nations 
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for coming to the defense of his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must express our gratitude to all those who helped the resistance of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to fascism. That is psychologically very important for our 
people who have suffered for almost two years," the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 16,000 killed children -- 16,000 killed children! That is 1,600 
playful schoolyards swept off this earth," he said. "I think these people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are entitled to relief, to know we are not alone. It is 
very, very important for our people to know that the genocide is going to be 
punished after all." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs accused NATO of hitting civilian targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this action NATO has committed open aggression against the Serb people 
by attacking civilian targets far from the front," a Bosnian Serb statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Milan Gvero, deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, said there were 
civilian casualties but did not elaborate, according to the Bosnian Serb news 
agency SRNA. 
</P>
<P>
 The air strike was the first of its kind in NATO's 45-year history. The only 
other use of NATO air power in the more than 2-year-old Bosnian war came Feb. 
28, when NATO jets downed four Serbian planes in central Bosnia after the 
aircraft violated a "no fly" zone. Also in February, the threat of air strikes 
forced Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their guns from Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's strike was ordered after Rose informed the U.N. force commander for 
the former Yugoslav republics, French Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, that the Serbs 
were firing on the center of Gorazde with tanks that had penetrated the heavily 
populated southern suburbs of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the increased risk to civilian lives, the lives of UNMOs (U.N. 
military observers) in the town, as well as of other U.N. and its humanitarian 
personnel, were assessed to be in direct risk," Williams said in describing the 
decisions that led to the air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose then asked Lapresle to request close air support from the civilian chief 
of the U.N. mission, Yasushi Akashi, who is the special representative of U.N. 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the only other time U.N. commanders asked for air power to back up 
operations on the ground, the request was granted in 25 minutes, according to 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. appeal in March for NATO air cover took more than three hours to be 
approved. In that time, the Bosnian Serb gunmen who had been attacking French 
U.N. troops near Bihac had time to escape retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials appeared somewhat concerned that the resort to force might 
undermine their already difficult quest for a cease-fire in a war in which at 
least 200,000 people have been killed or are missing, mostly Muslim civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would hope the peace process is not seriously impaired," said Williams, 
Akashi's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb leadership early today sharply protested the NATO attack and 
accused the United Nations of siding against the Serbs. The rebels declared 
that they were breaking off contacts with U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose and U.S. special envoy Charles Redman have spent the last three days 
shuttling between Bosnian army headquarters and a Serbian base just outside 
this capital in a fruitless attempt to mediate a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference before the air strikes, Silajdzic and Bosnian President 
Alija Izetbegovic accused the Serbs of toying with the Western mediators by 
taking part in the negotiations while continuing the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels had advanced on the Gorazde enclave despite escalating warnings 
from the U.N. commanders that aggression would not be tolerated while a 
diplomatic solution was being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 A final warning was telephoned to the Bosnian Serb military chief, Gen. Ratko 
Mladic, at 2 p.m. local time Sunday, Williams said, and the same message was 
relayed by facsimile 50 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no response from Mladic. But Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, the rebels' 
second-in-command, contended in a letter to U.N. commanders here that the 
Serbian military leadership had ordered a halt to attacks on Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can reliably inform you that Republika Srpska (the self-styled Bosnian 
Serb state) mortars and artillery rounds are not falling into Gorazde," 
Milovanovic insisted in the letter received by U.N. officials at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 However, shelling continued until 7:25 p.m., Williams confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lapresle planned to meet today with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, as 
well as with Izetbegovic, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali had raised the threat of NATO air strikes a day earlier, after 
Serbs captured strategic high ground around Gorazde and began shelling the 
refugee-packed city center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica, which were designated U.N.-protected havens last 
May, are the last three areas of eastern Bosnia not yet subjected to the 
Serbian rebel scourge of "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde is important for the Serbs because it sits astride the main highway 
linking their territories in southwestern and eastern Bosnia. Its continued 
control by government troops forces Serbs to depend on roads through Yugoslavia 
or mountain routes south of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 International aid workers had reported earlier Sunday that Serbian shelling of 
Gorazde had triggered panic and that thousands were fleeing the eastern bank of 
the Drina River as the rebel tanks rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Peter 
Kessler, said 5,000 refugees had fled their homes in the Gorazde pocket, most 
within the previous 24 hours.

CAMPAIGN NOTES; GOP CONSERVATIVES SPURN WILSON, ENDORSE UNZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conservative California Republican Assembly declared once again Sunday 
that Gov. Pete Wilson is not one of them, and voted to endorse a wealthy rival 
for the GOP primary, Northern California computer magnate Ron Unz. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision from the state's largest conservative grass-roots organization 
reveals some split in Republican ranks as the governor seeks reelection. But it 
is nothing new for Wilson, whose 1991 tax increase and support for abortion 
rights have rankled the party's right wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was so hostile to Wilson that when the moderator asked for a 
motion to nominate the governor, the only response was a yell from the back of 
the room: "Get a rope!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign downplayed his differences with the decades-old California 
Republican Assembly, arguing that the group represents only a small portion of 
the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the effect of this is zero," said George Gorton, Wilson's campaign 
manager. "The CRA has proven over and over and over again to only be interested 
in the tiny purist ideological things. This won't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, meanwhile, has crashed into the governor's race in just the last two 
weeks like a hero to conservatives unhappy with Wilson. He is anti-tax, 
anti-abortion and anti-gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also promised to spend millions from his fortune to finance an intense 
race for the June 7 primary. His campaign said a series of statewide television 
commercials is scheduled to begin airing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choice you have (is) the Ronald Reagan Republican who stands before you 
or an ideologically cross-dressing Democrat like our incumbent governor," Unz 
told the 300 conventioneers Saturday. "There are four Democrats running for 
governor -- Kathleen Brown, John Garamendi, Tom Hayden and Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Republican Assembly has endorsed Wilson only once -- when he 
was unopposed by a Republican in his 1988 reelection to the U.S. Senate. The 
group's list of endorsements over the last decade also includes far more 
primary losers than winners. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does represent some of the state's largest political volunteer 
organizations, which can mobilize thousands of people to help with all of the 
unglamorous legwork required in a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the volunteers were gearing up for Unz, whose name lends itself to 
a number of catchy campaign slogans: "Unzeat Pete," "Some Unz Got to Do It," 
and "Stick to Your Gunz, Vote for Unz." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorelei Kinder, campaign manger for Unz and the only woman to serve as 
executive director of the state Republican Party, said the endorsement will be 
particularly important for a campaign that needs fast recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "CRA is the conscience of the party," she said. "I would consider a CRA 
endorsement an important anchor for any Republican candidate to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood among the delegates was cheerful; they gave standing ovations to the 
two Arkansas state troopers who alleged last fall that they had witnessed 
then-Gov. Bill Clinton as a womanizer. Delegates even passed breadbaskets for 
donations for the officers, and at the head table, officials prayed with them, 
arm in arm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like all GOP candidates, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Huffington 
was also invited, but some were still surprised that he showed up. After all, 
the Santa Barbara congressman is a social moderate, and his two opponents for 
the GOP nomination to challenge Sen. Dianne Feinstein are conservative heroes 
who are welcomed at CRA like homecoming soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for former Orange County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer and Riverside 
attorney Kate Squires was so divided that delegates could not generate the 
two-thirds majority needed to endorse either one. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the conditions, one convention delegate described Huffington as 
refreshingly naive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Michael Huffington cares enough to come here knowing that this 
organization will always look at Bill Dannemeyer as their Uncle Bill," the 
delegate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, another moderate Republican and a veteran campaigner, has stayed away 
from the group's conventions partly because an abortion rights supporter will 
never get the group's backing, and also because there is potential for an 
embarrassing protest or prank. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Huffington plunged into the dinner meeting Friday, stepping from table 
to table to shake hands and introduce himself, there were some double-takes and 
disbelieving jabbing of elbows. When Huffington briefly spoke to the group, an 
aide said he was ready for boos and incredulous that there were none. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, at his hospitality suite, Huffington was sometimes forced 
to defend his support for abortion rights, prompting one woman to take his 
hand, shake her head and tell him she will pray for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his reception was cordial. And some CRA leaders said the candidate 
probably helped himself just by showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give respect, you get respect," said Steve Frank, a former CRA president. 
"He understands by his actions that we need a united Republican Party, whereas 
I don't think Wilson has figured that out." 
</P>
<P>
 Public polls show all three GOP Senate candidates struggling in obscurity. But 
state Republican leaders consider Huffington the most likely nominee because he 
is a millionaire who has promised to finance much of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington probably did not change any primary votes here. But CRA President 
Greg Hardcastle said: "If he is the party's nominee, this (appearance) will 
make a difference (in November)."

IN LETTER FOUND AT SCENE, HEBRON MOSQUE KILLER ASKS TO BE ADMITTED TO HEAVEN AS 
RIGHTEOUS JEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hebron mosque killer Baruch Goldstein, in a letter he left behind in the 
shrine, repented his sins and appealed to God to admit him to heaven as a 
righteous Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli inquiry into the Feb. 25 massacre of about 30 Muslim worshipers 
released the text of the letter Sunday night after giving Goldstein's wife the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
 It consisted solely of hymns and prayers and gave no reason for the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, God forbid, I should die, may my death atone for all the sins and 
transgressions I have committed before You, and may You give me a place in 
heaven and admit me to the hidden world of the righteous," wrote the U.S.-born 
settler, a religious Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein titled the letter "A Brief Confession From the Bridge of Life." It 
was found in a bag filled with ammunition clips next to his body after he was 
killed by survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended the letter with two prayers: "Hear, O Israel," which reaffirms faith 
in God and is recited when a Jew believes that he is near death, and "Master of 
the World," a hymn in praise of God that ends with the words, "I shall fear 
not."

LATINO GROUP BACKS NO CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mexican American Political Assn. held its annual endorsement convention 
over the weekend, but failed to endorse any gubernatorial candidates for the 
June primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi led voting 
among members, but neither received the 50% necessary to win endorsement by the 
organization, according to Ruben Treviso, chairman of the group's Whittier 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and Garamendi were the only two major gubernatorial candidates who 
attended the convention, which drew more than 400 people Saturday to the Hyatt 
Regency Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden received 47% of the vote and Garamendi 43%. The front-runners in the 
statewide race, Kathleen Brown and Gov. Pete Wilson, were not eligible because 
they did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong convention included discussions on various issues regarding 
Latinos. Treviso said group officials sought to back candidates who have 
opposed immigrant-bashing.

BARRED FROM ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS FRET AND WAIT; MIDEAST: 'WE'RE IN A BIG 
PRISON,' SAYS A GAZA STRIP RESIDENT. A CABINET DECISION PROLONGS THE EXCLUSION. 
</P>

 The sweet smell of oranges baking under a hot midmorning sun was turning into 
a stink as Mustafa Shahaiba sat Sunday on the ground next to his truck and 
waited, and traced his frustration with a finger in the dirt, and fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 60 tons of oranges. All of us, we have maybe 1,000 tons. We have been 
here since Thursday. Today, they say they will let us in at 7 o'clock. But as 
you see, it is now 10 o'clock. And until this moment, nothing has happened. 
They say: 'Wait.' And that's all they say." 
</P>
<P>
 In the dust and racket of the streets of Gaza City, a few miles away from the 
backed-up delivery trucks at the Israeli border, coffee shops are overflowing 
with clients. Men of all ages listlessly sip the morning away over a cup of tea 
or strong coffee. They lean against shop windows and watch the traffic lurch 
by. They strike up casual conversations over the hood of someone's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us here, we're in a big prison," said Yasser Mabhouh, a 22-year-old 
medical technician student who has not been able to leave Gaza to attend 
college in the West Bank town of Ramallah since late February. He and about 
1,500 other Gaza students have been told that they will never receive 
permission to resume their studies outside Gaza, "which means we will lose 
everything we have studied: in my case, two years of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Israel closed the occupied territories after the Feb. 25 massacre of 
about 30 Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron -- and tightened the seal 
last week -- there is little but waiting, and quiet nurturing of a growing 
fury, for the estimated 25,000 Gaza residents who have been prevented from 
going to work each day in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks aimed at reaching a self-rule accord resumed Sunday in Cairo, but 
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the focus has shifted away from the 
distant dream of autonomy. Now, tens of thousands of workers who can buy food 
just a day at a time wonder only how their families will eat each evening. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet said the closure of the territories, the 
strictest imposed in more than a year, would be in effect until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel TV reported that there are signs the 1.8 million Palestinians of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip could remain substantially sealed off until Israel 
signs a peace agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization -- an event 
that is not foreseen until at least after the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have savings for maybe two months," said Abdelrahim Hassan Hawilli, 36, a 
construction worker in Israel for 18 years. "After that, what can I say? We 
will starve, at least. And I say, at least. There will be starvation for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Gaza Strip, the closure order means economic agony. Unemployment, 
which was already at 35% when Gazans were commuting to work every day in 
Israel, has jumped to an estimated 50% since the lock-down. 
</P>
<P>
 More alarming for Gaza, which more than most West Bank cities owes its 
economic livelihood to jobs in Israel, the Israeli Cabinet has authorized the 
importation of 18,000 foreign workers to take many of the jobs held by 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign laborers, 15,000 in the construction industry and 3,000 for 
agriculture, will receive six-month work permits. New subsidies have been 
ordered to help recruit Israelis for jobs now held by Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet did say it will re-evaluate the closure order at its regular 
meeting next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the order, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel must 
begin freeing itself from its dependence on Palestinian labor, "a dependence 
which forces us to make decisions which endanger the security of civilians." 
</P>
<P>
 The closure order was tightened after eight Israelis died in two Arab 
terrorist attacks in Israel last week. Over the weekend, a Jerusalem woman was 
stabbed in the stomach by a man believed to be an Arab, and a young Hamas 
activist from the Gaza Strip was killed when he tried to attack Israeli 
soldiers with an ax. The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to turn 
Israelis' lives "into hell" in the week leading up to Israel's Independence Day 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinians have to understand there is a price for attacks on 
Israelis," Police Minister Moshe Shahal told the Cabinet on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza, Palestinian leaders see the closure order as a sign of bitter and 
difficult times to come as they attempt to build new lives under the coming 
transitional period of self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that Israel is serious this time, and if so, it will have a 
catastrophic effect -- the Palestinian economy cannot sustain it," said Salah 
Abdel Shafi, director of the Economic Development Group in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 He said both Israelis and Palestinians have agreed on open economic borders in 
negotiations under way in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an Israeli request, to have open borders," Abdel Shafi said. "So now 
Israel, either they need a kind of economic disengagement -- and in this case 
we have a right to prevent Israeli commodities from entering our markets -- or 
they must open borders to allow Palestinian workers. Either they marry, or they 
divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hebron massacre, an estimated 5,000 workers a day were still able to 
cross into Israel from the Gaza Strip. But since Thursday, even those 
permissions have been revoked, and Gaza doctors were complaining Sunday that 16 
patients badly in need of chemotherapy and other treatment in Israel were not 
being permitted to cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Council of Health said 20 Palestinian doctors from the 
territories were barred from reaching a hospital on Jerusalem's Mount of 
Olives, though the army announced that it would allow doctors to travel to 
hospitals in East Jerusalem if they had proper permits from the civil 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Produce truckers said their goods, though technically exempt from the closure 
order, were rotting at the border as Israel refused to allow them through. By 
late Sunday afternoon, most of the backed-up trucks had crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders say Israel, if it is going to continue barring 
Palestinians from work in Israel, must allow immediate relief deliveries and in 
the long run must allow the Palestinians to forge new economic integration with 
Egypt and Jordan. Eventually, Palestinians must develop industries and 
factories of their own, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than $2 billion in outside aid expected to flow into Gaza and 
Jericho during the coming period of self-rule, the construction of new 
infrastructure will provide some new jobs -- perhaps 10,000 to 15,000 in Gaza 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But an accord on Palestinian autonomy signed by Israel and the PLO last 
September carries with it a built-in economic dependence on Israel, Abdel Shafi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moment we agreed on limited political sovereignty we agreed on limited 
economic sovereignty," he said. "I don't think we are going to solve the 
unemployment problem in the short term, or even in the medium term."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON CASTS CONGRESS IN OLD ROLE OF THE EVIL EMPIRE: A 
WRESTLED BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a generation, presidents could sell themselves largely on the basis of one 
issue: how well they handled the Russians. But with Cold War tensions having 
faded, President Clinton has had to search for a new organizing principle for 
his public appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the President and his advisers have settled on such a theme: While past 
presidents could handle Moscow, this one can handle Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach will ring hollow if Clinton's major initiatives, particularly 
his ambitious health care reform plan, run aground in Congress. His record with 
Congress to date, although it contains major victories on the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit, has not 
persuaded the public that Washington has really changed its ways. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, with Congress returning to work today, the next several weeks 
on Capitol Hill could be of great importance to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the President plans a series of events to pressure lawmakers for 
action on a crime bill, which Administration officials had hoped to see signed 
into law by now. After that, Clinton's health care proposals, having made some 
progress in the first stages of legislative action, face key votes in two House 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton's budget, separate versions having passed the House 
and Senate in record time, still must go through a conference committee to 
reconcile differences between the two bills. The Senate is asking for deeper 
spending cuts, which would jeopardize the domestic programs Clinton favors. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that, Clinton's declarations on the health care campaign trail may 
seem a bit premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at what's happened in the last year, there has been a pretty big 
change in the way things work in Washington," Clinton said Friday as he spoke 
to an audience in Minneapolis. Clinton added that he and his congressional 
supporters "were willing to risk their political necks to make tough decisions, 
to stop talking about problems and start doing something about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words, which Clinton repeated constantly over the last week, reflect a 
belief on the part of his advisers, particularly pollster Stanley B. Greenberg, 
that a President's ability to handle Congress has more than ever become a 
crucial dimension that voters use in measuring a chief executive's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 In that view, former President George Bush adopted precisely the wrong 
approach during the 1992 campaign when he blamed Congress for his 
Administration's inability to produce a response to the nation's economic 
problems. Although Bush hoped to capitalize on Congress' unpopularity, 
Clinton's aides said voters simply decided Bush was not up to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean Americans like Congress but rather that they expect to see 
Congress act as the repository of all the nation's warring special interests 
and the President to prevent those interests from causing gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Clinton aides were deeply concerned last summer that a 
failure to pass his budget could leave his presidency crippled. For the same 
reason, they worry that steady Republican opposition to his other proposals, 
particularly health care reform, could badly sour voters' view of the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tries to prevent that from happening, Clinton has begun seeking to milk 
as much as possible from each congressional victory -- a contrast with last 
year when, aides complained, he often moved so fast from one fight to the next 
that even when he won he failed to receive much credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, this Congress, working with me, adopted a budget that brought the 
deficits down," Clinton told his audiences last week. That budget will "give us 
the first three years of declining deficits since Harry S. Truman was President 
of the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress, he went on to say, was "on a record pace" to adopt a new budget for 
this year, had already passed a major education measure and was working on 
legislation dealing with crime, unemployment and, of course, health care. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton seeks to cast his congressional opponents as 
practitioners of ideologically driven partisan politics and his supporters as 
pragmatists just trying to "get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty simple what our strategy is: Get people together, get things 
done, move the country forward, give people the chance to live up to their 
potential," Clinton said in his speech Friday. "I think you hired me to deal 
with the hard problems. So we're trying to deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, some of his opponents try to use each issue "as yet 
another opportunity to take a proposal and push it to the ideological extremes, 
forgetting all about the reality of the tens of millions of people's lives that 
are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, polls indicate that Clinton's approach has had mixed success. A Gallup 
Poll question asking whether Clinton "works well with Congress" has received 
steadily rising positive responses over the last year. In January, the last 
time Gallup asked the question, 72% said Clinton did, while 21% said he did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, when asked if Washington was making significant progress 
against the nation's problems, respondents to several polls, including one by 
The Times, provide less positive answers. A 55% majority in a December Times 
poll, for example, said Washington was making "only some" progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton strategists, however, say they believe that those numbers will move 
steadily upward if two things happen: the nation's economy continues to show 
steady growth and Clinton wins on a few more of his major initiatives, most 
importantly on health care.

AMERICAN ALBUM: VERMONT TAPS INTO ITS SUGARY RITES OF SPRING; TREES ARE 
AWAKENING FROM WINTER HIBERNATION AND SPILLING FORTH THE SAP THAT BECOMES THE 
STATE'S MOST FAMOUS PRODUCT: MAPLE SYRUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Spring comes to Vermont not with a sudden blush of blossoms or a burst of 
cracking ice, but with a slow and silent ritual in the maple groves that speaks 
of winter's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual takes place every year in this season between the seasons, when the 
knee-deep forest snow has turned soft underfoot and Vermont -- the skiers gone, 
the tourists not yet arrived -- belongs again, if only for a brief interlude, 
to Vermonters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although anyone seen wearing sunglasses here is dismissed as an optimist, the 
rites of spring began two weeks ago with what is known simply as sugaring time 
-- the time when maple trees awaken from their winter hibernation and spill 
forth sap that thousands of Vermonters collect and process into the state's 
most famous product: maple syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 The mom-and-pop industry is worth $12 million a year to Vermont, and the 
600,000 or so gallons the state will produce this year represents an important 
source of income for many residents. Vermont is the world's largest producer of 
maple syrup, a product unique to North America. 
</P>
<P>
 With the days warming, the nights still cold and the wind blowing in from the 
west -- conditions that stimulate the flow of sap -- Everett Towne pushed his 
way on snowshoes through the woods the other day, checking the spouts he had 
tapped into his hard-rock maples and the plastic tubing that carries the sap 
from the spouts to the little wooden sugaring house he had built by the brook 
behind his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77-year-old retired woodworker says he remembers when, not long ago, sap 
trickled into buckets that were carried by hand or horse-sled to the sugaring 
house. "When I saw my first pipeline," he recalled, "I said: 'What the hell is 
this? Someone's getting awful lazy.' But the tubes save you lugging. Gravity's 
doing the hard labor now." 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual of sugaring -- a season that ends after a few weeks when warm 
weather cuts off the flow of sap -- started with the Native Americans. They 
used maple syrup as seasoning in almost everything they cooked, from fish to 
meat, and molded candles from syrup that had been boiled down and crystallized 
as maple sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 They traded or sold their larger blocks of maple sugar, carrying them to 
market in specially made birch-bark boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, Vermont has started to market its maple syrup aggressively. 
Last month, the state sent a delegation to a food show in Japan, where chefs 
have discovered that maple syrup makes -- in addition to its traditional uses 
as a topping for pancakes and a sweetener for cookies, pies and baked beans -- 
an excellent marinade for fish and a tasty ingredient for soup. The delegation 
will soon visit Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vermont's real battle is with Americans, who believe that maple syrup is 
just for pancakes. The lion's share of the market belongs to imitation products 
that contain mostly corn syrup, and most Americans who live outside the 
producing areas don't have access to pure maple syrup; many don't know it 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 In Towne's sugarhouse, the water-clear sap bubbled on a steel pan placed atop 
a homemade arch, or wood-burning furnace. Forty gallons of sap must be boiled 
down to make one gallon of pure syrup, and from the cupola of the sugarhouse 
and countless others like it scattered through the countryside, clouds of steam 
pillared into the sky as though winter-weary Vermonters were passing word from 
hilltop to hilltop that sugaring time was progressing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Towne tossed four chunks of wood into the arch. The boiling sap gurgled 
softly. "The biggest mistake people make the first time they do this is let the 
sap go down so fast it burns the pan, and I done that once too," he said. "You 
have to know just the right time to draw off the syrup." 
</P>
<P>
 He dipped a scoop into the evaporation pan and let the near-syrup drip. It 
couldn't be too thin, or thick like molasses. It had to be amber in color, not 
too dark. It had to have a delicate, clear flavor known as "maple bouquet." No, 
Towne decided, the sap wasn't ready, and he sat in a rocking chair by his arch, 
a visored cap that said "Chasin' Rainbows" pushed back on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the wind had turned the afternoon cold, and dark shadows from the 
rustling, leafless maples reached across the snow. But here in the sugarhouse 
there was warmth and brightness and the sound of the roaring fire. And the 
boiling sap came to Towne like a song of spring.

DIVIDED CYPRIOT COMMUNITIES GET TOGETHER FOR A BATTLE -- BUT NO BULLETS FLY, 
ONLY DARTS 
</P>

<P>
 When Turkish and Greek Cypriots took aim Sunday, it wasn't at each other. The 
best-flung darts went straight to the bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Busloads of Cypriots, nominally enemies, gathered here from both sides of the 
Green Line for an unconventional bid for peace on the divided island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to play darts and to prove that we can be together," said 
Mustafa Bolkaner, a used-car dealer from the Turkish Cypriot half of the 
divided capital, Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
 The First All Cyprus Darts Tournament was the first major sporting event 
between the two Cypriot communities since the eastern Mediterranean island 
gained independence from Britain in 1960, organizer Tom Thoupos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty Turkish Cypriot dart players and scores of friends and fans trooped 
through barbed-wire barricades at the U.N.-administered checkpoint to line up 
against 88 Greek Cypriot challengers at Nicosia's Hilton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament was meant to show that ordinary people -- car mechanics and 
cooks, salesmen and secretaries -- don't care much about the "Cyprus Problem."

FRENCH RESISTANCE FIGHTERS HONORED ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF LIBERATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Francois Mitterrand, launching 50th anniversary commemorations of 
France's liberation, paid tribute Sunday to young Resistance fighters killed 
not long before D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand led about 3,000 survivors and relatives of the fallen in a moving 
ceremony commemorating members of the Maquis -- the partisan bands, which took 
their name from the shrubby Mediterranean flora -- who faced German mountain 
troops and French collaborators in a battle on the snowy Plateau des Glieres in 
March, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting was the first major open battle mounted by the Resistance against 
the occupiers and took place just weeks before the June 6 Allied landings in 
Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragedy that ended in blood and in horror," Mitterrand said of the 
heavy casualties suffered by the Maquisards and locals. 
</P>
<P>
 The small cemetery where Mitterrand paid tribute contains the graves of 105 of 
the 149 partisans killed in the battle. About 900 civilians, accused of backing 
the Resistance, were deported to German concentration camps.

 Engineers working frantically on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean fixed a 
broken radar on the space shuttle Endeavour, and the instrument was operating 
perfectly, the Kennedy Space Center reported. The fix will allow the shuttle to 
create an unprecedented three-dimensional map of Earth's mountains, volcanoes, 
forests, deserts, oceans and rivers. After tedious testing, engineers in Europe 
and at the Johnson Space Center in Houston had traced the problem to a bad 
sensor in a low-voltage safety circuit inside the high-power amplifier for one 
of the radars.

MOST SAY 'DEFENDANT AS VICTIM' STRATEGY IS OVERUSED, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of those questioned in a poll published today say they believe that 
the portrayal of defendants as victims, as in the Lorena Bobbitt and Menendez 
brothers cases, has gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are contained in a poll on public attitudes about crime published 
in the current issue of the National Law Journal.The survey of 800 people 
nationwide was conducted last month by Penn & Schoen Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The study showed that 59% of the respondents say they believe that the 
"defendant as victim" strategy is being overused, whereas 30% say many people 
legitimately commit crimes as a result of some suffering they have endured. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, 51% said juries are being duped when they take into 
account all of the circumstances of an accused person's life. A third said they 
believe that juries are doing a better job at administering justice by doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two percent of the poll respondents said they would have convicted 
Bobbitt of maliciously wounding her husband by cutting off his penis. Of those, 
62% were men and 43% were women. Bobbitt was acquitted after the jury found she 
was temporarily insane. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lyle and Erik Menendez's cases, 68% said they would have found the brothers 
guilty of murdering their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-nine percent of the poll respondents said they believe that the most 
compelling argument to excuse someone for a serious crime is a mother 
protecting her children from an abusive father.

 Blacks may be biologically more likely than whites to develop lung cancer from 
smoking, according to a study released at a cancer conference in San Francisco. 
The results are particularly relevant because cigarette manufacturers have been 
accused of aggressively targeting blacks in their marketing campaigns, said 
John Richie of the American Health Foundation, which conducted the study. "Our 
initial data seem to indicate that blacks have a poorer capacity than whites to 
detoxify NNK, one of the most important tobacco-related carcinogens linked to 
lung cancer," Richie told a meeting of the American Assn. for Cancer Research.

N. KOREA GETS 6-MONTH DEADLINE TO ALLOW INSPECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday that diplomatic efforts to 
get North Korea to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities 
will last another six months. 
</P>
<P>
 But, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press" program, he warned North Korea not to 
use the time to develop its nuclear program, saying that would change the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think that Secretary Perry's use of six months is not a bad period of 
time," Christopher said, referring to comments made by Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Secretary Perry said last week, he does not see the need for a preemptive 
strike at the present time," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diplomacy is continuing," he added. "At the same time, I want to emphasize we 
don't rule in or out any of the options over the longer term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly agree that if the situation goes on the way it is without the 
inspections being accepted, then we have a much more serious problem as time 
goes on," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has sent a Patriot antimissile battalion to South Korea and 
is scheduling military maneuvers on the peninsula to pressure North Korea to 
open its nuclear facilities to U.N. inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 But North Korea has rejected the demands and accused the United States of 
provoking a war. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher rejected statements from Moscow on Friday that Russia might have 
to side with North Korea under the terms of a treaty signed when it was part of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that statement's an accurate reflection of Russian policy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians have been very cooperative with us at the United Nations and 
elsewhere in trying to put pressure on the North Koreans to permit these 
inspections," Christopher said. "I think that Russia has exactly the same 
policy we do, and that is they want to have a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula."

CHIEF OF SCHOOLS IN NEW YORK CITY WILL NOT RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's school chancellor withdrew his resignation Sunday after reaching a 
compromise with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Cortines had said Friday that he was resigning after less than a year as 
head of the nation's largest school system because of differences with the 
mayor over education spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani had named former U.S. Rep. Herman Badillo as fiscal monitor, and 
Cortines said that would undermine his position. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Sunday's agreement, Badillo will remain in that post but with a title 
that does not include the word monitor . 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's meeting between Cortines and the mayor was largely arranged by Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo. He said he called the two Saturday and suggested that they 
could resolve their differences without either conceding any authority to the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest school system has a $7.3-billion budget. New York City 
has about 1,000 public schools and 1 million students. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortines came to New York from San Francisco. His resignation would have taken 
effect June 30.

COBAIN'S WIDOW READS PARTS OF SUICIDE NOTE AT SEATTLE VIGIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain's widow read parts of his suicide note in an angry, vulgar taped 
message to thousands of Nirvana fans gathered for a candlelight vigil Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain, 27, whose anguished lyrics helped sell millions of records featuring 
Nirvana's guitar-gritty sound since 1991, was found Friday in the home he 
shared with his wife, Courtney Love, and their toddler daughter. He died of a 
self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't felt the excitement for so many years," Love read from the note. "I 
felt guilty for so many years. The fact is I can't fool you, any one of you. 
The worst crime is faking it." 
</P>
<P>
 Love interrupted her narrative to add: "No, the worst crime is leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the passion anymore," Cobain wrote, and, borrowing from a Neil 
Young song, added: "It's better to burn out than to fade away." 
</P>
<P>
 But Love added on tape to the crowd: "Don't believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 4,000 to 5,000 near the Space Needle heard a poetry reading, then 
Love's tape and an exhortation from a crisis counselor who advised distraught 
fans not to hurt themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reading the note, Love described it as "a letter to the editor." She 
said she was omitting parts of it addressed to her because "it's none of your . 
. . business." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Space Needle observance continued, Love, other family members and 
friends privately gathered a few blocks away for their own unannounced memorial 
service at Unity Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's problems were well documented: heroin addiction, discomfort with 
celebrity, domestic disputes and, last month, a near-fatal ingestion of drugs 
and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the same way you guys do, I feel so horrible," Love said. "I don't 
know how it happened. I knew it was going to happen, but it could have happened 
when he was 40."

HIDDEN HILLS LIKES ITS POLITICS OUT OF VIEW; ELECTION: RESIDENTS VALUE THEIR 
PRIVACY. CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES MAKE NO BONES ABOUT THEIR TIGHT-LIPPED WAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Name a politician who scoffs at press coverage, ignores reporters, doesn't 
return telephone calls -- all just one week before a big election -- and 
chances are they live in Hidden Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all five City Council candidates for this Tuesday's election in the 
eccentric, aggressively smug gated and guarded city in the west San Fernando 
Valley are a bit press shy. And who can blame them? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is Hidden Hills, as people here like to say -- one of the 
first walled cities in California, a place where people value their privacy as 
they would a precious gem. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a 1.6-square-mile fortressed community where hidden (there's that word 
again) cameras record the license plate of every car that enters, a place where 
a Times reporter and photographer seeking out burning campaign issues were 
escorted out by a private security guard after they began questioning residents 
and workers outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Hidden Hills," explained one city employee. "Nobody just comes in 
here and starts asking questions. We're just not used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates seeking three council seats also make no bones about their 
taciturn, tight-lipped ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, really, this is Hidden Hills," said one council candidate who 
(naturally) asked not to be named. "Around here, a council seat is like running 
for some class office in high school. People tend to vote for those they know 
or like. There aren't any burning issues. This isn't Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not. In Hidden Hills, candidates don't stump to gain votes, although 
they might appear on the city's special cable channel, where homeowners ask 
pointed questions about which side of the line a candidate falls: Does he 
prefer horseback riding or tennis? What will he do about crime that might be 
generated by that new shopping complex in nearby Calabasas? 
</P>
<P>
 In Hidden Hills, the candidates filed the political short form with government 
officials, avoiding the countless forms and regular election red tape by 
agreeing to spend less than $1,000 on their campaigns and accepting no 
political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 In this city of walls, the only candidate money being spent is on postage to 
send a political postcard or two to registered voters. With only 1,700 
residents, there aren't many voters to worry about. And as far as returning 
calls to reporters? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem for you guys, not for us," said candidate Stuart Siegel. "I 
hope this doesn't sound hokey, but we're all just friends here. In Hidden 
Hills, political office is a volunteer kind of thing, like being on the board 
of directors of some charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're volunteering to work in a tiny community of a few hundred voters. So, 
there's no need for publicity, no need to take political shots at one another. 
The dynamics are different here, it's a civilized kind of thing. I mean, one of 
the candidates is a guy I car-pool with, another I vacation with. If I don't 
win, it doesn't matter. We'll still work together. That's the way it is in 
Hidden Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there has been a sense of cultured diffidence to Hidden Hills ever 
since the walls went up around the place back in the 1950s. People moved there 
to get away from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, incorporating in 1961 to 
stop the progress of Burbank Boulevard, which would have cut the community in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's a different world -- a community of million-dollar-and-up homes that 
sit on acre-sized lots, where horse trails have replaced sidewalks, where every 
home is surrounded by a mandatory white picket fence and cutesy white sign that 
announces the family name. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place run by two equally powerful governments -- a City Council and a 
homeowners association that divide responsibilities to see that Hidden Hills 
stays just the way it is. The association, for example, owns and maintains the 
roads while the city government manages the stop signs. But there's no 
downtown. No stores. No businesses. No stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one pay phone located outside City Hall, the place that bears the 
placard that reads "On this site in 1897, nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, elections were canceled because no one challenged the 
incumbents. On rare occasions, however, politics can get wild here. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 residents threw out three council members for proposing a low-income 
senior-citizen housing project that was part of a government requirement to 
provide the community with $100 million in redevelopment funds for a flood 
repair project. 
</P>
<P>
 Then residents disbanded the redevelopment agency, canceled a deal with a 
developer and fired their city attorney. When the developer sued, Hidden Hills 
settled out of court for $1 million rather than erect the senior housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we're a little standoffish here," says Andy Andrews, a Hidden Hills 
resident for the past 27 years, whose white family sign also bears the greeting 
"Huddle by the Puddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say their coolness doesn't come from any phony Hollywood-type 
exclusivity, even though the city has played past or present home to such 
personalities as actors Beau Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner, entertainers Bob 
Eubanks and Tony Orlando, comics Sinbad and Howie Mandel and the late singers 
Sarah Vaughan and Marvin Gaye. And Eric Wright, a rapper known as Eazy-E and 
former member of the group NWA, owns a home there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of personal privacy," Andrews continues. "We moved here for 
privacy. People who want to do that are by nature a little standoffish, don't 
you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents can't understand why outsiders won't let Hidden Hills remain, 
well, hidden . 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that it leaves such a bad taste in people's mouths just because you 
have a community of people in expensive homes who just want to close themselves 
off from all the crime and the rest of it in the city at large," asks Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
 "That idea just seems to strike such a chord with people, as if there's 
something wrong with it. Believe me, once you get inside these gates, there's 
nothing terribly exciting going on here. There's nobody inviting me to hot tub 
parties. It's very low-key. You'll probably find a disproportionately large 
number of family-oriented people, a lot more dads who coach Little League 
per-cubic-foot than the population at large." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's that nagging sense that Hidden Hills residents want the rest of 
the world to just go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're real hidden, aren't they?" asks Calabasas Mayor Marvin Lopata. "They 
just don't seem to extend themselves like the rest of the communities in the 
West Valley. We have community meetings and Hidden Hills always just sends 
their city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a really nice woman, I'm sure. But here we are, all these mayors and 
pro tems, and their mayor isn't there. I don't even know who their mayor pro 
tem is, to be honest with you, or if they even have one. The point is, they 
don't seem to want to participate in any of the community functions. I think 
they just want to keep to themselves. That's certainly the message they send 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, not all is bucolic even behind the walls of Hidden Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is a rift of sorts that has cracked the foundation of this 
walled paradise. Newer residents, many of whom have paid $3 million or more for 
their homes, have sought to leave their stamp on the community, say older 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the carpeted recesses of homeowners meetings, residents are duking out a 
proposal to streamline the assessment of homeowner fees, which are now based on 
a home's selling price. Those who bought more recently into the community want 
to see an even fee collected. But residents who have lived there for decades 
like things just the way they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some older residents are miffed over a plan to spend between $10,000 and 
$20,000 of homeowner funds on a catered welcoming party for new residents, 
saying that in their days a simple potluck dinner always did the job, a night 
when somebody "dropped a vodka bottle into punch at Peggy Blalock's house." 
</P>
<P>
 "This community is a different place today than it used to be," said retired 
attorney Warren McCament, a former council member. "The new blood has come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to build larger homes and it's split the community. This used to be 
a friendly place, but not anymore. I've never seen such resentment. I for one, 
don't want to see Hidden Hills turn into any Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime resident Eleanor DeCarteret has also felt the tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people are as friendly as they used to be," she said. "I try to 
wave to people when I'm in my front yard pulling weeds. But with the new ones, 
sometimes they wave, sometimes not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the coming election may bring some changes to Hidden Hills. But in the 
outside world, the impression is the community will remain pretty much the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year, officials plan to open up a new City Hall, where residents 
and outsiders can conduct official business. It will, however, be located just 
outside the city limits. After all, this is Hidden Hills. Hidden Hills Profile

UNDER-30 SET IS JOINING POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT; GOVERNMENT: O.C. CITIES TRYING 
TO TAP INTO FRESH IDEAS ARE COURTING A CADRE OF YOUNG ADULTS FOR SERVICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Tony Espinoza knew long ago that he wanted to dive into politics -- but he 
didn't expect he would be running for a Santa Ana City Council seat so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his twentysomething contemporaries, Espinoza, 26, has zigzagged 
from college classes to his job, looking for the right break. That break came a 
year and a half ago, when he was appointed to Santa Ana's Planning Commission 
at the age of 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to be involved in my city, but I wasn't sure how," said 
Espinoza, a Cal State Fullerton business student. Joining a commission made his 
decision to campaign for the City Council in this November's election "that 
much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza belongs to a cadre of young people who local governments are trying 
to attract for advisory boards, commissions and committees in an effort to tap 
into youthful ideas for a more representative government. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, for example, the 15-member Youth Action Team comprises students 
from four high schools who advise the City Council about the concerns of young 
residents. Tustin has a committee on youth issues, which includes three local 
high school and middle school students. 
</P>
<P>
 "City officials are realizing that you need to include citizens regardless of 
their age, if you're going to provide services" for them, said Sheri Erlewine, 
spokeswoman for the League of California Cities. "We need to have their views 
about a variety of city issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bartlett, president of the League of California Cities and mayor of 
Monrovia, agreed. The league is trying to bring more teen-agers into the circle 
of government this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to start looking outward and including young people in the 
decision-making process," Bartlett said. "I think it's going to be the trend" 
for local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 To some young adults, participating in local government is a steppingstone -- 
or test of mettle -- for political office. To others, it's a way to ensure that 
their voices, the opinions of the under-30 set, get equal time before 
decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza said he finds his work on the Planning Commission rewarding because 
he has learned how city infrastructure is built and how the city staffs work. 
It also makes him want to affect other city issues far from his grasp as a 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Orange Coast College, Espinoza has been a deputy probation 
officer for six years and counsels youths at Juvenile Hall. He landed the job a 
few years after graduating from Valley High School, where he was student body 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 School government is how he met Ted Moreno, 26, former student body president 
of Santa Ana High School, who was elected to the Santa Ana City Council in 
1992. Moreno appointed Espinoza as a planning commissioner last year. Of the 10 
people Moreno appointed to city boards, eight were under age 30, the councilman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see more young people involved to prove that the next generation 
can do something and be productive in cities," said Moreno, who is running for 
the state Assembly in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim has its own youthful aspirant in 20-year-old Fullerton College student 
Manuel Ontiveros. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros ran for Anaheim City Council -- unsuccessfully -- in 1992, at the 
age of 18. He was a member of Anaheim's now-defunct Youth Commission and still 
serves on the city's Parks and Recreation Commission. He also works part time 
as a reservations clerk at the Disneyland Hotel and interns for County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner appointed him to the county's Human Relations Commission about two 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good role model for young people, and I felt he would bring a youth 
perspective to the Human Relations Commission," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission "should reflect diversity throughout a county of 2.5 million, 
and certainly the perspective of young people is an important one," Steiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to turn all this over to them some day," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros held the post of student body president at Savannah High School, but 
when he got to college, he looked beyond school government. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I can make a change in my entire community being active in city 
politics," he said. "On a campus, you just focus on that campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Participating in local government gives young adults a "taste of what local 
governments face," said David Mars, professor emeritus of Public Administration 
at USC. "Even if they don't go into politics, it would make them better 
informed citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's about getting the voices of the young generation heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza's 22-year-old wife, Aida, a Rancho Santiago Community College 
student, is no political aspirant, but she joined the Santa Ana Human Relations 
Commission because she wants better services for Latino residents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I got involved, I hoped to do something about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aida Espinoza said that despite the snail's pace at which government sometimes 
operates, participating is worth the effort because it allows her to register 
her opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience also has mellowed her fervor, she admits. "Once you're in a 
group and have to accomplish something, you have to learn to meet people 
halfway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros said he tries to advocate recreational activities and classes that 
young people want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I think other (older) commissioners overlook youth activities," 
said Ontiveros, who will enroll at UC Irvine next fall as a criminology major. 
"There are a lot of senior citizens on a lot of boards and commissions, and 
sometimes they don't think that when you start cutting programs you shouldn't 
cut after-school programs for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Espinoza said he wants to take his concern for youths, especially the 
ones from gang neighborhoods in his hometown of Santa Ana, to higher office. He 
plans to run for the City Council in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my age . . . I could come in with fresh ideas on working with 
kids," he said, noting that he knows former classmates who are in gangs but was 
never tempted to join one himself. "Maybe I could show kids that another person 
(who grew up) with similar circumstances could make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros said that many young adults feel they live a world away from the 
governmental decisions that affect them. They do not believe they are part of 
"the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take education fee hikes, for example," he said. "Students are hurting, but a 
lot of the time, they're not the voting segment of the society. . . . If young 
people would get out and vote and be active, they'd have more of a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin tries to give its teen-agers a voice by putting them on an advisory 
board, in an effort to assure the city's youth that they have input into the 
projects the city envisions for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense in putting in a program if the kids don't want it," said 
Tustin Councilwoman Leslie Pontius, who works with Mayor Jim Potts on the 
city's youth committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, the Youth Action Team presents quarterly forums on matters high 
school students want to discuss. Recently, they invited students to talk with 
several Irvine police officers about conflicts between police and young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Action Team members, who are paid $5.98 an hour and put in five-hour 
weeks, also run a yearly survey to tap the voices of Irvine youth and listen to 
their concerns. The group presents its findings to the City Council in a "State 
of the Youth" address. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among people I knew, there was a disillusioned attitude toward the community, 
school and police," said Luke Fenchel, 17, a junior at University High School 
and Youth Action Team member. "Teens in Irvine sometimes don't feel like 
they're heard. A lot of problems come from people not feeling a part of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros admitted that he gets frustrated at how powerless advisory bodies 
sometimes seem, but he would rather participate in them than assail them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people like to criticize government and criticize the system," he 
said. "But if you don't work with the system, you can't change it."

THE DEATH MARCH; A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS REMEMBER THE INFAMOUS TREK ON BATAAN 
PENINSULA IN THE PHILIPPINES IN WWII. IN A PRISONERS' PARADE OF HORROR, IT WAS 
. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even as the United States commemorates the 50th anniversary of World War II, 
Army veteran Ken Hale is still amazed at how little many Americans know about 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, 72, and his friend Joe Verdugo, 74, both served in the Army's 31st 
Infantry Regiment in the Philippines at the beginning of the war in December, 
1941, and are survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March. Both men became 
prisoners of war 52 years ago this month, when U.S. and Filipino troops 
surrendered to the Japanese army on April 9, 1942, after nearly four months of 
bloody fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, of Garden Grove, has become disheartened to learn recently that Bataan 
and the march have faded from most people's memories and are not even a 
footnote in some history books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was discussing the war with four young high school graduates. Only one knew 
there had been a World War II and none had ever heard about the Bataan Death 
March. It hurts. It's painful, especially when people from the Vietnam 
generation, who are my kids' age, tell me they don't know about Bataan," Hale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When news of the death march reached the United States, Americans rallied 
around the cry "Remember Bataan," as the nation intensified the task of 
training an army and manufacturing the arms and equipment needed to win the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation was shocked by reports of the 60-mile death march. About 72,000 
U.S. and Filipino troops, many of them wounded, walked up to six days in the 
tropical sun with little water, food and almost no sleep. Nobody knows how many 
prisoners died during the march. Japanese guards bayoneted stragglers and shot 
those who left the column to drink from the artesian springs that lined part of 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon A. Alcaraz, 79, a Filipino naval officer who also survived the march, 
said the Japanese guards' brutality "was due to madness." Alcaraz, who lives in 
Orange, was a lieutenant when the war began and went on to become 
chief-of-staff of the Philippine Navy and graduated from the U.S. War College 
in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo, an Anaheim resident, weighed 198 pounds when he was captured and only 
90 pounds when he was liberated after the war. Hale was also a 90-pound 
skeleton when he was released, down from 170 when he was captured. The two men 
ended the war working as virtual slave laborers in defense plants in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale and Verdugo have been friends for almost three decades.  
</P>
<P>
 Although they were in the same regiment, they did not know each other on 
Bataan and were in different groups during the grueling march from the 
peninsula north to Camp O'Donnell, a U.S. Army base converted into a prisoner 
of war camp by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The march began almost immediately after the surrender of the U.S. and 
Filipino forces, who were outnumbered 7 to 1 and capitulated after almost 
running out of food, medicine and ammunition. At the end, the Americans were 
eating the few remaining horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese troops had captured Hong Kong, Singapore, Java and other allied bases 
with ease, after attacking Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. When the main Japanese 
assault on the Philippines began on Dec. 22, Lt. Gen. Masaharu Homma was given 
50 days to conquer the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We whipped the first bunch because we were only outnumbered 2 to 1. When they 
came back, they outnumbered us 7 to 1," said Verdugo, who served in the 
infantry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, a medic, worked in a field hospital taking care of the wounded. He said 
the hospital was bombed by Japanese planes on April 8, the day before the 
surrender, killing about 200 wounded soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every (hospital) building had a red cross painted on it. We had also sewn 
together several sheets, painted a giant red cross on it and laid it on the 
ground. They knew they were bombing a hospital. The cross ended up being a hell 
of a target," said Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 Each man has indelible memories of the march and his experience as a prisoner 
of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you forget the brutalities? I saw a Filipino soldier make a dash for 
one of the artesian springs. The Japanese guards walked a few feet, leveled 
their rifles and shot him. An American was completely exhausted and crawled 
into a ditch. A Japanese guard walked over and bayoneted him," said Alcaraz. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the third day of the march a major was ready to collapse and told the 
Japanese he wasn't going any further," Verdugo said. "A guard took a whip and 
started whipping him like a horse. We continued walking but could still hear 
the beating. The last thing I heard was a grunt, when the major was bayoneted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, who has never been able to overcome the bitterness he feels toward the 
Japanese, still remembers the words of a Japanese officer who addressed some of 
the U.S. prisoners in broken English before the march began. According to Hale, 
the officer said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan and America are enemies and will remain enemies. I hope all of you die, 
and many of you will die." 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. prisoners arrived at Camp O'Donnell, they were separated in 
groups of 10. They were told that if anyone in the group escaped, the others 
would be shot. In the struggle to survive, many Americans turned on each other, 
Hale and Verdugo said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few months at the camp, Verdugo and another prisoner made plans to 
escape. But they were betrayed by other Americans before the escape plan was 
completed, Verdugo said. As punishment, he and the other man were forced to 
kneel on gravel for 12 hours, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've turned Joe in, too. If they were in my group, and I knew they were 
going to try to escape, I would've turned them in. It was like that. Everybody 
wanted to live," said Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 However, death was a daily occurrence at Camp O'Donnell, said Hale, who, with 
other medics, tried to take care of wounded and sick prisoners. But working 
without any medicines, the best they could do was make the men comfortable as 
they waited to die from the effects of dysentery, diphtheria, malaria, 
beatings, starvation and other maladies, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale says thousands of Filipinos and Americans died during the first four 
months of captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on burial detail and can tell you that at one point there were 500 men 
dying each day. I know, because I counted them," said Verdugo. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcaraz, who was in command of a PT boat when he was taken prisoner, said he 
and his six other crew members were luckier than many of the Filipinos and 
Americans who were fighting on Bataan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in better physical shape to begin with because we were eating 
relatively well before the surrender. The guys on Bataan were surrounded with 
no way in or out. So, the march wasn't as bad on us," said Alcaraz, who 
eventually escaped to fight with the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the battle for Bataan, rumors spread through the U.S. and Filipino 
ranks that supplies and reinforcements were steaming across the Pacific Ocean 
from the United States in a convoy of ships that stretched 100 miles. This 
false hope encouraged the defenders to continue fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept waiting for that 100-mile convoy that we heard was crossing the 
ocean, coming from America to rescue us. We waited, hoping the story was true. 
When we surrendered, it was one of the darkest days in my life. It was like the 
end of the world," said Alcaraz.

STATUE A TRIBUTE TO SLAIN ACTIVIST; MEMORIAL: AT UNVEILING, HUNDREDS HONOR 
PALESTINIAN AMERICAN ALEX ODEH, KILLED BY A BOMB IN 1985. HE IS REMEMBERED AS 
'AN ADVOCATE FOR JUSTICE FOR HIS PEOPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 500 people gathered outside the city's main library Sunday to 
witness the unveiling of a nine-foot bronze statue of Alex Odeh, a prominent 
Palestinian American activist slain in a 1985 bomb attack. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no arrests for Odeh's death since the booby-trap bombing of 
the Santa Ana offices of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, where 
he was head of the group's western region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex Odeh . . . was an advocate for justice for his people," said Rabbi 
Arnold Rachlis of the University Synagogue of Irvine, one of several speakers 
representing a cross-section of the Orange County community who gathered at the 
Civic Center. "He championed Palestinian rights, not because he wished to deny 
those of others, but because he wanted his people's voice to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The statue, created by political cartoonist and sculptor Khalil Bendib of 
Diamond Bar, is the only full-length outdoor statue honoring an Arab American 
in Southern California and perhaps in the entire country, said Julie Silliman, 
the California project director of Save Our Statues, a Smithsonian-funded 
organization that tracks 52,000 statues nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The unveiling, which was performed by Odeh's widow, Norma, his brother Sami 
Odeh and other members of the Odeh family, was greeted with applause by the 
hundreds who came to pay tribute, including members of the Jewish and Muslim 
communities, local politicians and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendib was among those who praised Odeh as a courageous peacemaker, respectful 
of those who disagreed with him while steadfastly outspoken for the cause of 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me . . . erecting this statue has been a cathartic experience, a way of 
coming to terms with our pain and tragic loss," Bendib said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Alex Odeh was a tireless worker for peace and harmony," said the Paris-born 
Bendib, who came to California in 1977 at age 20 after living in Morocco and 
Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the current climate of rising acrimony and xenophobia toward immigrants, 
this statue will remind the world what America has always stood for: peace, 
tolerance and harmony," Bendib said. "It will remind us that an attack on any 
particular group is an attack on all groups." 
</P>
<P>
 The statue features what Bendib termed a romanticized rendering of Odeh in an 
Arabic robe holding a book and a dove of peace. A plaque at the base reads in 
part: "He taught the gentle wisdom of his land and sang the beauty of God's 
creation. To him Jews, Christians, Muslims, all were the children of Abraham." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the succession of speakers each lauded Odeh's memory, Albert 
Mokhiber, president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, also 
called for the arrest and conviction of Odeh's assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to have a statue of Alex, it's another thing to have justice 
for Alex," Mokhiber said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Mokhiber referred to the Jewish Defense League as "the group that 
is suspected of taking Alex's life." After the ceremony, Mokhiber said he was 
referring to Robert Manning, an Israeli and former JDL activist, and two other 
men. Manning was recently sentenced to life in prison for an unrelated 
mail-bomb killing of a Manhattan Beach computer company secretary in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, whom federal authorities have described as the prime suspect, has 
never been charged in the Odeh killing. Manning had fought extradition from 
Israel for two years before he was brought to California to be tried for the 
1980 bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 The JDL could not be reached for comment late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mokhiber also was critical Sunday of the White House for reportedly failing to 
send a letter paying tribute to Odeh, as did other political figures, ranging 
from U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) to California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 All speakers, however, praised Odeh as a gentle but courageous leader of the 
Arab American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Odeh, born in Jifna, Palestine, arrived in the United States in 1972 and 
obtained a master's degree at Cal State Fullerton, where he later taught Arabic 
for free. In 1975, he and his bride settled in Fullerton and two years later he 
became a naturalized citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 While participating in dialogues with the Jewish community as an advocate for 
a just peace in the Middle East, Odeh joined the American Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee in 1982 and was named as its West Coast regional 
director a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare public appearance to speak about her husband, Norma Odeh's voice 
cracked with emotion as she noted that his memory "will be preserved with the 
honor and dignity he deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Sami Odeh told the gathered crowd that his brother "was not a coward. Alex 
always functioned in the sunlight. Alex believed that only cowards, like his 
assassins, will seek darkness to cover their evil."

BOARD TO CONSIDER BUILDING LOANS FOR LOW-COST HOUSING; SHELTER: MONEY WOULD 
HELP BUILD 328 UNITS IN IRVINE AND FULLERTON. PROJECTS WOULD HELP CUT INTO A 
BACKLOG OF 6,000 NEEDY PEOPLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to ease continued shortages in Orange County's affordable housing 
market, the Board of Supervisors this week will consider loans of nearly $3 
million to help build 328 low-income units in Irvine and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects would help cut into a backlog of about 6,000 needy people who now 
wait an average of four years for vacancies in local government-assisted 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very significant developments and will guarantee affordable housing 
for a very long period of time," said Rick Efker, the county's director of 
community development. "We're very glad to have the financing settled. But it 
seems that how ever hard you work on this problem is never enough to meet the 
need of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 County Housing Director Dhongchai (Bob) Pusavat said that the need for 
low-cost housing has become so great in recent months that "people are becoming 
desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one woman come up to me in the hall outside my office and say, 'Bob, 
either you get me in (housing) or you'll suffer the consequences.' It's sad to 
see people like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine and Fullerton facilities represent major advancements in the 
county's overall housing strategy, which has seen the development of 1,400 
low-income units throughout the county in the past three years.  
</P>
<P>
 In virtually all cases, the county has joined with cities and private 
developers to help pay for the projects, some specifically designed for 
families, the elderly, physically disabled or single and married residents who 
cannot afford market-rate housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both projects will be operated as hotel-style efficiencies to accommodate 
predominantly single or married couples who earn less than half of the county's 
median income or $18,450 for individuals. Units are expected to rent for less 
than $400 per month in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to satisfy every need," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, 
who has promoted the development of affordable housing throughout the county. 
"This is a way for people to get in and begin to crawl their way up the 
ladder." 
</P>
<P>
 While the projects enjoy broad support among county officials, both proposals 
have been met with strong opposition along the way toward approval in their 
respective cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, opponents of the so-called Irvine Inn were concerned that the 
city's industrial area was not a proper place for a residential hotel. The 
2.4-acre site is located at Warner and Jamboree roads, next to the Tustin 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 But housing advocates have argued that the site would serve as a home for 
people who work in Irvine, but cannot afford to live in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was finally approved in January by the City Council after nearly a 
year of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never said it was an ideal location," said Irvine Councilwoman Paula 
Werner, "but I believe it is a workable one. It's just one piece in the housing 
puzzle, and we have to get a variety of pieces together before we solve the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the county would loan $2 million to developer Shawntana 
Management Corp. toward the total $9.7-million project cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the rooms would be furnished and 275 square feet in size. They will 
include full baths, kitchenettes with a microwave, sink, garbage disposal, 
countertops and cabinet space. The property will also be designed with common 
areas for recreation, a landscaped courtyard and a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, the only serious dispute centered on selection of a developer 
for the $6.2-million project slated for construction at 224 E. Commonwealth 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Chris Norby favored Fullerton developer Tony Bushala for the 
project, but the council later voted to begin negotiations with Urban 
Communities/San Gabriel Partners of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the proposed agreement, the county would lend $900,000 to the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the Fullerton rooms would come furnished with a bed, night stand, 
lamps, color television and air conditioning. Residents also would have access 
to a common gym, library and reading area, television and laundry rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other hotel-style project exists in Orange County. Costa Mesa Village 
opened about nine months ago, and Pusavat said all 96 rooms are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of facilities are definitely in demand," Pusavat said. "This is 
the right time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the county has drawn its funding from a previously unavailable 
$15-million reserve account. Pusavat said the money was freed only after 
housing advocates battled with local government housing officials to change the 
county's conservative philosophy toward low-income housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine and Fullerton projects, which will be considered by supervisors on 
Tuesday, would be among the last funded through the reserve account until it is 
replenished with loan repayments by the private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is getting the product out there to help the people," Pusavat 
said. "I'm satisfied that we are doing that."

CITIZENS CLAMOR FOR A MOMENT OF (OLD) GLORY AT THE CAPITOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patriotism has its price, but it ain't much: $10.27. 
</P>
<P>
 For this relatively meager sum, hundreds of Orange County citizens have had 
the flag of the United States of America flown in their honor over the Capitol 
of the United States of America, then packed with a fancy certificate and 
shipped to their homes, postage included. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the flag stays up there around half a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run it up to the top of the pole, pause and bring it back down," said 
William Raines, spokesman for the Architect of the Capitol, which handles 
flag-flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care," responded Wayne Markison of Huntington Beach, who bought four 
of them. "It flew." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, environmentalists will plant you a tree. In Berlin, you can get 
a hunk of the wall. Here in Washington, they fly you a flag, a practice so 
popular the Capitol installed six flagpoles precisely for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 A Flag Office had to be created to handle the demand -- as many as 350 a day. 
It takes three full-time typists to keep up with all the certificates, and the 
backlog is weeks long. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) recently 
informed his constituents of the flag offer, and his office promptly was 
inundated with nearly 700 orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crazy," an aide said happily. "The office filled up with flag boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 People give flags as wedding gifts, to commemorate the births of babies, to 
celebrate Eagle Scout status. One guy had it flown the day his divorce was 
final. "We try to avoid that kind of thing. This is something very honored," 
Christine Benza, Flag Office supervisor, admonished. 
</P>
<P>
 It is said that Frank Sinatra has one. Markison bought one for himself and 
gave three to his parents and two sisters in the Midwest for Christmas 
presents. He's saving his to fly on the flagpole of his front lawn on Fourth of 
July, his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so patriotic. They want so badly to have a flag. It tells a story 
in itself," Benza said. She has been working in the Flag Office for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekday at about 12:30 p.m., a crew goes to the roof of the Capitol's 
west front with a bunch of flags and starts raising. The flag-studded 
certificate attests that "This flag was flown in honor of (your name here)." 
</P>
<P>
 This rite of patriotism had its beginnings in 1937 when the used flags that 
flew over the Capitol were presented to members of Congress. (A flag's average 
life span on Capitol Hill is 30 days, considering the stiff winds up there; the 
maintenance crew does not abide frayed flags.) 
</P>
<P>
 The demand eventually outstripped the supply, and in 1955 someone conceived a 
plan to allow members of the public, through their local Congress member, to 
buy a new flag and have it flown, even if for a brief but shining moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, the Flag Office has been a sort of unofficial thermometer that 
measures the nation's mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders boomed in 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted into the union. In 
the rebellious '60s, hardly anybody wanted a flag. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 4, 1976, the Flag Office handled 10,471 bicentennial orders in a 
single day. Staff members started raising them at midnight and worked around 
the clock. Extra flagpoles had to be installed. Another record was set during 
the Gulf War, with 154,224 flown that year. The demand was so great, the flag 
supply store ran out of flags. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular model is the 3-by-5 in cotton ($10.47) or nylon ($9.66). But 
if one is feeling particularly spirited, the 5-by-8 version is also available 
for $21.58 in cotton, $18.25 in nylon. The prices cover all government costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to order a flag should contact their Congressional office. If it 
is desired that the flag be flown on a specific day, officials suggest the 
request be made weeks, even months, in advance.

LEGISLATORS GET CLOSE-UP LOOK AT QUAKE TOLL; DISASTER: DAYLONG TOUR IMPRESSES 
U.S. OFFICIALS, ONE OF WHOM VOTED AGAINST $8.6-BILLION RELIEF BILL. LEADERS 
PRAISE FEDERAL EMERGENCY AID EFFORTS.

<P>
 Far from his rural New Hampshire home, Republican Rep. William Zeliff Jr. 
stared Sunday at the broken steel beams in the severely damaged library at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 And he found himself in awe of the immense force unleashed by the January 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible," Zeliff said as a procession of hard-hatted congressmen stood in 
a dimly lit stairwell looking at beams that had been ripped from their anchor 
bolts when the 6.8 magnitude quake thrust the library upward and then slammed 
it back down on its concrete foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zeliff, who had only seen television pictures of the temblor's damage, the 
real thing was sobering. He saw it up close on the House Committee on Public 
Works and Transportation's daylong helicopter and bus tour of quake-ravaged 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been devastating, particularly the library -- to see that kind of 
damage (is) unbelievable," he said. "You see spots where bridges cave in and 
highways cave in. . . . You see all these apartment buildings that are squashed 
and the parking garages." 
</P>
<P>
 He found the tour a helpful backdrop to today's hearings here on the response 
to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Zeliff voted against an emergency $8.6-billion aid bill. Although 
he said he was concerned about quake victims, he said he was also worried about 
adding to the federal deficit and forcing future generations to pay the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But after seeing damage from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the 
Northridge Meadows apartment complex to the Newhall Pass, this fiscally 
conservative congressman had only high praise for federal, state and local 
agencies that responded to the one of the most expensive natural disasters in 
the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can see here, all the agencies have worked very, very well 
together. I'm very proud of what FEMA has done, unlike the problems that they 
had in Florida" after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, he said. "I think this will go 
down in history as one of the best examples of everybody working together very 
quickly to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on the eve of today's hearing at the Los Angeles County Hall of 
Administration, committee members, Democrats and Republicans had nothing but 
kudos for the performance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For committee Chairman Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose), the tour "just 
reinforces the fact that . . . we have responded very well and very quickly to 
the disaster of the Northridge earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Mineta said today's hearing with disaster officials will examine "how well 
we've done" as well as the shortcomings of the response to the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know what we can learn from this, so we can know how to do things 
better in the future," he said, outside a closed-door briefing at a Van Nuys 
quake assistance center. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, director of Gov. Pete Wilson's Office of Emergency Services, 
also spoke favorably of federal actions after the quake. "We've been through a 
lot of disasters (in California)," he said. "This is by far the most effective 
response we've seen from FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 The five committee members who took the helicopter tour saw the soon-to-be 
reopened stretch of the Santa Monica Freeway, the crippled interchange of the 
Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways near the Newhall Pass, and parts of 
the San Fernando Valley before arriving at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At the university, which is near the quake's epicenter, "the damage has been 
very extensive," CSUN President Blenda Wilson said. "The bill will be very 
large." 
</P>
<P>
 During a luncheon briefing, Wilson told the congressmen that estimates range 
as high as $300 million to repair buildings across the campus, which reopened 
Feb. 14. Many classes are still being held in temporary quarters, including 
hundreds of portable classrooms, trailer villages and off-campus locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson thanked the delegation, which included FEMA Director James Lee Witt and 
other Clinton Administration representatives, for the agency's "prompt and 
sensitive response." 
</P>
<P>
 As she showed slides of quake damage, from the shattered glass entrance of the 
bookstore to vast structural damage to a new parking garage and the Fine Arts 
Building, Wilson reminded the group that much work remains to be done to 
determine how campus buildings can be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was driven home to the delegation inside the Oviatt Library, where 
the force of the quake sheared off metal anchor bolts where steel beams meet 
the building's foundation. In some places, the concrete base beneath the beams 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structural strength of it is gone," Chris Baylis, project manager for the 
engineering firm of Law/Crandall, Inc. told the congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The damage extended to a 1991 addition to the library, built to the latest 
earthquake codes -- a fact that surprised Mineta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always amazes me just to see what happens, despite all of the best 
engineering practices," Mineta said. "Mother Nature has an upper hand over 
man-made structures. The question always comes up: How far can we go in terms 
of making a safe working environment or a safe building?"

SCHINDLER'S 'EQUAL PARTNER'; HOLOCAUST: SURVIVORS AND OTHERS PRAISE THE COURAGE 
OF THE 86-YEAR-OLD WIDOW OF THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN WHO SAVED MORE THAN 1,100 
LIVES DURING WORLD WAR II.

 The tiny white-haired woman in the navy-blue pantsuit was greeted with smiles 
and tears as she made her way, supported by two rabbis, toward the 
menorah-shaped monument at the Museum of Tolerance, where she lit a flame to 
remember the 6 million Jews killed during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me touch you," said one woman as she reached out to embrace Emilie 
Schindler, who as the wife of Oskar Schindler helped save more than 1,100 Jews 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie "Schindler's List," Emilie Schindler was portrayed as the 
long-suffering wife of a man who did great good but had a fondness for high 
living, and a straying eye, that few spouses could endure. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sunday, during a day of Holocaust memorials, the 86-year-old widow was 
welcomed to Los Angeles as the woman who persuaded Nazi officials to let 
Schindler move his factory from Krakow, Poland, to their home town of 
Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia -- and their Jewish workers along with it. 
</P>
<P>
 She also helped keep the factory open by retrieving her husband repeatedly 
after he was arrested by the Gestapo, and procured black-market food and 
medicine for the workers. And she helped spoon-feed women who arrived at the 
factory from the death camp at Auschwitz, where they nearly starved. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not only the woman behind the man. She was . . . an equal partner in 
his achievements," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hier told about 2,000 people gathered in the courtyard of the Westside museum 
that the Schindlers "did what kings and prime ministers and popes would not do. 
They cared." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Emilie Schindler will receive the Wiesenthal Center's highest honor -- 
the Righteous Amongst the Nations award -- along with Miep Gies, who hid Anne 
Frank's family in the Netherlands and preserved her diary after the family was 
taken by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler spoke briefly at Sunday's lunchtime event, from which several 
hundred people had to be turned away because of lack of space. Later in the 
afternoon, a candlelight procession and prayers were conducted at the Los 
Angeles Holocaust Monument in Pan Pacific Park, marking the 50th anniversary of 
the liquidation of the Hungarian Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for the love you are extending to me," Schindler said in German 
through a translator. "I did not expect any thanks. I just did what a person 
can do when other people are in trouble, when people are being murdered."  
</P>
<P>
 She was greeted by a dozen local Holocaust survivors saved by the efforts of 
her and her husband. Among them was Leopold Page, the Beverly Hills luggage 
store owner who persuaded Thomas Kenneally to write the book on which the 
celebrated movie was based.  
</P>
<P>
 Emilie Schindler traveled to Los Angeles for the ceremony from her home in 
Argentina, where she and her husband moved after the war. In the late 1950s, 
Oskar Schindler left Argentina for Germany after several business ventures 
failed, but Emilie stayed behind. The Buenos Aires chapter of B'nai B'rith 
bought the house in which she still lives and helped her out financially as her 
husband, who died in 1974, never repeated his wartime business successes.  
</P>
<P>
 In interviews after the ceremony, Schindler cracked jokes and responded with a 
twinkle in her eyes as she fielded reporters' questions. Her first impressions 
of her husband? "He was very elegant." 
</P>
<P>
 But she soon tired of the same old subject and declared with a smile: "Enough 
about him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Was she afraid during the war of what might happen to her for aiding the Jews? 
 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was afraid, I wouldn't have done anything," she said. "If you're afraid 
to do something, you'll never do anything."

 David Nathan has never gotten a parking ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one of the good things about not owning a car in Los Angeles. Among 
the bad is the man on the bus wearing surgical slippers and asking if anyone 
can spare a couple of bucks for new shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain grimness on the bus," admits Nathan, who nevertheless 
eschews driving in favor of riding buses, taking cabs, relying on friends and 
walking. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan is a transplanted Londoner and New Yorker who, having grown up in 
cities where mass transit is actually used by the masses, has no desire to 
maneuver the concrete spider webs of Los Angeles. He prides himself on getting 
to places on time without wheels, from business meetings to doctor's 
appointments to grocery shopping. It is something he figures anyone could do if 
so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a question of being inventive," says Nathan, who works as a 
jack-of-all-trades in the music industry. "You find ways of dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the end, despite a $200 to $300 monthly cab bill, he figures he comes 
out a little richer and a little saner than the millions of others who spend 
their days isolated in millions of metal cocoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving is very me -oriented," he says, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On this day, Nathan's first appointment is a 10 a.m. breakfast meeting at Le 
Montrose hotel in West Hollywood, a 10-minute cab ride from his Park La Brea 
apartment. Picking up the phone, he orders his first cab of the day. He has an 
account with a cab company, so he doesn't have to carry wads of cash 
everywhere. He gets a bill every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later he is settling into the vinyl-covered front seat of a green and 
white cab, explaining to the driver where he wants to go.  
</P>
<P>
 "What better way take it for you?" asks the driver helpfully. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few puzzled looks, Nathan deciphers the question and gives directions. 
The taxi driver nods and slips onto 6th Street, heading west. Nathan flips 
through the papers on his lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a meeting I can prepare for it in the taxi," he says. "There are a 
lot of different things I can do, which a driver cannot. I can read the paper 
or I can eat or I can take a nap." 
</P>
<P>
 The cab delivers Nathan to the front door of the hotel and he walks briskly 
inside for a meeting with a woman planning a music festival. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There is an unabashed prejudice against riding the bus in Los Angeles. "People 
assume the only reason you ride the bus is because you are poor," Nathan says. 
</P>
<P>
 (He confesses that when he moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s, he could not 
afford a car. No matter, though -- he did not know how to drive.) 
</P>
<P>
 His first attempt to drive was in a friend's car in a Los Angeles parking lot. 
It was a manual transmission and Nathan's right foot was a little heavy on the 
gas. "We almost went straight into a wall and that was that. I really didn't 
enjoy driving." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later he was vacationing with a friend in Hawaii when he tried 
driving again. It was fun. So he enrolled in driving lessons when he returned 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was appalled," he says. "I was very obviously a learner and people would 
honk. No matter where we went to practice, people were inconsiderate." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more appalling, his instructor was a jovial man who found humor in 
Nathan's terror and tended to laugh a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 After four lessons, Nathan concluded that he would not become a driver just 
yet. There are days he considers it. On sunny days, he longs to buzz over to 
the beach, but then wonders how often he would actually do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I will never learn to drive," he says. "But I can say that I 
won't do it in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 His first meeting finished, Nathan walks the couple of blocks to Santa Monica 
Boulevard to catch a westbound bus to Santa Monica for a doctor appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 A bus screeches to a stop and Nathan climbs aboard, paying $1.35 for a ride 
and a transfer ticket. He settles at the middle of the bus and soon the stately 
neighborhoods of Beverly Hills zip by, obscured by the graffiti on the bus 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 It is midday and the bus is only half full. The passengers make up perhaps the 
most representative cross-section of a city that vaunts its diversity even as 
its residents try to hide behind walls of race and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives me a better understanding of the variety of people in Los 
Angeles," says Nathan as his bus slows to a stop. "There are many days when 
I'll be the only Caucasian on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost liberating, not having a car. Nathan says he never worries about 
theft, does not have to pay insurance and has never been told to pull over to 
the right and produce his driver's license and registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing Wilshire Boulevard, he notices the telltale pink slip tucked under 
the windshield wiper of a Mercedes-Benz. He asks how much parking tickets cost 
and shakes his head when he finds out. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell me who's better off," he says.

CRITICISM BLURS MEMORIAL TO LINDSAY ; TRIBUTE: A $100,000 ARTWORK DEDICATED TO 
LATE COUNCILMAN IS PLANNED FOR CONVENTION CENTER. BUT OBJECTIONS HAVE BEEN 
RAISED TO ITS DESIGN, COST AND APPROPRIATENESS.

<P>
 Gilbert W. Lindsay's grave is a modest affair at Evergreen Cemetery on the 
Eastside. Only a simple, four-foot-high stone in a crowded plot marks the final 
resting place of the first African American on the Los Angeles City Council and 
Downtown's representative for 27 years until his death in 1990 at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, Councilman Lindsay will be memorialized in a public manner that 
his supporters and critics agree better fits his reputation as "The Emperor of 
the Great 9th District." A product of traditional politics and avant-garde art, 
the monument may be as controversial as Lindsay was. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are well under way for a $100,000 memorial artwork on a plaza, already 
named for Lindsay, in front of the newly expanded Los Angeles Convention Center 
in Downtown. Paid for with public bond money, the monument is to be comprised 
of three 10-foot-high pillars covered with large and small photo-based images 
of Lindsay in his private life and long public career. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Lindsay associates wanted a traditional bust or statue in recognition of 
his long civic service and efforts to get the center built. But art experts 
praise the unusual sculpture designed by Pat Ward Williams as an imaginative 
way to reflect a career that could not be summed up in a single pose. Moreover, 
the use of technology-enhanced art and optical tricks match the Convention 
Center's modern glass-and-metal architecture, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a marvelous way of giving people back the man, rather than 
having a stiff bronze of some kind. This, I think, is full of life, which he 
was," said Mickey Gustin, an arts planner for the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet beyond aesthetic judgment, there remain disagreements over whether Lindsay 
should be honored at all and how much should have been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleagues on the City Council wanted the entire Convention Center named 
after Lindsay and begrudgingly accepted the plaza memorial as a compromise. 
Admirers remember him as a black pioneer and an important figure in California 
history; they see him as someone who fought racism, rising from a janitorial 
job to become a crucial shaper of Downtown's towering skyline and revived 
economy while never losing his charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the monument, which is to be completed by the fall, point out that 
there is a pedestrian mall named after Lindsay in Little Tokyo, a plaque of his 
face in the courtyard of a Figueroa Street office complex, and there is a 
senior housing project and a city park in his name. They characterize Lindsay 
as a self-aggrandizing politician who favored corporate backers over low-income 
constituents who were the majority in his district; they complain he refused to 
acknowledge old age's infirmities and wound up napping through council meetings 
and being manipulated by an unscrupulous girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, people are so forgetful of reality anyway," said a high-ranking 
city official who requested anonymity for his criticism of Lindsay and the 
memorial. "But there's going to be a crowd of people in the know who will find 
this the last egotistical irony in his career." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Councilman Nate Holden says he feels strongly that "it's 
worthwhile to do what they've done in recognition of Gil Lindsay's 
contributions to this city. There won't ever be another Gil Lindsay." 
</P>
<P>
 The monument should be viewed more as a motivator to young people than as a 
favor to Lindsay, Holden stressed. "It's for the generations who are here and 
to come, to remind them never to take no for an answer, to keep on working hard 
like Gil Lindsay." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Lindsay's death, Holden and Council President John Ferraro 
introduced a motion to have the Convention Center named after him, according to 
city records. But the center's managers said they feared that such a name would 
confuse out-of-town conventioneers and hurt in marketing the $500-million 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need for the name to immediately and conspicuously identify the city is . 
. . a blunt necessity," George Kirkland, president of the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau, wrote to city officials in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Another center official recalled that "everyone went nuts" at the suggestion 
of a Lindsay Center even though the complex is in Lindsay's former district. 
Beyond potential confusion with former New York Mayor John V. Lindsay, center 
officials did not want it to be fully associated with Gilbert Lindsay's image 
as a deal maker. Besides, this official emphasized, while Lindsay was crucial 
to construction of the original building in 1971, he was too frail to be a 
driving force behind the expansion, which was approved in 1985 and completed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the compromise, the outdoor plaza at the northwest corner of Figueroa 
Street and Pico Boulevard was named after Lindsay and two large meeting halls 
inside were named for former Los Angeles Mayors Tom Bradley and Sam Yorty. On 
June 14, 1991, the City Council approved a Holden motion requiring "that 
suitable recognition, whether in form of a bust, plaque or artwork" be placed 
in the plaza. No price was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments against naming the center for Lindsay aggravated Bob Gay, a 
former aide to the councilman. Travelers are not befuddled by the Tom Bradley 
Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport, Gay said recently. Nor are they 
confused by New York's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, named after the late 
U.S. senator, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The naming of the center and a modest bust would have cost much less than the 
planned $100,000 monument, Gay contended. But he now supports the idea of the 
Lindsay memorial and suggests that people should not be influenced by an 
embarrassing legal battle after the councilman's death. If people expect human 
perfection, "we'd never honor a single politician, a single entertainer or 
athlete," Gay said. "No one is perfect. Everyone has something in their lives 
they don't want known." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 trial pitting Lindsay's family against a former girlfriend over his 
estate, the councilman's friends testified that he had become senile and 
incompetent while in office. A Superior Court jury ruled that the 40-year-old 
girlfriend had used undue influence to obtain money and property from Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the Lindsay memorial was first mentioned, some kind of outdoor art 
was planned for the plaza. "It will be nice, frankly, to have something of 
historical basis to it," Chris Simons, senior coordinator for the expansion, 
said of the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000 comes from a $2.6-million fund for art at the center, Simons 
said. All that comes from city-backed bond issues that are to be paid off 
through hotel room occupancy taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Convention Center authority sent the council mandate to an advisory art 
committee working on the building. Merry Norris, one of the art panel's five 
members, said she is a fan of artist Williams' final design, but recalled being 
uncomfortable with any Lindsay memorial at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was odd and it still feels odd that one councilman was being singled out 
for honor," said Norris, former president of the city's Cultural Affairs 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Richard Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary 
Art, said he had no such misgivings. Lindsay "had a genuine interest in seeing 
what he thought was best for Los Angeles," Koshalek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants recall half-serious discussions of a statue of Lindsay on 
horseback, reflecting his youthful service in the Army Cavalry in Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
 In a more serious vein, Koshalek's committee reviewed artists' portfolios, 
looking for work sensitive to Los Angeles life and African American heritage. 
Williams, a Venice-based artist, won and came up with various proposals before 
one was settled on by the Koshalek panel and then unanimously approved by the 
city's Cultural Affairs Commission in June. 
</P>
<P>
 In her plan, a photo of Lindsay at his City Hall desk will be hugely enlarged 
and reconstructed in three formats -- big dots, lines and random squiggles. 
Those images will be placed on the three three-sided monoliths so that 
Lindsay's face comes into focus when a viewer is about 20 feet away and the 
pillars are in the right visual alignment; otherwise it will appear to be 
abstract. Close-up viewers will see 96 foot-long tiles bearing reproduced 
photographs of Lindsay at various stages in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 In her research, Williams found that Lindsay was controversial but even his 
political opponents wanted to share amusing or affectionate anecdotes about 
him. "It was obvious he was a powerful person in the city who got things done 
with a flair," said Williams, who noted that she was unaware of any criticism 
of the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mississippi, where he worked in the cotton fields, Lindsay came to Los 
Angeles in the late 1920s and took a job as a Department of Water and Power 
janitor. He passed the Civil Service exam and became a clerk, only to find 
himself segregated from whites. Lindsay got involved in grass-roots Democratic 
politics, becoming a key aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay was appointed to a vacant council seat in January, 1963, and he went 
on to be elected to eight terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Lindsay's longevity and pro-development stance were not enough to merit 
the prominent memorial, contends Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del 
Pueblo, an agency that aids low-income residents of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He certainly was not a friend of the poor," said Callaghan, whose agency is 
in the 9th District. "And there is a way to care about the poor and have 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter its artistic merits, a Lindsay memorial will just "remind people of 
the old politics of the noncommittal," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Arden Siemers, a city senior administrative analyst who worked on the 
original Convention Center plan, said many people will be happy to see the 
sculpture. Its cost, he said, "is nothing compared to the untold hundreds of 
millions of dollars and jobs he brought to this community over the years. It's 
a minor token of appreciation."

CONGRESSMEN TOUR VALLEY QUAKE SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Far from his rural New Hampshire home, Republican Rep. William Zeliff Jr. 
stared Sunday at the broken steel beams in the severely damaged library at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 And he found himself in awe of the immense force unleashed by the January 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible," Zeliff said, as a procession of hard-hatted congressmen stood in 
a dimly lit stairwell looking at beams that had been ripped from their anchor 
bolts when the 6.8-magnitude quake thrust the modern library upward and then 
slammed it back down on its concrete foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zeliff, who had only seen television news of the temblor's damage, the 
real thing was sobering. He saw it up close on the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee's daylong helicopter and bus tour of quake-ravaged 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been devastating, particularly the library -- to see that kind of 
damage (is) unbelievable," he said. "You see spots where bridges cave in and 
highways cave in. . . . You see all these apartment buildings that are squashed 
and the parking garages." 
</P>
<P>
 And he found the tour a helpful backdrop to today's hearings here on the 
disaster response. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in February, Zeliff had voted against an emergency $8.6-billion aid bill. 
Although he said he was concerned about quake victims, he said he was also 
worried about adding to the federal deficit and forcing future generations to 
pay the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But after seeing damage from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to the 
Northridge Meadows apartment building and the Newhall Pass, this fiscally 
conservative congressman had only high praise for federal, state and local 
agencies that responded to one of the most expensive natural disasters in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can see here, all the agencies have worked very, very well 
together. I'm very proud of what FEMA has done, unlike the problems that they 
had in Florida" after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, he said. "I think this will go 
down in history as one of the best examples of everybody working together very 
quickly to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on the eve of today's hearing at the Los Angeles County Hall of 
Administration, committee members, both Democrats and Republicans, had nothing 
but kudos for the performance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For Committee Chairman Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose), the tour "just 
reinforces the fact that . . . we have responded very well and very quickly to 
the disaster of the Northridge earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Mineta said today's hearing with disaster officials will examine "how well 
we've done" as well as the shortcomings of the response to the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know what we can learn from this, so we can know how to do things 
better in the future," he said, outside a closed-door briefing at a Van Nuys 
quake assistance center. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, director of Gov. Pete Wilson's Office of Emergency Services, 
also spoke favorably of federal actions after the quake. "We've been through a 
lot of disasters (in California)," he said. "This is by far the most effective 
response we've seen from FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) emerged from the briefing to say that 
he too is pleased with the federal government's response. "It's not perfect, 
but given the quake's magnitude, it is better than any of us had any reason to 
expect," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a number of quake aid issues must still be resolved, including how to 
help financially strapped homeowners obtain low-interest loans from the Small 
Business Administration when they may still have a large unpaid mortgage on a 
dwelling that was heavily damaged or destroyed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The five committee members who took the helicopter tour saw the soon-to-be 
reopened stretch of the Santa Monica Freeway, the crippled interchange of the 
Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways near the Newhall Pass, and parts of 
the San Fernando Valley before arriving at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At the university, which is near the quake's epicenter, "the damage has been 
very extensive," said CSUN President Blenda Wilson. "The bill will be very 
large." 
</P>
<P>
 During a luncheon briefing, Wilson told the congressmen that estimates range 
as high as $300 million to repair buildings across the campus, which only 
reopened on Valentine's Day. Many classes are still being held in temporary 
quarters, including hundreds of portable classrooms, trailers and off-campus 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson thanked the delegation, which included FEMA Director James Lee Witt and 
other Clinton Administration representatives, for the agency's "prompt and 
sensitive response." 
</P>
<P>
 As she showed slides of quake damage, from the shattered glass entrance of the 
bookstore to vast structural damage to a new parking garage and the Fine Arts 
Building, Wilson reminded the group that much work also remains to be done to 
determine how campus buildings can be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was driven home to the delegation inside the Oviatt Library, where 
the force of the quake sheared off metal anchor bolts at the point where steel 
beams meet the building's foundation. In some places, the concrete base beneath 
the beams shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structural strength of it is gone," Chris Baylis, project manager for the 
engineering firm of Law/Crandall Inc. told the congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt wanted to know what was the answer to ensure the seismic safety of modern 
steel buildings. "It's going to take some serious review," Baylis said, 
including possibly a major change in building design. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage extended to a 1991 addition to the library, built to the latest 
earthquake codes -- a fact that surprised Mineta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always amazes me just to see what happens, despite all of the best 
engineering practices," Mineta said. "Mother Nature has an upper hand over 
man-made structures. The question always comes up, how far can we go in terms 
of making a safe working environment or a safe building."

STAYING THE COURSE; POISONED LITTLEROCK HIGH TEACHER SAYS SHE WILL RETURN TO 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a lesson on Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" last week, somebody in 
second-period English poisoned the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher, Susan C. Ennis, said Sunday she still cannot believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound like a sap," said the 32-year-old Littlerock High 
School teacher, recovering at a Palmdale hospital from Thursday's classroom 
poisoning. "But my kids love me." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Ennis said she has received about 150 get-well cards from students, 
some even promising to get the kid who apparently dumped toxic cleaning fluid 
into her can of Diet Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
 "My students have been here, some of them in tears," said Ennis, who will 
undergo tests this week to check for damage to her kidneys and esophagus. "Some 
have written on their notes, 'Please come back, Mrs. Ennis, subs suck.' They 
really do care. This is a freak thing. Maybe one student doesn't like me, but 
99% would bend over backwards to save me." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, who have made no arrests in the case, will have to rely on one or 
more of the 38 students in Ennis' second-period class -- the only potential 
witnesses -- to identify the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis said the incident was the second time that she has been attacked in her 
two years as a teacher at the school. Last year, she said, she was roughed up 
and her life was threatened after she disciplined a student for harassing 
others with a makeshift blowtorch fashioned from a cigarette lighter and an 
aerosol spray can. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis said she does not believe that the poisoning is related to last year's 
incident, which resulted in the expulsion of two students. Antelope Valley 
Union High School officials could not be reached Sunday to confirm the earlier 
attack, which Ennis said was reported in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pleas from her family to quit, Ennis said she plans to return to her 
classroom when she recovers. She met her husband, a local sheet-metal worker, 
when both were working in Grand Forks, N.D. Later, the couple moved to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, who grew up in the small town of Red Lake Falls, Minn., said her family 
there has tried to persuade her to leave California because of what they 
believe is widespread crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what has happened, though, Ennis said she will stay at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching is the one thing I feel I was born to do," said Ennis, who lives 
with her husband and three young children in a home 35 miles north of 
Littlerock. "I've always wanted to be a teacher, all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Ennis was concluding her Steinbeck lesson and students began 
turning in copies of the novel, which are shared by two other classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1937 book describes the lives of two Depression-era migrant farm workers, 
George and Lennie, and how they try to protect one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about how we should feel responsibility for each other," Ennis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, who describes herself as a Diet Pepsi fanatic, had put a can of the 
soda on a stand holding an overhead projector. Next to the can was a spray-pump 
bottle of white board cleaner, a potentially deadly substance containing 
glycols, according to the Los Angeles Regional Drug and Poison Information 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of class, Ennis popped open a fresh soda. While picking up the 
first can to toss it away, she noticed it was not empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Oh great, one more swig,' and I chugged it down and immediately 
my throat burned," said Ennis. "I dialed up security on the class phone and 
said, 'Get here now' and I started throwing up immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis was taken to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, where she remains, able 
to talk and move about but for now limited to a liquid diet. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the poisoning was probably a prank done by "an angry student or a 
mischievous, quiet student," someone who did not think Ennis would be hurt so 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that period, Ennis said she had disciplined two students, a boy and a 
girl, for not sitting in their assigned seats. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she does not believe that gang members in her class were involved, 
even though she was the target of threats last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Ennis spotted a student walking outside her classroom blowing fire at 
other students with a lighter and an aerosol can. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis caught him by the arm and was about to escort the boy to the vice 
principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "But his gang friends surrounded me and backed me up against the wall," Ennis 
said. "I was screaming for security while I was being jerked and dragged by the 
students."

 Two boys were expelled as a result, Ennis said, which prompted a threat on her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you in my heart, I do not believe any of my gang students did this 
because they love me," Ennis said. "They have too much respect for me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ennis hopes that her last Steinbeck lesson made an 
impression. In the novel, tragedy strikes the two main characters who try to 
cover up a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody saw what happened, I hope they would come forward," she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COASTLINE COLLEGE GETS ACCREDITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley-based Coastline Community College has received higher 
education's official stamp of approval for the quality and effectiveness of its 
educational program. 
</P>
<P>
 The college, founded in 1976, recently received a full six-year accreditation 
from the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges following a review conducted 
last fall by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, 
college spokeswoman Gail Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to students because it allows them to seek financial aid and 
take courses that transfer to other colleges and universities," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges voluntarily submit to periodic review, including a comprehensive 
self-review and an evaluation by a visiting team of peers every six years, 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastline conducted its self-evaluation during the past 1 1/2 years and 
published the results in a document called the "Self-Study Report." 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-member accreditation team consisting of faculty and administrators from 
other community colleges visited Coastline in October to conduct interviews 
with college faculty, staff and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the team's findings, the college was given full accreditation until 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastline offers a variety of educational opportunities and has an enrollment 
of more than 13,000 Orange County adults.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; SCHOOL SAFETY TOPIC OF 1ST TOWN MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new community group will host a town meeting Thursday at Laguna Hills High 
School to discuss youth violence and school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Action for Public Schools, a political action committee founded in 
December, has invited six panelists to the 7:30 p.m. meeting in the school's 
Little Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists represent South County public schools, churches, law enforcement 
and county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be moderated by the League of Women Voters and is the first 
in a series of town meetings the group will sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzie Swartz, the group's co-chairwoman, said the goal of the meeting is to 
ensure that the public schools remain a meeting ground and to inform the public 
on issues and people affecting public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town meeting is a call to all those who will work hand-in-hand to 
strengthen and improve our public schools," she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; LEGION POST TO CELEBRATE ITS 70TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's American Legion Post is, well, very Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The hall's nautically themed lounge sits on the shores of Newport Bay, 
offering the kind of water and harbor views usually associated with the city's 
pricey restaurants and million-dollar beach homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just outside the lounge is the post's own 50-slot marina, home to the only 
American Legion yacht club in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Post No. 291 take pride in the distinctiveness and beauty of their 
hall, which turns 70 years old this month. They plan a gala anniversary party 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are attracted by the camaraderie as well as by the water 
location," said Legion Commander Pat Dolan, noting that the post's nearly 1,600 
members make it the fourth-largest in the state. "This is a water-oriented 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The hall has been a popular meeting place for veterans since it was opened in 
1924 by 37 World War I soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 No World War I veterans remain active in the group today, but the post does 
boast of members who served in World War II and the Korean, Vietnam and Gulf 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lounge bar manager Bill Murray said the tone of the post has changed in the 20 
years that he's been a member. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, you heard a lot more war stories. People talked a lot about 
politics," Murray said. "Now, you hear a lot fewer war stories. The people 
don't want to sit around the bar and argue. They want to come and enjoy 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Membership has more than doubled over the past two decades, as Vietnam 
veterans -- at first uncomfortable about getting involved in veterans groups -- 
began joining the legion, said Dolan, himself a Vietnam-era soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the number of World War II vets has decreased and more 
military personnel from the Panama invasion and Operation Desert Storm have 
become active. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot more diversity in the group now," Murray said. "Back then, 
everyone knew one another. Now it's a much more informal club." 
</P>
<P>
 The post faced its biggest crisis in 1979 when a fire caused serious damage to 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But members gathered together and within a year had rebuilt the structure -- 
without any assistance from the city or any government agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members helped with the construction work, while others served sandwiches 
and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone banded together and helped out," said Trish Ward, the post's office 
manager. "Everyone is very proud about what we accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the hall is used by community groups for meetings and activities. The 
post's bar and restaurant remain a popular hangout for members. 
</P>
<P>
 It is decorated with antique maritime items as well as military and legion 
keepsakes and awards. 
</P>
<P>
 As an organization, the legion sponsors many community programs, including 
awards for outstanding Newport Beach students. 
</P>
<P>
 It also works with patients in veterans' hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the group invites severely ill veterans to the post, where they 
are taken on a harbor cruise and treated to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who are in a world of pain. We take them in their gurneys 
for the boat trip," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very humbling thing. You get the feeling that (there) for the grace of 
God go I."SHELBY GRAD

A GOOD FRIEND; MARIA LOPEZ SANCHEZ HAPPY AT HOME IN SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Interview by PERRY C. RIDDLE / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Lopez Sanchez meets with her friends every day under two towering pine 
trees on a street corner half a block from her house in San Fernando. She holds 
court with a group of mostly Spanish-speaking men, some who work nights and 
stop by after breakfast. She remembers the time 60 years ago when the vacant 
lot was the site of the Methodist church and the pine trees were much smaller. 
As a young woman, she began translating for people of her community, as well as 
interpreting for them in court. At age 77, she still helps Spanish-speaking 
people who need assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago Sanchez, who loved dancing, suffered an injury to her foot 
while doing a Mexican hat dance at Las Palmas Park. Complications caused by 
undiagnosed diabetes followed and she eventually lost her right leg below the 
knee. Although she has no trouble getting people to wheel her up the ramp at 
her home or to her daily street corner meetings, it is her prayer that one day 
she will be able to walk with a cane from her home to the street corner and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 My name is Maria Lopez Sanchez. I was born in San Fernando. I lived here all 
my life and raised six children, three girls and three boys. 
</P>
<P>
 My house was a wedding present from my mother and my father. My father was 
from the state of Jalisco and my mother was from the state of Michoacan. My dad 
came here to stay for 15 days and he stayed until he was 94. 
</P>
<P>
 I got married to a good man -- he didn't smoke, he was a good baseball player. 
His name was John Garcia. They used to call him Chango -- that's a monkey. 
"Ponte, Chango, ponte Chango." To us that word, ponte , means "be alert." 
</P>
<P>
 He played for San Fernando Mission. They were going to sign him to play in 
Calexico when he went to Mexico. He got killed a month after that. 
</P>
<P>
 They killed my husband at Las Palmas Park thinking it was my brother-in-law, 
who used to go out with the girls and didn't marry them. I was sitting right 
next to him when they pointed the gun at me, but it wasn't my time. Then they 
shot my husband. He died in 1942 and I was pregnant. From there on, I raised my 
kids cleaning houses. 
</P>
<P>
 I did a lot of housework because I wanted to be at home by the time my kids 
were out of school. Finally I started interpreting in the courts because I knew 
the two languages, English and Spanish, and I could write both of them. They 
didn't pay me but the lady I went to interpret for, she would give me $5. At 
that time you could buy a lot of things for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 All my life I've worked. Right now, I make capes, crocheted capes. I make 
hats, too. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been attracted to people. That's why you see a lot of people come 
and visit me. This lady who lives across the street, she thinks they are all my 
boyfriends, but they're not, they're friends. Friends from the heart who have 
never forgotten me because they didn't know English. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in a rest home. I was there a whole year. I've been back in my house a 
year in December. I'm happy. People say, 'How come you're crying?' I'm crying 
because I'm happy that the Lord let me come to my house again. Every time I 
talk about my house, I have tears in my eyes because that was a gift that my 
mother gave me. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy living in my hometown. That's what counts. They tell me, 'Maria, you 
look younger, what are you doing?' I say, 'I'm happy I'm at home. I feel like a 
bird when he comes back and finds his nest.' That's the way I feel. I'm a 
regular San Fernando girl.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON CITY WORKER LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote tonight on a proposal to lay off seven 
employees and eliminate 30 positions in an effort to deal with a $3-million 
shortfall in the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs would cover all areas of the city, from the police force and 
Building Department to the planning and community services sections. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the cuts would bring to 86 the number of city positions that have 
been eliminated in the past four years, representing 11.3% of Newport Beach's 
overall work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that and keep the level of service exactly the same," City 
Manager Kevin J. Murphy conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of cuts will allow the city to avoid raising taxes or making 
big cuts in city services, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials blamed the $3-million 1994-95 budget shortfall on cuts in state 
funding and a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said more cuts might be needed if the state further reduces its funding 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven employees facing layoffs were notified in February. If the council 
approves the layoffs, they will be off the city payroll in early May. Other 
employees whose jobs were targeted decided to take early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the Police Department will lose eight positions and the 
Fire Department five. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in May will get its first look at the 1994-95 general fund 
budget, which is expected to top $59 million. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; LEASE FOR VETERINARY GROUP CONSIDERED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of veterinarians would lease property near the Mission Viejo Animal 
Shelter under a proposal to be considered by the City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Orange County Emergency Veterinary Group has proposed building a 
clinic on about 10,000 square feet next to the animal shelter at 28095 
Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-year lease sets rent at $12,000 per year. However, the veterinary group 
would also serve as the animal shelter in exchange for all or a portion of the 
rent. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; LIBRARY DISTRICT OK AS IS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By sDEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A consultant has recommended that the Buena Park Library District remain 
independent after concluding that a merger with either the city or the county 
would not save a significant amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 If the library were merged with the city, the consultant said, only minimal 
cost savings would result and it would not generate new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant also reported that consolidating with the county's public 
library system would not "improve the library district's short- or long-term 
financial prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the study, prepared by BSI Consultants Inc. of San Diego, 
found that current library revenue is not sufficient to cover expected spending 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommended that the library district find ways to generate 
additional revenue so it could maintain its current level of service. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, budget shortfalls have been offset by spending the surplus 
from the previous year's budget, said library director Colleen McGregor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study found that in three years, the library will not have a surplus 
sufficient to continue covering state revenue losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The library district, founded in 1919, receives 85% of its funding from 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past two years, the library has faced declining revenue due to 
state property tax shifts, forcing the library to cut back some services. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees were expected to discuss the report at last week's meeting, but the 
session was postponed to May 4 because the consultant was unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The board in September hired the consultant for $10,000, with the funds 
provided by the nonprofit Friends of the Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Robert Niccum said that "it's certainly good news to read in the 
report that the current way the district is organized as a special district is 
the best way at the current time to be providing services to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Niccum added that because of continued revenue losses, he is concerned 
about the district's ability to maintain services at the present level. sDEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SLAYING TRIGGERS COMMUNITY REBIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a slaying nearly two years ago to switch on the lights -- literally 
and figuratively -- in the Avon-Dakota-Eton neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Anaheim neighborhood of about 900 had fearfully watched its 
streets fall victim to gangs and drug dealers for years, it seemed to take the 
fatal back-alley stabbing of a 25-year-old man in April, 1992, to shock the 
community into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That crystallized our ideas, desires and energies to really do something to 
change things," recalled Jaime Zamora, a 47-year-old engineer, who now heads a 
thriving neighborhood association made up of Avon Place, Dakota Street and Eton 
Place residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I remember thinking we either had to fix the neighborhood or 
board up the windows and walk away," added I.J. Himmelberg, who owns two of 40 
apartment buildings in the one-quarter-square-mile community. "And I just 
wasn't going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 After the slaying, property owners and residents teamed up with police, city 
code enforcement officials, schools and churches to return the streets to the 
residents. By virtually all accounts, the cooperative effort worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members were evicted from area dwellings. City inspectors wrote up 700 
municipal code violations. Trees, supplied by the city, were planted by 
residents and owners during block parties. Graffiti was painted over. Trash was 
cleaned up. Sidewalks were paved. 
</P>
<P>
 And many high-wattage lights, provided by the city and installed by residents 
and owners, were installed. Today, buildings and streets are illuminated by 
three times as many lights as were there two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lights shone on their hiding places, and the gangs started to leave," 
said Zamora, who has lived in the neighborhood 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A crucial element in driving out the gangs and drug dealers was the 
introduction of an aggressive community policing program. With a newfound 
confidence in police, residents -- who once feared gang reprisal for getting 
involved -- now alerted police to criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, Zamora saw the fruits of the group's hard work when he 
noticed children happily playing outside his building. "It was something that 
hadn't happened in years," Zamora said. "At that point, I realized we were in 
high cotton, and we could just live again." 
</P>
<P>
 The joint effort has not gone unnoticed. The city and the residents 
association will receive an award April 18 from the American Planning Assn., a 
Washington-based nonprofit organization representing about 28,000 planners and 
elected officials nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents and property owners say they must remain vigilant or risk having 
gangs creep back into the community. Every now and then they receive a reminder 
-- such as a graffiti incident or a gang member cruising by -- of how things 
once were. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't go back to the way it was," Zamora said. "You can write that down in 
stone."MARTIN MILLER

HALF-NAKED ESCAPEE IS LATER CAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An inmate who escaped from the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho and then -- clad 
only in his underwear -- allegedly robbed a woman of her car and jewelry was 
captured Sunday at a Palmdale motel, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Ferhenback, 29, who was awaiting trial on a robbery charge, was 
reported missing late Saturday night, authorities said.A woman who lives near 
the jail reported that a man wearing only his undershorts and carrying a club 
broke into her house Saturday night and stole her jewelry and the keys to her 
car, sheriff's Deputy Benita Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, sheriff's deputies scoured local hotels and motels and found 
Ferhenback with his girlfriend and her two children, said sheriff's deputy 
Angie McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The girlfriend, Kristie Hagen , 26, was booked on suspicion of harboring a 
fugitive, McLaughlin said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CITY DESIGNATES CURB FOR DISABLED PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Bassett will soon see the curbside in front of her West Avenue house 
designated a disabled parking area so she can more easily help her disabled 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week unanimously approved the blue curb to make it 
easier for Bassett to move her daughter, who must use a wheelchair, into and 
out of the family's specially equipped van. Only people with special permits 
may leave their vehicles in a blue-painted parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Bassett needs the special parking area because others park 
in front of Bassett's home, forcing her to park in an alley behind the house.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; UTILITY WIRES, POLES WILL BE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unsightly overhead wiring and utility poles along La Palma Avenue and portions 
of Stanton Avenue and Dale Street will soon vanish to enhance the appearance of 
the city's major shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiring will be placed underground and the poles will be removed in the area 
next to Buena Park Mall as well as nearby eateries and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating overhead utilities will make "our community appear more 
attractive," said City Manager Kevin O'Rourke, and it will also make streets 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved spending $141,000 toward the $1-million 
cost to place utilities underground along La Palma and Stanton avenues and Dale 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance will be paid by Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Other utility companies, including the telephone and cable services, will pay 
for the cost of placing their wiring underground, said Nabil S. Henein, deputy 
city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston Clark, manager for Sears at the Buena Park Mall, said retailers are 
concerned that construction could hurt business during the holiday season and 
discourage shopping at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henein said construction will stop between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day 
to avoid disruption for merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize any inconvenience to businesses and their customers, Henein said, 
business driveways will not be blocked and traffic lanes will remain open in 
both directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Completion for Edison's portion of the project is scheduled for June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project is expected to be completed by December, 1995. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SUPERVISORS TO SELECT NEW LIBRARY TRUSTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because the Buena Park Library District board could not decide last week who 
to select to fill a vacancy on its panel, the Board of Supervisors will select 
a new trustee, library director Colleen McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees had narrowed its choice to Carol Macera and Lucinda (Cindy) 
Alibrandi, both Buena Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the supervisors are under no obligation to select either of the two 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor said it is hoped that the supervisors will make a selection within 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The term of the vacated position expires in November, when the selected 
candidate would have to run for election to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight candidates applied for the position vacated by Bill Hardin, who resigned 
after 13 years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Macera, a telephone operator and law student, has worked on political 
campaigns and was appointed as a delegate to the Democratic Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alibrandi, who holds a doctorate degree in psychology, is a Cypress College 
professor and director of the college's Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Patricia Ganer and Trustee Robert Niccum voted to select 
Alibrandi. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Helen Bohen and Edward Erdtsieck favored candidate Macera.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials will begin to learn tonight if changes in the way City Council 
meetings are conducted encourages more participation from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with tonight's meeting, residents will be allowed to address council 
members immediately after the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will allow them to discuss items from the consent calendar, which 
the council routinely approves as a package without discussion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three items are on tonight's consent calendar -- a proclamation for National 
Crime Victims' Rights Week, city audit reports for the 1992-93 fiscal year and 
a resolution to support the city of Sacramento in a pending legal case. 
</P>
<P>
 Modifications in the state public meetings law prompted the council to change 
its procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members now will be prohibited from discussing matters not on their 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will be allowed to briefly respond to questions from the public and 
seek information from city employees on non-agenda items. BERT ELJERA

WOMAN KILLED IN SANTA ANA; BOYFRIEND HELD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 34-year-old mother was killed early Sunday in the bathroom of her home 
during an argument with her live-in boyfriend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the woman as Laverne Victoria Montano of the 300 block of 
East Pomona Street in Santa Ana.Her boyfriend, identified by police as 
31-year-old Daniel Lopez, turned himself in to authorities several hours after 
the 12:30 a.m. incident, said Sgt. Don Robertson. He is being held on suspicion 
of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Montano and Lopez began arguing after midnight. Lopez 
allegedly followed Montano into the bathroom, where the verbal argument turned 
physical; Montano was killed during the ensuing struggle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the incident, Lopez allegedly ran out the back door. Some of the 
couple's roommates found Montano's body on the bathroom floor and called 
police, Robertson said. Police declined to release a cause of death, pending an 
autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who lived in the house with Lopez and Montano refused to discuss 
the incident. Some of the couple's neighbors on the quiet residential street 
said they were awakened by the woman's screams. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, who asked not to be identified, said Montano's young daughter was 
in the house when her mother was killed. After the incident, the woman said, 
the girl ran into the street calling for someone to help her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 According to neighbors, two families shared the small, one-story house: 
Lopez's pregnant sister, her husband and four children, and Montano, her young 
daughter and Lopez.

80 JOIN IN REMEMBRANCE OF NAZI TERROR; HOLOCAUST: SURVIVORS, DESCENDANTS 
CELEBRATE THEIR LIVES WHILE PAYING TRIBUTE TO 6 MILLION VICTIMS OF THE HORROR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No matter how hard she tried, Frances Gelbart could not suppress the memories 
that haunt Holocaust survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was only 8 years old, Gelbart watched helplessly as her three younger 
sisters were sent to their deaths at the Auschwitz concentration camp. For 
decades, she refused to talk about the horrors -- even with her three sons -- 
because "I didn't want anyone to share the pain I felt." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Gelbart, who now heads the Orange County chapter of about 100 
Holocaust survivors, joined 800 people at Temple Beth Sholom in Santa Ana to 
pay tribute to the 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis -- and to 
celebrate the lives of those who survived. The day of remembrance, known as Yom 
Hashoah, has become an annual gathering for Jewish groups in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelbart, a real estate agent of Fullerton, said she is no longer silent about 
her childhood. She told the congregation Sunday about her experiences in the 
Krakow Ghetto and in concentration camps at Plaszow, Auschwitz and 
Bergen-Belsen, where she and other Jews were eventually liberated by American 
soldiers at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "This once hungry and frightened young girl feels very lucky and proud to be 
here among you," she told the congregation. "She relearned how to trust and 
love people. She relearned how to appreciate music . . . for music is poetry 
and hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's solemn service was filled with heartbreaking songs that described the 
nightmare of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the audience brushed away tears as Cantor Don Croll of Temple 
Beth David in Westminster delivered an emotional rendition of "The Boy With the 
Fiddle." 
</P>
<P>
 "We sang as our people went to die," he sang. 
</P>
<P>
 Rena Wolfson, an Anaheim Hills resident and daughter of Holocaust survivors, 
said children of Jews who survived the Nazis "have grown up and watched you, 
our parents, and felt helpless. We have wanted to wrench the pain out of your 
hearts -- to make bearing witness not yours, but our responsibility only." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfson is a Cal State Fullerton instructor in education and is president of a 
local group of people whose parents survived the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 She told the congregation that "just like our parents had no choice, we have 
no choices. If we choose to not remember and not teach our children, we will 
have violated our parents' purpose of survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Gelbart said she was encouraged that the public was becoming more aware of 
"the story of my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Gelbart said she recently wrote to director Steven Spielberg to tell him that 
his highly acclaimed movie, "Schindler's List," was the "closest" portrayal to 
her experiences. Spielberg sent his thanks in reply, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, she wants people to know that the suffering of her people is 
unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can a camera ever capture the horror in a mother's eye when her child is 
ripped from her arms?" Gelbart asked. "How can one book truly describe what 
really happened?"

COLLISION KILLS VAN NUYS WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys woman was killed when a motorist ran a red light and smashed into 
the car that she and her husband were riding in, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Alcarz, 28, and her husband were attempting to turn left at the 
intersection of Reseda and Roscoe boulevards Saturday about 9 p.m. when an auto 
driven by Francisco Campa, 31, struck them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcarz was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where she died an hour 
later, said Officer Ralph Kemptner of the Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Alcarz, who was driving, was treated and released. Campa was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Sunday, no charges had been filed against Campa, Kemptner said.

NEWHALL MAN KILLED IN CAR WRECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newhall man was killed Sunday when the Ford Bronco in which he was a 
passenger collided with an oncoming car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Perez, 41, was pronounced dead at the scene from his injuries in the 
collision, which took place on San Fernando Road just north of Sierra Highway 
about 1:30 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Bronco, Alfredo Contreas, 41, of Pacoima, was booked on 
suspicion of drunk driving at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
station in Santa Clarita, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's deputies, the accident occurred when Contreas, 
traveling south on San Fernando Road, attempted to turn left into the driveway 
of a mobile home parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Tarrabe, 26, of North Hollywood, who was driving a 1988 Toyota north on 
San Fernando, collided with the Bronco, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the collision caused the Bronco to spin, throwing Perez from the 
vehicle, authorities said. He was not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarrabe was treated for minor injuries at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Zamora, 52, of Pacoima, a second passenger in the Bronco, was taken to 
the same hospital and treated for unspecified injuries.

SANTA ANA REINSTATES BUILDING INSPECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's personnel board has reinstated a building inspector who was fired 
for allegedly using his city vehicle and offices to have sex with prostitutes 
on three occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 13-day hearing, the panel late last week ordered the city to rehire 
David E. Tibbs and to pay his full back salary, Tibbs' attorney, Richard 
Silber, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbs was fired last November after an investigation by Santa Ana police 
alleged that he had sex with a prostitute in his office on 4th Street. The city 
also accused Tibbs of having sex twice with prostitutes in a marked city 
vehicle during work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But Silber said Sunday that city officials failed to prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who reported that he had witnessed one of the purported sexual 
encounters between Tibbs and a prostitute failed to identify the building 
inspector in a photo lineup, Silber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said his client wasn't guilty of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Silber, Tibbs broke down in tears when he told the personnel 
board that he was only trying to help the women. Tibbs told the panel that he 
had a close relative who was a prostitute and how he had helped to rehabilitate 
her, Silber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could not take advantage of someone in that position," Silber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges were overwhelming. He really went in that hearing as a man whom 
they thought was guilty, and he came out innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the city attorney's office could not be reached for comment 
Sunday.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A toddler was critically injured Sunday after he fell from a balcony at a Los 
Angeles police station, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 11:30 a.m. at the Rampart station after the 
18-month-old boy wandered from his mother -- who was at the station to make a 
crime report -- and fell from a second-floor balcony, Officer Steven Manriquez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was knocked unconscious, but paramedics revived him on the way to

YOUTH SLAIN IN VENICE GANG SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old man was fatally shot early Sunday outside a party at a Venice 
housing project, in what Los Angeles police are calling a gang-related 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a gunman drove past the Marionwood public housing complex about 3 
a.m. and fired several shots at Manuel Hernandez as the teen-ager tried to run 
for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who lived in the housing project and had been attending the party, 
was hit in the upper and lower body. He was pronounced dead at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Sunday that they had no information about the shooting from 
witnesses. "Everyone knows (Hernandez), but no one is talking," Detective 
Cedric Wilder said.

HONEY AND MONEY; BEE BUSINESS STUNG BY PRICES, PARASITES AND A 'KILLER' BREED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crouching into the cab of her beat-up yellow truck, beekeeper Ann Bennett 
performed the meticulous task of transferring pinhead-sized queen bee larvae 
into new hives. 
</P>
<P>
 As she carried out this yearly ritual deep within a Piru orange grove, Bennett 
comforted the tiny insects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," she said softly. "There are good things in store for you. Soon 
you'll be a queen." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bennett could speak with confidence about the bees' future, she and 
her husband, Red Bennett, are more wary about their own. 
</P>
<P>
 As the year's prime honey season rolls around again, the financial and 
physical perils of the bee business are becoming so numerous that local 
beekeepers are souring on life amid the sweet smells of honey and orange 
blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the conditions are changing, I think a lot of people aren't getting 
the enjoyment out of beekeeping that they once did," said Red Bennett, who has 
been a commercial beekeeper for more than a decade. "The industry has 
definitely hit a rough patch." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, the number of commercial beekeepers in Ventura County 
has dropped from more than a dozen to about five, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial hives in Piru, Ojai and Ventura and hives farmed by hobbyists in 
Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are being sold, given away or intentionally 
poisoned as the industry falls prey to a host of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Local beekeepers blame the decline in part on a glut of imported honey from 
China, which has sent prices through the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those who have been able to endure the drop in honey prices are 
questioning whether they can survive a recent surge in bee parasites and the 
impending arrival of more aggressive, Africanized honeybees, often referred to 
as "killer bees." 
</P>
<P>
 That combination, they said, could spell doom for local beekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has had a bee industry for years, Bennett said, because many 
local farmers prefer to use bees to pollinate their crops rather than leave the 
process to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of avocado groves and flower farms call on beekeepers to bring in their 
hives every year for pollination, according to Ben Faber, a Ventura-based farm 
adviser from the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Faber said, the decline of local beekeepers has forced 
Ventura County growers to turn to beekeepers from as far away as Florida to 
help pollinate their crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just spoke to a grower last week who had been using the same local 
beekeeper for the past five years," Faber said. "When he dialed the guy up this 
year, there was no one at the end of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the need for bees, nearly every commercial beekeeper in Ventura 
County has hives on the selling block. 
</P>
<P>
 The keepers make $15 to $20 per hive by renting them to farmers, but the bulk 
of the income from keeping bees comes from honey sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since a peak in the 1970s of about 65 cents per pound, Bennett said, the 
wholesale price of honey has dipped to the current rate of about 45 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't even get the wholesalers to talk to us anymore," said veteran 
beekeeper William E. Farlow of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see this happening to such a wonderful business." 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow's apiary, like most of those around Ventura County, is a family-run 
enterprise driven by the allure of self-employment and the chance to work 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a beekeeper is like being an alcoholic," said Farlow, 65, who has been 
in the business for 40 years. "Once it gets in your system, you can't get rid 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow, whose small Ventura business produced 50 tons of honey last year, is 
now worried that the job that supported him will not survive to support his 
son, David. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the problem of falling honey prices, bee farmers like Farlow 
have fought off attacks from two types of parasitic mite, which can ravage 
hives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Farlow is gearing up for the long-ballyhooed arrival of aggressive, 
Africanized honeybees, which have moved from Brazil as far north as Texas, Baja 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While there is some hope these bees can reinvigorate the industry because they 
are prolific honey producers, beekeepers fear the fierce bees will create a 
host of new hassles and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The African bees are ferocious," Farlow said, not only because it takes 
little more than the vibrations of a tractor to provoke them but because 
farmers are now afraid that bee hives will pose a liability risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insurance people won't let people keep (Africanized) bees on their ranch 
because they're afraid the bees will seriously hurt someone," Farlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beekeepers -- commercial and hobbyist -- have long relied on the farmers to 
allow them to keep hives out on ranches so the bees could pollinate the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 As the growing seasons shift, most beekeepers travel with truckloads of 
beehives to farms where they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow recently returned to Ventura from Bakersfield, where almond growers 
used his bees for pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 The beekeepers maintain the hives, breed new colonies and collect the honey, 
which forms in gobs along wood panels filled with wax honeycombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the groves of Piru, Bennett's bees whiz freely through the orange blossoms, 
returning by instinct to the white wooden boxes so they can begin converting 
orange pollen into high-quality honey. 
</P>
<P>
 In groves in Simi Valley, hobbyist Len Bellenson used to keep as many as 100 
hives without fear of upsetting neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Bellenson said, he has only a handful of hives and he, too, is 
getting out of beekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved doing it," Bellenson said. "It was wonderful relaxation, but now I'm 
too concerned about getting sued." 
</P>
<P>
 Bellenson said that as the Africanized bees are spotted closer and closer to 
Ventura County, the cost of insurance rises and the threat of a lawsuit becomes 
more real. He said he is one of the last hobbyists in east Ventura County and 
he plans to soon give away his handful of hives. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, adds Red Bennett, is that the aggressive bees may take the joy 
out of beekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bennetts feel completely at ease around the bees. They are able to judge 
the bees' moods by the weather, choosing to skip work on days when it is cold 
and gray and the bees are more volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 They are comfortable working around hives amid virtual clouds of bees with 
little more than a screen over their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not to say we don't get stung," Ann Bennett said after working 
barehanded with the bees for five hours recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at my hands," she said, scanning her callused skin for evidence of a new 
sting. "These are not beautiful hands anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bennetts said that the pleasure of working without thick gloves and 
body-armor protection will disappear when the aggressive bees arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to wear 50% more gear, and we'll still get stung 50% more of the 
time," Red Bennett said. "Nobody looks forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
 But that will be the price to stay in the business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Area beekeepers' have only one hope to continue to make a living, according to 
Faber: learning to work with the Africanized bees.  
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive bees, he said, are more vigorous workers and will produce more 
honey. If they can be bred with the less-harmful bees, there is hope the 
industry will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly the chance beekeepers will be able to work with these 
bees," Faber said. "But even if they can solve that problem, it's not the only 
one they face. We're still quite concerned about the future."

STREET SMART: PATIENCE AT SIGNALS WILL HELP MOTORISTS SEE THE LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a sensible reason for the lengthy delay in the changing of signals 
from red to green at Victoria Avenue and Moon Drive in Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound Victoria traffic has a long wait for the green because of the 
southbound left-turning traffic onto Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The light stays red even when there are no more left-turning vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The same problem exists at Telephone and Portola roads and doubtless other 
locations. Why the delay? 
</P>
<P>
 R. D. Hopton 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 If you endure the wait at Victoria and Moon, your patience will be rewarded 
with an abundance of green lights down the road. So says Ventura traffic 
engineer Nazir Lalani. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists are made to suffer through long lights at that intersection and at 
Telephone and Portola, he says, for the greater good of synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
 If the light turned green even an instant earlier, you would find yourself 
jamming on the brakes at the very next intersection, stuck at another red 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, once you get through that first long wait, the lights are timed to 
let you glide down the road without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In your Feb. 7 column, a gentleman wrote asking why people do not use the 
bicycle lane when they are turning right. 
</P>
<P>
 The city engineer for Thousand Oaks said it is legal to enter the bike lane to 
turn. Since I am a new resident of California, I was required to take a written 
California drivers test. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the test, I read the manual, which states that a driver is 
not allowed to enter the bicycle lane any sooner than 200 feet from the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this contrary to what you wrote? 
</P>
<P>
 Please clear up this confusion for me and your other readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Sewell 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You, the city engineer and the state's rules-of-the-road manual agree that 
drivers are allowed to enter the bike lane to turn right. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers are not, however, allowed to cruise the bike lane indiscriminately. 
The bike lane should be used only when making a right turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Moorpark and occasionally drive down to The Oaks mall in Thousand 
Oaks for a little shopping. I have no problem finding my way there. The problem 
is getting out of the mall and back onto the freeway to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only a few exits out of the mall and no signs indicating where to go 
to find the on-ramp to the Ventura Freeway. I don't go there often enough to 
know by heart how to do it. Several times I've ended up driving the wrong way 
for several blocks trying to figure out how to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 Could signs be posted at the mall to show the way to the freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel Williams 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that signs could be posted, but only if it won't clutter the 
roadway, Thousand Oaks traffic engineer John Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Directional signs need to be kept to a minimum, otherwise they can block views 
of the road, Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, he says, "most motorists don't like to see too many signs because 
they are not attractive." Signs are posted near the mall on eastbound Hillcrest 
Drive near Moorpark Road and on westbound Hillcrest Drive near Lynn Road, 
Helliwell says. But there are none at the mall. The city will check to see if 
it can add a few.

STREET SMART: SHOPPING FOR A SIGN TO POINT MOTORISTS IN RIGHT DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Moorpark and occasionally drive down to The Oaks mall in Thousand 
Oaks for a little shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no problem finding my way there. The problem is getting out of the mall 
and back onto the freeway to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only a few exits out of the mall and no signs indicating where to go 
to find the on-ramp to the Ventura Freeway. I don't go there often enough to 
know by heart how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times I've ended up driving the wrong way for several blocks trying to 
figure out how to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 Could signs be posted at the mall to show the way to the freeway? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible that signs could be posted, but only if it won't clutter the 
roadway, Thousand Oaks traffic engineer John Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Directional signs need to be kept to a minimum, otherwise they can block views 
of the road, Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, he says, "most motorists don't like to see too many signs because 
they are not attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs are posted near the mall on eastbound Hillcrest Drive near Moorpark Road 
and on westbound Hillcrest Drive near Lynn Road, Helliwell says. But there are 
none at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will check to see if it can add a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a sensible reason for the lengthy delay in the changing of signals 
from red to green at Victoria Avenue and Moon Drive in Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound Victoria traffic has a long wait for the green because of the 
southbound left-turning traffic onto Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The light stays red even when there are no more left-turning vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The same problem exists at Telephone and Portola roads and doubtless other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the delay? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 If you endure the wait at Victoria and Moon, your patience will be rewarded 
with an abundance of green lights down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Ventura traffic engineer Nazir Lalani. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists are made to suffer through long lights at that intersection and at 
Telephone and Portola, he says, for the greater good of synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
 If the light turned green even an instant earlier, you would find yourself 
jamming on the brakes at the very next intersection, stuck at another red 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, once you get through that first long wait, the lights are timed to 
let you glide down the road without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In your Feb. 7 column, a gentleman wrote asking why people do not use the 
bicycle lane when they are turning right. 
</P>
<P>
 The city engineer for Thousand Oaks said it is legal to enter the bike lane to 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I am a new resident of California, I was required to take a written 
California drivers test. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the test, I read the manual, which states that a driver is 
not allowed to enter the bicycle lane any sooner than 200 feet from the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this contrary to what you wrote? 
</P>
<P>
 Please clear up this confusion for me and your other readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Sewell 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You, the city engineer and the state's rules-of-the-road manual agree that 
drivers are allowed to enter the bike lane to turn right. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers are not, however, allowed to cruise the bike lane indiscriminately. 
The bike lane should be used only when making a right turn.

APPROVAL OF FUNDING PUTS ESTUARY CLEANUP ON FAST TRACK; ENVIRONMENT: COASTAL 
CONSERVANCY IS EXPECTED TO GRANT $400,000 FOR VENTURA RIVER PROJECT. PHASE I -- 
CLEARING OF INVASIVE PLANTS -- COULD BEGIN IN JULY. 
</P>

<P>
 A decades-long push to restore the Ventura River estuary is now on the fast 
track after the California Coastal Conservancy announced that it expects to 
fund the first $400,000 of the program in June, Ventura officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers could begin as early as July on the first phase of the restoration: 
digging up invasive plants that are choking out native shrubs and replacing 
them with native plant species. 
</P>
<P>
 If the work goes according to plan and the large cadre of people who have 
volunteered to help comes through, the invading exotic plants could be removed 
in time to plant new growth before the rainy season begins in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Future phases of the Estuary Enhancement and Management Plan would not only 
continue monitoring the plants but would remove feral animals and establish a 
wilderness park complete with a visitor center and amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration comes not a moment too soon, said Reed Holderman, restoration 
manager for the Coastal Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a turning point for the estuary," Holderman said. "The exotics could 
take over and we would have a rough road to get back to a native environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years from now, invading plants such as the giant Kikuyu grass, castor 
bean and ice plant could be so well established that they would become nearly 
impossible to control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wait too long it could become prohibitively expensive, so now is the 
time," he said. "It's now or never." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura and the California Department of Parks and Recreation want 
it to begin now. Mary Lou Schill, who is overseeing the matter for the city, 
said the cleanup timeline has been "accelerated." 
</P>
<P>
 "We always expected funding, but we hadn't envisioned moving so quickly," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners are scrutinizing the restoration project for unintended 
environmental harm and will present their findings at a hearing April 21. The 
City Council could approve the final plan as soon as June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Conservancy board will hear the request for funding on June 23. 
And it is expected to be approved, Holderman said. After the conservancy funds 
the first $400,000, the city and state parks are expected together to 
contribute another $260,000 in cash and services to the project, Holderman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Treanor, the state parks district superintendent, said the project will 
protect the river mouth and its rare wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This falls right into our charge to protect the natural resources of our 
properties," Treanor said. State parks owns part of the property at Emma Wood 
State Beach being restored. The city owns the other portion of the 110 acres in 
the restoration area, including Seaside Wilderness Park on the western bank of 
the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic effort marks the first time that three public agencies have 
joined together for such an effort, said Mark Capelli, executive director of 
Friends of the Ventura River. The environmental group has pushed for river 
protection and restoration for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ramifications of this plan are profound," he said. "But I guess I always 
had the belief that at some point, people would realize there was a valuable 
resource in our midst." 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli, a lecturer on coastal ecology at UC Santa Barbara and an expert on 
the Ventura River, predicted that the new wilderness area will become a popular 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a major attraction for both visitors and residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River estuary, the point where river meets the sea, has long 
suffered pollution from storm drains, a sewage treatment plant and a homeless 
encampment. The restoration project does not address these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the project focuses on cleaning up the area and developing a 
wilderness park. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase I of the plan includes removing the plants that are choking out the 
native willows and other shrubs that provide food and shelter to native 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Schill said the city has already received promises from the Boy Scouts, the 
Audubon Society and many other environmentalists to participate in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The work will be led by biologists or other experts in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase I also includes a plan to monitor the new growth to see that native 
plants take hold and continue to remove exotic plants that return. 
</P>
<P>
 In Phase II, feral cats and other animals will be removed and a wooden trail 
will be built to protect the sand dunes. A visitors center and an amphitheater 
are also planned for this phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Phase III will concentrate on restoring the second mouth of the river, and 
trails will be linked between the estuary and the second mouth. The plans call 
for removing the earth fill beneath a railroad bridge built in 1970 and 
building a new bridge to span the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schill said the city would like the project to be completed within the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although environmentalists and public officials are delighted by the plan, 
they agree it does not tackle the thorniest issue in complete restoration of 
the Ventura River: removing the 100 homeless people living below the Main 
Street Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, said City Councilman Tom Buford, as long as the homeless stay north 
of the bridge, the restoration plan can get started. "At this point, what we do 
upstream, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River Estuary Enhancement and Management Plan will be presented at 
a meeting 7:30 p.m., April 21, at Ventura City Hall, 501 Poli St. For more 
information, call Mary Lou Schill, 654-7809.

OJAI MAY CHALLENGE LANDFILL BALLOT ISSUE; GOVERNMENT: CITY COUNCIL PLANS TO 
STUDY LEGALITY OF DEVELOPER'S PROPOSAL ON WELDON CANYON PROJECT. THE FIRM WANTS 
TO BYPASS SUPERVISORS AND GO DIRECTLY TO VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to stop development of a landfill at Weldon Canyon, the Ojai City 
Council is exploring legal challenges to a countywide ballot initiative that 
would allow the dump to be built without the approval of county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 At its Tuesday night meeting, the council intends to authorize its legal 
counsel to determine whether the initiative process can be used to approve a 
land-use issue, Councilwoman Nina Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Taconic Resources of San Diego County filed a request for an 
initiative that would bypass county authorities and let voters decide the issue 
in November, elections officials said. Voters would be asked to amend the 
county's General Plan and change certain zoning ordinances to allow 
construction of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The company needs to gather more than 18,000 signatures by June 6 to put the 
measure on the November ballot. If that campaign succeeds and voters approve 
the measure, Taconic would still need state, regional and some local approvals 
to develop the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking into is the right of a ballot measure to determine a 
land-use issue," Shelley said, explaining that land decisions are typically 
determined by local jurisdictions. "Is it proper for the people to determine by 
ballot the use of land in a given area?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Monte Widders said he was uncertain and intends to give the council 
a full report on April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said county attorneys also will probably look at the 
legal aspects of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the legality of it is an issue," she said. "But my biggest issue is 
if we put another dump in, it's going to be a white elephant. I don't think we 
need it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Montgomery, a Moorpark councilman who is chairman of the Ventura County 
Waste Commission, supports the project and said he has no doubt that an 
initiative would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't question the legality of the initiative process in this instance," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ojai's concerns, he said: "I'm well aware that they will oppose this. I 
respect their opinions. I just disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic, which specializes in solid- and liquid-waste projects, is negotiating 
to take over Waste Management Inc.'s lease at Weldon Canyon, which lies at the 
mouth of the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management spent eight years and $13 million trying to construct a 
landfill there but withdrew its proposal last summer after it became clear that 
county supervisors would defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic hopes to bypass the supervisors and go directly to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that east county cities could, if they could collect sufficient 
signatures, determine land-use issues in our part of the county," Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai, which has the county's smallest percentage of voters, intends to fight 
the landfill proposal with as much tenacity as the city showed during its 
previous battle to stop Waste Management, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have the power other communities have in numbers and income," 
Shelley said. "But not for one moment should anyone misunderstand the people of 
the Ojai Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the City Council intends to write to the County Waste Commission 
expressing its concern over Taconic's plan to develop a waste facility but not 
operate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic officials have said that construction and operation of the dump would 
be handled by a third party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Waste Commission has, in the past, determined that waste facilities in 
Ventura County should be managed as a public utility," Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said her greatest concern is that Taconic could import waste from 
outside the county to the landfill, which would have traffic and air-quality 
effects on the entire county -- not just Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no reason to go into that kind of investment unless the intent is to 
import waste from another county," Shelley said. "We are not in this county 
interested in building an economy on the importation of waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, who is seeking the supervisor's seat being vacated by Vicky 
Howard, said he sees no problem with importing trash but the immediate issue is 
whether to build the dump. "It's far too early to tell whether importation 
would be allowed," Montgomery said. "I would be supportive of taking a look at 
that issue at the proper time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hauling waste into Ventura County raises a new spectrum of environmental 
concerns, Shelley said, that would affect all county residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that we can convince other cities . . . this is no longer an Ojai 
Valley issue, this is a Ventura County issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Councilman James Loebl agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the thing qualifies for the ballot and it is legal -- and I'm not saying 
that it will or that it isn't -- then we need help throughout the county, and 
there is no time like the present," he said. "We have some work to do, there's 
no question about it."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER LOW-INCOME PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council will consider giving conceptual approval tonight to a 
146-unit, low-income housing development just north of the Santa Paula Freeway 
in east Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The development, proposed by Saticoy-based Cabrillo Economic Development 
Corp., has drawn criticism from neighbors who worry that the influx of 
low-income residents will bring traffic and crime to their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is just outside the city limits and would have to be annexed if the 
project is approved. Cabrillo, a nonprofit company, is the largest private 
builder of low-income housing in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already pledged the $350,000 in federal, low-income housing funds 
it received for 1994 to Cabrillo for use in a low-income project. Cabrillo 
officials are also asking the city's redevelopment agency for a $200,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting conceptual approval of the project would let Cabrillo officials know 
if they should raise more money for the project, said Everett Millais, the 
city's director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The development includes the construction of 80 apartments for very-low-income 
residents and 66 single-family houses for low-income residents on a 23-acre lot 
east of Saticoy Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 According to 1993 figures, low-income residents are families of four making 
$39,700 or less per year, Millais said. Very-low-income residents are families 
of four making $27,600 or less per year, he said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN ARRESTED IN RAPE OF TEEN-AGER 
</P>

<P>
 A short-order cook from Thousand Oaks was arrested early Sunday on suspicion 
of raping a 17-year-old youth from Thousand Oaks, Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Franco, 38, who apparently befriended the victim last summer, made 
unwanted sexual advances toward the boy at about 1:15 a.m. Sunday while they 
were at the Janss Mall on Moorpark Road, Sgt. Raymond Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel said Franco and the youth are unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim rejected Franco's sexual advances but was overcome by physical 
force and assaulted, Nagel said. He was treated at Ventura County Medical 
Center and released, Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responding to a 911 emergency call from an unnamed source spotted a man 
matching the description of the rape suspect, then apprehended Franco without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco is being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail. He is 
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Ventura County Municipal Court. JEFF

 A 19-year-old Oxnard man died early Sunday in the emergency room at St. John's 
Regional Medical Center after being stabbed in the chest by another man, who 
turned himself in to police, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rubio was found slumped in an alley behind the 5200 block of Columbus 
Place, bleeding from a single stab wound to the chest, Oxnard Police Sgt. Cliff 
Troy said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was transported to St. John's, where he was pronounced dead at 4:19 a.m., a 
coroner's spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald William Culbertson, 22, of Oxnard, approached officers as they 
investigated the scene shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday and turned himself in, Troy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culbertson told police that he and Rubio had been arguing over Rubio's use of 
a vehicle owned by Culbertson's sister. The suspect was booked at Ventura 
County Jail, where he is being held on $280,000 bail on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Ventura County Municipal Court, a 
jail spokeswoman said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GATEWAY MONUMENTS MAY HERALD CITY 
</P>

<P>
 Beige concrete signs adorned with an oak tree and mountain ridgeline could 
soon welcome motorists to Thousand Oaks, if the City Council on Tuesday 
approves a $30,000 program to install gateway monuments at key intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed signs, designed by former Planning Commissioner Denise Filz, 
would stand four feet tall and be approximately seven feet long.A textured 
landscape would stand out against the earth-tone concrete background, and 
raised brass letters would announce "City of Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 "The design really speaks to what Thousand Oaks is," Councilwoman Judy Lazar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always gripes me that if you go to Westlake Village, they have signs 
welcoming you. Our desire is to have something similar." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider installing six signs at a cost of roughly $5,000 
apiece. Money could come from the city's gas-tax funds or special grants, 
according to staff. 
</P>
<P>
 A gateway task force has recommended six locations for the signs: Westlake 
Boulevard both north and south of the Ventura Freeway, Hampshire Road north of 
the freeway, Lynn Road south of the freeway, Moorpark Road north of Thousand 
Oaks Boulevard and the Moorpark Freeway near the Olsen Road off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he would like to see an additional sign in 
Newbury Park, perhaps at the intersection of Borchard Road and Michael Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission recently allocated $200,000 to 
spruce up that intersection. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Moorpark city officials say they are just one month away from finishing a 
$1.7-million recreation center at Arroyo Vista Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to hold a grand opening ceremony in June for the new facility, 
said Christine Adams, director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The new recreation center has a gymnasium and two multipurpose rooms, Adams 
said. The city plans to keep the facility open 80 hours a week for everything 
from adult basketball leagues to summer day camp for preschool-age children.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that the center can be used as much as possible," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent about $3 million so far to develop about half of the 
69-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the new recreation center, the money has been used to grade and 
landscape the grounds and install parking lots, Public Works Director Ken 
Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would like to add more than $15 million in improvements, including a 
lake, tennis courts and baseball diamonds, according to Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might do that if we can ever find the money," he said. SCOTT HADLY

ANTI-DRUG PROGRAMS RECEIVE $3,000 GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Anti-drug educational programs in Thousand Oaks and Ojai have each received 
$3,000 boosts, in the form of federal grants funneled through the Area Housing 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll use the money for the extras, like T-shirts, pencils and plaques for 
outstanding DARE students -- the things that make the program special for the 
kids," said Sgt. Bruce Hansen of the East Valley Sheriff's Station.DARE stands 
for Drug Abuse Resistance Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Area Housing Authority distributed money to both DARE programs after 
receiving a $139,000 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
for anti-drug programs geared toward children in public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing authority, which operates six public housing sites countywide, 
also donated $7,500 to Thousand Oaks' crime prevention symposium, an all-day 
conference scheduled for May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grants support local park districts, which provide recreation programs 
to get kids off the street. The housing authority also uses federal funds to 
beef up security in the developments and to provide drug and alcohol 
counseling, said Marilyn Berwick, resident services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new buzzwords now are empowerment and self-sufficiency," Berwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust is in getting our residents to take over and guide their own 
lives, with our help." STEPHANIE SIMON

WOMAN CRITICALLY INJURED IN FREAK AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT; THOUSAND OAKS: MOORPARK 
RESIDENT'S OWN STATION WAGON ROLLS OVER HER AT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Moorpark woman suffered massive injuries Sunday after her station wagon 
rolled on top of her in the parking lot of a Thousand Oaks fast-food 
restaurant, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unconscious victim, Alicia Amparo Solares, 46, was pulled free by her 
husband after five people lifted the vehicle off her, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Solares apparently was exiting the late 1980s station wagon when it began 
rolling backward down an incline in the parking lot of the Burger King 
restaurant at Hampshire and Foothill roads, according to Sgt. Jesse Howe of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, in a written statement, said the left front wheel rolled the length of 
Solares' body, coming to a stop on her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities investigating the accident, which occurred about 11:20 a.m., did 
not furnish a reason for why the car was moving, but witnesses speculated that 
Solares either forgot to set the parking brake or to place the vehicle in park. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said at least three restaurant employees and two passers-by lifted 
the station wagon off the injured woman as her husband, Carlos Reyes, 23, also 
of Moorpark, dragged her to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Harker, the restaurant's manager, said the volunteer rescuers reacted 
smoothly and quickly when Carlos Reyes ran in and called for help. Solares had 
driven to the restaurant to pick up Reyes, who is an employee there. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of us ran out there and saw she was under the car," said Harker. "We 
just grabbed a part of it and lifted. To tell you the truth, it didn't seem 
like the car weighed very much at all but I'm sure we'll all be sore tomorrow. 
It was just pure adrenaline." 
</P>
<P>
 Harker said Solares was not breathing when she was pulled from under the car, 
but started gasping for air a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Solares was transported to Westlake Medical Center, where a nursing supervisor 
said she remained in critical condition as of 4 p.m. after emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Fire Department Capt. Charles Sitton said that when his engine 
company arrived at the scene, Solares had already been moved from beneath the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman apparently realized the car was moving and tried to stop it from 
outside the vehicle, Sitton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happened was that she was trying to stop the car and the door 
knocked her down," Sitton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he has seen a few similar accidents during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they try to do is stop the thing from outside and that's where they 
usually get into trouble," Sitton said. "What people should do is either get 
back inside the car and stop it mechanically, or get completely clear."

PLANNERS TO CONSIDER TOWNHOUSE PROJECT; THOUSAND OAKS: THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR 
45 MULTIFAMILY UNITS TO BE BUILT NORTH OF HILLCREST DRIVE. NEIGHBORS HAVE GIVEN 
SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to build 45 multifamily townhouses along Hillcrest Drive in 
Thousand Oaks has met the scrutiny of nearby residents and will come before the 
Planning Commission tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 The development, which would be built on rolling hills north of Hillcrest 
Drive near Skyline Drive, would replace two existing homes, one of which was 
converted recently into a church. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings, with built-in parking garages and a swimming facility, would be 
located next to an office complex on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The two existing structures on the property will be demolished, according to a 
city report. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the 200-member Conejo Valley Church of Religious Science 
said they initiated the development when church leaders realized they no longer 
had space for the entire congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked on the back of the property, which rests at the foot of a steep, grassy 
hillside, the church has a tiny sanctuary on the house's second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had standing-room-only services lately and so the congregation agreed 
to contact builders and this is what we came up with," said the Rev. David 
Laughray, a church spokesman. "We think it will be a solid addition to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The church, which plans to relocate, sold the land to Patriot Builders, a Los 
Angeles-based developer. It proposed building the townhomes on a portion of the 
five-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials were not available to comment on the project, but city planners 
recommended that the Planning Commission approve the project as well as several 
zoning changes allowing for construction of the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's architect, Francisco Behr, said the developer has cooperated 
fully with the city's requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end this will actually be a lower-intensity development than all of 
the buildings that are around this property," Behr said. "We've really bent 
over backward to comply with everything the city wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, he said, will be built on the more level portion of the parcel, 
leaving the steep slopes at the rear of the property undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, a portion of the hillside that was scarred during grading for 
the current structures will be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby homeowners' activist Rickie Whitman said that as long as the developer 
sticks to the plans it presented to the Westlake Hills Homeowners Assn. in 
March, the group will not fight the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very glad they came to us in advance, and we have the sense from them 
that this won't drastically impact us," Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behr and a representative from Patriot Builders told the group's board that 
the homes would be Mediterranean-style and would feature earth tones and tiled 
roofs, Whitman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The group was also assured that no parking would be allowed along Hillcrest 
Drive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, if approved, will begin construction at the end of this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The townhomes will be priced in the $200,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the project is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. today at the 
Planning Commission meeting at Thousand Oaks City Hall, 2400 Willow Lane.

PROPOSAL TARGETS BETTER BUS SERVICE; SIMI VALLEY: CITY COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER A 
5-YEAR PLAN FOCUSING ON EFFICIENCY, CONVENIENCE AND MEETING FEDERAL AIR-QUALITY 
REQUIREMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Future bus service in Simi Valley will be more efficient, convenient and 
environmentally sound, according to a five-year transit plan the City Council 
will consider tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan, over the next year the city will refine bus 
routes, replace computers, install bus shelters and buy a new van for the 
city's Dial-a-Ride service. 
</P>
<P>
 And, within five years, the city will begin running buses that don't need 
gasoline, in order to comply with federal air-quality requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, formally called the Short-Range Transit Plan, is required of all 
jurisdictions that use state and federal transit money to fund 
government-mandated programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley uses transit money to help pay for its four bus lines and will 
also use the funding to pay its share of the Ventura Intercity Transit 
Authority, or VISTA, scheduled to begin service in July. 
</P>
<P>
 That service is designed to make it easier to take the bus from one city to 
another in Ventura County and northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also received $1.9 million to buy an entirely new fleet of buses 
that are fueled by something other than gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan, the city will begin looking for a contractor 
to study fueling alternatives, which include electricity and compressed natural 
gas, said Judy Collins, deputy director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the same situation as most other cities right now," Collins said. 
"Everybody is looking for ways to get into compliance with these federal 
requirements to improve the air quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for six new bus shelters, five new computers for 
transportation workers and a new van for the Dial-a-Ride service, which caters 
to disabled residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will assemble new bus schedules and survey residents to 
find ways to improve service on its four bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership has increased steadily over the past five years. Last year, riders 
took about 360,000 trips on the system, according to a staff report that will 
be presented to the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the council agreed to cut midday fares to 1989 rates to encourage 
even more residents to take the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., regular fares are reduced from 75 to 50 cents. The 
fare for senior citizens and disabled riders drops from 25 to 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The system operates Mondays through Saturdays from about 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
throughout the city and to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis, who also serves on the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, supports the alternative-fuel bus service but thinks some of the 
federal money should be diverted to help fund the Metrolink commuter rail 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every few years the Feds come along and tell us about some new way to improve 
our buses that costs millions of dollars," Davis said. "Meanwhile we've got a 
great train service that will take us into the next century that need funds now 
to keep going. The train seems to me like a more sensible way to spend the 
money."

MIKE PENNER: ONCE THERE, ANDERSON'S RIDE IS SMOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You thought the Angels' season ended this weekend, didn't you? Didn't 
everyone? The news of "possible multiple loose bodies" floating around in Mark 
Langston's left elbow was supposed to finish this team before its home opener, 
considering the multiple loose bodies that compose the remainder of the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Brian Anderson arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Brian Anderson arrived, the Angels had many pairs of fingers crossed. 
Not that Anderson would step in for Langston, retire 17 consecutive Milwaukee 
Brewers, carry a shutout in the ninth inning and earn his first major league 
victory with a breezy 8 1/3 innings at County Stadium. That was fairy-tale 
stuff, too good to be true, too much to ask for on a day the Angels simply 
wanted to endure without inflicting any permanent damage on the road-weary arms 
in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' only hope was for Anderson to arrive. Just get here. Preferably by 
game time, although Buck Rodgers probably would have been willing to strike a 
cosmic deal for the bottom of the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's trip to Milwaukee was fraught with hazard, high anxiety and 
spine-tingling suspense -- nothing at all like his trip through the Milwaukee 
batting order. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's 24 hours in limbo began Saturday morning in Vancouver, where he 
received word that he would be guest-hurling for Langston on Sunday afternoon 
in Milwaukee. OK, fine, Anderson said. How do I get there? 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sims, Angel traveling secretary, booked Anderson on a whirlwind tour of 
some of the finest airport terminals in North America -- Vancouver to Seattle 
to Denver to Milwaukee. That was Plan A. Three legs through two time zones, 
leave at 11:40 in morning, touch down in Milwaukee at 9:30 at night. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the best-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson made it to Seattle as scheduled, but it was snowing in Denver. All 
incoming flights would have to be delayed, long enough for Anderson to miss his 
connection to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the desk in Denver and they told me there were no more flights," 
Anderson said. "I told the lady behind the counter that I had to be in 
Milwaukee for a 1 o'clock game, but it didn't look promising. The lady just 
kept typing with this crooked mouth, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "She finally said, 'We can get you there by 2.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her, 'That would be the third inning. That's not gonna work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson then placed a call to Sims, outlining the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Anderson, Sims' response was measured, succinct and to the point: 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be here tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson laughed as he recalled the conversation. Yes, Frank, I know, I know. 
</P>
<P>
 On to Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims: "You better rent a car and drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "From Denver? " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he thought I was in Chicago," Anderson said. "When I told him I was 
in Denver, he said, 'Oh no.' I really didn't think I'd get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was a desperate man. Frantically, he tracked down a couple of airport 
officials, pleaded his case and apparently lucked into a pair of baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were wonderful," Anderson said. "They took me to a separate terminal and 
got me on a flight to Minneapolis at 9:30 and then a flight the next morning 
from Minneapolis to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into Minneapolis at 1 in the morning, got to my hotel room at 2 and 
didn't get to sleep until 2:30. Then I had to wake up at 6 a.m. to catch a 7:30 
flight. That flight was supposed to get me here at 9 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case, Rodgers made contingency plans. If Anderson couldn't get here 
from there, Rodgers "probably would've gone with Scottie Lewis, try to get 
three or four innings out of him, and then go with the freshest arms I had in 
the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers cringed at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, what I was trying to do was just get the game in. That was my chief 
thing. Get nine innings in without completely destroying the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 In Minneapolis, Anderson phoned home, asking his mother for a 5:50 a.m. 
wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way yesterday was going," Anderson said, "if I asked the hotel for a 
wake-up call, I probably would've missed it. I would have had a lot of 
explaining to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, 10 minutes to six, Mom came through in the clutch. She rang her 
son's room, told him to have a safe -- and on-time -- flight and wished him 
luck against the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, she gave me a full scouting report," Anderson quipped. " 'OK, they 
got Brunansky. . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 On less than four hours' sleep, jet-lagged from here to British Columbia, 
Anderson took care of Brunansky, and Kevin Seitzer, and Pat Listach -- 25 
hitters in all. He gave up a double and two singles in the first three innings, 
then nothing at all from the fourth into the ninth, when Turner Ward singled 
and Tom Brunansky doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 That pitch to Brunansky, his 122nd of the afternoon, would be the last for 
Anderson. Rodgers knows a dog-tired rookie pitcher when he sees one, so he 
edited a good story before the ending turned sloppy and brought in Joe Grahe 
for the final two words: "The" and "End." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly an hour after the final out, Anderson, jagged on adrenaline, was still 
chatting with reporters, eliciting bursts of laughter about his wild night's 
ride over the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Anderson if Langston had said anything to him after his stellar 
understudy performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Lewis interjected as he walked by the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Don't do that again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone laughed one more time. Langston has nothing to worry about, other 
than today's examination with the Angel doctors. Anderson was simply glad to be 
here, simply glad to lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He accomplished both, just in the nick of time.

21-HOUR JOURNEY TO EUPHORIA; BASEBALL: NEW ANGEL PITCHER BRIAN ANDERSON'S ONLY

 Brian Anderson groggily reached for the telephone, peeked at his alarm clock, 
and at 5:50 in the morning, listened to that familiar voice on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey, it's time to get up. It's time to get ready to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 It was his mother, Janice Anderson, calling from Geneva, Ohio, telling her son 
that in seven hours he would be pitching in the major leagues for the 
California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was back in my Little League days," Anderson said, understandably 
forgetting that he was in a strange Minneapolis hotel room. "I was getting 
flashbacks. It was like, 'OK, who are we playing today?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In what turned out to be a zany 21-hour journey that belonged in a John Candy 
movie -- traveling from Vancouver to Seattle to Denver to Minneapolis to 
Milwaukee -- Anderson somehow found himself on the pitcher's mound at Milwaukee 
County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing he knew, Anderson was pitching the game of his life, 
mesmerizing the Milwaukee Brewers, 4-1, in front of 11,860 fans wondering where 
in the world this 21-year-old came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who was pitching for Wright State University in Ohio at this time a 
year ago, retired 17 consecutive batters at one point. He came within two outs 
of a shutout, and left after yielding five hits in 8 1/3 innings, throwing 122 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a guy who only got four hours' sleep and got snowed in in Denver," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers joked, "he pitched a pretty damn good ballgame, don't you 
think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's first major league victory came in only his sixth professional 
start and ninth pro appearance of any kind. His teammates celebrated the 
occasion by drenching him in beer, and the coaching staff presented him with 
the official lineup sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 His last victory? 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Illinois in the Mid-Continent Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson originally was scheduled to be pitching against the Salt Lake Buzz of 
the Pacific Coast League today, but when Mark Langston was placed on the 
disabled list, he got the call to come as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed from Nat Bailey Stadium to his apartment in Vancouver to pack his 
bags, barely made it in time to the airport, and then all the fun began. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a flight from Vancouver to Seattle with no problems. But the next leg 
-- from Seattle to Denver -- was delayed by a snowstorm in Denver. He arrived 
in Denver 10 minutes after his connection to Milwaukee left. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was, stranded in the crowded terminal at Denver Stapleton Airport, 
wondering what in the world he was going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The last flight to Milwaukee was gone. The next flight wasn't leaving until 
Sunday morning, and it was arriving at 2 p.m. -- one hour after game time. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had no choice but to call Angel traveling secretary Frank Sims. He 
alerted him of his dilemma. Sims was making sure that Anderson understood the 
magnitude of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Sims: "You have to be here tomorrow! You're pitching!" 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "What can I do, the last flight already left." 
</P>
<P>
 Sims: "Well, rent a car and drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson: "From Denver?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I made him a nervous wreck," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Anderson scrambled to find alternative plans, the Angels quickly made 
contingency plans. Rodgers decided that if Anderson couldn't make it, reliever 
Scott Lewis would be given the start. Bill Sampen would follow in relief. Then 
Craig Lefferts. Then, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, pleading his case to understanding airline officials, was put on a 
flight that arrived in Minneapolis at 1 a.m. He was in his hotel room at 2. 
Asleep at 2:30. Awakened at 5:50. On a plane to Milwaukee at 7:30. And sitting 
alone in the Angel clubhouse at 9:15, 1 1/2 hours before the arrival of the 
team bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working on pure adrenaline," said Anderson, who last pitched in a game 
10 days ago, against the Colorado Rockies' triple-A team. "I just kept reading 
every magazine and newspaper I could find until everyone got here." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the game ended, Anderson found himself swarmed by reporters, 
teased by teammates, and wondering if life can get any better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have been prouder of him today," said Langston, who will be 
examined today to determine if he must undergo elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable the way he went out there and picked us up. I couldn't 
have gone out there and done a better job." 
</P>
<P>
 What did Langston tell Anderson after the game?  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't do it again," Lewis joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Langston: "I just told him he better keep pitching like that, too, 
because I'll be back."

JIM MURRAY: AUGUSTA'S STILL A PART OF EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A foreigner won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 And grass is green and water's wet and the Pope is Polish and there are still 
bear tracks in the woods and the sun sets in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Like, what else is new? This is the sixth time in the last seven years a 
European player has won. You would think this course was in Scotland instead of 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing if a Scot or a Welshman or even an Aussie or South African wins 
-- but a Spaniard and a German? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tradition for the last Masters champion to put the green coat 
emblematic of victory here on the new winner, and Sunday night saw Herr 
Bernhard Langer of the Fatherland draping the coveted haberdashery over the 
shoulders of Senor Jose Maria Olazabal of old Bilbao or San Sebastian, Spain. 
We go from umlaut to tilde, Achtung! to Ole!  
</P>
<P>
 Spain has now won this thing three times in 11 years. Severiano Ballesteros 
won here twice and scared American players to death at a number of other 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballesteros used to play golf like he was fighting a bull. Olazabal plays it 
like he is making a watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballesteros won like a guy jumping through a skylight with an Uzi. Olazabal 
sneaks up on you like a pickpocket. Either way, they made more money out of the 
New World than anybody since the Conquistadores. Augusta is the new Eldorado.  
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal does not play that sword-in-the-teeth game of Ballesteros. He pretty 
much sticks to the fairway. He is as unexcitable as a butler.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, you would have to award him two ears and the tail for his performance 
in this year's Masters. He opened with a lackluster 74 but soon put his game 
back on the tracks.  
</P>
<P>
 This is no dilettante who took up golf to give himself something to do between 
flamenco dances. Olazabal once won a U.S. tournament, the World Series of Golf, 
by a record 12 strokes, one of the most incandescent exhibitions of golf ever 
seen on the American tour -- 61-67-67-67. The Yanks were so rocked by the 
display that it was freely predicted he would be the next world top player, a 
distinction the U.S. contingent pretty much abdicated when Nicklaus and Palmer 
left the scene.  
</P>
<P>
 It turned out this new Spanish grandee didn't have all that much to beat by 
Sunday afternoon here at the Augusta National. Tom Lehman, who has never won a 
PGA event, was his closest pursuer. Larry Mize, who won a Masters in 1987 and 
not much else, was also in the hunt.  
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal took to the course with a note from his mentor, Ballesteros, in his 
pocket and a confident attitude. But before you think Olazabal learned golf 
from a book or from old Ballesteros videos, be disabused. Like Arnold Palmer, 
he was raised on a golf course. The putting green was 35 feet away, the first 
tee was 100 and the ninth green was 60. He had a golf club in his hands right 
after he threw away the rattle. His first words were Spanish for "Fore!" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Palmer's course was in Latrobe, Pa. Olazabal's was in San 
Sebastian. To be sure, you need competition to get good at anything. To be the 
best speller in Patagonia probably will not lead to a literary career. So, 
Ballesteros brought him to England to get literate at golf.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has a theory on why the European golfers do so well at Augusta. The 
reason is obvious: the greens at Augusta are so hard and fast and unyielding, 
they resemble pre-World War British courses.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans are used to drive-and-an-eight-iron golf. You fire shots at watered 
greens and the ball sticks where it alights. In Britain, where the greens were 
historically watered only by God and the fairways mowed by sheep, you had to 
run the ball up to the green -- land it short of the putting surface and 
cannily run it on, gauging how much topspin to put on it. American backspin was 
not possible.  
</P>
<P>
 The Masters' flint-hard greens do not hold the Yankee game, in which the balls 
are flung on like darts in a pub to stick where they hit. The Masters rejects 
high, hard approaches, pushes them aside or onward.  
</P>
<P>
 Player after player concedes the Europeans play a more imaginative short game 
than the Yanks because of this and thus have an advantage at Augusta. This is 
not so apparent at a U.S. Open or PGA, where the courses are more typically 
watered by sprinklers and mowed so balls don't ricochet off a green like a 
bullet off a tank.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was not the agronomy alone that helped Olazabal excel.  
</P>
<P>
 The 15th hole at the Masters is a psychopath that is alternately as docile as 
a milkmaid or as venomous as a puff adder. You had guys shooting 8s (Tom 
Watson), 10s (Nolan Henke) and 7s and 9s this week. It drowned the hopes of a 
half-dozen of our greatest shotmakers.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, when the wind's not blowing and the fairway is greasy fast, 
you had guys (Tom Lehman) hitting nine-irons for their second shots on this 
500-yard hole Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, it was in between mood swings. You could attack it, but not insult 
it. Olazabal came up to it with a medium-good drive -- at least straight as 
most of his are -- and a five-iron that looked like disaster. It seemed to be 
short and it lit on a slope that normally carries it back to the water. This 
time it didn't. The ball stayed, precariously but steadily. Meanwhile, 
Olazabal's pursuer, Lehman, hit a superlative 190-yard six-iron that was not 
only safely on the green, but stopped about a dozen feet above the hole. It 
looked like a sure eagle, which would have recaptured the lead for Lehman.  
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal calmly ran in his putt for the eagle, boosting his lead. Naturally, 
Lehman missed his eagle putt. It's an axiom of golf thatwhen your opponent runs 
in a long putt, yours becomes impossible. The hole shrinks, the distance 
doubles, the putter suddenly feels like a live snake in your hands. Lehman's 
putt wobbled past the hole. He was down two shots with three holes to play.  
</P>
<P>
 That was the old golf tournament. The Old Country won again. Maybe we should 
invite the Russians. Give them a whack at the 15th hole and the Masters, a 
piece of real estate that should be under international jurisdiction, maybe by 
the U.N.

THE MASTERS; OLAZABAL REVIVES REIGN OF SPAIN; GOLF: AFTER BARELY FALLING SHORT 
OF VICTORY IN 1991, HE EAGLES NO. 15 TO WIN THE TITLE BY TWO SHOTS OVER LEHMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 The Masters is not won by rookies or conquered by the inexperienced. It's as 
if the Augusta National golf course must tear at your heart, rip at your soul, 
before allowing you a place in its trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny, windless day in golf's playground of tradition, Jose Maria 
Olazabal received such vindication. He battled the final 10 holes with two 
quite different opponents. There was Larry Mize, who has felt that 
indescribable feeling of being a Masters champion. And Tom Lehman, whose career 
has been marked by failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal effectively won the tournament Sunday when he eagled the 15th hole 
with an improbable 30-foot putt, as Lehman was staring at a possible eagle from 
15 feet. Olazabal could easily have taken a penalty stroke on that third shot 
because his second shot came within a foot of landing in the water. Instead, as 
if held up by some unseen force, the ball stayed on the bank and kept 
Olazabal's dream of winning the Masters from drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal has felt the heartbreak of losing the Masters before. In 1991, he 
approached the 18th tee on the final day tied with Ian Woosnam and Tom Watson. 
Olazabal's tee shot landed in the bunker and his chances of victory lay buried 
in the sand. He bogeyed the hole and Watson double-bogeyed, leaving Woosnam the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Olazabal tried on occasion to give the tournament to Lehman, but he 
wouldn't accept the gift. Meanwhile, Mize's game simply was missing, and you 
can't miss on these finishing holes. Nonetheless, it provided the high drama 
that the final round of the Masters usually does. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal entered Sunday's round one shot behind Lehman and one in front of 
Mize. When the day ended, Olazabal's 69 was good enough for a four-day total of 
279, nine under. Lehman shot a 72 and finished at seven under, and Mize's 71 
left him at six under. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite, never a factor in Sunday's round, finished with a 71 and 283, while 
Jay Haas (69), Loren Roberts (70) and Jim McGovern (72) were at 285. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no words in a special moment like this," Olazabal said. "You can't 
describe how you feel. It's quite different (than how I dreamed it would feel.) 
It's that much better." 
</P>
<P>
 The showdown started when Olazabal birdied the par-five eighth hole after 
two-putting from 30 feet. He, Mize and Lehman were all at eight under, with 
Mize playing in the group ahead of Olazabal and Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
 The three remained tied until Mize hit his ball over the 12th green and missed 
a four-foot putt for par. Lehman also lost a stroke on 12, when he, too, flew 
the green and missed a nine-foot putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize was on the par-five 13th green in two and settled for a birdie to move 
him back to eight under and a share of the lead. Then, Olazabal's tee shot on 
13 went into the trees, landing on a patch of pine needles. He had no chance of 
making the green in two. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal studied his shot and proceeded to clean some of the pine needles from 
around his ball as if he were playing a game of pick-up sticks. It was a tricky 
move because if the ball had moved, he would have been assessed a penalty 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he laid up out of the trees while Lehman blasted his second shot over 
the green. Olazabal chipped on to the green and got his par while Lehman 
struggled from behind the green and also settled for a par. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize bogeyed the 14th and parred the 15th, effectively taking him out of 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal and Lehman exchanged pars on the 14th. Then, Olazabal took control. 
His second shot barely stayed out of the water, while Lehman placed his 15 feet 
from the pin. Olazabal made his putt, Lehman didn't, barely missing to the side 
of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Olazabal) made that putt, it just motivated me to make mine," Lehman 
said. "I was actually pretty shocked when mine didn't go in. . . . It was a 
shot in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman got his birdie, but it was little consolation. Olazabal was now 10 
under and Lehman was at eight under. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal tried to let Lehman back in tournament when he bogeyed the 17th after 
his putt from off the green got caught in the grass and stopped six feet short 
of the cup. He missed the putt and took a one-stroke lead to the 72nd hole.  
</P>
<P>
 "After the 16th hole, I thought that this is the best chance I have to win the 
tournament," Olazabal said. "After the 17th, I said, 'I better be careful now.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman, hitting first on 18, killed the suspense when he sent his one-iron off 
the tee into the left fairway bunker. His second shot was a seven-iron that 
landed 30 feet short of the green. Olazabal struggled, too, when his second 
shot flew well past the green into the gallery, but by then Lehman had taken 
himself out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "All week long I was hitting a driver into the big bunker," Lehman said. 
"Today I hit my one-iron 265 yards into the bunker; normally I hit a one-iron 
240 yards. I didn't think I would go in the bunker . . . if I had to do it 
again, I'd hit a one-iron again." 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal's Masters victory was the second by a player from Spain. The firstwas 
by Seve Ballesteros, who won in 1980 and '83. Ballesteros shot a 71 on Sunday 
and finished at 292 and in a tie for 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Ballesteros went to the tee, he gave a note of encouragement to 
Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good note . . . I plan to save it," Olazabal said, coyly refusing to 
reveal the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to now, Seve was everything when it came to golf in Spain," Olazabal said. 
"Now, it would be nice if I could help Seve with golf in Spain. . . . But just 
because I won a Masters, doesn't mean you can compare me to Seve. He's one of 
the best players in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal isn't so bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was his 19th victory worldwide and third on the U.S. Tour, joining the 
1990 World Series of Golf and the 1991 International. He has played on four 
Ryder Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He was undecided on his next U.S. appearance before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll play in the U.S. Open now," he said. "Maybe a tournament or two 
before it, also." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lehman, maybe the pain and heartbreak he felt Sunday will someday be 
repaid by Augusta National. It was for Olazabal.

FITTIPALDI AVOIDS WRECK, WINS AT PHOENIX; AUTO RACING: NO ONE IS SERIOUSLY 
INJURED IN FIVE-CAR ACCIDENT. UNSER JR. FINISHES SECOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After the most frightening multi-car accident ever seen at Phoenix 
International Raceway took out pole-sitter Paul Tracy and four others, Emerson 
Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr. gave the Penske Marlboro team a 1-2 finish Sunday 
in the Slick-50 200 Indy car race. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending PPG Cup champion Nigel Mansell, driving a backup car after damaging 
his primary Lola-Ford in a late afternoon crash during Saturday's practice, 
finished third, a lap behind the Penske teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy I'm sitting here, it was one of the scariest times I've ever 
had in motor racing," said the former world Formula One champion from England, 
who expressed concerns about the safety of the track after record speeds were 
set during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-car pileup started on lap 62. Hiro Matsushita, who was 16 laps down 
at the time after making several pit stops, found himself sandwiched between 
two faster cars heading for the third turn. One got past on the low side, but 
Teo Fabi, trying to squeeze between Matsushita and the wall, clipped wheels 
with the young Japanese driver from San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact sent both cars into the wall, but Matsushita's ended up in the 
middle of the track. That seemed to be the end of it as the yellow caution 
lights came on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several seconds went by, as did many cars under the yellow," Matsushita said. 
"Then I saw (Jacque) Villeneuve coming straight at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve, forced to remain in a high groove because he had two cars on his 
left, smashed his Reynard directly into the center panel of Matsushita's car, 
breaking it in half. The nose and cockpit, with the driver inside, slid to the 
left. The engine and gearbox went to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an incredible hit," said Matsushita, who suffered only a shoulder 
separation. "I cannot believe the car withstood so much force. I was lucky to 
walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 Few among the 58,000 spectators could believe it, either, when Matsushita 
climbed out of the car and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve continued down the track and slid in front of Dominic Dobson. 
Tracy, who was leading the race at the time, was pinned against the wall by 
pieces of Matsushita's broken car. "I thought I was clear, but obviously I was 
wrong," Dobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year in a row Tracy crashed while leading the race. Last 
year, he was more than a lap ahead when he slid out while trying to lap another 
car.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Hiro and someone else get together," Tracy said. "I thought I could get 
through it when something hit me."  
</P>
<P>
 More fortunate were Fittipaldi, Unser and Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came along right in the middle of it and didn't know where to go," Mansell 
said. "Half a car was flying one way and half a car was flying another. When I 
got through, I went down the straight too slow because I didn't know if I had 
run over debris. That's when (Fittipaldi) pitted, took on four tires and fuel 
and was gone. That's where I lost the lap." 
</P>
<P>
 It took safety crews 27 laps under caution conditions to clean up the debris, 
which along with two other accidents, contributed to Fittipaldi's slow winning 
speed of 107.437 m.p.h. for 200 laps around the D-shaped, one-mile track. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusty conditions, caused by gusts of up to 40 m.p.h., caused Michael Andretti 
to run up into the rear of two slower cars, knocking Andretti out of the race 
on lap 162. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came around the corner (in the third turn) and I saw a big cloud of dust 
and I thought it was a sand storm," Andretti said. "It was blinding." 
</P>
<P>
 In a chain reaction from the crash, a wheel flew off Andretti's car and sailed 
over the fence into a hillside spectator area. The huge tire hit once and 
bounced toward a tent, sending spectators scurrying. Four people were injured, 
none seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, making the final start of his career in Phoenix -- where his 
Indy car career started 30 years ago -- also crashed because of a cut tire 
after driving over debris. A piece of Andretti's wing hit Raul Boesel in the 
helmet, braking his visor.

HE'S WORTH MORE THAN A THOUSAND WORDS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC'S IFEANYI IS A

 A well-remembered picture, in a long-forgotten magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Israel (Izzy) Ifeanyi is on USC's football practice field this 
spring, launching his 6-foot-4, 245-pound body into Trojan ball carriers and 
quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi, a 23-year-old junior from Nigeria, doesn't remember the name of the 
magazine or who was wearing the football uniform.  
</P>
<P>
 He simply remembers thinking: "This is what I want to be -- an American 
football warrior." 
</P>

 Ifeanyi talked the other day about the picture: "I was about 13, living with 
my grandmother in Owerri, Nigeria, and all I remember is being at a friend's 
house, looking at this magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this picture of an American football player, and I was very 
impressed with it. The player seemed like a warrior to me. I decided then 
that's what I wanted to be, a football player.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember what the magazine was, or who the player was, but I can 
still clearly remember the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime later, his father got him an early 1980s videotape of a 
Miami-Cincinnati NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched it over and over," he said. "I didn't even know the names of the 
positions, but I couldn't wait then to learn how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi, who had been a promising young cricket player in Nigeria, came to the 
United States in 1990 and initially stayed with a friend and his family in 
Windsor, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned there that a good place for me to be in order to qualify for 
college, and to learn football, was California," he said. "I wanted to start at 
a California junior college." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi contacted another Nigerian athlete, Uzoma Obiekea, who was playing 
basketball at El Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uzoma was living in Inglewood with his brothers and sisters, and in 1991 I 
moved in for a couple of months with them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Uzoma went to UC Irvine to play basketball and I went there one day with him. 
I heard about Orange Coast College being there (in Costa Mesa) and I went there 
one afternoon to introduce myself to the football coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Taylor, Orange Coast defensive coordinator, recalled: "Izzy walked in the 
door one day and just introduced himself, and said he wanted to play football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I noticed about him was that he filled up the doorway pretty 
good.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know much about football, but he's a bright guy and he picked up 
the game really fast. He's got a great football body and runs a 4.6-second 40. 
We played him at outside linebacker and at defensive end on pass plays.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had a good freshman season for us in '92, but he really improved last 
season. The coaches voted him a unanimous all-conference player. He'll be a pro 
someday." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Lindsey, USC's defensive coordinator, found it hard to believe that 
Ifeanyi had never put on a football uniform until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obviously very well coached in JC," Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't tell by watching him in practice that he has so little experience. 
He's very success-oriented. He has a great desire to win and to do all the 
little things right.  
</P>
<P>
 "He still has a way to go, because next season he'll see things he's never 
seen before . . . guys the size of Tony Boselli (USC's 6-8, 300-pound 
All-American offensive tackle) blocking him.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a team full of guys like him, you couldn't wait to get to practice 
every day. He's hungry to learn, hungry to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi will play outside linebacker for the Trojans and will line up as a 
defensive end on pass plays, Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 And he will wear a special linebacker's number, 55. That was Junior Seau's 
number in 1988 and '89, and it was also worn by departing senior linebacker 
Willie McGinest. 
</P>
<P>
 In spring drills, Lindsey said, Ifeanyi's pass rushing has been superior to 
his defending against the run. 
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson won't declare Ifeanyi a starter yet, but the Trojan coach said: 
"He plays hard and he can really move. He'll play a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ifeanyi said Robinson gets high marks for patience, adding: "I was very 
nervous when practice started, because I know so much is expected of me.  
</P>
<P>
 "But Coach Robinson made me feel much better when he came up to me the first 
day and said, 'Go ahead and just play. And don't be afraid to make mistakes.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Lindsey told me to learn all the little things first, like lining up in 
the right place. And not to try and make the big play every time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Ifeanyi might be able to provide more to USC than his own talent 
in his new sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a "little" brother, back home in Nigeria. Seems he plays basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 19 and 6-4 when I left home, and my little brother was taller than I 
was," he said. "The last time we played basketball, he beat me." Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC will finish spring drills Saturday with an 11 a.m. scrimmage. . . . In 
addition to Israel Ifeanyi, Coach John Robinson has expressed satisfaction with 
three other junior college transfers who have practiced all spring -- wide 
receiver Keyshawn Johnson and defensive end Marcus Bonds of West Los Angeles, 
and linebacker Errick Herrin of Mt. San Jacinto.

SANTA ANITA; BROCCO IS PLACED ON RESTRICTED LIST; INJURY IS DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brocco, the winner of Saturday's Santa Anita Derby and the co-favorite with 
Holy Bull for the Kentucky Derby, was placed on the state veterinarian's 
restricted list Sunday, although trainer Randy Winick says that there is 
nothing wrong with the colt. 
</P>
<P>
 Horses on the restricted list are not allowed to work out for five days and 
after that they can race only if they show they have recovered. To satisfy that 
condition, Winick has tentatively scheduled a workout for Brocco next Saturday 
at Santa Anita, which would result in a different training schedule for the 
horse leading up to the Kentucky Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 B. William Bell, the state veterinarian at Santa Anita, noticed that Brocco 
was favoring one of his front legs Saturday after the colt had finished his 
post-race urine test in the receiving barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very, very slightly off in one of his front legs," Bell said. "On a 
scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst, I would rate this as a one. It's 
something that a horse might get from a stone bruise. It wasn't serious, but I 
was obligated to put him on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Winick was not at the receiving barn when Bell noticed Brocco's right foreleg, 
but the trainer was represented by Mike Steppe, who is the colt's veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong at all with the horse," Winick said. "We respectfully 
disagree with his being put on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible to race again, Brocco must have a five-furlong workout in a 
time of 1:03 or faster. Bell said that because Brocco was scheduled to be sent 
to Kentucky next weekend, Winick may work the colt at Santa Anita or Churchill 
Downs, where Brocco would be observed by a Kentucky state veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just as soon get this behind us before we ship," Winick said. "My guess 
is that (the workout) will be Saturday. He walked (under the barn's shedrow) 
for 45 minutes Sunday, which is normal, and there were no problems. I'm 
planning to walk him some more for two days, then get him back to the track to 
gallop on Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Winick had planned to ship the colt to Kentucky without any more workouts at 
Santa Anita. Brocco will still be flown to Kentucky next weekend, which doesn't 
differ from the original shipping plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has no history of lameness," Winick said. "We've never treated him 
for anything. All I can think of is that this relates to the body soreness and 
the tying up that he did earlier this season, before he started racing." 
</P>
<P>
 At the barn early Sunday morning, Winick had said that Brocco came out of 
Saturday's race sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mention the vet's list then, because I didn't find out about it 
until afterward," Winick said Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In all six of his races, Brocco has been treated with phenylbutazone, a legal 
painkiller that was also given to the other five Santa Anita Derby starters. 
Brocco has also raced with Lasix, a diuretic that is routinely given to horses 
that experience pulmonary bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anita Derby was Brocco's fourth victory in six starts and his first 
since the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita in November. After the 
Breeders' Cup, Brocco ran second to Valiant Nature in the Hollywood Futurity 
and in his only start this year was second to Soul Of The Matter in the San 
Felipe Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of those rivals ran Saturday, Valiant Nature being held for the Blue 
Grass Stakes at Keeneland next Saturday and Soul Of The Matter being scratched 
because of a blister on his lower left foreleg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been putting salve on the blister and hosing it, and it's getting 
better every day," said Richard Mandella, who trains Soul Of The Matter. "If 
the race had been (Sunday), he would have been able to run, but I wanted to 
take the conservative approach. Now I'm leaning toward running in the Lexington 
(at Keeneland on April 24), with an outside chance that we'd go in the Blue 
Grass. I'll have to make my decision by Tuesday, when a plane takes some 
California horses to Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco was three-quarters of a length better than Tabasco Cat, with trainer 
Charlie Whittingham's pair, Strodes Creek and Numerous, taking the next two 
positions. Strodes Creek was beaten by 1 3/4 lengths and Numerous, who threw a 
shoe in the race, was almost seven lengths behind Brocco.

<P>
TO LOSE HIS TEMPER, WAGNER MAKES A RUN FOR IT; VOLLEYBALL: CALMER DEMEANOR NETS 
SCHOLARSHIP WITH PRESTIGIOUS LONG BEACH STATE PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State volleyball player Martin Wagner greets you with a warm smile 
and an easygoing demeanor. Don't let it fool you. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later he's explaining his transition from playing high school 
volleyball to community college to the Division I level. And it seems Wagner 
wasn't always such a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he admits, he used to get downright nasty during his two years on 
University High's varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I had a temper," said Wagner, a 6-foot-4 junior who plays opposite the 
setter. "I would get down on myself when I hit a ball out. Sure, I would be 
telling myself to do it better the next time, but, unfortunately, I was 
slamming the ball while I was doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wagner wasn't Mr. Congeniality in high school, so what? It's amazing how a 
little maturity -- and running a few laps in practice -- can change a kid's 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're curious about the results, just check out what Wagner has been 
doing lately at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Since transferring from Irvine Valley College, Wagner has emerged as Long 
Beach State's top hitter in his first season with the 49ers. He's averaging 20 
kills per match, including 5.8 per game, for the 13th-ranked 49ers (12-13). 
</P>
<P>
 His season-high 41 kills against San Diego State on April 1 ranks as the 
fourth-best single-match performance in the nation this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems Wagner has been taking his frustrations out on the ball when it's 
actually in play. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest change has been my attitude," he said. "My temper disappeared when 
I was at Irvine Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner was one of the first players to wear an Irvine Valley uniform. Coach 
Tom Pestolesi built the program from scratch two years ago with talented high 
school players such as Wagner, who, somehow, were overlooked by Division I 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner was an All-Sea View League selection at University in 1991, his senior 
year. He was a good, all-around player, but Pestolesi was the only one who 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pestolesi had a knack for landing local high school talent, bringing in 
Wagner, Zolti Csanyi (University), Billy Nguyen (Newport Harbor), and 
Capistrano Valley's Brian Godshaw and Eric Olson as his first recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
 After a successful first year, that recruiting class was the key to Irvine 
Valley winning the State title last spring. So much for the sophomore jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no pressure playing there that first year," Wagner said, "because 
nobody expected anything from a first-year team. We had a little more pressure 
the second year, but we came through and won State." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Pestolesi found a cure for Wagner's ill attitude on the court. 
Go ahead and slam the ball and pout in practice, the coach told him, but you 
and your teammates will have to run every time you do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything came together at Irvine Valley," Wagner said. "Pestolesi showed me 
that there was no room for a temper, that I looked like a goofball, yelling and 
hollering out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner was named to the All-Orange Empire Conference's second team as a 
sophomore, and had offers from Pacific and Long Beach State after Irvine 
Valley's season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach was the best offer because it paid my whole tuition and was 
driving distance from home," Wagner said. "I've known (49er assistant coach) 
Mike D'Alessandro since high school, and I knew Long Beach would be a great 
place to play." 
</P>
<P>
 But would he get to play? This, after all, was Long Beach State, where former 
Dana Hills standout Brent Hilliard had blossomed into an Olympian. Only three 
seasons ago, the 49ers won the NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner arrived on campus last fall, started workouts and figured he would sit 
out as a redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two seniors in his lineup, 49er Coach Ray Ratelle decided to keep 
Wagner on the varsity. Wagner responded with 24 kills in his first 
regular-season match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit," Wagner said, "I was a bit nervous coming to a Division I 
school. I had watched college games as a kid, and everyone seemed so much 
bigger and better. But I'm not having too much trouble here, which surprises 
me."

Q & A: O.C. CASE SPURS NEW SAFEGUARDS; U.S. ACTS TO PROTECT INVESTORS AFTER 
WYMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The case of Steven D. Wymer, the Newport Beach investment adviser who pleaded 
guilty in 1992 to charges that he bilked clients of more than $200 million, 
sent a shock wave through the financial community. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also one of the factors that led to an extensive review of how the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission regulates investments. In March, SEC 
Chairman Arthur Levitt cited the Wymer case when he announced new rules that, 
among other things, prohibit investment advisers from making decisions about 
client accounts unless the client receives periodic account statements directly 
from an independent custodian. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Cacheris, regional director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission and former chief of the regulator's West Coast enforcement division, 
answered questions last week about new provisions of the Investment Advisors 
Act Rule, formulated to protect large and small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cacheris, 38, directs an office that covers California, Arizona, Nevada, 
Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Alaska, Idaho and Montana. She headed the SEC 
investigation of Wymer, who is serving 14 years in federal prison and last week 
began paying restitution to his former clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You described the case against Steven Wymer as one of the "most significant 
and financially devastating cases of securities fraud ever perpetrated." Why 
didn't the SEC rules in effect at the time protect the investors? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Several factors contributed to Wymer's ability to perpetrate the fraud on 
his clients and to disguise the amount of money that was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he maintained two sets of books and records. Wymer spent a great deal 
of time creating fictitious trade confirmations and customer account statements 
that were virtually indistinguishable from genuine documents. 
</P>
<P>
 It also appears that he may have been assisted by others, including account 
executives at the brokerage that held the defrauded investors' accounts. Our 
investigation into this is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, Wymer was also able to convince the defrauded investors that receipt of 
trade confirmations and account statements was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 He provided sometimes genuine and sometimes forged letters from his clients to 
the brokerage, authorizing it to send account statements and confirmations to 
Wymer alone, bypassing the investors, so they never saw the real status of 
their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How have the rules changed since then? What is the major new safeguard? 
</P>
<P>
 A The new rule . . . is specifically designed to prevent a Wymer-type 
situation by prohibiting investment advisers from trading discretionary 
accounts unless the holder of the securities has agreed to send -- and does 
send -- account statements to the clients on at least a quarterly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 By requiring the custodian to send account statements directly to each client 
at least every quarter, the rule will make it less likely that the adviser can 
gain unauthorized access to client accounts without being detected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why weren't changes made sooner? 
</P>
<P>
 A Although the number of investment advisers has expanded greatly and we have 
recognized the need for additional examiners to conduct periodic inspections, 
there are many existing investor protections. By and large, the industry is 
relatively safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rule will complement the existing regulatory protections by 
adding a provision designed specifically to address the type of fraud 
perpetrated by Wymer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Was the Wymer case a phenomenon of the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
 A It was definitely an era of higher interest rates and high earnings. When 
Wymer offered a better-than-market rate of return supposedly using a 
sophisticated trading strategy, clients may have found it easy to believe him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to realize, however, that in any era there will be individuals 
who are bent on committing fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Could the same thing happen now? 
</P>
<P>
 A The new rule would make it substantially more difficult to carry out such a 
scheme, although investors must be diligent in learning all they can about 
their money manager and how their funds are invested. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are new kinds of scams being perpetrated on investors today? If so, how do 
they work? 
</P>
<P>
 A. As long as greed and deceit are human characteristics, there will be 
investment frauds. The particular types of cases we've seen in Southern 
California of late are wireless cable offerings and prime bank investment 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the commission issued an alert to investors advising of the 
escalation of fraudulent schemes involving "prime" bank financial instruments. 
Typically, these instruments are in the form of notes, debentures, letters of 
credit or guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, there is a promise or guarantee of unrealistic rates of return. The 
purported association with prime financial institutions itself serves as an 
inducement to the unwary investor. In addition, the transaction is described in 
highly complex terms that make it extremely difficult for the investor to 
analyze. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What tips would you give to small investors looking for a safe place to put 
their money? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Ask a lot of questions before you invest. Ask directly about fees, 
commissions and all compensation to be received by your broker or financial 
adviser. Never invest merely on the basis of a phone call. Take your time to 
understand the investment. And never invest in anything you don't completely 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What other sorts of questions should people ask when they are considering 
an investment? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Just last month the SEC joined a group of securities regulators in 
launching a public awareness campaign to help investors better understand how 
to invest in stocks, bonds and other securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they issued a brochure, "Invest Wisely," which provides basic 
information to help investors select a brokerage firm and salesperson, identify 
decisions to be made before making an initial investment decision and address a 
problem that may arise. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure also helps investors identify questions they should ask, provides 
background information about the securities industry and describes practices 
that may signal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the brochure may be obtained at no charge from the SEC or from the 
other co-sponsoring regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How would you pick an investment adviser? 
</P>
<P>
 A. For probably a majority of small investors, it may make some sense to find 
a "fee-only" financial planner who will recommend allocating the family's 
resources among a variety of investment types based on the family's means and 
financial goals. 
</P>
<P>
 These advisers are called "fee-only" because they receive compensation based 
only on the time spent reviewing your financial situation and recommending 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 These advisers do not receive commissions on the sale of any particular 
products, so their advice is presumably the most objective. They may recommend 
placing some assets into a portfolio of no-load mutual funds, for example. Then 
the investment strategy and allocations should be reviewed on a periodic basis 
as the markets and family circumstances evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Many advisers are also registered representatives with a brokerage firm. They 
may not charge separately for their financial advice but will receive a 
commission based on the recommended products that you purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisers who manage client money on a discretionary continuous basis generally 
have a minimum account size, such as $100,000. They will charge an annual fee 
-- from 1% to 3%, for example -- for assets under management. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you think further protections for investors are necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 A. With that goal in mind, the chairman of our agency recently announced the 
creation of a Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee to assist us in resolving 
investor problems and being more responsive to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will explore broad, fundamental issues of concern to investors, 
including matters currently under consideration by the SEC and topics of 
emerging concern to investors and the financial services industry. Selecting an 
Investment Adviser 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission recommends taking these steps before 
you pick a financial consultant: 
</P>
<P>
 Get referrals: Ask your accountant, attorney or trusted friends with 
experience in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 Do a background check: Once you are considering a possible adviser: 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the Securities and Exchange Commission, (202) 942-7040, to find out if 
the person is registered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Call the North American Securities Administrators, (800) 289-9999, or the 
state securities agency in your area to find out if the person has a 
disciplinary history or if past arbitration awards have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you interview the adviser, go armed with lots of questions. Ask all of 
them, and make sure you get answers you fully understand. Also ask to see the 
adviser's FORM ADV, which is information provided to the SEC when an adviser 
registers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before investing: When considering an investment, do not sign the new account 
agreement unless you thoroughly understand it and agree with the terms and 
conditions. Do not rely on verbal representations not contained in the written 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTIONS TO ASK 
</P>
<P>
 * Who will control decision-making for your account? 
</P>
<P>
 You are responsible for all investment decisions involving your account unless 
you provide your broker with discretionary authority, which allows investment 
decisions to be made without consulting you first. Do not grant discretionary 
authority without considering the potential pitfalls, which include poor 
judgment or outright fraud on the part of the broker.

 * How will you pay for your investment? 
</P>
<P>
 Most investors maintain a cash account requiring full payment for each 
security purchase. An alternative is a margin account, which allows you to 
borrow money from the brokerage to buy securities. You will be charged interest 
on the amount borrowed and will be asked to sign an agreement disclosing 
interest terms. The brokerage has authority to sell any security in your 
account, without notice to you, to cover any shortfall resulting from a decline 
in the value of your securities. If the value of your account is less than the 
amount of the outstanding loan -- even if the cause is a one-day market drop -- 
you are liable for the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 * How much risk should you assume? 
</P>
<P>
 That depends on your investment goals. Understand the distinctions among 
"income," "growth" and "aggressive growth." Each indicates a different risk 
level, with income considered safest and aggressive growth the most risky. When 
opening a new account, you will be asked to specify your investment goals. Be 
sure that the investment products offered reflect your risk category.

SHOP TALK: WORKER ASKS ABOUT SOCIALIZING WITH SUPERVISOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shop Talk is a forum for readers to ask questions about on-the-job situations 
and get answers from specialists on workplace issues. This week's experts are 
Ron Riggio, professor of industrial and organizational psychology at Cal State 
Fullerton; and Elizabeth Winfree Lydon, Orange County regional manager and 
senior staff consultant for The Employers Group. Question: There's a clique in 
my department at work that includes some of my co-workers and our supervisor. 
They socialize after work, and those of us outside the clique feel that the 
supervisor gives her friends the best assignments and promotes their work 
better than ours. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.M., Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It is interesting to note that in Japan workers are "required" to 
socialize with superiors and co-workers -- it's considered part of their jobs. 
However, in the United States we are more inclined to keep our business and 
social lives strictly separate. Obviously, your boss prefers mixing the two and 
giving special treatment to the "in-group" members. You might try approaching 
your supervisor and voicing your concerns. But don't try to join the clique if 
doing so would make you feel uncomfortable. 
</P>

 Question: Can my boss require me to take comp time if I work late, or does the 
law allow me to take my pick of either comp time or overtime pay? -- M.B., 
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It is difficult to answer this question without more information. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a salaried employee who is exempt from overtime pay requirements, 
then compensatory time off, or CTO, is primarily a matter of agreement between 
you and your employer. 
</P>
<P>
 For non-exempt workers, however, granting CTO in lieu of overtime pay is much 
more complicated and subject to strict limitations under three independent sets 
of state and federal regulations and guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Labor Code does authorize comp time under certain 
circumstances. But there are a number of situations in which certain sections 
of the labor code are not applicable. And a separate set of guidelines applies 
solely to some health-care industry employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all else, the state permits CTO in lieu of monetary compensation only if 
the employee requests it in writing before working the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer CTO to overtime pay, write out your request and give it to your 
boss in advance. If you have any other concerns about your work schedule, your 
hours and how you are compensated, talk them over with your boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both state and federal regulations on this issue are extremely 
complex, your employer might want to get legal or professional advice on how to 
set up your company's CTO program.

 Question: I have a new baby, and my boss is letting me work at home so I can 
breast feed. Are there any books or other resources available on working out of 
your house when you have small children around? I have trouble getting 
everything done on days when the baby is fussy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.C., Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There isn't much available in the way of books to help parents who 
work at home while caring for children. There are, however, many books for new 
parents on how to organize child care and work activities. One of those is 
"Creative Parenting" by Dr. William Sears of USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 What you really need, though, is to get your work time organized so that you 
can work effectively in brief spurts. There are many books on effective time 
management, most of which emphasize organization and goal setting. One such 
title is "The Time Trap," written by Alec MacKenzie and available through the 
American Management Assn.'s AMACOM publishing unit in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Riggio 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
 One answer to a question in your inaugural issue of Shop Talk on April 4 was 
surprising and, I believe, incorrect. The question was what to do about a 
romantic affair between a supervisor and a co-worker in which the co-worker was 
treated more favorably than the others. The answer was to do nothing or, if the 
writer had difficulty working in that environment, to consider the 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, the situation is a very clear case of sexual harassment, which 
is no longer tolerated in the workplace. My advice would have been to report 
the situation to the human resources department of the company. Whether or not 
the liaison is taking place during business hours, the co-workers are at a 
disadvantage, and the company is bound to correct the situation. 
</P>

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: THAT SOUND ON WALL STREET: THE SILENCE OF THE 
OPTIMISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That noise you don't hear is the sound of corporate America warning about 
disappointing first-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically at this time each quarter, Wall Street is hit by a barrage of 
earnings "pre-announcements," whereby companies swallow hard and admit that 
their profits in the just-ended quarter won't meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time around, "there's been a definite falloff in the number of 
(negative) pre-announcements," says Ben Zacks, head of earnings-tracker Zacks 
Investment Research in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 More prominent, instead, have been the positive earnings pre-announcements: 
General Electric, brokerage Charles Schwab & Co. and truck engine maker Cummins 
Engine, for example, all issued upbeat first-quarter earnings forecasts last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 And computer workstation giant Sun Microsystems, which last Monday warned that 
first-quarter sales would be below expectations, surprised Wall Street on 
Wednesday by reporting that earnings came in above expectations despite the 
sales shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 If the good news so far foreshadows the general tone of first-quarter 
earnings, the end result could be much-needed support for the stumbling stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by rising interest rates, investors have been struggling to find a 
reason to hold on to stocks, let alone to buy more. Wall Street's optimists 
have been arguing vociferously that the bull market isn't dying, but is merely 
in transition -- from being driven by low interest rates to being driven by 
rising corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's true, the best thing for stocks would be for the bond market to 
remain relatively calm this month while strong quarterly profit reports grab 
the business headlines day after day. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, earnings ought to be pretty good. The economy surprised nearly 
everyone with the strength of its advance in the first quarter, even in the 
face of the Northridge earthquake and lousy weather in much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Booming sales of homes, cars, computers, machinery and other big-ticket items 
should translate into higher profits not only for the companies that produce 
them but for the myriad supplier businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Wall Street analysts, apparently choosing to play it cautious on the 
economy despite evidence to the contrary, continually chipped away at their 
earnings estimates as the quarter progressed, Zacks says. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been the pattern of the last five quarters, he says: "The analysts 
lower their estimates going into the reporting period. Then the numbers come in 
slightly better than expectations, and (the analysts) start raising their 
numbers again" for the next quarter -- at least for a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallying up analysts' estimates for the blue-chip companies in the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index, Zacks says the average S&P company is expected to report 
first-quarter operating earnings (i.e., results before any one-time gains or 
losses) up 11.7% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of January, the analysts had expected S&P operating earnings to 
rise 15.7% for the quarter, Zacks says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expectations are fairly moderate" now, agrees Melissa Brown, who tracks 
corporate earnings trends for Prudential Securities in New York. "So it's seems 
unlikely that we'll have a lot of negative surprises" as the numbers are 
reported, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And if analysts have again been too cautious, the stock market could benefit 
as higher-than-expected profits force investors to reconsider stocks' prices 
relative to potential earnings power in an expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby Cohen, investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York, is one 
of the earnings optimists. She expects S&P 500 operating earnings, which jumped 
16% last year, to rise 12% this year and another 10% in 1995 as the economy 
continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wall Street's bears believe the stock market will be strangled by rising 
interest rates, Cohen notes that rates don't rise nonstop, even in a healthy 
economy. Once the bond market settles down from the selling frenzy of recent 
weeks, she expects investors to focus again on stocks' individual fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 And on that count, she says, there are still plenty of reasons to feel good 
about the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be extremely unusual to see the market peak when we have a couple 
years of earnings growth still ahead," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, stocks have become overvalued. That's the bear case: Even 
though earnings are going up, the 42-month-old bull market has already factored 
higher earnings -- even into 1995 -- into stocks' prices, the bears say. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, there is nothing for Wall Street to look forward to except the next 
recession and the next cycle of lower earnings. Add rising interest rates to 
the equation, and you get falling stock prices even as earnings surge in 1994, 
the bears contend. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wall Street jargon, the term for that is multiple compression : Stocks' 
price-to-earnings multiples, or P-Es, slowly shrink because stock prices (the 
numerator in the equation) go down while earnings (the denominator) go up, at 
least in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 Or to put it another way, investors lower their valuation of stocks, or what 
they consider a fair price to pay relative to longer-term earnings expectations 
and to the returns on competing investments, such as bonds and money market 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are worrying that what we get in earnings (growth) will be lost in 
valuation as interest rates go up," says Prudential's Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cohen and other bulls didn't consider stocks to be overvalued before the 
recent dive in prices. Thus, they argue, today's lower prices are an invitation 
to buy, not a warning of worse to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Goldman Sachs' earnings estimates, the average S&P 500 stock sells 
for 14 times 1994 operating earnings. Historically, the market's P-E has 
averaged 16.4 in periods when inflation ran at 3.5% or less annually, Cohen 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you believe, as she does, that inflation (and, by proxy, interest rates) 
will remain subdued, the stock market could advance 17% from current levels and 
still not exceed historic "fair" valuation levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's easy to talk about fair valuation for the market as a whole. 
But most portfolio managers aren't buying the market -- they're buying 
individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why so much may ride on the first-quarter earnings reports that will 
swamp Wall Street starting this week: If the individual numbers aren't good 
enough to make shareholders want to hold on -- after the turmoil of the past 
few weeks -- the market's slide may resume, and what had been a long-overdue 
"correction" in prices could rapidly become something far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of downbeat pre-announcements so far is certainly encouraging. But 
earnings-tracker Zacks adds a caveat: There's a chance that many companies with 
bad news to release didn't do so early because they feared they would 
accelerate the recent stock selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Zacks looks for strong quarterly earnings gains from auto, 
semiconductor, bank and industrial companies, while results from energy, 
airline, drug and food companies are expected to be weak.  
</P>
<P>
 Briefly: At last, a survey in which Los Angeles doesn't finish last. 
</P>
<P>
 Money magazine says major L.A.-area stocks racked up the biggest gains in the 
first quarter of stocks in 24 metropolitan areas tracked by the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of Money's regional stock indexes is made up of 12 companies viewed as 
representative of the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. index jumped 7.3% in the quarter, helped by big gains in shares of 
Carter Hawley Hale, Dole Food and National Medical Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2 region in the quarter was Cincinnati, where stocks were up 3%. Next 
were San Francisco, up 1.7%, and Boston, up 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom: New York City, down 12.9%, San Diego, down 9.8%, and 
Pittsburgh, down 9.4%. And When the Bear Finally Visits. . . 
</P>
<P>
 For many stock investors, the issue isn't necessarily how much they'd lose in 
a bear market, but how long the pain would last. The following shows the 
duration of major declines in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index since 1953, 
and how long it took afterward for the market to recover 75% and 100% of each

THE HUMAN RIGHTS PIPELINE; CHARGES OF SLAVE LABOR IN MYANMAR LEAD TO BALLOT AT 
UNOCAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a proxy vote this month, Unocal Corp.'s shareholders face a decision that 
may have a major impact on the debate over U.S. human rights policy in Myanmar, 
where the military regime allegedly is using forced labor to build 
infrastructure projects possibly related to a Unocal gas pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials deny any connection between Unocal's activities in Myanmar 
(formerly Burma) and alleged human rights violations. They have urged 
shareholders to reject a resolution calling for a full report on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But as proxy votes are being cast by mail in advance of Unocal's April 25 
annual shareholders' meeting in Los Angeles, evidence is mounting that serious 
problems have occurred in the vicinity of the planned natural-gas pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Burmese refugees reportedly have poured into Thailand, complaining that 
government troops uprooted villages and conscripted men for forced labor gangs 
working on highway and railroad construction in the area, formerly a war zone 
where ethnic Karen and Mon rebels were active. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think these reports are credible," said a knowledgeable U.S. official, who 
requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. "Forced labor is 
an important aspect of the human rights problem in Burma." 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence has surfaced directly linking the alleged labor abuses to plans by 
Unocal and its French partner, Total, to build a 38-mile pipeline through the 
Ye-Tavoy region, in Myanmar's southern panhandle, to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. official said there is "certainly a possibility" of a link. But 
Unocal officials said any construction in the area has nothing to do with the 
pipeline project. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipeline construction would begin only if offshore drilling concessions, 
located in Myanmar's territorial waters in the Andaman Sea, prove commercially 
viable, Unocal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not hire slave labor," said Dennis Codon, vice president and general 
counsel for Unocal. "We will not be a party to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Unocal proxy resolution, filed by investors affiliated with the 
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, brings focus to a festering 
trouble spot in U.S. foreign policy. And it highlights the kinds of ethical 
questions corporations must ask themselves as they pursue opportunities in 
developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unocal and other corporations claim political neutrality in Myanmar," the 
proxy resolution states. "However, doing business with a repressive regime is 
inherently political." 
</P>
<P>
 Myanmar's ruling military junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council (SLORC), "flaunts its partnerships with foreign 
corporations as proof of political legitimacy," the resolution asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 John Imle, Unocal executive vice president, insisted that Unocal 
representatives in Myanmar have seen no evidence to substantiate the claims of 
human rights abuses in the pipeline area. He added that Unocal believes its 
presence in Myanmar will contribute to the growth of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot take an anti-SLORC stand," Imle said. "But I don't think they're 
gaining legitimacy on the world stage by having Total and Unocal there. I think 
the people have gained through employment . . . and Western influence." Unocal 
has been active in Myanmar since 1988; it abandoned an unsuccessful onshore 
drilling site in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension between U.S. commercial interests and human rights concerns in 
Myanmar mirrors the increasingly belligerent dispute over China's trade 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime over the next several weeks, the Clinton Administration is expected 
to announce a tougher plan of action for Myanmar, which may include economic 
sanctions, knowledgeable sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy will follow a series of White House discussions with a group of 
Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been protesting the house arrest of fellow 
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. 
</P>
<P>
 Aung leads the National League for Democracy, the party that won Myanmar's 
first free election by a landslide in 1990. The military junta abrogated the 
election results and cracked down on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Western countries stopped foreign aid after the military massacred hundreds 
and possibly thousands of civilian demonstrators in 1988. But in the absence of 
economic sanctions, international human rights activists have been pressuring 
corporations to voluntarily withdraw from Myanmar, or adopt a code of conduct 
that would restrict their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists complain that doing business with the SLORC regime not only 
legitimizes the military government, but brings in the badly needed hard 
currency that will ensure its survival. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Total-Unocal deal, the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, the state oil 
company, will acquire a 15% stake in the gas project once it starts producing, 
a Unocal spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal, which now owns 47.5% of the project, will retain at least a 28% 
interest; Total, the lead partner, will control about 31%. The Petroleum 
Authority of Thailand has an option for a 26% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the activists have had little influence on U.S. corporate policy. The 
exception has been privately owned Levi Strauss, which withdrew operations from 
Myanmar as well as China in 1992, citing human rights concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Unocal, shareholder resolutions on the Myanmar human rights question 
have been filed at three other corporations this year: Amoco Corp., Texaco Inc. 
and Pepsico Inc. But all three persuaded the Securities and Exchange Commission 
to strike the measures from their proxy statements. (Chicago-based Amoco 
announced last month that it was withdrawing from an onshore energy exploration 
project in Myanmar, citing economic reasons.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal, however, chose not to appeal to the SEC. Company officials said they 
allowed the Myanmar resolution to remain on the proxy statement because they 
wanted to engage in open discussions with its sponsors and let shareholders 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Father William G. Devine, a Jesuit priest from Boston who has spearheaded the 
Unocal stockholder measure, said he has met twice so far with Codon, the 
company lawyer. A meeting with Imle is scheduled for Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unocal says it really wants a dialogue, and they're coming all the way across 
the country to sit down with us," he said. "But their answers aren't very 
clear. There's not much follow through yet." The Interfaith Center on Corporate 
Responsibility, which Devine represents, holds 3,608 of Unocal's 240 million 
outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Devine noted that the resolution does not censure Unocal or require it to 
suspend operations in Myanmar, but only directs management to study the 
situation and prepare a report for shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Imle said the company wants the resolution defeated to avoid setting a 
precedent. "If we created reports for every Unocal shareholder, we'd be writing 
a lot of reports," he said. "We don't have the time." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Pepsico shareholders asked for and received a report on the 
company's activities in Myanmar last year without resorting to a proxy 
resolution. This year they filed a resolution demanding the company withdraw, 
but Pepsico got the SEC's permission to drop the measure from its proxy, said a 
spokesman for the Purchase, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) -- a Washington 
group that evaluates social issues facing shareholders -- issued a report last 
week on the Unocal resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "That SLORC is guilty of serious human rights abuses in general appears beyond 
any reasonable doubt, despite assertions by the oil companies," the report 
said. "The charges of forced labor and relocation are open to more question. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Some shareholders may feel that a vote in favor of this resolution could help 
to establish the truth of these allegations," the IRRC concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group added that the resolution also brings Unocal management's 
judgment on Myanmar into question, possibly "endangering projects and 
relationships that are providing -- or seem to offer the prospect of providing 
-- substantial profits for the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal's Codon expressed doubts about the report's objectivity. "I wouldn't 
say they're not neutral," he said. "But I would say they're being lobbied and 
petitioned by that group (of religious investors)." 
</P>
<P>
 The IRRC report cites allegations of forced labor abuses in Myanmar by the 
State Department and human rights advocacy groups such as Amnesty International 
and Asia Watch. It quotes a United Nations investigator as saying "atrocities 
are being committed consistently and on a wide scale by the soldiers of the 
Myanmar army against innocent villagers." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is not clear whether evidence of forced labor in the Total-Unocal 
pipeline area can be clearly documented and whether such abuses can be linked 
to pipeline infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 A British documentary maker said he recently visited the pipeline area and 
photographed a laborer in chains. An American anthropologist said she 
interviewed an army officer there who described the infrastructure work as 
partly aimed at "boosting security" for the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither claim could be independently verified. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all hearsay in my mind," said Codon. "We're asking for proof and 
evidence." Focus of Controversy 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed natural gas pipeline in which Los Angeles-based Unocal will be a 
major investor has prompted questions from religious activists about the 
company's activities in military-ruled Myanmar. Map details the pipeline's 
tentative route from Myanmar to Thailand.(MORE)

NORTHROP POISED FOR DOMINANCE, CHAIRMAN SAYS; AEROSPACE: KENT KRESA SAYS THE 
ACQUISITION OF GRUMMAN WILL GIVE HIS COMPANY AN EDGE IN FUTURE DEFENSE 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Looking more chipper than ever, Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa has spent the 
past week bounding around the Pentagon, promoting to senior defense officials 
his latest creation: the Northrop Grumman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa is broadcasting the message that Northrop's pending $2.17-billion 
acquisition of Long Island-based Grumman would create a new aircraft industry 
powerhouse that will emerge in the next several years as an equal to McDonnell 
Douglas and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Grumman deal, Northrop has put together the key technologies that will 
dominate future defense programs, Kresa said in an interview between visits to 
Defense Secretary William Perry and the Pentagon brass. The deal is expected to 
close Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northrop has suffered through plenty of disappointments in recent 
decades -- losing major competitions and becoming embroiled in national 
scandals -- its saving grace has been a keen ability to predict how radical new 
technologies would drive defense markets. That knack has yielded the firm a 
handful of multibillion-dollar programs, including the B-2 stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest test of that trademark Northrop skill will be played out over 
the next five years, as Kresa attempts to make good on his theory that future 
defense programs will combine reconnaissance, long-range strike capability and 
precision weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa made the rounds in Washington saying the Grumman acquisition would give 
Northrop a broader capability and more existing programs in these areas than 
any rival. Moreover, Northrop's knowledge of the whole technological picture 
provides an advantage in competing for any of the parts, Kresa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace experts and analysts say that Northrop stands to gain so much 
technical capability and breadth with the Grumman deal that it is now far more 
likely to be a survivor of the aerospace bust of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their success will depend more on how they are managed now than anything 
else," said John Harbison, director of the aerospace consulting practice at 
Booz Allen & Hamilton. "Northrop has the opportunity to accomplish things 
through (consolidation) that McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed do not." 
</P>
<P>
 At Northrop's swank Washington offices overlooking the Potomac River, Kresa 
acknowledged that he has not been so upbeat about Northrop's prospects in a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the opportunity to build something exciting," Kresa said. "I feel very 
positive that this is a winning situation for everybody involved."  
</P>
<P>
 Kresa, a model of temperance, expressed no regret that he lost prior bids for 
other defense units over the past two years. He also rejected the idea that 
personal hostilities or ego played any role in Northrop's aggressive bidding 
for Grumman. (Northrop's offer topped a $1.93-billion bid by Martin Marietta.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Kresa insisted that the Grumman deal reflected only Northrop's 
long-held strategy to focus on the military aircraft and defense electronic 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly have the opportunity to be an equal," Kresa said about his 
rivals. "We are an $8-billion defense company now. Our technology is world 
class in many areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike its rivals whose corporate cultures have grown to resemble bland 
bureaucracies, Northrop has taken big risks and attempted to preserve the 
technological free thinking that was the hallmark of U.S. aerospace decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been stunning successes -- mixed with a few embarrassments and 
a corporate culture sometimes notable for its eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
 When competitors were trying to build faster jets in the early 1970s, Northrop 
instead began working on stealth technology that would make its jets invisible 
to enemy radar. That savvy bet yielded the B-2 bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, it began work on a revolutionary floating ball gyroscope 
technology that won the firm the guidance system for the MX missile. And in the 
early 1980s, Northrop engineers began tinkering with advanced microphones that 
could listen for enemy tanks, a radical concept that resulted in the Bat strike 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firm also spent $1.2 billion of its own money on the F-20 fighter, an 
effort that failed to win a single order. In some programs, Northrop also 
failed to deliver weapons on time, within budget and up to the required 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 And it became infamous during the 1980s for its succession of scandals, 
leading to a guilty plea on federal felony charges in 1991. No new allegations 
have hit the firm for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War has created the notion that the defense market has 
been permanently reduced. But some experts believe that the current bust is so 
deep that another boom is likely in several years and the market will support 
all of the current military producers -- Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, Boeing 
and Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
 By early next century, Air Force and Navy aircraft will be decrepit and in 
some cases obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa believes that the Grumman acquisition will give Northrop the strength to 
bridge the 1990s until the market turns up.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the fortunes of the long controversial B-2 appear to be rising. Senior 
congressional and Air Force leaders have begun to support the acquisition of 
more than the 20 aircraft now on order. Later this month, Congress will convene 
hearing on the future of the bomber industry, a significant step in increasing 
the B-2 order book, Kresa said.

 Time Warner watchers have wondered if Chairman Gerald M. Levin will be able to 
take the kind of high profile successfully maintained by his predecessor, the 
late Steven J. Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Any doubts that he's out to do that ought to be erased by Time Warner's 
Levin-rich annual report, which may set a new standard for the amount of space 
devoted to a top official. 
</P>
<P>
 The just-released report pictures Levin four times in just the first 11 pages 
(other pictures show a Daffy Duck watch and the "Batman" logo). 
</P>
<P>
 The report also includes 13 pages of commentary from Levin in the form of a 
standard chairman's report, a special question-and-answer section and a 
full-page "values and commitments" report that appears on the back page. Kiss

 A couple of professors at Bryant College in Rhode Island have put to a 
rigorous academic test something we've all known for some time: Brown-nosing 
pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 In the March issue of the academic journal "Group & Organization Management 
Inc.," Ronald J. Deluga and J.T. Perry examined "higher quality 
supervisor-subordinate exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, they found brown-nosers "receive special benefits and 
opportunities including favorable performance appraisals, promotions, support 
in career development, as well as satisfying and interesting positions." 
</P>
<P>
 The study defines "ingratiation" as a "set of influence behaviors designed to 
improve one's interpersonal attractiveness" that is "used by subordinates to 
gain the approval of supervisors who distribute desired rewards." 
</P>
<P>
 The study goes on to say that "subordinate ingratiation can be manipulative." 
</P>
<P>
 It also concludes that it "is among the most commonly used influence 
strategies" in the workplace. Details at 11

 Officials Crack Down on Investment Operation: Authorities from California and 
other states said they have raided 10 offices in Los Angeles, Orange and San 
Diego counties that raised millions of dollars from investors led to believe 
they were putting money in wireless cable television ventures.Wireless cable is 
a technology that competes with conventional cable systems by allowing 
subscribers to receive service via antennas. Such systems are in operation in 
several cities around the country but the technology is so new that it has 
attracted con artists offering investments in nonexistent systems. The state 
Department of Corporations said it would release details of its raids during a 
press conference today.

PROFITS ARE UP, JOBS ARE DOWN, MAGAZINE SAYS; RECOVERY: FORBES REPORTS THAT 
EARNINGS ROSE ALMOST 14% LAST YEAR, WHILE EMPLOYMENT DECLINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Corporate profits among U.S. companies rose nearly 14% last year -- but at the 
cost of jobs, Forbes magazine reported in its Forbes 500s issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The special April 25 issue ranks the nation's leading manufacturing and 
service companies according to four measures -- sales, net profits, assets and 
market value. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric Co. earned top ranking on the Forbes Super 50, a composite 
ranking of the most powerful and competitive of the Forbes 500s -- those firms 
that earn high scores on all four Forbes lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits grew four times faster than sales among the 785 companies in the 
Forbes lists, showing the companies made their money by improving productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of higher productivity, however, is getting more out of every 
worker, slashing costs and getting rid of as many workers as possible. As a 
result, the magazine said, total employment among the Forbes 500s declined 
about 1% last year to 20.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers look more troublesome when viewed over a period since the economic 
recovery began in March, 1991. Big American firms in the Forbes 500s rankings 
have announced cutbacks of nearly 1.8 million jobs, or 10% of total employment, 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, 27 companies announced they would cut at least 10,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the ax-wielding list is International Business Machines Corp., which 
said it would lop off 85,000 jobs, followed closely by American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co., which shed 83,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Others with heavy axes include General Motors Corp., cutting 74,000 jobs; 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. with 50,000; GTE Corp.'s 32,150 and Boeing Co.'s 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all big businesses cut jobs. Payrolls grew dramatically at Microsoft 
Corp., Home Depot Inc., McCaw Cellular Communications and WMX Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, profits of the top 500 firms rose 13.8% to $204 billion last year, 
while sales rose only 3.5% to $3.8 trillion. Assets expanded 10.2% to $8.9 
trillion, and market value rose 6.9% to $3.6 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list of most profitable is Exxon Corp., which earned $5.28 
billion. In terms of sales, General Motors Corp. was No. 1 with $138.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric tops the Forbes Market Value 500 list, with a market 
capitalization of $89.2 billion. It also ranks above all other firms in total 
property, plant, equipment and financial assets, at $251.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 GE ranks behind Exxon in profits. It earned $5.18 billion, followed by AT&T's 
$3.97 billion, Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s $3.57 billion and Ford Motor Co.'s 
$2.53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit fared well on this count. For the first time since 1986, Forbes 
reports, all three U.S. auto makers were among the 10 most profitable 
corporations in America. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest earnings surprise came from Sears, Roebuck & Co., which lost 
$2 billion in 1992 but reversed course to gain $2.4 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Improving its core retail operations, shedding its catalogue and brokerage 
businesses, reducing its equity in Allstate Insurance and slashing 30,000 
workers helped rescue the retailer, Forbes reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to the Market Value 500 list include Lotus Development Corp., whose 
capitalization quadrupled over the year to $3.8 billion despite a 31% drop in 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine also ranked firms likely to show earnings growth of at least 13% 
in 1994. They include Chrysler Corp., Citicorp, Compaq Computer Corp. and Ford.

 Prudential Ordered to Pay $25.4 Million: Two Prudential Insurance Co. of 
America policyholders were awarded $25.4 million by an Alabama jury that found 
they were defrauded by a life insurance agent operating with delinquent 
supervision.Newark, N.J.-based Prudential, the nation's biggest life insurer, 
said it would appeal the award, which it called "grossly excessive." The award 
by the Barbour County, Ala., jury included $17.5 million in punitive damages 
against Prudential for improper supervision. An Opelika, Ala., couple alleged 
that Prudential negligently hired and supervised agent Charlie Whatley and 
misled state regulators about his abuses.

 Tokyo Stocks Calm as Investors Await Word on New Cabinet: Stocks were little 
changed early today as investors awaited news on the formation of a new cabinet 
following the resignation Friday of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. In the 
first half hour of trading, the benchmark Nikkei 225-share average fell 65.02 
points or 0.33%, to 19,869.97. "Today is very dependent on what comes out of 
talks with the coalition and obviously the market's going to have one eye very 
firmly on what comes out of those sort of talks," said David Harris, an equity 
trader at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

 Sales Strong for Apple PowerPC: Apple Computer Inc.'s new line of Power 
Macintosh computers are selling so well that retailers report shortages and 
back orders for some models, according to analysts and retailers. Apple 
introduced the new souped-up versions of the venerable Macintosh computer in 
mid-March to boost its 11% worldwide market share and with the aim of 
recapturing excitement in the market. Although it is one of the world's largest 
computer makers, Apple has been concerned that its market share was 
increasingly vulnerable to advances in software by Microsoft Corp. and by 
faster chips being developed by Intel Corp.

 Pager-Answering Machine Unveiled: Two companies unveiled a new pager in Dallas 
that acts like a pocket telephone answering machine.Motorola Inc. and Paging 
Network Inc., the country's largest paging company, say they expect to begin 
marketing the device nationwide next year, charging about $20 a month. Here's 
how it works: The person sending the message dials a special phone number, then 
hears a recorded greeting from the recipient and leaves a verbal message. This 
is sent by phone to a paging terminal, then to a satellite, and finally to the 
recipient. The recipient will hear a tone or feel a vibration from the device.

 At a time when Orange County's recession-wracked shopping centers are 
scrambling for customers, one developer is taking a less-beaten path: He's 
trying to build a better trap for aging mall rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of creating another look-alike mall, Shaheen Sadeghi gutted a vacant 
plant that once manufactured goggles for the military and transformed it into 
The Lab, a shopping mecca designed specifically for people in their 20s.

 The Lab, Sadeghi said, is an "anti-mall." 
</P>
<P>
 "Malls are all marble and buffed out," Sadeghi said. "This building is . . . 
raw, soulful and comfortable, . . . a place where you can sip coffee, play 
chess or read a book." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lab occupies two aging warehouses on Bristol Street, with exposed wooden 
ceilings, massive iron roof beams and cement floors. It is anchored by Urban 
Outfitters, which sells hip clothing and home decoration items, and Tower 
Records, which operates a large alternative music store. The center also houses 
more than a dozen shops, including shoe and clothing leader Na Na, a coffee 
shop, a vintage clothing store, a children's clothing and furniture store and 
space for live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadeghi doesn't expect The Lab to rival Santa Monica's hip Third Street 
Promenade or Los Angeles' funky Melrose Avenue shopping district. But the 
former Quiksilver sportswear executive is betting that the community of 
disenchanted mall-goers in Orange County is strong enough to support smaller, 
alternative shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-to-29 age group targeted by The Lab represents a potential gold mine 
because it is "the only group of people who actually want to spend more of 
their discretionary time shopping," said Watts Wacker, a futurist with 
Yankelovich & Partners in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for conventional retailers, Wacker said, those consumers are 
also "a group of people who feel unbelievably mistreated by the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Many younger Southern Californians view malls as "a corporate selling retail 
nightmare," said Michael Pringle, who owns alternative clothing stores in San 
Diego and San Francisco and a wholesale clothing business. "They don't create 
the image and energy that's going to attract people. Malls are built for one 
purpose, . . . and it ain't cool for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics, however, suggest that Sadeghi is merely putting a new spin on a 
familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lab "sounds like a mini-mall in an old building," said Keith Fox, 
spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in New York. Yet 
Fox concedes that, with Tower and Urban Outfitters, Sadeghi has landed "two of 
the nation's hottest retailers for that teens-through-20s" target group. 
</P>
<P>
 And, unlike some similar ventures elsewhere, The Lab is in a prime location. 
The old factory building is near the busy Costa Mesa Freeway and within a mile 
of South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Outfitters is the descendant of Free Peoples Store, a freewheeling head 
shop that opened in Philadelphia in 1972. Owner Richard Hayne, then 23, 
discerned that mainstream retailers weren't meeting the needs of a sizable 
number of style-conscious but cash-poor young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Free Peoples died a natural death in 1976, when it was no longer hip to be a 
hippie. But Hayne, now 46, continues to cater to the fashion and home 
decorating needs of younger consumers through Urban Outfitters, which sprang to 
life after he closed the head shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Outfitters opened its first California location in Santa Monica's Third 
Street Promenade in 1992. Its second California store opened in November in The 
Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower Records, no stranger to malls, geared its Tower Alternative store to 
appeal to consumers in their 20s, focusing on tunes that entice that group. 
Consequently, it carries some jazz and mainstream pop but little in the way of 
classical or country. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxi Taxi offers vintage clothing, while Newport Beach-based Modern Amusement 
sells fashionable children's wear. Gypsy Den offers a place to sit and sip 
coffee or read a book, and there's also space for live performances and art. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retail observers say that Sadeghi has correctly targeted a segment that's 
willing to spend but is too often taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Malls can be very uncool, Hayne said, for Urban Outfitters' core clientele: 
"upscale homeless people, . . . people who typically are only recently out of 
their parents' houses and who haven't really settled down and created another 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Outfitters' consumers aren't alone in deserting the big regional 
shopping centers, futurist Wacker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1985, malls were the third most frequented places in our lives, but since 
then we've basically cut in half the amount of time we spend in them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor in that decline is competition from value-oriented discount chains 
and warehouse clubs. Another is that young shoppers are instead frequenting 
stores like those found at The Lab and at a group of trendy shops on F Street 
near San Diego's downtown post office. 
</P>
<P>
 However, although Sadeghi harbors doubts about the future of suburban malls, 
he concedes that they are not likely to lose their dominance of the retail 
horizon soon. 
</P>
<P>
 And real estate observers say that the "anti-mall" is simply another facet of 
the ever-changing retail industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always trying to come up with a better mousetrap," said John 
Shumway, president of Market Profiles, a real estate consulting firm based in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the rag business it's even more competitive, so people try to 
differentiate themselves from the rest of the group."

HONG KONG RICH KID TURNS ASIA ON ITS HEADSET; MEDIA: RICHARD LI DECLINES FAMILY 
JOB TO FOUND SATELLITE-TV VENTURE. NEXT GOAL IS PAN-ASIAN 'INFORMATION 
EXCHANGE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an office unusually Spartan for one of Hong Kong's business elite, Richard 
Li calls out to his secretary to bring him a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in transition . . . moving from one office into another," explains Li, 
who last year turned down an offer from his father, billionaire Li Kashing, to 
be managing director of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., the flagship conglomerate of 
the family empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he accepted a lesser position in the family firm and set up his own 
company, Pacific Century Group. Li said his new venture will take particular 
interest in Asian infrastructure projects that use advanced technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Li, 27, is determined to assert himself as a major player on the Asian 
business scene, and he is succeeding in ways that exemplify the region's 
economic boom and the emergence of a new generation of Asian-Pacific business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I (headed) Hutchison, would I lose my independence? The answer is 
definitely yes," says Li, whose clipped, upper-class Hong Kong-British accent 
survived his 10 years in the United States and Canada. "My father is still very 
much hands on." 
</P>
<P>
 Heir to the Li dynasty fortune with his older brother, 29-year-old Victor, he 
was widely regarded as just another rich man's son when he returned home from 
attending school and working in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 He surprised many people when he launched Star TV, the first pan-Asian 
satellite television service, three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the onset, what we saw was a very young, somewhat inexperienced person in 
the corporate environment and in the broadcasting community," said Alex Zilo, a 
former Star TV executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Richard didn't really leave us much time for that impression to last, if 
you will, because he very quickly picked up the concept and ran with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The impatience of investors in Star TV's parent company, Hutchvision Ltd., 
drove Li to sell a majority stake in Star to media magnate Rupert Murdoch last 
July. The sale, for $525 million in cash and stock, was highly profitable for 
Hutchison and the Li family, who together invested about $110 million in Star 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Li used his family's share of the profits to set up Pacific Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel quite comfortable to be on my own, taking what I'm earning, rather 
than being greedy and taking what I didn't make," Li said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't believe in family succession in management, Li said, he 
was obliged to take up the deputy chairman's position at Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
 He said: "20% of my time will be given to Hutchison, and 80% will be given to 
Pacific Century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Li left Hong Kong before his 14th birthday to attend a prep school in Menlo 
Park. He lived alone in an apartment without a chaperon or a maid. "I knew how 
to fry an egg and that was about it," he said. "TV dinners certainly helped out 
a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 To augment his allowance, Li did as many American high school students: He 
worked the night shift at a local McDonald's for a couple of months, and 
scooped ice cream at a Swenson's ice cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a degree in computer engineering from Stanford University in 1987, 
but then shifted to investment banking, landing a job in Toronto with Gordon 
Capital Corp., one of Canada's top investment banks. After four years in 
Canada, he returned to Hong Kong in 1990 at his father's behest. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at home, Li became smitten with satellite television, and Star TV was his 
first big test as skeptics among Asia's veteran business executives watched 
eagerly to see if the rich kid would fall flat on his face with his new toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Li quickly showed his detractors that Star TV, which he built from scratch, 
would be a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably had 100 years of experience in our respective businesses," Zilo 
said, "and here was this young kid. . . . What we saw was a resemblance of a 
very inexperienced, charismatic young man who fooled all of us to become very 
seasoned, very aggressive and very determined." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Star TV beams five channels across Asia. As of November, Star TV 
reached 42 million homes, a fourfold increase from February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Li's main goal is to examine new ways of using existing technology in Asia to 
bring basic services, such as telephones and a variety of television 
programming, to masses of consumers at affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to approach pan-Asian territory with a common medium or information 
exchange, like Star TV has done, to bring people together," Li said. "I believe 
that when people from different nations can communicate more and understand 
each other, at the end of the day they are more similar than they are 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore Business Times reported in March that Li may invest in a new, 
$233-million satellite Malaysia is planning to launch from French Guiana. 
</P>
<P>
 But Li is barred for several years from providing satellite television 
services, according to the agreement he made with Murdoch when he sold Star TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Li would not comment about specific investment interests for "strategic 
reasons," but he said more about the company's direction may be announced as 
early as October. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he is quietly fixing his attention on his new venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position at Hutchison is work," Li said, "but my role at Pacific Century 
is living."

 Unemployment Declines, Jobs Grow: Australia's jobless rate in March fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 10.3% from 10.5% in February, its lowest point since 
November, 1991.Employment grew slightly, but not as much as analysts had 
expected. The drop in the jobless rate, however, was better than experts had 
predicted. The number of people employed in March rose by 7,100; that 
represented a drop of 8,800 in full-time jobs and a rise of 15,900 in part-time 
jobs.

 TRW Gets Satellite Contract: TRW Inc. has won a $61.14-million contract to 
help build Taiwan's first satellite. Taiwan's National Science Council chose 
Cleveland-based TRW over Matra Marconi of France, Space System-Loral of the 
United States and Israel's IAI and France's Dornier, officials said. TRW will 
develop the spacecraft for the scientific research satellite in time for 
launching in 1997 and will oversee the integration of payload packages and 
components designed by Taiwanese firms.

PACIFIC WATCH: CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Serious Unemployment Problem Is Acknowledged: The government said that moves 
away from the socialist welfare state had put unprecedented strains on the 
economy. Li Boyong, labor minister, said: "China's employment situation is 
extremely difficult, and the country now is faced with unprecedented challenges 
in deploying all the jobless."The official Xinhua news agency, which quoted Li, 
said China would try to register its unemployed to get some control over the 
situation. The Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper vowed the urban 
unemployment rate would be limited to 3% for this year and next, up from 2.6% 
last year. Economists said China's unemployment statistics are misleadingly low 
because they do not include the large mass of rural unemployed and 
underemployed, and they mask much urban joblessness behind euphemisms such as 
"youths waiting for work."

PACIFIC WATCH: JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imported Vehicle Sales Jump: The Japan Automobile Importers' Assn. said the 
40.7% increase was fueled by the yen's strength and low-interest loans. A 
record 32,440 imported cars, trucks and buses were sold in March, compared with 
23,051 sold in the same month of last year, the association said.The March 
figure surpassed the previous record of 25,943 vehicles imported in March, 
1990, said Yasuhiko Yokota, association spokesman. The yen has climbed about 
11% against the dollar over the last year, but Yokota said the association did 
not monitor how much of that was passed on to consumers in lower retail prices. 
German autos remained the most popular, with 13,103 sold, up 26.3% from a year 
earlier. Imports of U.S.-made vehicles climbed 48.3% to 12,116.

FIREFIGHTER HAD A BURNING DESIRE; ANNA FURST, WHO'S ALSO A PARAMEDIC, TRAINED 
YEARS TO PASS GRUELING PHYSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna Furst, a firefighter for four years and a paramedic for 11, can't imagine 
doing any other job. 
</P>
<P>
 Succeeding in her chosen field has been a series of challenges, Furst said. 
When she settled on a career path 15 years ago, women were barred from being 
firefighters in her native Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Furst relocated to the United States in 1979 and began studying fire science 
at Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga and Rancho Santiago College in Santa 
Ana. Also, to gain practical experience, she earned her license as an emergency 
medical technician and took a job with a private ambulance firm. Her next move 
was to join the Santa Ana Fire Department as a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
 Her biggest obstacle, Furst said, was passing the physical test for admittance 
to the firefighters academy. Among the requirements are the ability to climb to 
the top of a five-story tower and rescue a 150-pound dummy; to raise, lower and 
carry ladders from a fire engine to a building and to move waterlogged hoses 
into position. In addition to endurance, all require an exceptional amount of 
upper-body strength that women do not typically have. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Furst didn't pass the test on her first try, she said -- or on her 
second or third. "But I'm stubborn," she said. "So I kept trying." After five 
years, she finally passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Furst, 35, credits her personal trainer, who is also a firefighter, with 
getting her into shape. "He really helped me," she said, "and so did my 
husband. He's a firefighter, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I thought about quitting, they picked me back up and reminded me of all 
the other people who eventually made it. Last year I helped fight the Laguna 
Beach fires while my husband fought in Malibu. It's different every day, and I 
am always learning." HOT JOBS: Firefighter 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Anna Furst, 35 
</P>
<P>
 Company: Orange County Fire Station No. 5, Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 What's Involved: Firefighters are on duty 24 of every 72 hours. While on duty, 
they live, eat and sleep at the station in crews. In addition to structure 
fires, they respond to medical emergency calls, hazardous-materials spills and 
explosions, gas leaks, plane crashes and traffic accidents. Between calls, they 
divide their time between maintaining the station and updating maps of their 
response areas. Several hours each day are spent inspecting businesses and 
multifamily dwellings to enforce fire-safety ordinances. They also conduct 
fire-prevention and educational training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifications: Most firefighters have an associate of arts degree in fire 
science and an emergency medical technician certificate. Before attending a 
fire academy, they must pass physical and mental aptitude tests. Once hired by 
a fire department, they are given additional training. 
</P>
<P>
 Salary range: $2,699 to $3,630 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The number of firefighting jobs in Orange County is expected to 
increase 23% by 1998, according to the state Employment Development Department. 
In 1992, there were 1,800 positions. That number is projected to reach 2,210 by 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: Firefighters typically report a high level of job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Physical risk, being on duty around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancement: After five years as a firefighter, one may specialize in fire 
investigation and prevention, hazardous materials, training or administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "If you are thinking of becoming a firefighter, it's never too soon to 
start eating right and getting in shape. Even small steps toward your goal will 
get you there that much sooner." JANICE L. JONES

KEMPER URGES SHAREHOLDERS TO REJECT GE CAPITAL'S NOMINEES FOR BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kemper Corp. Sunday urged its shareholders to vote against four people 
nominated to Kemper's board of directors by GE Capital Corp., which is trying 
to buy out Kemper with a $2.35-billion cash offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper said GE was trying to "strong-arm" Kemper shareholders into abandoning 
the chief executive officer and directors who Kemper said have engineered a 
turnaround in the company's results over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that although GE fully recognizes Kemper's potential, it is 
attempting to strong-arm your board and management into selling out cheaply," 
Kemper said in a letter to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital a week ago also wrote to Kemper shareholders, urging them to vote 
for the GE slate, saying Kemper's management had failed to rebuild the company. 
The unit of General Electric Co. accused Kemper management of putting itself 
ahead of shareholders in refusing to discuss GE's offer to buy the company for 
$55 a share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of proceeding in a professional and constructive manner on behalf of 
shareholders as we had urged, Kemper's management and board have 'stonewalled,' 
" said the three-page letter signed by Gary Wendt, chairman of GE Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter urged shareholders to vote for GE's slate nominees and belittled 
Kemper management's contention that the interests of Kemper shareholders are 
best served if the company remained independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper countered Sunday by saying, "Do not be bullied or fooled." 
</P>
<P>
 "GE is proposing to buy your company because it thinks Kemper's prospects are 
great," said Kemper's letter, signed by Chairman David Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do too," Mathis wrote. "GE sees that Kemper is poised to perform and to 
reward its owners." 
</P>

STATE TAKES OVER INSURANCE FIRM HURT BY L.A. RIOT-DAMAGE CLAIMS 
</P>

 State regulators have taken over operation of AIM Insurance Co., a company 
that specializes in fire and liability coverage for small businesses that was 
hurt by excessive claims in the wake of the Los Angeles riots in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim company, which has 4,000 clients and 45 employees, continues 
operating, however, and is renewing policies and paying claims, state 
regulators said.It is not writing new policies, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The state placed the company in a conservancy last week after its president, 
Christi Guardiola, and chairman and major shareholder Richard A. Newby both 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 State insurance commission officials are reviewing an application by a 
Delaware holding company to purchase AIM. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the insurance commissioner's office, said Friday 
that AIM had assets of $20 million and liabilities of $19.2 million at the end 
of the year -- leaving a reserve of just $780,000 -- considerably lower than 
the $2.1 million required by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the shortfall occurred last month when a block of mortgage-backed 
securities in the company's reserve fund was devalued from $2.3 million to $1.2 
million because of a weakening market for such bonds.

MISSION VIEJO CO. PRESIDENT BECOMES FIRM'S NEW CEO; DEVELOPER: CRAIG L. 
MCCALLUM ADDS TITLE. RETIRING JAMES G. GILLERAN PIONEERED MASTER-PLANNED 
COMMUNITY CONCEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Craig L. McCallum, president of the Mission Viejo Co., has added the title of 
chief executive officer following the recent retirement of James G. Gilleran, a 
veteran of more than two decades with the land development company. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilleran, 62, was originally an executive with Phillip Morris Cos., the 
tobacco conglomerate that bought the land company in 1972. The Mission Viejo 
Co. had been founded eight years earlier with 10,000 acres of Rancho Mission 
Viejo. A former accountant, Gilleran is credited with helping direct the growth 
of South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 37 years, he was ready to spend some time with the family," said Wendy 
Wetzel-Harder, spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co. "It's still business as 
usual here." 
</P>
<P>
 "When he started, Mission Viejo was out in the boondocks and now it is one of 
the finest master-planned communities in the United States. I think Gilleran 
would like to be remembered for having pioneered the master-planned community 
concept," said Larry Webb, president of Greystone Homes, a Newport Beach home 
builder, who worked for the Mission Viejo Co. in the mid-1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 Gilleran, a Mission Viejo resident who had been president and CEO since 1988, 
did not want his retirement publicly announced and was not available for 
interviews Friday, company officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, who also declined to be interviewed, was most recently president of 
Mission Viejo Co.'s Colorado division. He currently lives in Highlands Ranch, 
Colo. His affiliation with the development company began in 1973 when he was a 
planner with the engineering firm of Raub, Bien Frost and Associates in Orange 
County, a portion of which was acquired by the Mission Viejo Co. Before that, 
he worked in the planning department of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men worked for the company when Mission Viejo, the company's 
master-planned development, became Orange County's 27th city in 1988. The 
Mission Viejo Co. was founded in 1963 with 10,000 acres of Rancho Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate executives described Gilleran as a strong, dynamic leader and a 
good public speaker who liked to be in charge and make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he brought a level of professionalism and discipline to the company 
early on," said Harvey Stearn, who left the Mission Viejo Co. in 1989 to form 
Pacific Gateway Homes in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo planned community now has more than 26,500 homes and 
apartment units and more than 75,000 residents. The community is expected to 
swell to about 90,000 people when it completes its 30-year plan in 1996.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: IN THE LONG RUN, A STOCK-BOND BALANCE PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The frustrating thing about this year's investment slump isn't just that 
stocks have fallen or bonds have dropped, but that they've declined together. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first quarter of 1994, the two categories moved down virtually the 
same path. Equity funds, including international and sector portfolios, fell an 
average of 3.2%, according to Lipper Analytical Services of Summit, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxable-bond funds in general were down 2.2%. U.S. government bond funds 
declined 3.2%, the same amount as stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such close synchronization is to be expected, since rising interest 
rates hurt both markets, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 While higher rates clearly harm bond prices, the link isn't always so certain 
with stock investments. Rising rates are usually accompanied by stronger 
economic activity, and that can be a plus for equities, says C. Frazier Evans, 
chief economist of the Colonial mutual fund group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equities can resist rising interest rates -- it depends on the level of rates 
and how fast earnings are growing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Research on the financial markets from 1926 through 1993 by Ibbotson 
Associates of Chicago supports this assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term government bonds were down 18 of those 68 years. Blue-chip stocks 
had 20 down periods. But the two fell together in the same year just five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more telling, there have been only two years, 1931 and 1969, when 
large stocks and government bonds fell by more than 2%, as they're on pace to 
do for 1994 based on the first quarter's results. 
</P>
<P>
 If history offers any guide, then one of the two groups is likely to bounce 
back, or at least stabilize, over the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The above results stay substantially the same even if you substitute small 
stocks for blue-chips, or corporate bonds for governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibbotson's numbers track unmanaged portfolios of stocks and bonds, so they 
aren't exact proxies for mutual funds. Yet the data seems clear enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stocks and bonds tend not to move together," says Keith R. Getsinger, a 
senior consultant for Ibbotson. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds, however, that the two asset groups have been moving a bit more in 
step since the 1970s, even if the numbers quoted above don't show it. Getsinger 
dates this modest convergence to 1979, when the Federal Reserve changed its 
basic inflation-fighting policy in a way that made the bond market more 
volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 What all this means for investors is that it still makes sense to maintain 
holdings in stock and bond portfolios, one lousy quarter notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Asset-allocation or flexible funds tend to hold such a combination, often with 
cash, real estate, gold or foreign securities thrown in. These funds were off 
3% during the first quarter, faring better than stocks but worse than bonds, as 
might be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But another hybrid group, the balanced funds, did worse than both, falling 
3.3% on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Many balanced portfolios got stung because they had fairly large stakes in 
utility stocks and brand-name companies, two groups that got banged around, 
says A. Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical. Longer term, he adds, the funds 
are likely to continue offering compromise performance, somewhere between those 
of stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, a stock-bond mix has been a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a reason why pension funds tend to run about 60% stocks, 40% bonds," 
says Evans. Based on Ibbotson's numbers, a 60-40 split would have made money in 
every rolling five-year period since 1937-1941, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Balanced and asset-allocation funds tend to maintain a respectable equity 
exposure most of the time, and their bond holdings provide for a smoother ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group had a 52% weighting in stocks at last count, according to 
Morningstar Inc. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, a hybrid fund is a good choice for people who can afford only one. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you have more cash to invest, you might want to build a balanced 
portfolio by selecting individual stock and bond funds. Few fund families are 
superior in both the equity and fixed-income sides of the business, so it might 
pay to shop around. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, you can more finely tune a portfolio of two or more funds to 
better fit your preferences. For example, with a single balanced or 
asset-allocation fund, the bonds you get are almost always going to be taxable 
government, corporate or foreign issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if you're in a high tax bracket, you might want to use municipals for the 
fixed-income portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many advisers think tax-free bonds offer compelling values at the moment, 
especially after taking a dive in the first quarter. 
</P>

<P>
 The latest round of mutual fund openings, closings and additions includes some 
prominent names. 
</P>
<P>
 AIM Aggressive Growth, which enjoys above-average marks from the Morningstar 
and Value Line rating services, plans to shut its doors to new investors after 
May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing shareholders will be able to keep adding money after that date. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston-based stock fund ((800) 347-1919) now counts more than $330 
million in assets, roughly 10 times its size of two years ago. It carries a 
maximum 5.5% sales charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two big no-load portfolios, Mutual Shares and Mutual Qualified, 
opened to new investors on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their large size -- $3.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively -- the 
funds are finding buying opportunities thanks to the stock market's correction, 
says management. 
</P>
<P>
 These funds ((800) 553-3014) also enjoy good marks from the two rating 
services. They're part of the Mutual Series group in Short Hills, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 And New York-based Neuberger & Berman ((800) 877-9700) has unveiled a Socially 
Responsive fund. 
</P>
<P>
 It will seek out companies with good environmental and workplace records, 
while avoiding those that earn revenue from alcohol, tobacco, gambling, nuclear 
power or weapons. There is no sales charge. First Quarter Winners 
</P>

 These balanced and asset-allocations funds were among the better performers 
from January through March and have good records over lengthier periods.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric Centers, the Laguna Hills provider of psychiatric 
services, reported a first-quarter profit of $625,000, or 1 cent a share. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares with a net loss of $37.9 million, or 88 cents a share, for the 
corresponding period last year, which included a charge of nearly $55 million 
related to the restructuring of several of the company's U.S. psychiatric 
facilities. Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 rose 9%, to $92.5 million 
from $84.7 million.

THE CUTTING EDGE; IN THE INFORMATION AGE, EVERYONE'S A REVOLUTIONARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL AKST, Akst is The Times' assistant business editor for technology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dictionary says that technology is "the application of science, especially 
to industrial or commercial objectives." But it's hard, just using that one 
word, to capture some of the technology-inspired changes that have occurred 
merely in the past decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Intel microprocessor -- these are the brains of most desktop 
computers -- performed 2.6 million instructions per second in 1983. Last year, 
the comparable chip performed 112 million instructions per second. 
</P>
<P>
 At that rate of increase, Montgomery Ward will soon be selling what we now 
think of as supercomputers right next to the refrigerators, for the same price 
as today's average personal computer. One difference might be that instead of 
using one of these devices to write your aunt in Minneapolis, you'll use it to 
visit with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Instruments, meanwhile, has developed what it hopes will be a 
lower-costhigh-definition television system based on 2.3 million infinitesimal 
aluminum mirrors attached on a kind of hinge to a computer the size of a large 
postage stamp. Responding to a digital TV signal, the mirrors move back and 
forth to reflect pulses of colored light and produce crystalline images. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a miracle of miniaturization, of course, but the real miracle is the 
microprocessor, which is already having an impact on a par with those earlier 
shapers of modern life, television and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 To try to keep abreast of the changes that flow from the computer revolution, 
the Los Angeles Times Business section will offer expanded coverage of 
technology and its effects on business and the people who use it. In this 
section, we offer something of a snapshot of the Information Revolution -- a 
progress report on a process well underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Wednesday -- and on every Wednesday after that -- we'll explore these 
issues in one or more pages of technology coverage appearing in Business under 
the banner of The Cutting Edge. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that the changes wrought by technology are often manifest in 
business before they become a familiar part of everyday life. Another is that, 
so far, the biggest impact has been felt by and through companies and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, when business spent hundreds of billions of dollars on 
computers, there was little measurable gain in productivity, the implication 
being that the money had basically been thrown out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 But new discoveries always need time to take hold. It took years for the Royal 
Navy to embrace citrus fruit, even though it was known to cure scurvy, but 
eventually British sailors became limeys. The advent of electric engines didn't 
immediately transform manufacturing -- until the people who created factories 
in those days thought to redesign their plants to exploit the power of the new 
machines. Once they did, productivity soared. The current "jobless recovery" 
isn't really jobless, of course, but the relatively slow growth of employment 
reflects, in part, the ability of business to do more and more work without 
adding staff. This is possible in large part because people have finally 
figured out how to use their computers. Another factor is that they have also 
learned to trust them, so instead of adding computing to the paper pushing, 
firms are changing the way they do business altogether to take full advantage 
of the computing power now widely available. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, this will be good for everybody. After all, rising productivity 
is a key to prosperity in any society. But as with most change, there will be 
winners, and there will be losers.  
</P>
<P>
 It's been said that all revolutions eat their children, and this one will no 
doubt do more than a little snacking. Some job categories will disappear, even 
as others emerge. A variety of skills will follow the blacksmith into the 
sunset. And workers without a good education -- or an awful lot of native drive 
-- could find themselves in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the opportunities this revolution presents -- for community, for 
entrepreneurship, for personal freedom -- seem vast in comparison with the 
pitfalls. In most places where they have been introduced, computers have proved 
themselves instruments of democracy, with consequences few could have foreseen 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides all that, we really don't have much choice. The one thing clear by 
now is that, at this late date, there's no going back.

THE CUTTING EDGE; WEAK ON GEOGRAPHY? TRY MAPPING IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CALEB SOUTHWORTH, Southworth is a Los Angeles writer who has worked with 
geographic information software. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cellular One, a Bay Area mobile communications company, had lots of customers 
and plenty of capacity. The one thing it didn't have was a way to match the 
two. As a result, some customers got cut off in mid- sentence, while others 
struggled with inferior connections. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before Cellular One embraced Geographic Information Systems, a way of 
linking geography with non-geographic information. GIS lets users see business 
data such as sales, phone calls and store locations on a map, juxtaposing that 
information with, say, demographic data. Business decisions that once required 
reams of statistical tables and a healthy dose of imagination are laid out 
visually. 
</P>
<P>
 With the installation of a GIS-based network management center in Santa Clara 
last fall, Cellular One was suddenly able to deploy its cloud of cellular 
coverage where customers were actually making the calls, delivering better 
service while making more efficient use of its resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Once restricted to big companies with access to mainframe computing power, 
GISnowadays is spreading like wildfire, thanks to the growing power of desktop 
computers and to innovations in GIS software. The falling price of 
desktop-based GIS programs -- nearly 70% during the past three years -- is 
leading to a revolution in the analysis and display of business data. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular One is far from the only business using this powerful tool to answer 
the question: Where are the customers? Kodak, Arco and Coldwell Banker are a 
few of the many large corporations that use it to find market niches, place new 
stores, assess ZIP-code demographics for direct mailings, dispatch repair teams 
and even analyze power-consumption data within a building. 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses can use GIS too, although this segment is often called 
"desktop mapping." Sales of PC-based software in this genre grew 24% in 1992, 
and an estimated 37% in 1993, when they reached $115 million, according to 
Daratech, a Cambridge-based market research company. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, MapInfo -- the largest vendor of desktop mapping software -- went 
public. Older companies with mainframe products are entering the desktop 
market, and new companies have brought out new GIS products in the last few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 With the decline in computer prices and increase in their speed and power, GIS 
solutions are already within reach of even a small company. Three years ago, a 
mapping software cost upward of $10,000, according to Daratech; now a desktop 
installation is around $3,000. Within the last year, smaller companies such as 
Scan/US have brought out Windows-based geomarket analysis packages for less 
than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Daratech assesses the "core market" -- GIS software, hardware sold by vendors 
and support service -- at $953 million in 1993. But including all data, 
technical support, hardware and software, companies spent $5.5 billion on GIS 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary use of GIS is in site selection. Ken Green, senior analyst in charge 
of volume prediction at Arco, uses it to decide where to buy land for new Arco 
stations and AM/PM outlets. In the past, Arco would have turned to a 
demographic analyst for a market study of a location, but now Green can simply 
highlight a possible venue with his mouse and show the roadways, traffic 
patterns and existing Arco stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In making real estate decisions, Green knows that downtown Los Angeles has 
more potential gasoline customers, but the question is, as he puts it, "is 
eastern Washington going to have a higher yield given what we pay for the land? 
With mapping software I am able to show how many potential customers are within 
a two-mile ring, or I can show the effects of a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another market project we used the software for involved a change in our 
beverage contract with Coke to a setup that included both Coke and Pepsi. 
"There was reason to believe that installation of new, larger machines that 
included both Coke and Pepsi would result in a significant increase in sales, 
but we could not install the machines everywhere at once. I worked with the 
marketing department and used GIS software to create a map of the counties with 
the highest drink sales. That set the agenda for the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Coldwell Banker used GIS "for one client in Phoenix where the market 
demographics within two miles of each store were considered critical," said 
Celeste Cummings, a senior systems analyst for the firm. "GIS allowed us to 
determine which stores were pulling from the same market, in a sense 
cannibalizing customers from each other. This allowed the client to decide 
which stores to close and where to open new ones." 
</P>
<P>
 GIS-based analysis offers the clarity of a map display and the deeper 
understanding of geographic and spatial analysis. At Coldwell Banker, this 
means that instead of handing a voluminous text-based report to a client, 
agents are able to become more involved with the analysis. "When the data 
appears on a map, it is easy to see where you've got holes," said Cummings. 
"The weak spots just jump out at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the geographically linked information changes the potential product 
market. Todd Schwartzrock, director of marketing for Revere National Corp., a 
billboard concern, finds that his new mapping system is pointing to new clients 
who were previously not approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Although outdoor advertising has long used lifestyle data to place billboards, 
Revere uses the mapping software in conjunction with a traffic engineering firm 
that tracks license plates of cars passing its billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are target-marketing as a science. In the past, Schwartzrock's 
pitch to a client would have involved some generalizations about who the ad 
would appeal to and what sorts of viewers might see the billboard. Now he can 
say with confidence who passes that location, where they live and what sort of 
buying patterns that neighborhood has. 
</P>
<P>
 "It affects the kinds of clients we actually approach in the use of our 
media," Schwartzrock said. "We are moving away from the traditional use -- 
alcohol and tobacco -- and toward retail, entertainment, and packaged goods. 
MapInfo allows us to do this with more than just intuitive claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Targeting specific neighborhoods was the interest that launched a relationship 
between the Southern Baptist Sunday School Board and Los Angeles-based mapping 
firm Scan/US. The Sunday School Board -- which manages over $250 million a year 
in revenue -- is the world's largest Protestant religious publisher, with over 
38,000 churches in its conventions. Working with Scan/US, it built the Southern 
Baptist Data Consortium, which adds demographic data and the locations of 
churches and congregations to maps. 
</P>
<P>
 "GIS helps the churches understand how the community has changed and what they 
can do to reach the community," said Earl Nobels, director of the Sunday School 
Board. "As urban systems spread out tentacles -- highways -- housing usually 
follows. The core of the city will then lose population, and racial and ethnic 
changes will follow. So you may have a church that has been there for 25 years, 
now battling to survive. It has to serve a whole different group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 GIS has enabled some congregations to make the tough choices necessary to 
survive. One predominantly white church in a major metropolitan area saw its 
congregation shrink from 1,500 to fewer than 100. In the same community was a 
black church that was pressed for space. Nobels conducted an analysis with 
Scan/US to show where the religious communities were located, and armed with 
this information, the white church decided to donate its facilities to the 
black church. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily diet of tough decisions at the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
made GIS a natural. FEMA started using the MapInfo program after Hurricane 
Andrew touched down in 1992. The agency was facing 240 square miles of 
devastation with no street signs and damaged roadways.  
</P>
<P>
 "We set up a raw street grid and then added to it whatever visual markers 
existed," explained Tom Mulhall, manager for FEMA Response and Recovery 
Information Systems at its Miami office. "You couldn't say 'turn right at 120th 
Street.' You had to say 'right at the water tower, left at the collapsed 
shopping center.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful notebook PCs allow FEMA field operatives to continually send in new 
data and receive redrawn maps several times a day.  
</P>
<P>
 During the California wildfires last summer, FEMA used GIS to map areas of 
damage and decide where relief should go. FEMA estimates that this took a 
three-week process and converted it into a matter of hours. TECH TIPS: What to 
Look for With GIS 
</P>
<P>
 GIS packages are available for PCs, workstations and mainframes. At a minimum, 
you'll need a 486 IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh II. Either should have at 
least 8 megabytes of RAM, high-resolution graphics and 100MB of free hard-disk 
space. Most GIS packages come with some basic data but expect users to buy 
additional data for their specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some desktop packages: 
</P>
<P>
 * Scan/US, $695 ((310) 820-1581) For Windows, comes bundled with basic 
demographic data for the entire United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * MapInfo, $1,295 ((800) 327-8627) The largest vendor of Windows-based GIS 
software, MapInfo sells many GIS add-ons and also makes a Mac version. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atlas GIS for Windows, $1,595 ((800) 472-6277) Atlas is also a major 
supplier of data formatted for its software. 
</P>
<P>
 * Businesses with bigger needs might consider a mainframe or workstation 
installation with the help of a consultant. The two largest GIS companies, 
Intergraph in Huntsville, Ala., and ERSI in Redlands, Calif., specialize in the 
mainframe market and also have PC products. 
</P>
<P>
 A good source of information is the monthly magazine GIS World ((303) 
223-4848).

THE CUTTING EDGE; BUYING INTO THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTY JEROME, Jerome, computer columnist for the Boston Globe, is co-author 
of The Streetwise Guide to PCs (Addison-Wesley). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buying a computer? Heh-heh, you're going to get bilked, of course. You'll pay 
too much for technology that will be obsolete before you even master it. You 
know that, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Old fears die hard. These days, in fact, it's almost impossible to get taken 
to the cleaners when buying a personal computer. The price wars that bloodied 
the industry over the last 18 months have made it hard to avoid a bargain. Even 
cheap PCs now put more power and capability at your fingertips than most people 
will ever use. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, obsolescence is in the eye of the beholder. Yes, computer 
technology advances in gigantic bounds, which will pound the resale value of 
anything you buy today. But this has always been true of computers, and as long 
as your machine is doing the work you need it to do, who cares about keeping up 
with technology fashions? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, technical expertise matters far less than you might believe. Like 
camera or stereo nerds, you can certainly bone up on the benefits of Enhanced 
IDE burst transfer rates or the subtle differences between caching controller 
chips, but it won't make a jot of difference in how much work you move off your 
desk or the enjoyment you get from your PC. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to getting your money's worth is homing in on who will use the gear 
and how. Be as specific as possible. Homework is a generic use. Writing term 
papers, drawing diagrams and calculating differential equations are specific. 
Moonlighting is general. Creating spreadsheet budgets, maintaining customer 
databases and drafting project proposals are specific. Figuring out what you 
hope to accomplish will help immensely in your quest for the perfect system. 
Which Computing Camp? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the rules for buying computers have changed in the last year, mostly 
for the better. The choice between Macintosh and Windows PCs, for example, is 
no longer a matter of theology, and the technical advantages of one camp over 
the other have all but evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 While Apple Computer remains the only maker of Macs, no longer must you pay 
boutique prices for one. Humbled by a shrinking customer base, Apple joined the 
price wars last year. Dollar for dollar, Macintoshes now line up squarely 
against Windows machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mac's seductive charm has won a devoted following, but bear in mind that 
there are 12 IBM-compatible PCs in the world for every Macintosh. If others 
frequently need to read files that you create, Windows ensures wider 
compatibility. Exception: desktop publishing, which the Mac still dominates, 
though this is changing. Also, technophobes and those coming to the computer 
for the first time will generally be happier with the Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new generation of computers based on the PowerPC processor will 
(sort of) run both Windows and Macintosh operating systems. Apple is first out 
of the gate with the new systems (IBM will soon follow), basing them on its 
Quadra PCs. But they run Windows in "emulation mode," which means slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, choose between Windows and Macintosh computers according to the 
software you already know how to use as well as the programs you plan to buy. 
This may seem obvious, but it's surprising how often software doesn't enter the 
picture until the hardware is already bought. That's really putting the cart 
before the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've chosen your computing camp, then ask yourself: Should your gadget 
travel? Can a portable PC suffice as your sole machine? 
</P>
<P>
 The convenience of a notebook system is obvious; the drawbacks aren't. For 
example, fingers must adjust to cramped notebook keyboards. Also, spend two 
hours working from a small and shadowy notebook screen, and you'll develop 
hallucinations and unusual tics. Some notebooks allow you to hook external 
monitors and keyboards to them when working at home, or even full-blown docking 
stations. Such systems do cost more, though. Under the Hood 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether your system travels, each program it runs places 
different demands on your system, which you'll want to take into consideration 
when choosing its configuration. Here generalizations help. Roughly speaking, 
there are five system subcomponents to consider: processor (CPU), memory (RAM), 
hard drive, video and peripherals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because all data traffics through the main processor, a slow CPU translates 
into slow system performance (although the reverse is not necessarily true). 
Graphics, drawing and design programs -- including desktop publishing -- make 
heavy demands of all system components. If you plan to use any of these types 
of programs, get the fastest processor you can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Mac, this means the 32MHz 68040; otherwise, bargains abound in slower 
68030s. For Windows machines, you'll want some flavor of the 486 chip, 
preferably a 33MHz, 50MHz or 66MHz version. Dx means more power than Sx. And 
don't give a second thought to the chip's manufacturer; "Intel Inside" and 
other advertising slogans are so much marketing gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about the new, super powerful Pentium chip; programs that take 
advantage of its advanced features are at least two years away. And computers 
that allow you to "upgrade" to Pentium neglect to mention that the upgrade 
cards typically cost as much as a new computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Memory and hard drive configurations are easier to calculate: The more, the 
better. Any computer you buy today should come with at least four megabytes of 
random access memory, or RAM. Any less, and your dealer is hiding costs that 
will magically resurface at the cash register. For desktop publishing or 
high-end design and graphics work, you'll want at least 8MB, possibly more. 
Ditto large databases and spreadsheets, or if you frequently run more than two 
or three programs concurrently. Almost no one needs more than 16MB, and those 
power hogs know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard drives, like old garages, run out of space depressingly fast. Even simple 
documents and spreadsheets come adorned with fonts and charts and other fins 
and flora that insinuate themselves into larger spaces. Today's computer games 
and screen savers shamelessly grab 10 megabytes at a time. The porkiest files 
contain full-motion video or animation and sound, which is why multimedia 
programs are stored on compact disc, not on a hard disk. But even stuffy 
business applications now include video sequences and sound clips. A current 
glut of hard drives has hammered prices down to about $1 per megabyte. Take 
advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's floor for drive capacity is 120MB. Work upward from there. For heavy 
desktop publishing, large databases and drawing and design programs, look for 
at least 200MB. If you plan to produce videos or animation from your PC, or if 
you use photo touch-up programs, you'll want at least 500MB. Performance counts 
too, especially with databases and design programs. Some Windows PCs run their 
hard drives on "local bus," which pumps data along a more direct route to the 
CPU. It helps drive performance somewhat, but don't pay extra for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Local bus was originally designed to goose video performance, which has become 
the most serious system bottleneck, thanks to graphical interfaces (both 
Macintosh and Windows). Almost all Windows PCs sold today come with a video 
accelerator running on local bus. Don't trouble yourself about which 
accelerator or which local bus architecture -- or even about what these things 
mean. Just make sure your Windows computer includes this feature; it ensures 
that your screen can keep up with the rest of your computer. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also need to decide how many colors your video system supports at which 
resolutions. For example, most plain-Jane Windows PCs support 256 colors at 640 
by 480 resolution (the number of dots of light displayed horizontally and 
vertically). For desktop publishing, you'll want a display that supports 256 
colors at 1,024 by 768 resolution. Ditto for games and multimedia applications. 
And look for a monitor with a .28 dot pitch and 70Hz refresh rate. Don't worry 
about why. 
</P>
<P>
 High-end graphics work and full-motion video require special video cards that 
can display up to 1.6 million colors. For such work, you'll want a monitor 
that's larger than the standard 14- or 15-inch variety as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Video on the Macintosh is simpler. Low-end displays provide 16 simultaneous 
colors, adequate for spreadsheets and word processing, perhaps, but games will 
look anemic, and you'll definitely want more pizazz when working with graphics 
or multimedia applications. Choices are limited, however. Let your budget 
dictate which video option you choose, keeping in mind that, as with Windows 
PCs, you can buy special cards for full-motion video and animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you never plan to watch movies on your computer, multimedia has become 
a preponderant fact of computing -- which is why CD-ROM drives are suddenly the 
best-selling PC peripheral today. Don't buy a computer without one. Two years 
hence they'll be required even to load software onto your system. Problem is, 
they're s-l-o-w. 
</P>
<P>
 Double-speed CD-ROM drives read text and program code at twice the speed of 
conventional drives, which boosts overall performance. They're basically the 
standard. Triple- and quadruple-speed drives are also available, though 
practically speaking, they're only moderately faster than double-speed drives. 
And they typically cost far more. If you can find a bargain on one, nab it. 
Otherwise, stick to double-speed. Computer as Communicator? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't leave the store without a modem, your entree to the information 
superhighway, even if the cliche does make you carsick. The faster the speed, 
the happier you'll be. Faster modems can save you money on your phone bills or 
connect charges, depending on what you do on-line, and even if you use a 
flat-rate service, slower transmission speeds can be maddening. These days, 
14,400 bps modems (never mind what that stands for) are so cheap you've got to 
have one. TECH TIPS: What to Look for While Shopping 
</P>
<P>
 What do you hope to do with your new computer? Answering that question will 
make finding the right machine easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home use: For letters, homework, managing your finances, playing games, 
using services such as Prodigy, get a 486SX (25 MHz or 33MHz) PC or a 68030 
Mac. Either way, get 4 megabytes of RAM and a 120-megabyte hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small business: For word processing, spreadsheets and databases, get a 486SX 
or DX (50 MHz) PC or a 68040 Mac, either way with 8MB RAM and a 200MB hard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Desktop publishing, graphics and multimedia production: 486Dx (100 MHz) or a 
68040 Mac. In either case, get 16MB of RAM and a 500MB hard drive.

THE CUTTING EDGE; MAILBOX RUNNETH OVER? YOU MUST BE USING E-MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not long ago, electronic mail was the province of the electronic elite. 
Admittance was attained only after demonstrated mastery of arcane computer 
commands and willingness to plunk down large sums for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, e-mailers were a small and, yes, cozy community of tech-heads, 
academics and the occasional underage hacker. On the rare instance that members 
of the general public penetrated the digital domain, they were greeted with 
surprise and courtesy. People you could never reach by phone answered e-mail in 
person.  
</P>
<P>
 But the golden age of e-mail is fast coming to an end. The rush toward the 
electronic frontier has almost overnight turned a modest cybercolony into an 
overrun metropolis, leaving some of its longtime inhabitants pining for the old 
days, and flailing, along withthe newcomers, to devise a way to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when I got irritated at 15 messages," says John Trimble, a 
professor of business economics at Washington State University. Recently, he 
hit a personal best, logging 678 e-mail missives in a day. "Wading through them 
all can be pretty depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, e-mail is hip. MTV video jockey Adam Curry has an electronic 
address. So did the athletes at this winter's Olympics; Tonya Harding even had 
the privilege of having hers tapped into by a clique of hacker wanna-be 
journalists. Vice President Al Gore flaunts his Internet account as a sign that 
he's more cutting-edge than he looks. And the once-nerdy Net is now being used 
as a symbol of social empowerment: "We're here, we're queer, we have e-mail" 
reads the T-shirt slogan of the recently founded Digital Queers. 
</P>
<P>
 Snail mail, of course, still dominates. But Americans bought more computers 
than televisions last Christmas season, and plummeting prices threaten to equip 
half of all U.S. households with the devices within a year. E-mail is also 
getting easier to use, with point-and-click graphics beginning to replace 
Byzantine Unix commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses too are rapidly expanding their use of on-line communication. A 
recent study at one medium-size firm estimated that it could save more than 
$100,000 a year in long-distance telephone costs if even 25% of its staff was 
hooked up to the Internet, although it's unclear whether the study took account 
of potential lost productivity from the inevitable Net addictions that would 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, 476 million e-mail messages pulsed across the fiber-optic 
backbone of the Internet, run by the National Science Foundation -- double the 
number from the previous year. By last February , the number had nearly doubled 
again, to 837 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, people like e-mail. It fosters the exchange of ideas, has revived 
the art of letter writing (in a different way) and maybe saved some trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the influx of the masses into cyberspace raises myriad questions, such as: 
When is e-mail junk mail? What constitutes "free speech" on-line? And perhaps 
most important, how in the Netgod's name to deal with mailboxes overflowing 
with digital communiques? 
</P>
<P>
 By now, for example, most everyone knows that e-mail inspires boldness in the 
shy, humor in the stodgy and eloquence in the bland. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog," says a dog at a computer in a 
New Yorker cartoon, his soul presumably roaming free in cyberspace, where the 
banality of physical form matters not. 
</P>
<P>
 E-mail's cachet wore off quickly at the Clinton Administration, for example, 
which has already resorted to an electronic form letter for their man on the 
electronic frontier. An e-mail message to Vice President Gore elicits the 
following response from "autoresponder@Whitehouse.gov": 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for responding to the vice president via Internet. . . . 
Unfortunately the very large volume of mail received by the Vice President from 
citizens around the nation prevents him from sending a more detailed and direct 
response at this time. Please be assured, however, that your correspondence has 
been read carefully. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Tips on future White House e-mailings from director of vice presidential 
correspondence Bill Mason include: "Write short and concise messages, address 
only one issue per message, and send only one copy of your message." 
</P>
<P>
 On mailing lists -- topical discussion groups whose members send e-mail to all 
participants at once -- the failure to include a relevant subject heading 
begets "flames" like the following from a recent posting to a list about the 
future of newspapers: "Today alone I have almost a dozen messages with the 'Re: 
your mail' subject lines and another subject line that bothers me -- 'Unknown 
subject.' I'm sick of being forced to call up dozens of pieces of mail because 
the subject lines are misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 This can be especially annoying for subscribers to services that charge the 
receiver "postage due" for opening mail. Other typical offenses include posting 
private e-mail on public mailing lists and mass e-mailings of unsolicited 
product pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime members of the e-mail elite are resorting to multiple accounts, using 
"bounce" to automatically return unwanted authors and subjects, and retaliating 
against junk-mail offenders (advertisers, mostly) by stuffing the senders' 
mailboxes with "junk replies." These range from recipes for kale and tempeh 
stir-fry to more direct expressions of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraig Meyer of El Segundo-based Aerospace Corp. came back to almost 1,000 new 
messages when he took a two-week vacation last year. He's coped by writing 
several programs that will sort and file messages based on the subject line or 
sender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried having two accounts, one 'unlisted' and one for subscriptions, but 
that didn't work," says Leslie Carlin, who uses e-mail to keep in touch with 
her Los Angeles friends from her new home in North Carolina. "I found myself 
avoiding the 'task' of going through the subscribed account, but then also 
missing useful information, often with deadlines. Now I'm back to just one 
mailbox, and I plow through the 'junk,' enjoying messages from people I know as 
special treats. It's not quick, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, America Online, a previously self-contained information service, 
unleashed its nearly 1 million subscribers onto the Internet, a network of 
networks that is essentially public and not owned by any one organization. 
Consternation has reached a fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke over the last few weeks is 'Hey, why don't you have an aol.com 
address like all the other idiots?' " notes Joshua Geller, a systems 
administrator at a Santa Monica telecommunications firm, adding: "There are 
certain, not really rules, but customs, that people follow, and they just don't 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Negroponte, who heads the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media 
Lab, has managed to keep his e-mail down to 30 or 40 thoughtful and relevant 
messages a day with one account, largely through force of will. 
</P>
<P>
 "That number is low," Negroponte writes from an Internet node in Gutersloh, 
Germany. "It is low because I am on no mailing lists whatsoever. It is also low 
because people know that I live or die on e-mail and will not send gratuitous 
cc's or dare crap up my mailbox with more noise than message."  
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, whose e-mail address was published earlier this 
year in a New Yorker magazine story and is reputed to be receiving up to 3,000 
messages a day, offers this vision of e-mail's future -- conveyed, it must be 
noted, electronically via the Internet: 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, there will be an approach where strangers who want to get 
someone's attention will have to say if they are willing to pay to get 
someone's attention. The person who reads the mail will have folders with the 
amounts marked on them. When you read a message you can decide to cancel the 
charge if you decide it was really worth reading for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds simple, but e-mail advertising in any form is a major source of 
contention on the Net, where the prevailing ethos is an odd mix of equal parts 
libertarianism and commune. 
</P>
<P>
 James McBride, whose Los Altos-based marketing firm a year ago began 
collecting e-mail addresses by category and selling them to clients who used 
them to send advertisements, said he quit recently due to all the flak. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't like it will send you back hundreds of messages a day just 
for the hell of it, as an irritation," McBride says. "Everybody feels it's 
their job to police the Internet." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride instead turned his address lists into the first analog cyberspace 
phone book. Published by IDG, the Internet White Pages hit stores last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Gates, perhaps the most e-mailed man around, still comes down strongly in 
favor: "I still read all the e-mail I get. All of the e-mail from internal or 
any one I know I read the same day it comes in. I separate out the mail that 
comes from strangers across the Internet into a separate folder and sometimes I 
fall as much as a week behind on that. This doesn't mean I answer every piece 
of mail, but I don't answer most of the mail I get from the post office, 
either."

THE CUTTING EDGE; SECONDHAND PC BARGAINS ABOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite big advances in technology, millions of us have specific, limited 
tasks we want our PCs to perform. We don't need state-of-the-art. Fact is, most 
of us can get by with a 286-based PC and a 40MB hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfit it with an integrated package, such as Microsoft Works or Lotus Works, 
a personal finance program such as Quicken or Managing Your Money, a file 
manager and a set of disk utilities for emergencies. The whole tamale costs 
less than $600. A sad secret of the computer industry is that even power users 
typically work with less than 20% of the software features or system power in 
their $3,000 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, a booming industry of used PCs has emerged in the last six 
years -- witness Processor ((800) 334-7443), a paper filled largely with used 
computer ads. Catering to small businesses, nonprofit organizations, educators, 
moonlighters, hobbyists and, increasingly, big corporations, the used computer 
market offers superb dollar value. 
</P>
<P>
 There are essentially three ways to tap into it: through a computer exchange, 
a local dealer or from classified ads. You'll pay more buying from a computer 
exchange or a dealer, but you usually get some kind of warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Any way you buy, the prices are amazing. A 2-year-old IBM PS/2 Model 70 with a 
120MB hard drive costs about $800 on the Boston Computer Exchange ((800) 
262-6399). The United Computer Exchange ((800) 755-3033) recently offered a 
Macintosh LCIII for $600 and a Mac Plus for $400. A LaserJet III printer cost 
$450 on the American Computer Exchange ((800) 786-0717). 
</P>
<P>
 This is hardly derelict technology. But how do you know you're not buying a 
lemon? Because computers contain so few moving parts, problems typically emerge 
in the first few weeks of life . . . or not for years. Exceptions: monitors, 
power supplies and hard drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Power supplies expire from simple old age. Replacements cost $60 to $120, and 
are easy. Monitors suffer all the ailments of old televisions. When 
tire-kicking a used monitor, stare closely at the screen when it's turned off. 
A permanent ingrained image indicates old age. You'll probably have to replace 
it in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Disk drives contain moving parts, which makes them vulnerable. They tend to 
crash without notice. Everyone who uses a computer should have a set of disk 
utilities, such as the Norton Utilities or PC Tools, for help in data 
disasters. When inspecting a used PC, take these along. They include 
diagnostics that will report bad hard-disk sectors and other irregularities 
that augur catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they're mostly just a whistle in the dark. The main thing is to adopt a 
painless backup strategy, and stick to it. MARTY JEROME

THE CUTTING EDGE; WITH 'SHAREWARE,' TRY BEFORE YOU BUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PRESTON GRALLA, Gralla, a writer in Cambridge, Mass., is the author of The 
PC/Computing Guide to Shareware (Ziff-Davis Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're looking for good buys on software, consider "shareware," software 
that you can try before you pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail software is so cheap nowadays that nobody is writing shareware word 
processors or spreadsheets anymore. But shareware remains a great source for 
utilities such as file managers, calendars, anti-virus programs, games and 
niche products such as wedding planning software. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do you get shareware? Three main places: on-line, from disk vendors, and 
on CD-ROMs, which come stuffed with thousands of programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among on-line services, your best bet is CompuServe. One way or another, just 
about every piece of shareware ends up there. The best way to find it is to use 
the IBM File Finder (GO IBMFF, in CompuServe parlance), which will search the 
service for the programs you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy doesn't have shareware collections like CompuServe. If you want a 
wide-rangingcollection of shareware, you'll have to go to ZiffNet for Prodigy, 
and you'll have to pay an extra fee for it. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online isn't as comprehensive as CompuServe, but has lots of shareware 
too. Just GO SOFTWARE. On the Internet, there's shareware in many places; to 
reach the great trove of Windows programs, ftp ftp.cica.indiana.edu (you 
netsters know how). 
</P>
<P>
 Disk vendors have large collections of shareware, which they sell for $2 to $5 
per disk. Two of the best-known vendors are Public Software Library ((800) 
242-4775) and Public Brand Software ((800) 426-3475). 
</P>
<P>
 The newest shareware source is CD-ROMs. They usually sell for less than $40, 
which gets you a CD stuffed with thousands of shareware titles. There are many 
sources; two are Public Software Library and the Assn. of Shareware 
Professionals ((616) 788-5131). 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, wherever you get your shareware -- even if you buy it on disk -- 
you're morally and legally obligated to register any programs you keep. That 
means paying the author. 
</P>
<P>
 To get started in shareware, make sure you get: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pkzip. This package of programs lets you uncompress downloaded shareware 
files, or compress files to be stored or sent to another user; 
</P>
<P>
 * McAfee's VirusScan virus protection software, so you can scan whatever you 
get later; 
</P>
<P>
 * The Visual Basic Runtime modules. Many Windows programs are written in 
VisualBasic, which means you'll need these generics to make them run. They're 
vbrun100.dll, vbrun200.dll and vbrun300.dll. 
</P>
<P>
 Some others worth trying: 
</P>
<P>
 * Time and Chaos. If you're looking to take control of your life, this 
excellent "personal information manager" is the place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 * ClipMate. This Windows utility lets you save all the information you put 
onto the Clipboard, not just the last clip. It also lets you combine several 
clips into one large one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drag and File. This excellent replacement for the Windows File Manager 
includes file viewers for just about every major program -- something Windows 
doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 * METZ Task Manager. Do away with Windows' anemic Task Manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * WinPost. Get rid of the little yellow stickies all over your desk and 
computer. Use this electronic equivalent of Post-Its. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wolfenstein 3-D. Great game: Kill Nazis and their running dogs. Escape from 
the fortress. 
</P>
<P>
 * AM-TAX. You have filed your taxes, haven't you? No? Then get this tax-prep 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * QModem. The best DOS shareware telecommunications program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Top Fonts Sampler. Windows users can never have enough fonts, so try out 
this excellent TrueType collection. 
</P>
<P>
 * WinPaks. More fonts, icons and screen savers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4DOS. For command-line junkies, a better DOS than DOS. 
</P>
<P>
 * Envision Publisher. DOS desktop-publishing program. 
</P>
<P>
 * WOPR (WinWord Office Power Pack). Macros and add-ins for Word for Windows, 
the popular word processor.

THE CUTTING EDGE; CASE STUDY: HOW TECHNOLOGY CHANGED A BUSINESS; AT MAZDA, 
USING COMPUTERS TO REV UP CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Groves covers the computer industry for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, Mazda Motor of America, fearing the worst, dispatched 
employees to visit its dealerships posing as customers in search of 
out-of-stock parts. The "mystery shoppers" confirmed the awful truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers often had no idea how long it would take to get a part, or promised 
delivery by a certain date and then had to renege. Mazda customers generally 
had to wait days longer for repairs than did owners of Nissans, Toyotas and 
other makes of vehicles. Customer satisfaction was woefully deficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were dead last in how long it took to get a part, and near the bottom in 
the number of dealers that already had the part," said Michael Anzis, vice 
president of information systems for Mazda Motor of America, based in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years and more than $10 million in technological revamping later, 
customer -- and dealer -- satisfaction is on the upswing for the U.S. arm of 
Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 By placing orders on personal computers hooked up to an IBM mainframe at 
headquarters, dealers can now get parts delivered overnight. Instead of 
scouring old-fashioned microfiche records, parts managers can call up 
computerized descriptions, diagrams and pictures from an electronic parts 
catalogue played on a compact disc device. In the works: An interactive system 
that will coach mechanics through tricky repairs as they work in the service 
bays. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Mazda has been battered by resurgent U.S. car makers, a weak yen and 
the deteriorating Japanese economy. Like other auto makers, Mazda has been 
forced to lay off workers, but its embracing of computer technology has helped 
there, too. Mazda executives insist the job cuts aren't the result of the 
revamping. They say the new system made it possible for them to cope when the 
layoffs became necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda reinvented its parts system with technology that is far from the cutting 
edge. On the contrary, the company's experience shows how much can be done with 
established technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda devised its new parts strategy in 1991, with the help of Andersen 
Consulting, a leading technology adviser based in Chicago. After a three-phase, 
18-month rollout, the last of Mazda's 800 dealers were trained on the new 
equipment last June. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the project was deceptively simple: To improve customer 
satisfaction at the dealership. And management knew early on that computer 
hardware and software could take the company only part of the way there. Most 
important was instilling a new customer-comes-first attitude in the dealers, 
many of whom sell other makes as well as Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear that grabbing hold of dealers' attention . . . was essential," 
said Doug Willinger, an Andersen Consulting partner who worked on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer technology helped with that, too. At Mazda headquarters, the IBM 
mainframe, running software developed by Andersen, began working in real time, 
rather than the previous method that imposed an automatic one-day delay for 
filling orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Mazda used custom-developed software to make the dealerships' IBM 
workstations more responsive. The software can search the system for anything 
from an oil filter to a water pump for a 20-year-old RX-3. If the dealer orders 
the part by 3 p.m., the computer immediately confirms that the part will arrive 
the next morning from one of seven U.S. distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
 For harder-to-find parts, dealers can now place a daily "back-order inquiry" 
that provides estimated times of arrival. In the past, the actual delivery date 
was always a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 With the CD-ROM electronic parts catalogue, updated monthly, dealers can type 
in a car's 17-digit vehicle identification number and be assured of getting the 
exact part needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as having the right technology in place, however, has been 
Mazda's push to communicate with and train its far-flung network of dealers, 
parts managers, mechanics and employees -- all 36,000 of them. The 
hand-holding, Mazda officials said, never ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a constant sell for dealers to see the wisdom of approaching 
the customer in a different way," said Vic Morine, Mazda's director of parts 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system has been a boon for dealers trying to keep pace with orders for 
the 70,000 parts needed for every model, style and production year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mike Rudolph, parts manager for Almaden Mazda in San Jose, the clincher is 
overnight delivery instead of a wait of two to five days. With Mazda now 
filling 90% of dealers' orders in just one day, he can stock up on the 
hottest-moving parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parts end (of the business) right now is just booming," he said. "At 
times previously, it was kind of depressing."

THE CUTTING EDGE; WOMEN AND COMPUTING: NATURE OR NURTURE?; WHY ARE MOST NERDS 
MEN? AND DOES IT REALLY MATTER? TO FIND OUT, THE TIMES POSED QUESTIONS TO A 
DISPARATE GROUP OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO DEBATED THEM IN AN APPROPRIATE FORUM -- AN 
ELECTRONIC MAIL ROUNDTABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why are there so few women in the world of computing? Why do men predominate 
on-line and stay up all night, tinkering with their config.sys files? And does 
it make any difference? 
</P>
<P>
 In search of answers, the Los Angeles Times asked some people who've spent 
time thinking about such questions. Here are some excerpts from the resulting 
discussion, which began with Jo Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Sanders: I am increasingly concerned by the direction the popular media is 
taking about women's issues, including computing. We seem to be hearing more 
and more about the equivalent of a "computer gene" that makes women different, 
in essence innately, from men. 
</P>
<P>
 This thinking leads to the conclusion that it's not surprising there are so 
few women in computing, relatively speaking, and not coincidentally, also 
reinforces the status quo: if women are by nature unsuited to computing, why 
bother trying to increase their numbers? In all my years of research on girls 
and computing, it seems to me that there are so many cultural influences that 
explain the differences in computer behavior and achievement between men and 
women that looking for the functional equivalent of a computer gene is at best 
misguided and at worst a cynical attempt to keep women out of computing.  
</P>
<P>
 We know a great deal about the subtle and not-so-subtle influences: parents 
who buy computers for boys and put them in boys' rooms, software that appeals 
(not to say panders!) to male tastes, pornography in electronic networks and 
software, nerdy boys who chase girls out of computer rooms -- I could go on and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George Gilder: The dominance of males in computing is no greater than their 
dominance in mathematics, logic, business, politics, physics, chess, athletics 
and violent crime. These areas of dominance are obviously not an effect of 
socialization since they arise in all societies known to anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not politically correct, male dominance originates with the 
biological differences between the sexes, beginning with the perceptible 
differentiation of brain structures. As long as computing is a leading-edge 
activity, it will be dominated by males. This was true of driving until the car 
was routinized. When the computer becomes a routine tool, men will turn to 
something more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Raskin: Surely this was meant as inciteful conversation? 
</P>
<P>
 I think the operative word here is not "leading edge" but "impractical." That 
is as long as computing is an "impractical" activity, it will be dominated by 
males. Women are practical creatures, driven by very practical, goal-oriented 
needs. While men have the luxury of "frittering away" their time with on-line 
banter, the latest video game technology, a round of sports, a few hours of 
listening to high fidelity or some other "sharper image" pursuit, women have 
been juggling the realities of family and work. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a woman who spent 10 years at home minding the children, and writing about 
technology as a sideline. When my children were school-aged, I returned to the 
office and was shocked beyond belief at how inefficiently men there used their 
time relative to women at home. I also quickly came to realize and appreciate 
that sometimes it's this playful/tinkering/explorative behavior that leads to 
the most creative work. 
</P>
<P>
 As a woman in this industry, I try to balance the practical considerations of 
getting a high-tech magazine out on time and on budget with the more noble 
pursuit of "testing the heck out of a software or hardware product." In other 
words, I try to bring a sort of androgynous blend to the picture. Women have as 
little incentive to go on-line and chat with electronic cronies as they did to 
hang out at the corner bar. As the computer becomes a tool with a means to an 
end -- a way to get the school newsletter out, or shop for a family, or find 
out what an expert family doctor says about the new HIV vaccination, or plan a 
family trip, or balance the family budget -- that's when women will see the 
value of computing. Women see a "tool" where men see a "toy."

 Sanders: I'm always amused at the certainty people have of innate sex 
differences, considering that such a thing is unknowable. When we're prepared 
to raise children in individual boxes with no environmental influences 
whatever, then we will know what is innate and what isn't. In the meantime we 
have to assume that since we know a fair amount about environmental influences 
that shape expectations and behavior, at least a lot can be laid at that 
doorstep.

 Reva Basch: Whatever the historical reasons for the lack of women in computing 
-- something that I do think is changing -- I see a tremendous interest among 
my female friends and colleagues, not so much in how computers work as in what 
they can "do." 
</P>
<P>
 For any technology to take hold, you need a "killer app," an application that 
makes using it irresistible. For many women, the killer app is communications, 
the ability to connect with other people through their keyboards and modems. I 
host Women on The WELL, a private, women-only forum that happens to be one of 
the most active conferences on that system. I see women who got hold of a 
computer and climbed the learning curve solely to participate in on-line 
communications. There are artists, single mothers, people who live in isolated 
rural areas, whom you wouldn't think of as computer users at all, but they have 
gotten adept simply because there was something they were strongly motivated to 
accomplish that happened to be computer-related.

 Gilder: The issue of differences in behavior between men and women in relation 
to anything, from knitting and figure skating to baseball and computing, cannot 
be seriously discussed without confronting the demonstrable reality of 
biological differences. Although sex roles have varied tremendously among 
societies throughout history, in all societies, men are more aggressive and 
competitive, hold the warrior role (Amazons are a myth), and command the 
positions to which the society ascribes the greatest prestige and importance 
outside the always central and indispensable maternal roles. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, studies of the brain have demonstrated physiological 
differences in the hypothalamus and the cortex, and in the entire 
endocrinological system. Differential performance in math and science is not a 
peculiarity of the United States; it is universal. Greater male focus on 
earning money is universal in all societies with productive economies. It stems 
from the fact that as an overwhelming rule men must outperform women in the 
marketplace in order to marry. The computer is the leading wealth producer in 
the world economy. Men flock to it not for diversion but for sexual survival. 
In general, the more money a woman makes, the larger is the gap between her 
income and her husband's larger income. The male dominance in computing is 
merely another expression of the universal need of men to dominate economically 
in order to win women.

 Raskin: But George, you can't say that spending hours and hours surfing the 
Internet, or playing some golf simulation, or Fantasy Baseball League, or 
electronic chat boards, or heaven forbid even electronic pornography has much 
to do with going out there and "making a killing?" These guys have a "because 
it is there" attitude, not unlike climbers of Everest. While I won't disagree 
with your findings about innate differences in the sexes, I think the male 
"kill" gene doesn't really explain what's going on here. As a matter of fact, I 
could argue that there's an escapist gene at work instead. I've heard wives 
complain about their husbands' computer habits with the same tone that wives 
complain about drinking or drug habits.

 Mary K. Flynn: Cyberspace may have traditionally been a men's club, but that's 
changing fast. Earlier this month, at U.S. News & World Report, we launched a 
women's symposium on our CompuServe forum. In the first three weeks, 2,000 
people participated, about 95% of whom are women. And we certainly aren't the 
only ones who've been successful in bringing women on-line. The New York-based 
bulletin board Echo isn't aimed especially at women, but by virtue of its being 
founded by a woman, Stacy Horn, it's captured 40% female membership. Compare 
that with CompuServe, which estimates its female membership at about 10% (and 
maybe as high as 30% if you count women using their significant others' 
accounts). Women's Wire, launched in January in San Francisco by Ellen Pack, 
has 700 members, 90% of whom are women. Clearly women are very interested in 
communicating on-line. But the way women communicate electronically seems to be 
very different from the way men do. While men spend a lot of on-line time 
expressing their opinions and arguing, women seem to be more interested in 
sharing resources and in connecting with each other in the real world (the U.S. 
News women's symposium is filled with a lot of career networking). At this 
point, I wonder if the very thing men seem to like about on-line services -- 
the electronic "pub" -- is what has been turning women off. As to why so few 
women in the computer industry, this is a question I've been asking male and 
female executives in the computer industry for the last eight years. Many of 
the women I've spoken to talk about that magical age between 11 and 13 when all 
of a sudden you can't be both pretty and good at math. (If I were George, I 
guess I'd say women discover that in order to get a man, they have to fail at 
math.) 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Basch: Women often need to be shown that there's something of value behind the 
technology. I tried explaining to my 80-year-old mother-in-law how it was that 
I had made such good friends "on the computer." Finally, I sat her down and 
demoed The WELL to her. Her comment? "Why, honey, it's just people talking, 
isn't it?" She was thrilled, and had me browse through conference after 
conference, looking for topic headers that she found interesting. I don't go 
along with Mary's suggestion that women seem to be more interested in sharing 
resources and connecting in the real world than in hanging out in some 
electronic pub. The electronic pub model is exactly what appeals to many of us. 
We work at home, or live in areas where it's difficult to find kindred spirits, 
and we fulfill many of our social needs by hanging out on-line.

 Wendy Kaminer: I'm a computer illiterate, having my first e-mail conversation 
(is this called a conversation?) Imagine my delight when while reading George 
Gilder's remarks, I discovered the escape key. I may learn to love computers 
after all. I'm already enjoying the spectacle of a new technology being used to 
conduct an old conversation. Women have traditionally been considered 
ill-suited to do whatever jobs it would have been socially or economically 
disruptive for them to do. The professions -- law, medicine, and business -- 
and the more lucrative trades were exclusively male for much of our history, 
partly because it was believed that women were dumber than men, less analytic 
and ambitious, as well as weaker. "Scientific" theories about gender difference 
were always used to justify gender discrimination (just as theories about 
racial difference were used to justify racism.) 
</P>
<P>
 Darwin asserted that men were more creative, energetic and courageous than 
women, who, he suggested, were not as evolved as men. He associated women with 
the "lower races." (Guess which races he meant.) Of course, George, I don't 
know as much about evolution as Darwin did, but I do know a dinosaur when I see 
one. Nineteenth Century scientists also kept themselves busy weighing the 
brains of famous men, in the belief that brain power was a function of weight. 
But, as feminist Helen Hamilton Gardener pointed out, no man's brain, not even 
Byron's, was a match for the brain of an elephant. More important to biological 
determinists today than theories about the brain are theories about genes. 
Practically everything, it seems, is said to be genetic, which means nothing is 
anyone's fault and nothing is changeable. We have alcoholism genes, homosexual 
genes, and now, it seems, we have computer genes. (We really ought to have a 
biologist in on this conversation to explain how genes work: it's not that 
simple.) 
</P>
<P>
 How convenient all these theories are for men who want to maintain their 
monopolies. Actively discourage girls from succeeding in math and science and 
then count the number who change to humanities majors in their sophomore year 
as evidence that women are naturally uninterested in math and science. When a 
woman has been forced into a corset all her life, Helen Gardener remarked, it's 
hard to judge her natural shape.

 Karen Frenkel: I have just finished filming a documentary for Public 
Television that addresses the same questions as this forum. The one-hour film 
is tentatively entitled "Minerva's Machine: How Women are Changing Computing." 
Over 40 people were interviewed, including computer scientists, psychologists, 
lawyers and students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gilder's statement that there are few women in computing because males 
dominate leading edge activities is, at best, simplistic. The reasons for 
unequal gender representation are complex, as we learned from our interviews 
and research. As one sociologist explained, boys and girls exhibit different 
styles of programming. Boys generally use the "hard master" style -- they 
conduct a monologue with the computer, commanding and writing code according to 
a structured, linear plan. In contrast, most girls employ "soft mastery," 
engaging in a dialogue and even a negotiation with the computer in order to see 
what works. Their way is to interact and explore what the computer can do, 
rather than to conquer the box, as males try to do. In school, girls get their 
hands slapped for programming the "wrong way." As a result, they believe that 
they are not good at programming, become discouraged, and stay away. Yet truly 
creative, virtuoso programmers draw on both styles in order to maintain their 
"leading edge." Think of all the talent that is being deterred and lost. The 
idea that women are not capable of excelling in computer science because they 
are biologically not fit is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raskin: With new visual development environments and the rules of 
object-oriented programming, I wonder if women won't be better off. The things 
you mention, like having a dialogue with the machine, and testing to see what 
works and what doesn't figure heavily into the object-oriented model. The 
ability to see the gestalt of the application becomes very important too. Of 
course, I just wrote a column where I lambasted the "fellas" who are developing 
some of the new language of object-oriented programming. Concepts like 
"exposing your objects," "naked objects" and "inserting objects into 
containers" dominate the language. Freud would have had a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frenkel: Several of my sources said the direction of computing seems to be 
going in one that women will welcome. For example, girls like to work and play 
together with the computer. They like to problem-solve as a team. This would 
seem to be in synch with the advent of collaborative work, made increasingly 
possible by local-area networks and client-server configurations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gilder: Wendy Kaminer's response is typically feminist: throw some dirt and 
change the subject. A belief in the differences between the sexes is alleged to 
imply racism, genetic determinism, and male superiority. I actually believe 
that male and female brains are different and that in many ways the female 
brain is superior: for example, female brains manage a much more complex 
endocrinological system, more sensitive social perceptions and verbal 
subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
 I have shown in several books that women are sexually superior and that men 
are more dependent on marriage, and hence on women, than women are dependent on 
men. Women are healthier and play the central roles in procreation. A society 
could survive the deaths of nearly all its young men, but would go extinct if 
its women were not protected. But men in all societies are more aggressive, 
competitive, enterprising, mathematical and tall. It so happens that computer 
science is heavily a mathematical pursuit and that the computer business is one 
of the most competitive on the planet. But as the father of three girls, one of 
whom I am currently teaching calculus, phasor algebra, trigonometry and other 
advanced engineering math at age 13, I fail to see how my observation that 
women around the world are less involved in computers than men makes me somehow 
a dinosaur. Any society, however, that fails to come to terms with the profound 
differences between the sexes will likely go the way of the dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn: George, I'm trying to follow your arguments but I'm perplexed. If men 
are genetically better designed for mathematics, what is the point of teaching 
your 13-year-old daughter calculus, trig, etc? There'll always be a guy around 
who can do it better, in your view. 
</P>
<P>
 I also don't understand why the historical evidence you refer to leads you to 
the conclusion that men and women are genetically different -- all of it could 
be explained by socialization, not biology. I do believe there tend to be some 
general behavioral differences (with zillions of exceptions), but I think they 
stem from the different training we give girls and boys. Some of the signals we 
send are so subtle we don't even notice them. I try to be very vigilant about 
this stuff, buying gender-neutral clothing for the kids we know, but I fall 
into old habits sometimes too. For example, when my husband I were Christmas 
shopping, we chose a Fisher Price garage for our nephew and a Madame Alexander 
baby doll for my best friend's daughter. It was only later that we realized 
what a different set of messages -- and training grounds -- we gave to each 
child. Who knows? If my parents had given me a garage when I was two, maybe I'd 
be a mechanic instead of a writer. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gilder: It is amazing to encounter extremely intelligent people who believe 
after the last 50 years of revolutionary advances in biology, neurology, 
endocrinology, and physiology that the differences between the sexes manifested 
in all societies ever studied by anthropologists are environmental. The 
superior male performance in mathematics is not debatable. It is a fact. 
However, my daughter is far superior to me in mathematical aptitude and in 
mechanical aptitude, just as there are millions of men better than me in 
mathematics. This fact does not stop me from studying math, any more than the 
fact that several of the female participants in this wrangle know far more than 
me about computers stops me from studying computers and writing about them. The 
environment in the feminist argument becomes a force as all encompassing as 
biology itself. Why do human beings everywhere create an environment that makes 
women less aggressive and less mathematical? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raskin: As computers evolve it becomes less and less essential that you be 
mathematically inclined, or that you be an engineer, or even a computer nerd to 
make your "mark" on the computing world. Computers become a form of expression 
and exploration for everyone. Will more and more women enter into engineering, 
chip design, mathematics or data processing? I'm not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that part of the reason they've stayed away is not a matter of ability 
or inclination but of our social system. The nuclear family is probably the 
single biggest impediment to women entering traditional 9-to-5 jobs and 
sticking with them long enough to make an impact. Why do women dominate the 
teaching field? You think it's because they have some sort of biological 
inclination to teach the next generation? Hogwash! It's because you get summers 
off and the workday ends at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 I can be the editor of the largest computer magazine today because I stayed 
home with my three children and wrote free-lance articles about computing until 
they were all in school. And even now (ages 14, 12 and 8) I have an extensive 
and elaborate support network of relatives and paid help that get me and them 
through each day. My husband, great guy, and successful that he is, never had 
to balance the demands of family and professional life the way that I have. He 
writes books while I write magazine-length articles. And I tell him that in 
part, the reason I stick to magazines is because I can't think for more than 
5,000 words without being interrupted. I think many women are driven by such 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminer: And they say feminists have no sense of humor. I wasn't "throwing 
dirt" George, I was trying to provide some historical context for this 
discussion. (How is that changing the subject?) 
</P>
<P>
 Since you rely so heavily on "science," it seems useful to examine some 
historic scientific biases. I did not imply that you are a racist, though 
believing that the sexes are naturally different in character and intellectual 
ability does make you something of a biological determinist. (I'm surprised 
that you consider the term an epithet.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do I understand why you bother denying your belief in male superiority; 
it's evident in the assertion that men are more enterprising and more likely to 
be involved in leading-edge activities as well as more mathematical. Of course 
you assign superior social skills and emotional sensitivity to women; male 
supremacists usually do. Stressing women's superior capacity for nurturance and 
their relative lack of ambition and aggression is merely a way of stressing 
that they belong at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, I find assertions about female superiority as silly as assertions 
about male superiority. Women aren't "born communicators" any more than they're 
born to be stupid at math, any more than occupational segregation is natural. 
During World War I, when there was a shortage of male workers, women were 
deemed ideally suited to low-level bank jobs, because they were presumed to be 
neat and in possession of good characters and nimble fingers -- qualities that 
might have made them born blackjack dealers. How come it made them born 
secretaries? 
</P>
<P>
 During the Depression, when there was a surfeit of male workers, experts 
discovered that women were ill-suited to banking work after all, partly because 
they were lousy at math. White collar jobs, in particular, can be easily 
categorized as either stereotypically male or stereotypically female, depending 
on what job qualifications you choose to emphasize, and how. Executive 
positions might be considered naturally male, if they're said to require a 
penchant for hierarchical authority structures and for cool, analytic 
decision-making that puts the interests of the company above the feelings of 
individual employees. Or, executive positions might be considered naturally 
female if they're said to require a penchant for cooperation and nurturance, or 
even nagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Computing might just as easily have been labeled naturally feminine activity, 
since it requires typing skill. We might have pointed to men's fascination with 
computers as evidence of the feminization of the male work force. We might have 
focused on the phenomenon of men sitting at keyboards, getting soft. Instead 
we've fixated on men exploring cyberspace. What if we focus on virtual 
community? I've heard it said that women are less likely to engage in virtual 
community because it is relatively impersonal. But, the Home Shopping Network 
and the talk shows seem like mass, female virtual communities to me. Will women 
form different kinds of virtual communities? Perhaps. Gender stereotypes are 
often self-fulfilling; that's why they have such staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why don't I use a computer? I admit to being something of a Luddite 
(Luddites were male; how does George explain that?). I'm happy with my 
typewriter, and I like the process of typing and retyping because I get to know 
my work so well. I try to organize while I write, so I don't feel that much of 
a need to rearrange text, and because I want my writing to trace the 
development of my thought, I don't actually like the idea of rearranging. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, perhaps, I don't like what computers have done to editors. 
They're made it too easy for editors to rearrange text, for no particular 
reason. Editors have begun to see essays as collections of interchangeable 
parts -- paragraphs that can be thrown into the computer and spit out in any 
order. Computers have contributed greatly to the increasing incoherency of 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders: One advantage to working on the educational/kid end rather than the 
industry/grown-up end is that it is easier to see developmental processes 
occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 I am increasingly able to understand just why it is that the "computer gene" 
approach is so attractive to so many people, not just our friend George. It 
seems to fit so well with the evidence! After all, it rarely happens -- perhaps 
just about never happens -- that anyone forbids girls to use computers. Parents 
don't tell girls that only their brothers are allowed to use the family 
computer. Teachers don't restrict computer courses to boys only. In fact, we 
all know that parents and teachers often wish girls would be more involved in 
computing than they are. The conclusion that the boy/girl difference must be 
innate is so easy to reach, since nothing else seems to account for it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two major problems with this kind of thinking. The first is the most 
obvious. Computer ability can't be innate when some men are poor at computing 
and some women are superb at it. In fact, all educational research on gender 
differences in achievement in math, science and computing indicates that there 
are larger within-sex differences than between-sex differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The second explanation is to my mind less obvious but far more interesting. 
The reason we see different behavioral outcomes but do not see the causes 
leading up to them (thus concluding the cause must be genetic) is that the 
causes are so subtle and cumulative that they are terribly hard to identify. 
When a boy in a computer class makes a disparaging comment to a girl about what 
she's doing, and what's worse the teacher lets it pass unchallenged, a tiny 
influence has lodged in her mind about her computing ability. One incident 
alone is nothing, but many of them add up to a considerable force. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl who eventually decides in high school that computers aren't as 
interesting as she thought they were when she was younger surely doesn't 
understand the influences on the change in her thinking, but this doesn't mean 
she wasn't influenced. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Flynn: Karen, I'm relieved (though also saddened) to hear other women 
experience the fatigue you're describing. After covering the computer industry 
for eight years, I am soooo tired of having to prove I know something about 
computers every time I do an interview. I used to think it was just a test 
computer executives put all reporters through until I started going to press 
conferences with my husband, John Quain, who is a contributing editor at PC 
Magazine. The difference between how we're treated is really shocking -- people 
just assume he knows what he's talking about; whereas I have to earn their 
respect. It's quite exhausting. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Esther Dyson: The mere fact that there are greater differences within sexes 
than between has nothing to do with innateness. It is entirely possible 
(likely!) that there are two overlapping populations (women and men), but that 
the averages of those populations differ. Therefore you can predict 
statistically, but with no certainty in each individual case, for any 
particular characteristic such as partiality to computers. Such differences can 
of course be accentuated by nurture -- and probably are. As with most things, 
there's no single cause. (For what it's worth -- not much -- my mother is a 
mathematician, logic and set theory mostly.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaminer: Reviewing everyone's remarks, it strikes me that for all our talk 
about gender and computing, no one has mentioned all the gender and sex games 
that hackers play. There are a fair number of would-be transsexuals out there 
in cyberspace, guys pretending to be women. If I wanted to be glib, I'd suggest 
that men may be using computers to escape the gender stereotypes that tradition 
insists in imposing on them. If George Gilder is right, which I doubt, this 
means that the male brain has finally given men the means of escaping their own 
maleness.

THE CUTTING EDGE; PARANOIA YOUR PASSWORD? OK, BUT DON'T TELL ANYONE

<P>
 Computer consultant Peter Wayner changes his Internet password every week in 
order to foil hackers, and he hopes to send his electronic mail encrypted so 
prying eyes see only jabberwocky. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the fellow paranoid? Not really. If you use a computer mainly to write 
relatives and catalogue your compact disc collection, and you never run any 
software that didn't come shrink-wrapped off the shelf, security isn't your big 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the rest of the world, however, computer security is a 
pressingconcern. Mainframes and networks are fat targets for hackers, office 
PCs are subject to unauthorized use, and viruses can infect home computers 
through innocent-seeming shareware. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayner, for instance, knows that when he sends electronic mail from Baltimore 
to a client in Montreal, it may pass through 24 computer systems before it 
arrives, as easy to read the entire way as the message on the back of a 
postcard. He'd like to send his messages scrambled by an encryption program, 
but the odds are no one on the receiving end could decode them. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that, for most computer users, data protection is relatively 
easy, yet few take the steps needed to establish even rudimentary computer 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, an increasing number of computer programs come with built-indata 
security measures, including the new Macintosh System 7 operating system, 
Windows NT and Novell's Netware. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular corporate e-mail programs, such as cc:Mail, and widely used system 
utilities, such as PCTools, will let anyone encrypt a computer file so 
thoroughly that only the National Security Agency could crack the code without 
the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't important for letters to Mom," Wayner said, "but I think it 
isincreasingly essential in business. Corporate espionage is a very real 
problem, and many of the opponents are well-financed, technically adept and 
among the best at surveillance in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 This comes as no surprise to the operators of networks that are major targets 
of industrial espionage. These administrators, some of whom fend off dozens of 
anonymous probes a day, probably keep the telephone number of the federal 
Computer Emergency Response Team programmed into their digital cellular phones 
and have the loose-leaf edition of the Disaster Recovery Yellow Pages on the 
bedside table, open to the section on "Trauma Counseling." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the number of reported computer break-ins, they may have already 
ordered "smart" password cards for their employees. These credit card-size 
devices are synchronized to the computer and automatically generate new system 
passwords every few minutes. Even if someone intercepted a password -- as 
happened to tens of thousands of Internet users recently when their secret 
sign-ons were intercepted by illicit "sniffer" programs -- the password is 
quickly out of date. Boston University is issuing such password cards to its 
2,000 system users at a cost for each of about a nickel a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when people do fret about system security, the necessary precautions seem 
like just so much more of that extra work computers generate to make life more 
complicated, rather than simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 John Toon, a public affairs manager at the Georgia Institute of Technology, 
for example, remembers to regularly scan his computer files with anti-virus 
software, and he has configured his office system so that only an authorized 
few can upload files or access the most sensitive files. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows he should be changing system passwords more often than he does. 
Frankly, he says, it takes too long because of all the automated log-in scripts 
that have to be reconfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, a little useful paranoia can go a long way. While not everyone 
needs an automated security guard, there are some relatively painless 
precautions that a sensible computer user should consider. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passwords: Use a mixture of letters and numbers, and don't write it down. 
Don't use a word that can be found in the dictionary. Use a different password 
for every different telecommunications account or bulletin board you access. 
Change it as often as you can stand. Don't ever share it. This is especially 
important for small systems equipped with remote-access programs, such as 
PCAnywhere or Carbon Copy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encryption: Consider using the built-in encryption features of programs like 
PCTools, Norton Utilities or, on a network, Lotus Notes. Some of these programs 
will also "shred" files you wish to delete, so they can't be recovered. Even 
compressing files with Pkzip or another archiving program offers some basic 
protection. For more sophisticated users, AT&T's SecretAgent offers a range of 
file security and encryption features elaborate enough to satisfy anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Screen savers: If you use a personal computer in an office, install a 
password-protected screen saver so that your system will hide your work and 
lock itself if you step away from your desk for more than a few minutes. 
Install a floppy drive lock, so no one can bypass hard drive security to boot 
your system. Better yet, use a program like Norton Disklock, which prevents 
unauthorized users from getting access to your computer's hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Backups: Since hard drives sooner or later crash, backing up data is 
crucial, but it also helps with security. If your computer is stolen, if it 
goes up in flames, or if important files are corrupted as the result of 
mischief or malfunction, you can restore them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Digital signatures: Electronic mail is easily forged. Tampering with 
electronic documents takes no special skill and leaves no trace. RSA Data 
Security Inc. in Redwood City recently announced that it would start giving 
away on the Internet a program called RIPEM/SIG as a free tool to authenticate 
information and to verify who sent an electronic expense account, document or 
sales form by appending an unforgeable electronic signature. To get it, send 
e-mail to rsaref@rsa.com. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computers and faxing: Don't forget what happens to your computer data when 
you fax it. AT&T makes a product called Data Fax, which reduces any computer 
file, picture, spreadsheet or data base to an encrypted pattern of variegated 
black and white squares that resembles the static snow on a television screen. 
The recipient would scan the page into his computer, which would translate the 
markings back into the presumably intelligible original. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most effective way to protect a computer system from outside 
interference is to disconnect the phone line and lock the door. 
</P>
<P>
 That's easier said than done for systems connected to the Internet, a network 
of networks in which each system relies to some extent on the others. Since the 
National Science Foundation lifted restrictions on commercial use of the 
Internet two years ago, it has grown to encompass 25,000 interconnected 
networks in 61 countries, with more than 2.5 million computer systems and 
millions of users tied together in a fragile web of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a party line all over the world," said William R. Cheswick, a computer 
security expert at AT&T's Bell Laboratories. "Anyone can get on, and you need 
some protection." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard to find a company more worried about communications security 
than AT&T. On the average, someone tries to break into the research network at 
Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., 70 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the entire system has given Cheswick such a security workout that he 
has written a comprehensive manual (with colleague Steven M. Bellovin) called 
"Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the Wily Hacker." It will be 
published next month by Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "You certainly don't want people on the Internet watching what's going on in 
your business," he said. "I know of companies that have decided not to connect 
because of that possibility of electronic break-ins." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest business security problems, however, are not caused by outsiders 
trying to break in but by insiders poking around where they don't belong. A 
1993 Ernst & Young survey of corporate information officers found that they 
were far more worried about security breaches caused by their own people than 
about any wily hacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies cooperating on a joint project need to share data and share access 
to their systems, but they don't want to give a potential competitor any more 
access than necessary," Cheswick said. "We want to have firm assurances that 
they are stuck in one directory and can't get out."
