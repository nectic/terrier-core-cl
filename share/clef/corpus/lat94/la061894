U.S. WEIGHS BOOST IN FORCES IN S. KOREA AGAINST NORTH; DEFENSE: PRESSURE FOR 
NEW MILITARY MOVES GROWS. CONFUSION OVER CARTER STATEMENTS MAY DELAY DECISION. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration must decide soon on how rapidly to strengthen U.S. 
armed forces in South Korea to deter or, if necessary, repel an invasion by 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his senior national security advisers are considering a 
package prepared by Defense Secretary William J. Perry that outlines options 
ranging from a modest increase in support troops to deployment of dozens of 
additional bombers and warships. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure for new military moves has been mounting. Although Congress has 
generally supported Clinton's response to North Korea's refusal to allow 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, some key Democrats and Republicans have 
begun to complain publicly that Clinton is not doing enough to prepare for 
possible war. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said any decision would probably be delayed as the 
Administration tries to untangle the confusion resulting from apparently 
erroneous statements on U.S. intentions made by former President Jimmy Carter 
at the end of his visit to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, traveling as a private citizen, told North Korean President Kim Il 
Sung that the Clinton Administration was suspending its drive for U.N. 
sanctions while it assessed a new compromise proposed Thursday by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, had already vowed to keep pressing for economic sanctions in 
response to North Korea's defiance of international safeguards against nuclear 
weapons proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton warned reporters Friday not to "overreact" to Carter's statement. "I 
gave my position yesterday and it hasn't changed," the President told reporters 
on a trip to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official acknowledged Friday that the Administration 
is worried that Carter's assertion to Kim could give other countries at the 
United Nations an excuse to drag their feet in considering the sanctions 
proposal, easing pressure on North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one reason why we moved . . . so quickly yesterday with a statement to 
say we are proceeding with consultations on sanctions at the U.N.," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Administration officials said they would hold up any further action on the 
North Korean offer until after today, when Carter leaves the North Korean 
capital of Pyongyang and can talk with them on a secure telephone line to 
provide more details of his conversations with Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Robert L. Gallucci, the Administration's point man on Korean 
issues, said no major decisions are likely until early next week, "assuming 
that we have good conversations, clear conversations with President Carter 
tomorrow or Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the military package presented to Clinton included 
these options: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sending more military support personnel to South Korea to make it easier for 
the services to deploy more combat and logistic troops to reinforce troops now 
in place, should North Korea invade the South. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deploying up to 40 more warplanes to the region, including F-117 
radar-evading Stealth bombers in South Korea and B-52 long-range bombers on 
Guam. The Navy would send an extra aircraft carrier to the area. And the Army 
and Marines would beef up their forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Making preparations for rapid deployment of substantial numbers of ground 
troops to the area as reinforcements, if war should break out. Gen. Gary E. 
Luck, U.S. commander in South Korea, has said he would need 400,000 more 
troops, besides the 37,000 Americans in position now, if North Korea were to 
invade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has also been taking steps to modernize existing forces and 
bolster supplies of spare parts and ammunition to facilitate the arrival of 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
have sent Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea, along with 
artillery-locating radar and dozens of Apache helicopters, intended to replace 
aging Cobra gunships that U.S. forces had been using. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, except for the addition of the Patriots, the bulk of the U.S. effort 
has been modest and barely visible. And some steps that Perry had said earlier 
he would take -- such as bolstering allied ammunition supplies -- have still 
not been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials have argued that they have kept the effort 
low-key for two reasons: They want to avoid provoking the North Koreans, who 
have warned that the mere imposition of sanctions might set off a war. And they 
want to mollify South Korea, which fears that a real mobilization would panic 
the country and hurt the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite North Korea's strident rhetoric, U.S. intelligence officers have 
reported that they have seen no unusual movements of troops or equipment in 
North Korea that might suggest that the country is gearing up for an invasion. 
"Everything looks normal," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration has been under mounting pressure from conservatives to 
beef up U.S. forces in South Korea, particularly in the face of North Korea's 
increasing threats of war as the United States began to press for U.N. 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some private military analysts, such as Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon 
Korean strategist, have warned that an invasion by the North would result in 
enormous allied casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of congressional unease over the U.S.-North Korean confrontation, 
the Senate voted, 93 to 3, Thursday to urge Clinton to bolster U.S. forces in 
South Korea to a level where they could "deter and if necessary repel an 
attack" from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 What is propelling the Administration most, however, is timing. U.S. 
commanders in the field figure that it would take at least several months to 
prepare allied forces there for reinforcements and ultimately to deploy extra 
troops and equipment -- and the clock is ticking fast. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, is forcing the Administration to think about its real 
objectives in pursuing the dispute with North Korea. "The fundamental question 
still is whether the Administration believes the nuclear issue in North Korea 
is worth transitioning to war over," said Robert RisCassi, who once served as 
commander of U.S. forces in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Administration will try to answer that question, once and 
for all, in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials spent much of Friday trying to distance 
themselves from Carter. "President Carter carried no message from us, no 
message from the President . . . neither concessions nor threats," Gallucci, a 
State Department official, said, told reporters at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the usually circumspect Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, did not try to hide his astonishment. "It's a new 
kind of diplomacy, let's put it that way," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea offered, in essence, to allow international weapons inspectors to 
remain at its major nuclear site, rather than expelling them as it had 
threatened, and to cooperate with them in the future in exchange for broad 
political and economic talks with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said it might accept the North Korean proposal but only if the 
North Koreans agreed to freeze their nuclear program, stop refueling its 
reactor and cooperate fully with inspectors. It also wants to make sure that 
the offer is genuine before reaching any agreement.

COLUMN ONE; A PAINFUL LESSON FOR A GAY TEACHER; L.A. DISTRICT HAS SUPPORT 
GROUPS AND A POLICY AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. BUT STUDENT TAUNTS DROVE HIM OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He was walking downstairs with a crowd of students during an earthquake drill 
when he heard the word. Soon, the stairwell seemed to be filled with it. 
"Faggot! Faggot!" the teen-agers jeered, exulting in the taunt, encircling him 
with their scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, when the drill was over and the students had filed back into the 
building, Martin Bridge sat alone at the edge of the football field, staring 
into space, not moving. He felt dazed, sure of only one thing -- that he could 
not endure much more. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, ever since a favorite student flippantly asked him in class if he 
was gay, the slurs had haunted Bridge's days at Los Angeles' Crenshaw High 
School, where he taught English. He would hear them in class, in the hallways, 
from his own students and from kids he had never seen before. The epithets 
seemed to follow him everywhere, hurled at him in defiance and derision. 
</P>
<P>
 It had not always been so. Bridge arrived at Crenshaw two years ago, a former 
television game show producer spurred by the impending death of his partner to 
do something more meaningful with his life. Maybe, he thought, he could get 
teen-agers excited about literature, about drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he was popular. His students, particularly the girls, liked his classes. 
They called him Mr. B and confided in him. He was named teacher of the month. 
His evaluations were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loved him," muses Toni Little, a fellow teacher and friend of Bridge. 
"That's the sad part. They really did adore him. . . . They had a friend in him 
and they found out he was gay and they turned on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bridge is gone now. In April, not long after the stairwell scene, he went 
on sick leave, at half pay. He has since filed a discrimination complaint with 
the school district's affirmative action office and a workers' compensation 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 As the days have slipped by to this, the final week of the school year, many 
of his colleagues and students have mourned his departure, saddened that they 
have lost a good teacher. Yet in dissecting his ordeal, they offer no single 
explanation, no simple solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinions swirl: It was an isolated case that exploded out of control 
because of Bridge's inexperience. It could have happened anywhere in the 
chaotic Los Angeles school system, where teachers are in a daily battle for 
control of the classroom. Kids will seize on anything to torment their teachers 
-- this time, homosexuality just happened to be the weapon. It was the 
administration's fault. It was the fault of the faculty, of the school 
district. You can't expect 16- and 17-year-olds to be tolerant when society 
signals so much hostility to gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way to explain this," says Yvonne Noble, Crenshaw's principal. 
"Most of (the students) liked him and yet they allowed him to be harmed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to most school systems in the country, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District is decidedly gay-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has an official policy of non-discrimination against gays. 
Support groups for gay students are in place at about half of the system's 49 
high schools. Just a few weeks ago, the district sponsored its first gay 
student prom. The school board has designated June as Gay and Lesbian Pride 
Month and its "Educating for Diversity" policy calls for classroom discussions 
about homophobia as well as the contributions of gays in history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 One only has to spend some time talking to students, however, to see that the 
reality on campus is in many ways out of step with official policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crenshaw, teen-agers describe "fag" as a favorite insult, used frequently 
and indiscriminately. Even those who say they don't care if someone is 
homosexual indicate that anti-gay sentiment is widespread at the 2,300-pupil 
high school, which draws its student body from economically mixed communities, 
predominantly black and Latino. Many students come from homes where 
conservative religious views on homosexuality hold sway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to frown on, being gay. It's just the way people around here 
are raised," says a junior, attempting to explain, as he waits for his bus, why 
some of his schoolmates felt so free to deride Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses, then adds, "It's not a dislike. It's a hate of gays." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he heard classmates snicker in the halls as Bridge walked by. Girls would 
come to Bridge's defense, scolding, "That's not nice," remembers the junior. 
"But not the boys. It goes against what people see as macho." 
</P>
<P>
 Another junior -- one of the girls who tried to hush the slurs -- says Bridge 
was her favorite teacher. "We all liked him," she says. "If we explained a 
problem to him, he'd listen." She misses him. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are not so sorry to see him go. "I don't like gay people because 
they're gay," declares a senior, a slight grin of bravado on his face. "I feel 
that being gay is not normal. . . . I feel threatened by gays." 
</P>
<P>
 He had Bridge as a substitute teacher in one of his classes this year. He says 
he discussed Bridge's "feminine voice" with his friends. "I think I may have 
verbally assaulted him. I don't know if he heard me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" boasts the teen-ager, who says he walked out of the class because 
Bridge is gay. "I insult everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what they think of gay people, a couple of other students suggest that 
homosexuals be shipped off to an island or castrated. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10th-grader, overhearing the comments, chimes in: "I think gays have a right 
to be gay. You're just acting out of ignorance!" 
</P>
<P>
 Retort the boys, "Are you gay?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to see why many of Bridge's students liked him. He is articulate 
and intense, as tightly wound as a teen-ager. He can talk for hours with barely 
a pause, skittering from subject to subject. His energy demands attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like the worst experiences I've had happen to me have been in public 
schools," he says, standing in the doorway of his small apartment on the 
Westside of Los Angeles, savoring the breeze. Talking about his last months at 
Crenshaw makes him uneasy; he feels trapped again. The open door is a comfort 
of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Rapid City, S.D., the son of an ironworker, he was often taunted 
in school. Sissy was the favorite word then. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd way, his youthful experiences drew him back to the classroom. "High 
school was such a painful experience for me. I thought if I went back I could 
heal something in myself if I had a positive experience." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while he did. Then the old wounds were torn open. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 35 now, no more immune to anti-gay invective then he was as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Then) I just walked away ashamed. And I have to say it's very similar to how 
I treated this. I just became ashamed again. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you deal with it," he says of the name-calling. "I can deal 
with it in myself and then at a certain point I say that's enough. I've been 
called fag enough. I've been called it every day for 2 1/2 months." 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment began to plague Bridge early this year, after one of his 
students -- quoting another teacher -- blurted out a question about Bridge's 
sexuality in an American literature class. (The teacher denies making any 
remarks about Bridge.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bridge had always avoided questions about his personal life or answered them 
obliquely. If a student asked him if was married, he would say he had been for 
five years -- the amount of time he had been with his partner, Ned Penney, who 
died of AIDS a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 To his student, Bridge replied that the topic was inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day another boy in the same class asked him in crude terms whether he 
engaged in anal sex. "Whatever I do, I do it with a condom," Bridge shot back, 
trying to defuse the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work. The derisive comments and questions continued, gradually 
escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 Students he had never seen before would yank open his classroom door and shout 
epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 A strange girl in a softball uniform confronted him in the hall, mockingly 
striking a suggestive pose. "You want some?" she teased. "No, you wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a relatively small number of students were involved, the incidents 
were occurring every day. He suspended several students from class. He confided 
in a few teachers at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But he kept much of it to himself. For one thing, he did not want to talk 
about being a homosexual. He was also embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I was losing control and somehow once again it was my fault, right? . 
. . For being gay. Somehow again I had failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after the stairwell episode, he went to Noble, the principal, telling 
her about some of the incidents. She offered to talk to his students. But he 
said no, thinking that a visit from the principal would signal that he could no 
longer run his classes without reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to feel as though he were in a private nightmare from which he had 
only one escape: to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulling it over now, he is not even sure he wants to continue teaching high 
school. He laments that the school system has not provided enough support for 
gay teachers, that it is too timid to challenge anti-gay attitudes and confront 
parents uneasy about having their children taught by open homosexuals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Gays and lesbians may have come a long way in the workplace outside of 
education. But in education, it's still the 1950s," he says. "We form our own 
little groups to pat each other on the back and say we're OK and network. But 
the truth is, in the classroom we're still scared to death of dealing with the 
homophobia." 
</P>
<P>
 On another day he muses: "I don't blame the kids. I used to blame their 
parents, and I'm not sure I do that anymore. I think I blame gays and lesbians 
because they have chosen to remain in the closet. They have chosen the path of 
least resistance and that has brought us to a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, says Noble, she doesn't think it was so much that Bridge was gay as 
that the kids discovered how to get to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they found a way to push his button, they pushed his button," Noble 
observes. "Students who wanted to be mean were just mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Mean they can be. These days, teachers say rudeness and profanity are 
routinely directed their way. Students make racial comments and threatening 
remarks. They stomp out of class and spew obscenities. They will zero in on a 
teacher's soft spots like heat-seeking missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, Noble harbors no illusions about what it's like to be gay at 
Crenshaw. She speaks of counseling gay kids who were harassed and points to the 
difficulty she has had trying to launch a Crenshaw branch of the school 
district's support program for gay students, known as Project 10. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was assistant principal, Noble says, she approached various Crenshaw 
teachers about sponsoring a gay group. The teachers all declined, one by 
responding, "I'm not a faggot." 
</P>
<P>
 Even putting up a display to observe the school district's Gay and Lesbian 
Pride Month was problematic. As an exhibit -- the school's first -- was being 
arranged last week, Noble says, students walked by muttering, "Why are you 
putting that mess up?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an issue that is very sensitive. I can't just act according to my own 
personal acceptance," Noble says. "It's a matter of being sensitive without 
being in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 After Bridge went on leave, Noble spoke to two of his classes. "I talked to 
them about how there were students who were verbally abusive and discounted his 
dignity and his value as a person. . . . They were very quiet and a lot of them 
came to apologize afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of what happened to Bridge, Noble thinks there may be a support 
group for gay students at Crenshaw next year. A "values" program for 
ninth-graders is also in the works and it will include acceptance of people's 
differences -- homosexuality among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she confesses, "I don't know what I can do to make sure it never 
happens again." 
</P>
<P>
 Other faculty members grumble that not enough was done once the harassment 
came to light, that the issue was simply swept under the rug. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarks one teacher, "This problem has not been resolved. Nobody has educated 
(the students). Nobody has said, 'This is not the way it should be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the gay-friendly resolutions adopted by the Los Angeles school 
district, gay teachers say they remain mostly in the closet. And school 
officials acknowledge that the policies haven't necessarily filtered down to 
the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making progress unevenly throughout the district," said Jeff Horton, an 
openly gay school board member who spent most of his teaching career at 
Crenshaw. What happened to Bridge could have happened anywhere in the sprawling 
system, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Crenshaw, he adds: "All along the school should have been more proactive in 
dealing with this issue. . . . And I'm ashamed to say, I didn't. I was closeted 
when I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bridge called Horton about his troubles, Horton says he wasn't really 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things about teaching at Crenshaw, like most schools in Los 
Angeles, that are difficult," Horton concedes. For many white teachers, such as 
him and Bridge, there are cultural gaps to be spanned with minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he says, high school students in general "will use anything to get 
to you. If it's not homosexuality, it's something else. I've seen teachers 
driven out for lots of reasons. . . . If you haven't figured out a way to blunt 
their challenges and attempts to distract you from teaching, it's going to be 
miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Uribe, a Fairfax High School teacher and the openly lesbian founder 
of Project 10, says she receives five to 10 calls a month from teachers all 
over the state complaining about being harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains a closeted middle school teacher in the Los Angeles system: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last acceptable prejudice. . . . Even at this young age, they really 
feel we don't have any rights. That is why I don't come out."

SIMPSON HELD AFTER WILD CHASE; HE'S CHARGED WITH MURDER OF EX-WIFE, FRIEND; 
CRIME: FOOTBALL LEGEND HAD AGREED TO SURRENDER BUT DISAPPEARED, PROMPTING 
MANHUNT. CAR IS SPOTTED IN ORANGE COUNTY; PURSUIT ENDS IN DRIVEWAY OF HIS 
BRENTWOOD HOME.

<P>
 O.J. Simpson, the football great who rose from the mean streets of San 
Francisco to international celebrity, was arrested Friday for the murders of 
his ex-wife and a male friend after leading police on a gripping, two-hour 
chase through the rush-hour freeways of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic capture of one of the best-known and best-loved public figures in 
America came shortly before 9 p.m., about 10 hours after he was to have turned 
himself in to Los Angeles police. Simpson's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, said 
Simpson, 46, had agreed to surrender earlier, but bolted at the last minute 
with Al Cowlings, a longtime friend and former teammate at USC and with the 
Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive manhunt involving scores of law enforcement officers ended in the 
cobblestone driveway of Simpson's Tudor-style mansion, as Los Angeles Police 
Department officers in bulletproof vests converged on the white Ford Bronco in 
which Simpson and Cowlings had fled. 
</P>
<P>
 As the truck sat parked, its hazard lights blinking silently in the balmy June 
night, Cowlings got out of the driver's seat and walked into the house. Then, 
for nearly an hour, a distraught Simpson sat inside the truck, reportedly 
cradling a blue-steel revolver and demanding to speak to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of supporters gathered in the upscale neighborhood, chanting "Free 
O.J.," and rocking police cars. Meanwhile, the LAPD Special Weapons and Tactics 
team and negotiators surrounded the house, eventually coaxing Simpson out of 
the vehicle by cellular telephone. He put the gun down and emerged about 8:50 
p.m. carrying a framed family photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson went into the house, used the bathroom, called his mother and drank a 
glass of juice, authorities said. He was then transported by police motorcade 
to Parker Center for booking and transported to Men's Central Jail. Cowlings 
was booked on suspicion of harboring a fugitive. He was being held on $250,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic arrest, broadcast live on national television, capped a tragic 
weeklong drama that began with the slayings of Simpson's ex-wife, 35-year-old 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman, a 25-year-old Brentwood waiter 
whom she knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found stabbed to death early Monday morning 
outside her Brentwood condo. Police sources said the two were slain sometime 
after 10 p.m. Sunday as her two small children slept inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Police Department had refused all week to label Simpson a 
suspect, and Simpson's lawyers said he was innocent, sources inside the LAPD 
made it clear from the outset that he was the focus of their investigation. The 
former college and professional football star was briefly handcuffed at his 
mansion Monday afternoon and taken to police headquarters for questioning. He 
was later released, and remained free as evidence mounted against him day by 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, detectives had concluded their case, recommending that Simpson be 
charged with two counts of first-degree murder. The charges, which include a 
"special circumstance" of multiple killings, could bring him the death penalty 
if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Cmdr. David J. Gascon said Simpson had been scheduled to 
turn himself in to police at 11 a.m. Friday, with arraignment scheduled for 
that afternoon in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But 45 minutes, and then an hour, ticked by and Simpson was nowhere to be 
seen. Finally, just before 2 p.m., police held a news conference to announce 
that Simpson had officially become a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a wanted murder suspect," Gascon said tersely, "and we will go find 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Simpson -- who had been dogged by 
crowds of reporters and cameramen for most of the week -- had managed to escape 
authorities, who had felt confident that someone so famous would never attempt 
to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, Simpson had appeared to be sequestered in his Brentwood 
home, emerging only to visit his children and to attend Nicole Simpson's 
funeral in Orange County. After the services Thursday, a man resembling Simpson 
was photographed ducking past hordes of news reporters into the home -- 
escorted by an off-duty LAPD sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said Friday, however, that the man who resembled Simpson was a 
decoy, who was under the escort of LAPD Sgt. Dennis L. Sebenik, a 25-year 
veteran who works in the LAPD Harbor Division. Police said they want to 
interview Sebenik. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to department leaders, Sebenik was serving as a member of Simpson's 
security detail even as police were investigating the former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebenik said he manages a "legitimate security company" and had been hired to 
provide security for Simpson. He would not comment on why an off-duty Los 
Angeles police officer was protecting a man widely reported to be a suspect in 
a double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said department officials were investigating Sebenik's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to rush in here and defend anything that might have occurred, 
but I'm not going to rush to judgment either," Gascon said. "We have no 
interest in excusing what is obviously going to be a difficult situation to 
explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Simpson had been told Friday morning that he would have to 
surrender that day. Because of Simpson's "fragile" emotional state, Shapiro 
said he had asked several doctors to join him at the San Fernando Valley home 
of Simpson friend Robert Kardashian, where a heavily sedated Simpson had spent 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Simpson had spent the morning in the throes of what appeared to 
be a suicidal depression. He updated his will, the lawyer said, called his 
mother and his children and gave three sealed letters to a friend at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 One, addressed "To whom it may concern," reiterated Simpson's denial that he 
had any part in the murders, and reflected his anguish at the events of the 
past week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of my life, and feel I have done most of the right things," the 
letter said. "So why do I end up like this? I can't go on. No matter what the 
outcome, people will look and point. I can't take that. I can't subject my 
children to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said the plan for Simpson's surrender had not been an unusual one, 
adding that he had made similar arrangements for other clients in previous 
cases. But the surrender, he said, had been delayed for nearly an hour by a 
medical examination of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, impatient about the delays, called the house to say that they were 
coming to make the arrest. But Shapiro said he did not pass on that news to 
Simpson, who was with Cowlings in another part of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 It was apparently at that point that Simpson and Cowlings slipped away, 
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, the afternoon was a frenzy of police activity and public 
astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown bars people watched television sets, once primed for the 
championship basketball series, now tuned only to the breaking news story. At 
the Spectrum Club in Santa Monica, exercisers pedaled stationary bikes to TV 
sets tuned to coverage of O.J. Simpson's temporary disappearance. Downtown 
streets were deserted. Even West Hollywood's Sunset Strip, generally 
bumper-to-bumper with night-clubbers and party-goers, was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard, 15 television monitors were tuned to the 
Simpson story, and customers were transfixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's paralyzed our business," said manager Gary Wilde. "They're just standing 
there in awe." 
</P>
<P>
 What they saw was nothing less than the running to ground of one of the most 
famous murder suspects in U.S. history. Every move was chronicled on live 
television, a jump-cut documentary of an icon's demise: now he was reported 
missing, now feared dead, now alive and headed south on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the police could finish announcing that he had disappeared, the drama 
had shifted back to the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 2 p.m. -- at almost the same moment that authorities were 
announcing to an audibly shocked press corps that Simpson was a fugitive -- 
Nicole Simpson's grieving father rushed from his daughter's tile-roofed 
condominium, begging a teen-ager to dial 911. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Sgt. Bob Brounstein said a man claiming to be Simpson had called the 
house at least twice, saying he was coming over to the scene of the murders to 
kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go join Nicole," the caller allegedly said. But Simpson never 
turned up at the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a big mess," Sgt. Doug Abney told an anxious crowd. "This is a false 
alarm." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just before 6 p.m., Highway Patrol officers spotted Cowlings' white Ford 
Bronco heading south through Orange County on Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 A phalanx of police vehicles took off in pursuit, blocking traffic on the 
freeway and entrance ramps as Simpson and Cowlings wound their way through 
Orange County and back to Simpson's Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 During the pursuit, LAPD Detective Fred Lange, the lead investigator on the 
case, contacted Cowlings on the phone, and was told that Simpson was in the 
back seat with a gun to his head, that he would never surrender and that he 
wanted to see his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 As TV news choppers broadcast the astonishing spectacle -- the white Bronco 
slowly wending its way across Southern California, a cadre of 20 
black-and-white squad cars in its wake -- traffic came to a halt along the 
freeways from Disneyland to Los Angeles and commuters jammed the overpasses to 
cheer and wave at Simpson as he passed. Some held up huge signs exhorting, "Go 
O.J." Meanwhile, scores of callers from across the country pleaded with him 
over the airwaves on KNX-AM news radio to pull over and turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance of Simpson threatened to create a public relations nightmare 
for the LAPD and the district attorney's office, whose decision not to arrest 
the ex-football star earlier had been second-guessed in some quarters. Police 
sources had been saying all week that the evidence against Simpson was strong 
enough to warrant his arrest, and yet the department held off, hoping to build 
an airtight case before taking him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said the department was "very unhappy" with Simpson's disappearance and 
stressed that police had not given Simpson special treatment in their handling 
of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who described himself as "upset and angry" about 
Simpson's disappearance, also defended the Police Department's performance, 
saying investigators had done a commendable job at building the case against 
the former athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four days after the killings, police sources say, evidence steadily 
mounted linking Simpson to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodstains on the walkway where the bodies were found matched Simpson's blood 
type, they said, and two bloodstained gloves were recovered, one at the scene, 
its match outside his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Polices sources also said that a trail of blood drops stretched across 
Simpson's cobblestone driveway. And Friday, they said that bloodstains inside 
his home matched Nicole Simpson's blood type. The blood evidence appeared to 
figure against Simpson but is not necessarily conclusive, sources said. Even 
the rarest blood types are shared by many people. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said that a murder weapon, which he described as a "substantial 
knife," had yet to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 It was shortly after midnight Sunday that the blood-soaked bodies of Nicole 
Simpson and Goldman were found sprawled on a Spanish-tile walkway outside her 
Brentwood condominium. Coroner's investigators said both their throats had been 
slit, and their corpses bore multiple stab wounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, police began looking for Simpson, who, they later learned, had 
taken an 11:45 p.m. flight to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Notified of his ex-wife's death, Simpson returned to Los Angeles, arriving 
shortly before noon. 
</P>
<P>
 As police bore in on Simpson during their investigation, he changed lawyers, 
hiring Shapiro on Tuesday. But Shapiro said his client grew increasingly 
distraught and began undergoing treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference Friday, Shapiro said he and Simpson's doctors feared 
that the football great might attempt suicide. One of Simpson's last acts 
before disappearing had been to write the three letters to his children, his 
mother, who was hospitalized in San Francisco Friday night, and to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the letters to his children and mother were not released, close 
friend Kardashian, who joined Shapiro at the news conference, read the public 
letter to a hushed group of reporters on live television. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, Simpson expressed regret for the life that he would never have with his 
current girlfriend and thanked a list of former teammates, golfing buddies and 
good friends. He acknowledged the much-publicized fights with his ex-wife and 
their recent decision not to reconcile after years of turmoil, but 
characterized them as the natural ups and downs of long relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the news media to leave his children in peace. And he denied that he 
was the man who committed the brutal killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with Nicole's murder," Simpson wrote. "I love her, 
always have and always will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't feel sorry for me," the letter concluded. "I have had a great life, 
great friends. Please think of the real O.J., and not this lost person." The

LAWYER DETAILS SIMPSON'S DAY IN GRIPPING TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN and JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the central act in a week of high drama, a spine-tingling glimpse at 
the torment haunting America's best-known fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 When O.J. Simpson's lawyer, under fire for failing to surrender his client, 
summoned the media to Century City on Friday afternoon, there was no hint that 
it would be anything more than a curt denial that he knew of the ex-football 
star's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, over the next half an hour, attorney Robert Shapiro produced a 
remarkably detailed account of the hours leading up to Simpson's disappearance, 
all the while defending his own reputation. In what was surely one of the most 
captivating news conferences ever on live TV, it also became apparent that 
Simpson's life -- by his own hand-written account -- could be headed for a sad, 
tortured end. 
</P>
<P>
 As a normally jaded press corps listened in rapt silence, the unflappable 
Shapiro strode to the polished oak podium in a slate-blue double-breasted suit, 
and without any introduction, said: "O.J., wherever you are, for the sake of 
your family, for the sake of your children, surrender immediately . . . please 
do it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, who first gained fame for successfully defending adult film star 
Linda Lovelace on cocaine charges, then launched into a flawless description of 
how a seemingly suicidal Simpson sneaked away just minutes before police came 
to arrest him for the June 12 murders of his ex-wife and her waiter friend. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending Thursday's funeral for Nicole Brown Simpson, Shapiro 
disclosed, the 46-year-old former running back chose not to return to his 
Brentwood home. Instead he was taken to a sprawling and secluded San Fernando 
Valley residence, where Simpson was sedated and kept under the supervision of 
psychiatrists and physicians due to his "frail and fragile emotional state." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I was thinking," Shapiro said, "and what I told the police department 
and the D.A. was that he was suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
 About 8:30 a.m. on Friday, Shapiro said, he was contacted at home by 
authorities with word that Simpson would be charged with the two murders and 
was expected to surrender by 11 a.m. Shapiro immediately traveled to the 
hideaway and broke the news just as Simpson was waking. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime suspect was examined again by his internist, whom Shapiro said had 
found an inflamed lymph node under one of Simpson's armpits. While Shapiro kept 
in touch with Los Angeles police every 15 minutes, Simpson called his personal 
lawyer and updated his will. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never concerned he might run," Shapiro said in his own defense, 
explaining that he had made similar arrangements to surrender Erik Menendez on 
murder charges several years ago. "I believe having four physicians there and 
his best friend -- a former professional football player -- there's no way we 
could have been better prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 When 11 a.m. came and went, anxious police officials called Shapiro, saying 
they were no longer going to wait for Simpson to arrive at Parker Center. At 
that point, authorities told the lawyer, "We must announce O.J. as a fugitive, 
wherever he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers asked for the address and said they would send a patrol car to pick 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Simpson was downstairs with former USC and Buffalo Bills teammate Al 
Cowlings, "wailing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the attorney said he never tipped his client that police were on the 
way, Simpson and Cowlings stealthily slipped out of the large house while 
Shapiro and the doctors waited upstairs in a conference room. Shapiro said that 
Simpson was not carrying his wallet or any identification, although he had been 
given $60 in cash to help cover his expenses in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt worse in my professional career," said Shapiro, 51. He added: 
"I've always kept my word and my clients have always kept their word." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations were another twist in what already had been an emotional 
roller-coaster -- a week of anonymous accusations and vehement denials that had 
stirred feelings of anger, grief and betrayal among an entranced public. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more, a bombshell that Shapiro had saved for last. Simpson, the 
lawyer said, had taken the time Friday morning to put his agony in writing. 
There were three letters, one to his children, one to his mother, and one for 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would these contain the first statements from Simpson about the 
accusations, but the one meant for public consumption would be read -- right 
there and then. 
</P>
<P>
 "To whom it may concern," began Robert Kardashian, a businessman and lifelong 
confidante of Simpson's who had been counseling the Hall of Famer during the 
past few days. 
</P>
<P>
 It was written with black pen, the letters printed on white, unlined paper. 
The pages were filled with crossed-out words, marked with corrections and 
addenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder," 
Kardashian continued reading to his astonished audience. "I loved her, always 
have, and always will. If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson acknowledged that there been stormy times in the past, noting a widely 
publicized 1989 New Year's fight that left his then-wife bloodied and bruised. 
Despite his earlier admissions that police had been summoned numerous times to 
their home, he characterized the dispute as an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike what has been written in the press, Nicole and I had a great 
relationship for most of our lives together," Simpson wrote. "Like all 
long-term relationships, we had a few downs and ups." At one point, he even 
characterized himself as a "battered husband." 
</P>
<P>
 He then thanked all the people who had filled his life with joy, referring to 
several dozen friends, former teammates and golfing buddies -- most of them 
just by their first names. As he went on, it sounded more and more like Simpson 
was saying goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things," he said. "So 
why do I end up like this? I can't go on. No matter what the outcome, people 
will look and point. I can't take that. I can't subject my children to that. 
This way they can move on and go on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Kardashian had finished reading, reporters began firing questions 
at Shapiro, who fielded them in an unflinching voice. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Simpson leave the house unnoticed? "The house has a front door, the 
house has a back door," the lawyer dead-panned. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the letter a suicide note? 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking with the four doctors," he said, "clearly that was their 
interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 Do you still think he is innocent? 
</P>
<P>
 "Next question," Shapiro barked. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Kardashian briefly showed the letter to reporters, then folded it 
in thirds and tucked it in the breast pocket of his sports jacket. Those close 
enough to get a glimpse saw this salutation: Peace and love, O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the O, he had drawn a happy face.

COMMENTARY; CHASE OUTRAN THE USUAL TV THEATRICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was matchless and amazing, at once a wildly improbable scenario that 
critics of crime movies would find unbelievable and an addictive live 
television drama that you couldn't pull away from. 
</P>
<P>
 A fleet of police cruisers was tailing the white Ford Bronco on an Orange 
County freeway. For once, viewers weren't enduring gratuitous crime coverage 
from local news. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was former football great O.J. Simpson's most memorable 
zig-zagging run, a murder suspect's desperate flight captured live by an armada 
of seven Los Angeles news choppers streaking the skies like ghosts of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys, guys, please stop," KCBS-TV Channel 2 sportscaster Jim Hill begged 
Simpson and Al Cowlings, the apparent driver and the fugitive's close friend, 
in an appeal from the studio that was being simulcast on KNX radio. "If you are 
listening, put on your emergency brakes, pull over to the side." Later another 
pro, Simpson's friend, Vince Evans, added his own plea on Channel 2, sobbing: 
"In Jesus' name, just stop, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the pursued Ford Bronco continued west on the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the entire day had been a video speedway of perilous potholes and 
hairpin curves, the likes of which had never been observed before. If there 
were ever an example of television being historic as well as instantaneous, 
this was it. Although stumbling earlier, for much of the day the people on 
television did themselves -- and the public -- proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Television is often accused of presenting even the most sorrowful events as 
entertainment, something to amuse rather than to inform and enlighten. Friday 
evening was refreshingly different. Things moved so swiftly as the evening wore 
on that there was no time for the hyperbole and the dramatic titles and 
musically backed choreography one so often associates with live television, no 
time for the made-for-TV drama. And no need. Step by riveting step, the 
excitement of the chase and the ache of the anguish were before us on the 
screen, as the media, police, Simpson and others became role players in this 
suspenseful and tragic adventure drama as if following a script. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, the script was reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Simpson had been charged with the murders of his former 
wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. Then he had 
gone back on an agreement to turn himself in to police. Yet as the Bronco 
traveled north on the San Diego Freeway, with Simpson reportedly holding a gun 
to his head as if threatening suicide, people stood on overpasses and cheered 
him and the unconventional motorcade that passed beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Whooping it up for an accused murderer fleeing from police? "It is just a 
macabre curiosity that is driving them," Channel 2 anchor Michael Tuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 2 interviewed rooters at one of the overpasses, and the compassion 
most of them expressed for Simpson, as if he were a hero on the lam from the 
forces of evil, was a testament to his enormous popularity and the weird 
unpredictability of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the incredible chase ended benignly, with Simpson's vehicle 
returning to his Brentwood mansion, pulling into the driveway and stopping. 
"There is a standoff," said Channel 2 chopper reporter Bob Tur. "So far, Mr. 
Simpson is still in the vehicle." A little later: "All right, the door is 
opening," KNBC-TV Channel 4 anchor Paul Moyer reported. And out came Cowlings, 
who later appeared to be negotiating with Simpson and police. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time night had fallen on the scene, throngs of onlookers had been 
caught on TV gathering outside the big house as if celebrating some kind of 
gala. "Juice! Juice!" some yelled in support of Simpson. "Even children have 
come up here," said disbelieving KTTV-TV Channel 11 reporter Jane Wells. "It is 
absolutely bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 KABC-TV Channel 7 anchor Harold Greene said earlier: "O.J. Simpson has come 
home on this Friday night." As it turned out, Simpson hadn't come home to die. 
"Unbelievable great news," Tur reported about 8:50 p.m. from somewhere in the 
darkness. "O.J. Simpson is in custody." 
</P>
<P>
 It was extraordinary television that ended well for Simpson and newscasters. 
But earlier, with team coverage breaking out all over the place, it had been 
television doing business as usual. With Simpson reneging on his reported 
agreement to turn himself in, local stations found themselves all dressed up 
for live coverage with nothing to cover. True to tradition, they covered it 
live anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the morning, Channel 4 prematurely put up a picture of 
Simpson with this headline: "Simpson Surrenders." In addition, several stations 
reported a possible second suspect in the case. Channel 5 attributed that to 
CNN, Channel 2 to "reports," Channel 4 to a "credible news source." Later, it 
was reported that there was no second suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation is the nourishing mother's milk of live TV coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, on Friday afternoon, Channel 2 anchor Ann Martin announced gently, but 
ominously: "It is impossible not to speculate there is a body inside that 
condominium." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh uh. No body. 
</P>
<P>
 "That condominium" was the Brentwood townhouse where Nicole Simpson and 
Goldman had been stabbed to death Sunday night. On Friday, with Simpson a 
fugitive from justice, the townhouse again became the center ring of this 
movable media circus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime that afternoon, someone identified as a member of Nicole Simpson's 
family emerged from the residence and frantically shouted for reporters to call 
911. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon police arrived. In much greater numbers, so did the media. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 p.m., Channel 2 and Channel 4 choppers were above the townhouse. 
Then Channel 2 was live on the ground. Then KTLA-TV Channel 5 was live in the 
air. Then KCAL-TV Channel 9 was live on the ground. Then Channel 11 and KCOP-TV 
Channel 13 were live in the air. Although the Channel 7 Newsvan appeared stuck 
in traffic, even it would ultimately would arrive at the townhouse, joining the 
gawkers and others who had turned out for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The place was surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Simpson inside? If so, was he dead? Had he returned to the townhouse and 
taken his own life there? As Martin acknowledged, it was impossible for her not 
to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
 It was when police cordoned off the area with yellow tape that the conjecture 
about a body flowed from Martin's lips. And on Channel 4, reporter Joe Rico 
asked rhetorically: "Is it a possible suicide?" He said police were denying it. 
Moyer urged caution. "We do not know what happened here." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly when the media's Hercule Poirots are most dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, this latest townhouse mystery was apparently cleared up when it 
was reported that someone identifying himself as Simpson had called the 
townhouse and vowed to come over, causing the family member inside to panic and 
run outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were plenty of things to raise curiosity and speculation," Martin said 
much later. Plenty of things. Later in the afternoon, for example, her 
co-anchor, Tuck, informed viewers that police had "converged on the Santa 
Monica airport. We don't know why." But we could guess. Simpson had obviously 
gone there to commandeer a plane to Cuba, yes? No. Overhead in his chopper, Tur 
later reported merely that police had the airport under surveillance as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 In triplicate or quadruplicate, meanwhile, let the television movies begin. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were ever doubts that these brutal slayings were destined for prime 
time -- the November ratings sweeps have a nice cash smell -- the events of 
fantastic Friday ended them.

U.S. PUTS ITS SPIN ON BALL AT KICKOFF OF WORLD CUP; SOCCER: CLINTON JOINS 
GERMAN, BOLIVIAN LEADERS AT TOURNEY'S CHICAGO OPENING. FIRST ROSE BOWL GAME 
TODAY. 
</P>

 The United States put its star-spangled stamp on the world's most popular 
sports event Friday, opening the World Cup soccer tournament in sizzling style 
under a broiling sun before a crowd of 63,117 that included President Clinton 
and an array of dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening game, predicted to be a ho-hum blowout matching defending champion 
Germany -- the powerhouse soccer nation -- and Bolivia, was unexpectedly close. 
In a testament to the power the sport has to negate such matters as geography 
and economy, Germany barely beat Bolivia, 1-0, and it was even closer than the 
outcome would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Close calls and unpredictable results are the stuff international sport is 
made of, and the World Cup offers all that, as well as a healthy dash of 
nationalism and jingoism. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena will have its first game as Romania and 
Colombia play at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This World Cup, held in the United States for the first time, is expected to 
inject an American freshness into what is for many in this country a sport with 
foreign traditions. The opening ceremony here Friday hinted that some pizazz 
was in the wings. Bedecked with ribbons and splashed with the colorful garb of 
soccer fans, even somber Soldier Field seemed cheerful and sparkling in the 
sun. The bowl-shaped stadium that sits beside Lake Michigan became a caldron of 
the emotion and passion that is so emblematic of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the game, spectacle intruded on sport. Clinton was greeted with a 
good-natured mixture of cheers and whistles -- the usual irreverence of a 
sports crowd for politicians. The President spoke of soccer's unifying effect, 
saying, "The love of soccer is a universal language that brings us together." 
</P>
<P>
 He welcomed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, all dressed formally in dark suits while temperatures were in the 
90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the official portion of the festivities gave way to the pageantry, the 
restive crowd grew celebratory. The afternoon's hostess, Oprah Winfrey, set up 
the day's best unintentional pun when she said, "Chicago warmly welcomes you." 
The comment drew attention to the blistering temperature and stifling humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was unable to put a damper on the parade of national flags and 
dances representing the tournament's 24 teams. Bolivia and Germany were greeted 
loudly, as expected, but Mexico also drew marked cheers. The United States was 
introduced as a squad of spandex-clad dancers lunged around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all very festive, which was the anticipated reaction when, on July 4, 
1988, the United States was awarded the right to play host to the 15th World 
Cup. Soccer officials hope that soccer can conquer North America, a region with 
a noted indifference to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 145 nations have spent the last 18 months in regional qualifying for 
the quadrennial event, regarded as the largest single sporting event in the 
world. The 24 qualified teams are playing 52 games in nine cities throughout 
the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles area will get a heavy dose of the World Cup -- eight of the 
tournament's games, including the final July 17 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 A $3-million face lift has transformed the venerable 72-year-old Pasadena 
landmark into a colorful venue that will serve as "home" to the U.S. team, 
which plays there June 22 against Colombia and June 26 against Romania. The 
United States will play its first game today against Switzerland in the 
Silverdome at Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is playing in Group A; the tournament is organized into six 
groups of four teams. Each team plays three games in the first round, and the 
top 16 teams will advance to the next round. Three points are given for a 
victory and one for a tie.

SIMPSON FLEES MURDER CHARGES; HE DISAPPEARS AFTER AGREEING TO SURRENDER; CRIME: 
AUTHORITIES CHARGE THE FORMER FOOTBALL STAR IN THE SLAYINGS OF HIS EX-WIFE AND 
HER FRIEND. IN A LETTER TO THE PUBLIC, HE MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCE.

<P>
 O.J. Simpson, the football great who rose from the mean streets of San 
Francisco to international celebrity, became the subject of a massive police 
manhunt Friday, after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with 
the murders of his ex-wife and a male friend. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said Simpson disappeared around noon after 
agreeing to turn himself in to authorities. Shapiro said Simpson, 46, had been 
last seen with his friend, former USC teammate Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 The two apparently fled together as police were en route to the large, San 
Fernando Valley house where Simpson's arrest was to have taken place. Shapiro 
said he was upstairs in the house when Simpson and Cowlings apparently left. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, who publicly begged Simpson to turn himself in "for the sake of your 
family, for the sake of your children," said that in the hours before his 
disappearance, Simpson had updated his will, called his mother and children, 
and gave a friend at the house three sealed letters. 
</P>
<P>
 One, addressed "To whom it may concern," reiterated Simpson's denial that he 
had any part in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman, a 25-year-old Brentwood waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of my life and feel I have done most of the right things," the letter 
said. "So why do I end up like this? I can't go on. No matter what the outcome, 
people will look and point. I can't take that. I can't subject my children to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't feel sorry for me. I have had a great life, great friends. Please think 
of the real O.J., and not this lost person." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, enraged at Simpson's disappearance, warned the public against 
hiding the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner, who had promised to surrender to 
authorities on Friday morning but failed to show up. Scores of law enforcement 
officers fanned out across Southern California in an intensive search for one 
of the world's most recognizable public figures when Simpson did not appear as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us perhaps had empathy, to some extent," said a visibly agitated Gil 
Garcetti, the Los Angeles County district attorney. "We saw the fall of an 
American hero. . . . But let's remember, we have two innocent people who have 
been brutally killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found stabbed to death early Monday morning 
outside her $700,000 townhome. Police sources said the two had been slain 
sometime after 10 p.m. Sunday night as her two small children slept inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police had refused to officially label Simpson a suspect, and 
Simpson's lawyers said he was innocent, sources inside the LAPD made it clear 
from the outset that he was the focus of their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The former college and professional football star was briefly handcuffed and 
taken into custody at his mansion Monday afternoon. He was released, however, 
after questioning, and returned to the graceful Tudor-style home, where he 
remained as evidence against him mounted day by day. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, detectives had concluded their case, recommending that Simpson be 
charged with two counts of first-degree murder. The charges, which include a 
"special circumstance" of multiple killings, could bring him the death penalty 
if he is found, tried and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Commander David J. Gascon said Simpson had been scheduled 
to turn himself in to police at 11 a.m., with arraignment set for later that 
afternoon in Los Angeles County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But time ticked by and Simpson was nowhere to be seen. Finally, just before 2 
p.m., police held a news conference to announce that Simpson had officially 
become a fugitive from justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a wanted murder suspect," Gascon said tersely, "and we will go find 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how the 6-foot-1, 205-pound Simpson -- who had been dogged by 
crowds of reporters and camera crews for most of the week -- had managed to 
elude the authorities, who had felt confident that someone so famous would 
never attempt to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, Simpson had appeared to be sequestered in his Brentwood 
home, emerging only to visit his children and to attend Nicole Simpson's 
funeral in Brentwood and burial in Orange County. And after the services 
Thursday, a man resembling Simpson was photographed ducking past hordes of news 
reporters into the home -- escorted by an off-duty LAPD sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources say that authorities now believe that that man was a decoy, and 
intend to interview Sgt. Dennis L. Sebenik, a 25-year veteran who works in the 
LAPD's Harbor Division and who was a member of Simpson's security detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebenik said, however, that the Simpson decoy had been intended only to help 
the grieving Simpson avoid the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get rid of you guys, maybe," he told The Times, "but not to help him get 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Sebenik said he manages a "legitimate security company" and had been hired to 
provide security for Simpson. He would not comment on why an off-duty Los 
Angeles police officer was providing security for a man widely reported to be a 
suspect in a double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon, meanwhile, said department officials were investigating Sebenik's 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to rush in here and defend anything that might have occurred, 
but I'm not going to rush to judgment either," Gascon said. "We have no 
interest in excusing what is obviously going to be a difficult situation to 
explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Simpson had been told Friday morning that he would have to 
surrender that day. Because of Simpson's "fragile" emotional state Shapiro said 
he had asked several doctors to join him at the San Fernando Valley home where 
a heavily sedated Simpson had spent Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he was in constant contact with authorities as doctors were 
examining Simpson, a process that delayed the planned surrender for nearly an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, impatient about the delays, called the house to say that they were 
coming to arrest Simpson. But, Shapiro said, he did not pass that news on to 
Simpson, who was with Cowlings in another part of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 It was apparently at that point that Simpson and Cowlings slipped away, 
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities announced to an audibly shocked press corps that Simpson was a 
fugitive, Nicole Simpson's father rushed from her Brentwood condominium, 
begging a teen-ager to dial 911. LAPD Sgt. Bob Brounstein said a man claiming 
to be Simpson called the house at least twice, saying he was coming over to the 
scene of the murders to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go join Nicole," the caller allegedly said. But Simpson never 
turned up at the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a big mess," said Sgt. Doug Abney. "This is a false alarm." 
</P>
<P>
 As it became increasingly clear that Simpson was not likely to turn up, other 
law enforcement agencies throughout the region were notified of Simpson's 
disappearance. Sheriff's officials and the California Highway Patrol joined the 
manhunt for Simpson, focusing their search on the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were looking in particular for a white Ford Bronco apparently 
belonging to Simpson's lifelong friend, Cowling. They also warned that Simpson 
might be armed and was considered possibly suicidal. That created yet another 
problem: If Simpson raises a weapon at an officer, there is the possibility 
that he could end up dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can avoid a shooting, we obviously will," Abney of LAPD said. "But we 
have to consider that if he's suicidal, he may be homicidal." 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance of Simpson was a public relations nightmare for the LAPD and 
the district attorney's office, whose decision not to arrest Simpson earlier 
had been second-guessed in some quarters. Police sources had been saying all 
week that the evidence against Simpson was strong enough to warrant his arrest, 
and yet the department held off, hoping to build an air-tight case before 
taking him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon said the department was "very unhappy" with Simpson's disappearance, 
and stressed that police had not given Simpson special treatment in their 
handling of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, who described himself as "upset and angry" about Simpson's 
disappearance, also defended the Police Department's performance, saying 
investigators had done a commendable job at building the case against the 
former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four days since the killings, police sources say, evidence has 
continued to mount linking Simpson to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodstains on the walkway where the bodies were found matched Simpson's blood 
type, they said, and two blood-stained gloves were recovered, one at the scene, 
its match outside his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources also said that a trail of blood drops stretched across 
Simpson's cobblestone driveway. And Friday, they said that blood stains inside 
his home matched Nicole Simpson's blood type. The blood evidence appeared to 
figure against Simpson but is not necessarily conclusive, sources said. Even 
the rarest blood types are shared by many people. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA tests can more definitively identify blood samples, but they take weeks or 
even months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said that a murder weapon, which he described as a "substantial 
knife," had yet to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also have interviewed witnesses about Simpson's relationship with his 
ex-wife, and on Thursday questioned a jogger who said she saw a light-colored 
car resembling one of Simpson's outside the townhouse at around the time the 
murders are believed to have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses and authorities said O.J. and Nicole Simpson -- who had apparently 
seen each other off and on after their troubled and sometimes violent marriage 
ended in 1992 -- had been together on the evening of the killings, attending a 
dance recital for their 9-year-old daughter in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not with the family when Nicole Simpson, her children, and seven 
others arrived for dinner at the Brentwood restaurant where Goldman had been a 
waiter for the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's co-workers at the restaurant, Mezzaluna, later said that when Nicole 
Simpson went home, someone in her party left behind a pair of glasses. Goldman, 
a sometime model who during the past several weeks had struck up a friendship 
with Nicole Simpson, volunteered to drop them off at her house on his way home, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their blood-soaked bodies were found sprawled on a Spanish-tile walkway 
shortly after midnight Monday morning. Coroner's investigators said both their 
throats had been slit, and their corpses bore multiple stab wounds. 
Investigators added that there were signs that Goldman had put up a fierce 
struggle before he died. Police sources placed the time of death at sometime 
between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, police began looking for Simpson, who, they later learned, had 
taken an 11:45 p.m. flight to Chicago. Lawyers for the 
athlete-turned-TV-pitchman said he had been scheduled to attend a meeting 
hosted by Hertz, the auto rental firm for which he has long been a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the Chicago hotel where Simpson checked in hours afterward said 
that upon his arrival, he displayed the same affable, avuncular attitude that 
had been the hallmark of his public persona. When he checked out at 8:30 a.m. 
CDT, however, he was visibly agitated, they said, breaking into a line of other 
guests at the desk and demanding to be attended to immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson immediately returned to Los Angeles, arriving shortly before noon. 
Meanwhile, Chicago police scoured his hotel room, discovering a broken glass, 
bloody pillowcases and a bloody towel; a lawyer for Simpson later explained 
that he had slammed his hand down and cut his finger upon learning of his 
ex-wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as police struggled to conduct a deliberate investigation in the face 
of intense press scrutiny, Simpson's lawyers protested the celebrity's 
innocence -- even as authorities stressed that he was not officially a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, the lawyer who initially represented Simpson, said at first 
that Simpson had been on his way to Los Angeles International Airport when the 
slayings occurred. Several days later, after Simpson replaced Weitzman with 
Shapiro, the second lawyer said that Simpson had been at home awaiting the 
arrival of his limousine at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, however, also signaled that Simpson was aware that he had become the 
focus of the case, and indicated that he was planning an aggressive defense 
with an announcement that he had hired a private forensics team on Simpson's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also said that Simpson had been distraught since the killings, and had 
been undergoing treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's condition appeared to be particularly acute over the past three 
days, Shapiro said Friday. He and Simpson's doctors feared that the football 
Hall of Famer might attempt suicide, and one of Simpson's last acts before 
disappearing had been to write three letters -- one to his children, one to his 
mother and one to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the letters to his children and mother were not released, close 
friend Robert Kardashian read the public letter at a Friday afternoon press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone understand," the letter said, "I have nothing to do with Nicole's 
murder. I love her and always will." The Day He Disappeared 
</P>
<P>
 THE CHARGES 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a partial transcript of the felony complaint filed against O.J. 
Simpson in the slayings of his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

 On a day that mixed grand opera with street theater, culminating in a surreal 
car chase across Southern California, the nation drew together to watch an epic 
American tragedy unfold Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 From the freeway overpasses and streets of Los Angeles -- where some gathered 
to cheer O.J. Simpson as though he were a legendary outlaw -- to a tiny tavern 
with a television blaring in a Nevada mining town, people suddenly stopped 
their lives to watch a white Ford Bronco on an incredible odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 Work went untouched while television sets worked overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the day Los Angeles stopped," said David Colden, an entertainment 
attorney. "Everything just ground to a halt. . . . I bet billions of dollars 
was lost today in lost productivity. No one's gotten anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 At Chaya Brasserie in West L.A., patrons came to dinner equipped with 
miniature television sets that they perched on their tables. In health clubs, 
people lingered after workouts, afraid to miss a single moment of the rolling 
melodrama playing out on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the audience were moved to join the show, striking a bizarre 
note as they cheered on a fugitive who, only hours before, had been charged 
with murdering his ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 With dozens of police cars falling in behind and saturation television 
coverage tracking every movement -- north on the 5, west on the 91 Freeway, 
north on the 405 -- huge crowds gathered on overpasses to watch as Simpson, 
reportedly pressing a gun to his head, whizzed by in the car driven by his 
former college teammate and close friend Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Intersecting Simpson's path back toward his Brentwood estate, motorists 
stopped, got out of their cars in the middle of the rush-hour freeway traffic 
and waved. Others spilled into the traffic lanes near the loping Bronco. They 
cheered, honked horns and lined the roadway waving -- a scene more reminiscent 
of a parade or victory procession than a police pursuit of a murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were glued to television sets when they realized that the pursuit would 
be passing near them, so they said they jumped in their cars and positioned 
themselves on on-ramps or along the freeway so they could join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be therapy for O.J. if he saw motorists honking and 
bunching up behind him," said Steve James of Diamond Bar, who joined the 
pursuit in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The harrowing chase started around 6 p.m., when law enforcement authorities 
traced the Bronco to Orange County by following cellular phone transmissions 
from the truck. By 7:15, after several tries, officers started talking to the 
Bronco's occupants on the car phone. They were not the only callers. Radio 
listeners took to the airwaves and urged the onetime football hero to give 
himself up. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 8 p.m., as Simpson's vehicle left the freeway at Sunset 
Bouelvard, near his estate, people were waiting in the middle of the street, 
some lunging toward the vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 A large, boisterous crowd gathered at Rockingham Avenue and Sunset as the 
drama wound down, some of them cheering and chanting, "Free O.J." Others held 
signs saying "Save the Juice" and "We Love the Juice." About 50 young people 
tried to clamber over an ivy-covered hillside leading to the Simpson home, but 
police pushed them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to make sure he didn't commit suicide," said Brian Washington, 
25, who drove down from Lancaster with his pregnant wife. "Let's just go on 
from here. You've got young and old out here and we are all pulling for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Gibson, 21, drove up from Orange County after spotting Simpson on the 
freeway. Holding a sign that said "Go O.J.," he wanted to get one last glimpse 
of his hero, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most incredible thing in my entire lifetime," Gibson said. "For 
him to go down like this, well, it's just not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Brochelle Hale, 35, of Hawthorne, said she was glad when Simpson finally 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make any sense for him to go through all he has gone through," she 
said. "He should have turned himself in at the beginning. He ain't no hero." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, though, the mood was festive, and in almost every case, supportive 
of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Juice is loose!" several people shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to bring my family to see this," said one man with a small child on his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rest of the country, the action was confined to television screens, but 
was no less riveting for those caught in its grip. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City alone, nine television stations preempted regular programming 
to carry coverage of the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC interrupted coverage of the NBA championship basketball game, joining ABC 
and CBS in televising what could only be regarded as an extraordinary spectacle 
-- a fallen hero, pursued by police and reporters in full public view. 
</P>
<P>
 At Waterhole No. 1 in the tiny northeast Nevada mining town of Golconda, owner 
Judy Wilson watched the California freeway chase and later developments 
surrounded by 15 to 20 patrons at any one time in the evening. It was a switch 
for the small bar; usually they just watch sporting events and the news -- and 
then only in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite a show," Wilson said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Sheggeby, a book editor in San Francisco, had been watching television 
for the past two hours, since she got home from work at 7 p.m. "We think it's 
the most ridiculous thing we've ever done, but we just can't stop. Once you've 
put in a certain number of minutes, you think, 'What if something happens and I 
miss it?' It seems like something that would only happen in a TV show or a 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 At the police station in Buffalo, N.Y., a city in which Simpson braved ice and 
bitter temperatures for a decade to become a football legend, half a dozen 
local police personnel crowded around a small radio at headquarters to follow 
the drama as they waited to book the night's suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's listening," said Christine Dipasquale, a technician in the auto 
unit. "Everybody just feels so bad. My son was just saying this afternoon that 
Los Angeles probably feels bad, but for Buffalo it's worse.  
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. played for us for so long, he lived here for a long time. We remember 
our stars," she said. "Everybody feels like maybe he did do it, but we just 
wish he didn't."  
</P>
<P>
 It was a particularly somber mood at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York 
City, the organization that awarded Simpson the prized Heisman Trophy a 
quarter-century ago. A dozen members sat glued past midnight to the TVs at the 
club, still not believing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a feeling of total shock," said Milton Rodriquez, a security guard at 
the club. "I can't believe how far it's going. It's so sad, what's happening. 
People were asking if we were going to scratch out the name on the Heisman 
Trophy, or take down his picture. A few were saying we should. But I told them, 
hey, this is totally different. He won the trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 At Harry Caray's restaurant just north of Chicago's Loop, a crowd of about 
100, including tourists there for the city's World Cup opener between Germany 
and Bolivia, sat transfixed, coming to life only to cheer when Simpson's car 
was dodging traffic on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having trouble explaining to the Germans what's going on," said general 
manager Steve Borchew. "I told them it was as if Lothar Matthaeus, their best 
player, was driving out there with a gun. They can't imagine it." Pursuit Path 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson led authorities on a freeway pursuit Friday after being charged 
with murder in the slayings of his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Here is the 
path taken by the car carrying Simpson and his longtime friend and former 
teammate, Al Cowlings.

HOUSE PUTS END TO SPENDING ON TOBACCO RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtually all money for tobacco research was eliminated in an Agriculture 
Department spending bill approved Friday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The $67.9-billion bill, which includes funding for the Food and Drug 
Administration, passed on a 278-127 vote.The Senate has yet to complete its 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is spending $3.7 million on tobacco research this year. The 
proposed spending cutback would cover the 1995 budget year, which starts Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exception to the research ban would be for studies of pure scientific 
interest to botanists and genetic researchers. More is known about tobacco 
genetics than any other plant. Because of that it can be used to develop 
genetically engineered drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other anti-smoking measures in the bill include a continued ban on using 
government money to promote tobacco sales abroad, and a ban on smoking in 
clinics where poor parents and infants receive food from the government.

HIGH COURT RULES FOR TRUTH IN SENTENCING; TRIALS: THE JUSTICES OVERTURN A SOUTH 
CAROLINA MAN'S DEATH SENTENCE BECAUSE JURORS WERE NOT TOLD THAT HE WAS 
INELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, insisting on truth in sentencing, ruled Friday that jurors 
may not be fooled into thinking that a convicted killer eventually will go free 
if they do not sentence him to die. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-2 decision overturned a South Carolina man's death sentence on grounds 
that prosecutors and the judge had refused to tell the jurors that, regardless 
of their sentence, the defendant would never again be a free man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution's guarantee of due process of law is violated by the state's 
"refusal to provide the jury with accurate information" about the defendant, 
wrote Justice Harry A. Blackmun for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling may require new sentencing hearings for some Death Row inmates in 
South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Texas, attorneys said. In those 
states, jurors in death sentencing hearings are not told if the defendant is 
ineligible for parole. Jurors might choose the death sentence for fear that the 
convicted killer might otherwise eventually go free and pose a danger to 
society, defense lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is unlikely to have much impact in California, where, by law, 
jurors in capital cases are told they must choose either a death sentence or 
life in prison without parole. The possibility that the defendant will go free 
is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ruling in the case (Simmons vs. South Carolina, 92-9059) represented 
a rare occasion when the Supreme Court has overturned a death sentence. It 
illustrated how jurors could be confused about the meaning of a simple phrase: 
"life in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 7% of adults in South Carolina believed that "life in prison" really 
means that a defendant will stay behind bars until he dies, according to a poll 
cited in the opinion. The vast majority realize that a defendant given a life 
term might be paroled later. 
</P>
<P>
 But many states, as well as federal sentencing guidelines, have abolished 
parole for some crimes. In those cases, life in prison can mean just that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case before the Supreme Court, Jonathan D. Simmons had pleaded guilty 
in 1990 to two sexual assaults before being tried for the murder of an elderly 
woman. Because he was twice guilty of an assault, he would be kept in prison 
for life without parole if he had a third strike on his record, according to 
South Carolina law. 
</P>
<P>
 The third strike came with his murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 During his sentencing hearing, the prosecutor stressed that Simmons was a 
"threat . . . in our midst." His defense attorney was told he could not tell 
the jurors that Simmons, if not sentenced to death, would be kept in prison for 
life without eligibility for parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after beginning deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge 
asking if a life sentence would carry with it the possibility of parole. Rather 
than answering that it would not, the judge replied: "Do not consider parole or 
parole eligibility."  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five minutes later, the jury returned a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In reversing the sentence, the justices agreed that if jurors are told about 
the defendant's "future dangerousness," they must also be told if he is not 
eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented, complaining that the 
decision opened "another front in the guerrilla war" against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In other rulings, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Insisted that the Federal Communications Commission maintain fixed rates for 
all long-distance telephone service (MCI vs. AT&T, 93-356). In a 5-3 decision, 
the justices reversed an FCC policy that allowed MCI and other companies to 
negotiate lower rates while AT&T was required to follow its fixed rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Struck down, 7 to 2, a Massachusetts law that subsidizes milk produced in 
the state (West Lynn Creamery vs. Healy, 93-141). The Constitution does not 
allow a state to protect its product "from the rigors of interstate 
competition," the court held.

GUATEMALANS SIGN REFUGEE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Guatemalan government and leftist guerrillas signed a deal Friday in Oslo 
on resettling refugees, a milestone on the road to ending a conflict in which 
more than 100,000 people have died. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides, meeting since Monday, signed the 12-page deal in the same 
mansion and on the same table where Israeli and Palestine Liberation 
Organization delegations secretly initialed their historic peace accord on 
limited Palestinian autonomy last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's deal maps out how to resettle about 60,000 Guatemalans in Mexico, 
most living in refugee camps, and perhaps a million people forced to flee their 
homes inside Guatemala by the 33-year conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides aim to sign a complete peace accord in late 1994 to end the last 
guerrilla conflict in Central America. The two sides also said they had made 
progress on the other main theme of the talks -- setting up a commission to 
examine responsibility for human rights abuses during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nuccio, a U.S. policy adviser helping with the talks, said the United 
States had promised to turn millions of dollars in military aid into a fund to 
improve living conditions in Guatemala once the peace treaty is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States will be expected to announce, within the month, the 
establishment of a peace fund of about $60 million to help rebuild Guatemala 
when the final peace agreement has been signed," he said. The fund will include 
$56 million originally designated as military aid to the Guatemalan government, 
he said.

CHIAPAS NEGOTIATIONS MIRED IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS; MEXICO: THE TWO LEADING 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN A HARD LINE TOWARD THE ZAPATISTA REBELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The resignation of Chiapas peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis is a troubling 
sign that, in this presidential election year, politicking has taken precedence 
over finding a solution to the conflict in southern Mexico, analysts said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, they expressed concern that the risk of a return to armed 
confrontation may have increased because of the hard line the two leading 
presidential candidates have taken toward the rebels, who rejected a government 
peace proposal last week. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize that risk, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced that the 
federal government will fulfill the social and economic commitments in the 
32-point proposal and named a former Camacho Solis aide as liaison to 
coordinate that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to keep up the political and social offensive in order to make 
any return to fighting politically costly for them," a senior government 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was meant to help calm fears that the cease-fire in effect since 
mid-January might not withstand the political fireworks created by Camacho 
Solis' resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho Solis said late Thursday that he felt forced to quit as peace 
commissioner because of harsh criticism from ruling party presidential 
candidate Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 That criticism did not end with Camacho Solis' resignation: In an early 
morning radio interview Friday, Zedillo blasted him for having created false 
expectations of a peace settlement with the Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
"I find it quite worrisome that the ex-commissioner would link his resignation 
to my statements," Zedillo said. "I frankly have no idea what is his political 
motive for doing so." 
</P>
<P>
 What many political analysts find especially worrisome is that the uprising, 
which began Jan. 1 and appeared to be headed toward a peaceful resolution, has 
become part of the election campaign and, more specifically, subject to what 
increasingly looks like a personal rivalry between Zedillo and Camacho Solis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is extremely dangerous," said Carlos Ramirez, political columnist for 
the business newspaper El Financiero. "This is a fragile peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho Solis' resignation, combined with the withdrawal of mediator Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz, leaves a vacuum that concerns many Mexicans. "We have lost the 
mediators who the Zapatistas trust," political analyst Denise Dresser said. 
"This is really bad for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have asked for a new round of talks that would include members of 
national civic organizations with an agenda of national issues. They rejected 
the government peace proposal as too narrow because it promised mainly local 
solutions to economic, social and political problems that they said are present 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In his resignation speech Thursday, Camacho Solis appeared to assign his tasks 
to others who will continue the work of finding peaceful solutions to the 
problems that led to the uprising. But many of those responsible for solving 
the conflicts are members of the same Chiapas state power structure that has 
been unable to resolve the conflicts for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camacho had to give the impression that he was leaving everything in order," 
Ramirez said. "But a state governor does not have the influence in the federal 
government needed to respond to the Zapatista demands." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas named Hector Hernandez Llamas, a statistician who worked with Camacho 
Solis when he was mayor of Mexico City, as liaison with the Chiapas government. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez holds little hope that any agreement can be reached before the federal 
elections Aug. 21. The rebels have indicated they will only believe their 
government, which has a long history of voter fraud, is committed to democratic 
change if those elections are clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Zapatistas are holding the elections hostage," Ramirez said. That almost 
assures that Chiapas will become more of a campaign issue as the election 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 One leading candidate, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action 
Party, spoke out strongly against negotiating with "people in masks," as he 
called the ski-masked Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's feud with Camacho Solis has also pushed him toward the faction in 
his Institutional Revolutionary Party that favored a military solution to the 
uprising. "He is acting like an autocrat, and he hasn't even been elected yet," 
analyst Dresser said.

MIDEAST PEACE EFFORT FOCUS SHIFTS FROM SYRIA TO JORDAN; DIPLOMACY: ISRAEL 
REVIVES TALKS WITH KING HUSSEIN'S GOVERNMENT. DAMASCUS NO LONGER SETS PATTERN 
FOR ARABS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The focus of the Middle East peace process is quietly shifting from Syria to 
Jordan as mediation between Israel and Syria appears to be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two weeks, Jordan and Israel have revived their talks, 
reportedly after a secret meeting between Jordan's King Hussein and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein is expected in Washington on Monday and Tuesday to see President 
Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher as Jordan and Israel prepare 
for their first-ever public talks in the Middle East in the two countries' Red 
Sea ports of Aqaba and Eilat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordan-Israeli track, which had been dormant in deference to Christopher's 
shuttle diplomacy between Syria and Israel, is now going ahead in virtual 
defiance of Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer will Syrian President Hafez Assad be able to establish the framework 
for negotiations between Israel and the three remaining front-line states -- 
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon -- that have not negotiated peace agreements with 
Israel, regional analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said, Jordan's mediation will at least run parallel to the 
Syrian-Israeli talks and could even jump ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has deferred a visit to Damascus and Jerusalem planned for next 
week. "We no longer have high hopes for anything imminent on Syria," an 
Administration official admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Israelis and Syrians have speculated that a much-anticipated breakthrough 
will not happen this year, as President Clinton had predicted in January after 
talks with Assad in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the United States adopts the role of full partner in the peace process 
it launched and decides to remove the obstacles placed by the main saboteur of 
the process, namely Israel, it and other sponsors of the peace process should 
not expect to see peace in the Middle East in the next few months or even this 
year," al-Baath, an official Syrian newspaper, reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel on Friday, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, a key Rabin adviser and peace 
negotiator, told the Labor Party newspaper, Davar, "I don't believe that it 
will be possible this year to complete the negotiations with the Syrians, as 
they will be long and complex." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official cautioned against making too much of the gyrations of 
the Middle East peace process. "We're in the process of making a movie, and 
what you're seeing is only one frame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli official noted that former Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
traveled to the region 14 times before putting together an agreement for the 
1991 Madrid peace conference, which launched the current process. Reflecting 
growing concerns, however, the same official warned that diplomacy is often 
overtaken by events in the volatile region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that you always have small windows of opportunity," he said. 
"If you don't take the opportunity when the time is ripe, then you never know 
what will happen tomorrow -- maybe a North Korea to divert international 
attention or a terrorist attack that shakes down this whole region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is taking a slower path than we had hoped, and if that continues, the 
process could get stuck," he added. "And no transformation from war to peace 
can be complete without Syria." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the focus of Jordan-Israeli talks is expected to be smoother and 
potentially faster because it centers on bilateral issues rather than the 
broader effort to end the general Arab refusal to establish relations with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "economic cooperation" is the stated agenda for the coming talks in 
Eilat and Aqaba, discussions will also cover security, borders and other peace 
treaty issues. Haaretz, a prominent Israeli paper, said Jordan had effectively 
become a "strategic partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's sudden prominence appeared to surprise Syria, which reacted by 
canceling talks with Jordan. Commentators in the government-controlled news 
media launched strong and repeated denunciations of the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regional analysts are speculating that Jordan may sign a peace treaty 
with Israel before Syria does. One of the breakthroughs at the secret 
Rabin-Hussein meeting was the decision to begin implementing major elements of 
a draft peace agreement before it is formally concluded and signed, according 
to Israeli officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel now appears confident that the Jordan track will move ahead. "The 
problems between us and the Jordanians are minimal compared to those between us 
and the others involved in the conflict," Shahak said pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Shahak's comments and the Jordanian track itself are both being widely 
interpreted as sending signals to Syria that Rabin will not be pushed into 
concessions because he fears a stalemate. Rabin is effectively putting Assad on 
notice that he will be the loser if the recent momentum is lost, a senior 
Israeli official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin is not under pressure to move on the Syria track, especially since 
progress would probably involve giving up at least some territorial claim on 
the strategic Golan Heights overlooking northern Israel, a step that would be 
highly controversial at home. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Syrian officials said that they are under no pressure to 
move first or fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not negotiating for just a piece of property but to change the face of 
the entire Middle East, between all Arabs and Israel, not just Syria. So 
there's a different mentality," a senior Syrian official said. "We've been in 
the Middle East for more than 5,000 years. Because we want this peace to last 
throughout future generations, we have to move carefully to avoid making 
mistakes."

ARAFAT HAMPERED BY POLICE FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already struggling with organizational snags, Yasser Arafat's embryonic 
self-rule government took on a new problem Friday -- a police feud threatening 
to tear apart the security apparatus in Jericho and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was just the latest in a long list of financial and security 
problems that have kept the PLO chairman from setting a date for his move to 
Jericho, the West Bank town that will be the seat of the Palestinians' 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in the Palestine Liberation Organization said the fight involved Gen. 
Nasr Youssef, overall commander of the new Palestinian police force in the 
self-rule zones, and Col. Jibril Rajoub, head of a special security unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajoub refused orders from Youssef, insisting that the security unit answers 
only to Arafat, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rajoub's 
main duty is to protect Arafat and other top Palestinian leaders when they move 
to the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said a heated argument between Youssef and Rajoub in Arafat's 
presence degenerated into a scuffle, with the men threatening each other 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the problem would lead to a clash in the restive territories, 
Arafat summoned the central committee of his mainstream Fatah faction to a 
Thursday night session to map out specific duties for Youssef and Rajoub. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee persuaded both men to put their animosity aside and coordinate 
on security matters through Arafat, the sources said.

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; TEXT OF SIMPSON'S LETTER TO THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Text of a letter to the public by O.J. Simpson, which was read Friday by a 
close friend, Robert Kardashian, at a Friday afternoon press conference:  
</P>
<P>
 To whom it may concern: 
</P>
<P>
 First, everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder. I loved 
her, always have, and always will. If we had a problem, it's because I loved 
her so much. Recently we came to the understanding that for now we were not 
right for each other, at least for now. Despite our love we were different and 
that's why we mutually agreed to go our separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough splitting for a second time, but we both knew it was for the 
best. Inside, I had no doubt that in the future we would be close friends, or 
more. Unlike what has been written in the press, Nicole and I had a great 
relationship for most of our lives together. Like all long-term relationships, 
we had a few downs and ups. 
</P>
<P>
 I took the heat New Year's 1989 because that's what I was supposed to do. I 
did not plead no contest for any other reason but to protect our privacy. It 
was advised it would end the press hype. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to belabor knocking the press, but I can't believe what is being 
said. Most of it is totally made up. I know you have a job to do, but as a last 
wish, please, please, please leave my children in peace. Their lives will be 
tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to send my love and thanks to all my friends. I'm sorry I can't name 
every one of you. Especially A.C. -- man, thanks for being in my life. The 
support and friendship I received from so many -- Wayne Hughes, Louis Marks, 
Frank Olson, Mark Packer, Bender, Bobby Kardashian -- I wish we had spent more 
time together in recent years. My golfing buddies -- Hoss, Alan Austin, Mike, 
Craig, Denver, Wyler, Sandy, Jay, Donnie -- thanks for the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 All my teammates over the years: Reggie (McKenzie), you were the soul of my 
pro career, Ahmad (Rashad), I never stopped being proud of you. Marcus (Allen), 
you've got a great lady in Catherine, don't mess it up. Bobby Chandler, thanks 
for always being there. Skip and Cathy, I love you guys -- without you I never 
would have made it through this far. Marguerite (his first wife), thanks for 
the early years -- we had some fun. Paula -- what can I say? You are special. 
I'm sorry we're not going to have our chance. God brought you to me, I now see. 
As I leave, you'll be in my thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things. So why do I 
end up like this? I can't go on. No matter what the outcome, people will look 
and point. I can't take that. I can't subject my children to that. This way 
they can move on and go on with their lives. Please, if I've done anything 
worthwhile with my life, let my kids live in peace from you, the press. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had a good life. I'm proud of how I lived. My mama taught me to do unto 
others -- I treated people the way I wanted to be treated. I've always tried to 
be up and helpful. So why is this happening? I'm sorry for the Goldman family. 
I know how much it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole and I had a good life together. All this press talk about a rocky 
relationship is no more than what every long-term relationship experiences. All 
her friends will confirm that I have been totally loving and understanding of 
what she's been going through. At times I have felt like a battered husband or 
boyfriend. But I loved her, make that clear to everyone. And I would take 
whatever it took to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life, great friends. Please think of 
the real O.J. and not this lost person. Thanks for making my life special. I 
hope I helped yours. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace and love, O.J.

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; TWISTS AND TURNS KEEP RADIO FANS TALKING ABOUT SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON and CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some played amateur detective. Some vented their rage at the suspect, at the 
police, at the media, at society. Some joked while others lamented. And many 
wondered how, where and if it would all end. 
</P>
<P>
 As the twists and turns of the murder case involving former football great 
O.J. Simpson further unraveled Friday with his flight from justice, talk radio 
fans continued their weeklong bombardment of calls to local stations, 
expressing a myriad of emotions and opinions that reflected a public gripped in 
a real-life murder mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for society," said Karen from San Diego during a Friday afternoon 
call to the John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou show on KFI-AM (640). "Our heroes have 
fallen." 
</P>
<P>
 Darnell from Los Angeles thought the case was botched by both the police and 
the media: "The police and the media were leaking too much information. They 
need to put a grip on that. O.J. is smarter than they think." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert from Bellflower told Joe Crummey of KMPC-AM (710) that the circus-like 
coverage of the case by hungry hordes of journalists camped out in front of 
Simpson's home and at the funeral was reprehensible: "It's all about getting 
the first scoop. The media have no regard for how O.J. is feeling. How could 
the families mourn at the funeral with all the press there?" 
</P>
<P>
 All week, talk radio hosts at KMPC-AM, KFI-AM and KABC-AM said the callers 
seemed consumed by the mystery, wanting to discuss little else. A majority of 
the callers declared immediately that Simpson was guilty, citing clues and 
circumstances. But a smaller group of callers vehemently defended the athlete, 
saying that media speculation and police leaks were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 As the week progressed, callers became increasingly caught up in the drama, 
commenting on every twist and turn of the case. Some of the hosts, such as 
KMPC's Tom Leykis and KFI's Chiampou and Kobylt, broadcast shows commenting on 
the harried atmosphere from the front of Simpson's Brentwood residence. 
</P>
<P>
 These discussions are "like what goes on around the dinner table," Kobylt 
said. "You're all arguing over it. We're just doing that on the radio. It's 
just human nature. We can't help ourselves but talk about it. That's the nature 
of the talk radio beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the discussions were musings by listeners and the hosts on numerous 
aspects of the case: Racial implications. The battering of women. How society 
builds icons and then seems to delight in tearing them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hosts made a point of treading carefully about the case during most of 
the week. Long-time KABC talk show host Michael Jackson, who had blasted the 
media circus surrounding the case, persisted in his "wait-and-see" attitude 
through the week. Even on Friday, after news reports revealed that Simpson 
would be charged in the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman, cautioned 
listeners that "we have to remember he is innocent until proven guilty."  
</P>
<P>
 KABC host Gloria Allred said: "Every caller seemed emotionally involved. They 
had a morbid fascination (and) at the same time they were condemning the press 
for giving them information." 
</P>
<P>
 But by late Friday, many of the hosts -- and the callers -- had abandoned that 
cautious stance. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the bizarre events of Friday were reported, afternoon calls to the 
stations focused largely on blame: The Police Department for letting Simpson 
slip through their fingers. The media for rampant speculation. Callers 
themselves wondered aloud whether Simpson had fled the country or committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the theories were hard to figure. One KFI caller said she thought the 
police had Simpson in protective custody. Another speculated that the police 
let Simpson go purposely because of the LAPD's ongoing salary dispute with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Even by the end of the day Simpson still had his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Warren from Hollywood to Chiampou and Kobylt: "I still can't accept the 
fact that he did it. I don't see how anyone can do it. I'm just an average Joe. 
Call me crazy."

<P>
 C omments regarding Friday's events after a warrant was issued for O.J. 
Simpson's arrest , and portions of a letter from Simpson:  
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simpson is a wanted murder suspect -- two counts of murder, a terrible 
crime. We need to find him, we need to bring him to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles Police, Cmdr. David Gascon 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us perhaps had empathy, to some extent. We saw the fall of an 
American hero. . . . But let's remember, we have two innocent people who have 
been brutally killed. . . . We will find Mr. Simpson and we are going to bring 
him to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "First, everyone understand, I have nothing to do with Nicole's murder. I 
loved her, always have, always will. . . . I can't go on. No matter what the 
outcome, people will look and point. I can't go on like that, I can't subject 
my children to that. . . . Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life, 
great friends. Please think of the real O.J., and not this lost person." 
</P>
<P>
 -- O.J. Simpson, excerpt from a letter he wrote and gave to a close friend 
Friday 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "First, to O.J., wherever you are, for the sake of your family, for the sake 
of your children, please surrender immediately. Surrender to any law 
enforcement official at any police station, but please do it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attorney Robert Shapiro 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simpson has done himself no favor by failing to surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laurie Levenson, Loyola University law professor 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not embarrassed he didn't turn himself in at the right time. We made 
arrangements, the same as we would with anyone else, to No. 1, surrender with 
the attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 -- LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not keeping close tabs on O.J. We were assured that he was going to 
turn himself in, so we lost track of where he was. . . . I'm amazed that anyone 
in our department let it come to this. . . . I'm discouraged and embarrassed 
for the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 -- LAPD Sgt. Doug Abney 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have projected O.J. into our personal lives. He's kind of the friend 
we all had whether we knew him or not. We don't want to believe he's involved 
in this, but the evidence is pretty overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>

Trophy at the university

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THE NEWS CONFERENCES; LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
SCRAMBLE TO EXPLAIN AND DEAL WITH BIZARRE EVENTS OF DAY; DIST. ATTY. GIL 
GARCETTI; 'WE SAW, PERHAPS, THE FALLING OF AN AMERICAN HERO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was visibly upset as he strode 
into a packed news conference in what reporters call "the war room" at the 
Downtown Criminal Courts Building on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 His anger, he told the eager crush of reporters, was directed at Orenthal 
James Simpson, who failed to surrender himself earlier in the day for arrest on 
charges that he killed his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to find O.J. Simpson and we are going to bring him to justice," 
Garcetti said confidently before opening the floor to questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do you blame for this?" one reporter blurted above the sudden din. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to criticize the Los Angeles Police Department," Garcetti shot 
back. "They did an outstanding job." 
</P>
<P>
 No one had mentioned the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you can tell that I'm a little upset and I am upset," he told reporters. 
"This is a very serious case. Many of us, perhaps, had empathy to some extent. 
We saw, perhaps, the falling of an American hero. To some extent, I viewed Mr. 
Simpson in the same way. But let's remember. We have two innocent people who 
have been brutally killed. We have their families who are still with us today 
who are going to suffer for the rest of their lives, including the children of 
the Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti seemed to agree with reporters that Simpson was a flight risk, but a 
source in the district attorney's office said the prosecutors did not think so 
before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A top Garcetti deputy assigned to help police with their investigation was 
quoted by the source as saying she was stunned when Simpson did not surrender 
himself for arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that Simpson had done everything he had been asked to do, returned 
from Chicago and kept in frequent touch with police," the source said. "He had 
been very cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
 At what should have been a moment of triumph for Garcetti -- a relatively 
speedy decision to prosecute in a high-profile case -- the Los Angeles County 
district attorney once again found himself defending his office's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombarded with criticism in recent months that deputies in his office too 
often fumble big cases, he testily and emphatically denied to reporters Friday 
that it had been prosecutors who were responsible for delaying Simpson's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office -- under Garcetti and his predecessor Ira 
Reiner -- has seen its share of controversial cases in recent years: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hung juries in the trial of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who admitted killing 
their parents at their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not guilty verdicts against four police officers accused in the videotaped 
beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acquittals on most serious charges against three men charged in the beating 
of trucker Reginald O. Denny in first hours of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acquittals and jury deadlocks in the McMartin child molestation case after 
the nation's longest and most expensive criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Garcetti never directly answered repeated questions as to why 
Simpson, at some point, was not taken into custody during the 48 hours that the 
law allows a suspect to be held as police investigate a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Clark and David Conn, the two high-ranking deputy district attorneys 
assigned to help police on the Simpson case, flanked Garcetti during the news 
conference, but neither spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garcetti, Conn and Clark left, the reporters descended on one of 
Garcetti's press secretaries, pumping him for the slightest detail about the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been like that since midmorning, when the media got the word that 
charges had been filed against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with a remote connection to the case who might have a morsel to offer 
was surrounded and bombarded with questions in the corridor outside Garcetti's 
office, where scores of reporters and camera operators were gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, when they mistakenly thought Simpson was about to be arraigned, 
journalists rushed en masse to the courthouse's heavily guarded security floor 
to line up for spots in the designated courtroom. They had to compete with 
county workers who also were lining up for good seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as the media crowd once again found itself milling about outside 
Garcetti's office, rumors and theories about the case swirled around. 
</P>
<P>
 By time reporters were allowed in the war room, a veritable feeding frenzy was 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garcetti appeared, there was barely a space in the large conference room 
that was not occupied by someone with a notebook or a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, normally the picture of coolness and restraint, was purposeful in 
his anger as he directed a message to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you in any way assist Mr. Simpson in avoiding justice, if you assist him 
in any way, you are committing a felony," he said as he began his remarks. 
"Think about it. You will be prosecuted as a felon." 
</P>
<P>
 And at one point, Garcetti turned the attention back on his inquisitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't blame anyone," he said. "I mean, look at how many people are here 
today. How many members of the media have been surrounding Mr. Simpson's house 
and he was able to get away somehow."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THE NEWS CONFERENCES; LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
SCRAMBLE TO EXPLAIN AND DEAL WITH BIZARRE EVENTS OF DAY; CMDR. DAVID J. GASCON; 
THE LAPD IS 'VERY UNHAPPY WITH . . . HIS FAILURE TO SURRENDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Cmdr. David J. Gascon, the day's briefings began in disaster and ended in 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 2 p.m., Gascon, standing ramrod straight, his jaw tightly 
clenched, addressed hordes of reporters to break the news that O.J. Simpson was 
wanted for a brutal double murder and was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simpson, in an agreement with his attorney, was scheduled to surrender 
this morning to the Los Angeles Police Department," Gascon said. "Initially, 
that was 11 o'clock. Then it became 11:45. Mr. Simpson has not appeared. The 
Los Angeles Police Department right now is actively searching for Mr. Simpson. 
The Los Angeles Police Department is also very unhappy with the activities 
surrounding his failure to surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters gasped, and Gascon proceeded to guardedly detail the extraordinary 
tale of a five-day police investigation that resulted in a warrant for 
Simpson's arrest and yet allowed the suspect to slip through police grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue our pursuit of Mr. Simpson," Gascon pledged, "and hope to 
have him in custody soon." 
</P>
<P>
 With Police Chief Willie L. Williams in Philadelphia to testify in a case 
related to his tenure in that department and the rest of the LAPD's top brass 
watching from safely beyond the limelight, Gascon gamely praised the work of 
detectives and scientific staff who had collected and analyzed a wealth of 
evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to respond to rumors that have swirled around the case from the 
start. He defended the LAPD against accusations that the department had leaked 
information to the press, noting that the Police Department's official comments 
had never so much as identified Simpson as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our official comments have been limited to those statements given at the 
crime scene by Lt. John Rogers . . . comments by Chief Williams and comments 
that I've made," Gascon said. "Any criticism of the Los Angeles Police 
Department because of what has been published or broadcast by the media is 
unfair. We do not control the newsrooms. You and your bosses make very 
difficult decisions, and we appreciate and respect your judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Barely had Gascon finished his statement, however, than reporters aggressively 
began to challenge the Police Department's performance, shouting over each 
other in an effort to get the commander's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cmdr. Gascon, didn't you have a tail on the suspect all the time?" one asked. 
"Weren't you watching him constantly?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon tried to fend off those inquiries, saying the department would decline 
comment on that subject until investigators completed their work. He did say 
that police had spoken with Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lawyer, and Gascon 
made no effort to hide the LAPD's irritation with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have expressed our dismay," he said. "And we have indicated to him that we 
expect to see Mr. Simpson immediately, if not sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon denied one reporter's suggestion that Simpson had been given special 
treatment, a notion that has been raised because of the decision to allow 
Simpson to remain at large even as evidence against him mounted. "There is no 
preferential treatment. There has not been any preferential treatment," Gascon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For proof of that, Gascon suggested that reporters watch the enormity of the 
police response as officers fanned out to find the missing murder suspect. That 
process began even before Gascon addressed the press, and by mid-afternoon, 
finding Simpson was the main preoccupation of Southern California law 
enforcement. Highway patrol officers, sheriff's deputies and FBI agents were 
among the legions who set out in search of the athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simpson is a wanted murder suspect," Gascon said. "We need to find him, 
we need to apprehend him. We need to bring him to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, Gascon's promise had been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 A beaming and expansive Gascon addressed a placated media just as Simpson was 
being booked into police headquarters after a chase that ended with SWAT 
officers successfully talking the football star into dropping his gun and 
giving himself up. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Gascon talked of the "magnificent job" performed by LAPD officers 
and of the personal pride he took in his association with them. The questions 
were gentler and tempered by bursts of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the day's events, he reflected: "It's something that all of us can be very 
proud of."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; 'I WAS SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING'; 
CHILDHOOD: THE FOOTBALL HERO GREW UP IN A BLEAK HOUSING PROJECT IN SAN 
FRANCISCO AND WAS OFTEN IN TROUBLE. BUT A JAILHOUSE VISIT BY BASEBALL STAR 
WILLIE MAYS HELPED THE YOUTH TURN HIS LIFE AROUND.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a youngster growing up in one of the city's toughest neighborhoods, 
Orenthal James Simpson seemed destined for a life of crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised by his mother in a bleak housing project on Potrero Hill, south of 
downtown, Simpson spent his teens as the leader of a gang, fighting in the 
streets and committing petty crimes, such as stealing slabs of beef from a 
butcher's warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was somebody who didn't care about anything," Simpson once told The Times, 
"and the best thing you can say about me and trouble was that I was 
borderline." 
</P>
<P>
 But the man the world knows as O.J. had two things going for him: his 
extraordinary athletic ability and the intervention of San Francisco Giants 
star Willie Mays, who once paid him a visit after Simpson spent a weekend in 
juvenile hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy who wore braces on his legs because of rickets survived the projects 
to become one of the greatest running backs in pro football. The popular 
teen-ager, a natural leader in the ghetto, went on to win fame as a television 
pitchman and football commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of his speed and strength, he developed poise and grace, an easy smile 
and a sense of modesty that helped make him a hero in his hometown and a role 
model for youngsters everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crushing disappointment to millions of fans, Simpson was charged Friday 
with murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and waiter Ronald Lyle 
Goldman outside her Brentwood condo. After promising to turn himself in, 
Simpson eluded police for hours, then led them on a lengthy pursuit on 
Southland freeways before finally surrendering at his Brentwood house Friday 
night.  
</P>
<P>
 The case has revealed that Simpson had a history of spousal abuse and that 
police had been called repeatedly after domestic disputes, in which the former 
football star allegedly struck his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But longtime friends and residents of his childhood neighborhood refuse to 
believe that Simpson could have any connection to the double murder. His fans 
suggest that he has been framed by some powerful enemy. His friends say it is 
not in his character to commit such a horrible act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a hard time seeing O.J. in a ski mask and gloves hiding in the 
bushes with a knife," said Calvin Tennyson, a boyhood friend who has remained 
close to Simpson. "This is a professional man, someone trained to control his 
emotions. I can't see him flipping out to the point where he would kill two 
people and throw his whole life down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 O.J., who will turn 47 on July 9, was the third of four children born to 
Eunice Simpson, a hospital technician, and Jimmy Lee Simpson, a bank custodian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpsons separated when O.J. was 5 and he was raised by his mother, a 
strong-willed woman who did her best to keep her children in school and out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us had dads, and things weren't easy," recalled Joe Bell, a childhood 
friend and high school football teammate. "But we were all raised by strong 
mothers who instilled in us a desire and drive to better ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Many mothers in the projects were on welfare, but Eunice Simpson worked long 
hours and frequent night shifts at San Francisco General Hospital. She and 
other mothers in the neighborhood helped each other watch over their children 
and made sure they toed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mrs. Simpson saw me doing something wrong, she'd slap me quick," said 
Bell, who now owns a thrift shop in Richmond. "And if my mother saw O.J. doing 
something wrong, she'd slap him. Neighbors looked after their neighbors' kids." 
 
</P>
<P>
 When Simpson was inducted into the pro football Hall of Fame in 1985, he 
praised his mother as "the best mother a guy ever had." At the same ceremony, 
Eunice Simpson confessed that she never expected that her son would achieve 
such fame and glory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had always said, 'One of these days you're going to read about me,' " she 
told the crowd. "And my oldest daughter would always say, 'In the police 
report.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because he suffered from rickets -- a Vitamin D and calcium deficiency -- 
Simpson had to wear leg braces as a small child and was left bowlegged by the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he became a superior athlete as a youth, which conferred upon 
him a special leadership status in his neighborhood. He and his friends formed 
a gang named the Persian Warriors -- Simpson called it a "social club" -- and 
he was its leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book "60 Years of USC-UCLA Football" by Steve Springer and Michael 
Arkush, Simpson recounted how he and his fellow Warriors used to steal from 
factories and warehouses in the industrial district near the Potrero Hill 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were bored and wanted to make some money, you go 'hit the pie 
company,' " Simpson recalled. "Do it maybe once a month. Either sell the pies 
or gorge out on them. My favorite was blackberry." 
</P>
<P>
 They stole sardines from one company and soft drinks from delivery trucks, but 
stealing slabs of beef was the most difficult, according to the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bitch rolling those things down the hill," he said, "but there was 
no way one of those guys (the butchers) was going to chase anyone down into the 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and his friends also formed a social club called the Superiors, a 
group of the best athletes in the projects. "He had more natural leadership 
ability than any youngster I know," recalled Lefty Gordon, a social group 
worker at the Booker T. Washington Community Center who served as an adviser to 
the Superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era before guns were readily available, most rival teen-agers didn't 
mess with the Superiors, who were among the biggest and strongest youths in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circles in which we all traveled in that time were very, very close to 
the fringe," recalled Otis McGee Jr., another childhood friend and fellow 
Superior who is now a San Francisco attorney. "Many of us made it, but I can 
think of as many people who I grew up with who later died or wound up in prison 
or became drug-addicted or fell into some other trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson acknowledged as much in a 1967 interview: "I could have turned out 
bad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Simpson, the turning point came when he was picked up by police at the age 
of 16. Simpson once said it might have been for fighting; friends recall they 
had stolen beer for a Superior party. In any case, Simpson spent the weekend in 
juvenile hall. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was released from custody, he expected to get a beating from his 
father. Instead, he received a surprise visit from his idol, Willie Mays. The 
meeting was arranged by social workers at the Booker T. Washington center, 
where Mays occasionally helped troubled youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays spared O.J. any lectures. Instead, the sports hero took him on a drive, 
stopping at the dry cleaners and going to his house in the posh Forest Hill 
neighborhood of the city. Simpson soon realized that Mays was a regular person 
with everyday problems; at the cleaners, his laundry wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that he was human," Simpson recounted. "A lot of people thought I was 
good and I realized I could be this guy. I could be Willie Mays. . . . I don't 
think I got in any real trouble from that point on. I got a little more 
focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who had been suspended from school five times, began to pay more 
attention to his studies and focus more intently on school sports. 
</P>
<P>
 He played football at Galileo High School, but the team rarely won, despite 
his talents. To his disappointment, he did not receive any college scholarships 
and enrolled at San Francisco City College. 
</P>
<P>
 He began the season as the third-string tailback, but when the first two 
runners were injured he got his chance. He broke a variety of city college 
records, ultimately scoring 26 touchdowns and averaging 9.9 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson hoped to go to USC as a sophomore but was again disappointed when the 
school rejected him because of his poor grades. He considered enrolling in 
another four-year university but was persuaded by a USC scout to stay at city 
college another season, improve his grades and then come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then it was clear that Simpson had his sights set on more than a football 
career. He chose USC not just because of its football prowess; as he once told 
a San Francisco Chronicle columnist, he wanted to attend "a place where I can 
learn which fork to use at dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson married a high school sweetheart, Marguerite Whitley, in 1967, the 
same year he started school at USC. In an interview soon afterward, Marguerite 
described O.J. as a "terrible" person when they first met. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson agreed, explaining: "I didn't have any goals. I goofed off a lot. . . 
. I was sort of aimless." 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, he became an immediate sensation, ran for 3,295 yards, led the team to 
a national championship and won the Heisman Trophy. He was the first pick in 
the 1969 NFL draft, taken by the Buffalo Bills, where he spent most of his 
career. In 1973, he became the first man to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. and Marguerite had three children, but their marriage suffered from his 
celebrity status and time on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Marguerite, as well as Nicole, women just treated him as if he wasn't 
married and climbed all over him," Bell said. "He was pursued in hotels, women 
would send him their panties in the mail, that sort of stuff. You've got to be 
a strong woman to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Marguerite separated during his Buffalo years. In 1978, he returned to 
his hometown to play out his career as a 49er. In 1979, his final year in pro 
football, he and Marguerite divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the divorce, tragedy struck when their youngest child, 23-month-old 
Aaren Simpson, drowned in a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 After his football career, Simpson worked as an NFL commentator, including on 
"ABC Monday Night Football." He also has been in more than a dozen movies, 
recently completing a TV pilot called "Frogman." 
</P>
<P>
 Success did not change Simpson, his oldest friends said, and he was generous 
with his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 He contributed thousands of dollars to the Potrero Hill Recreation Center, 
where he once played basketball, and to athletics programs at Galileo High 
School. He also returned occasionally to visit his old neighborhoods, even 
filming an orange juice commercial on Potrero Hill with kids from the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 After he turned pro, the Simpsons bought their first place, a fancy $150,000 
house with a swimming pool in Los Angeles; he flew his buddies down for a 
week's vacation, wining and dining them and driving them around town in his 
Corvette, recalled Tennyson, who now works in the laundry at San Francisco 
General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, Tennyson said, he would get a phone call out of the blue from 
Simpson, telling him there were two tickets to Los Angeles waiting for him at 
the San Francisco airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't forget us. Even with all that money, he remained the same old O.J. 
we always knew," Tennyson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to reports that Simpson battered his second wife, Nicole, during 
their seven-year marriage, Tennyson said such conduct should not prompt the 
public to judge the former football star harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put a man and a woman in the same house, day in and day out, and from 
time to time somebody gets slapped," he said. "I don't think that made O.J. 
outstanding in America. It's not exactly an uncommon thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In his old neighborhood, youths still look up to him as a role model and proof 
that it is possible to escape the projects. The charges against him were met 
this week with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always wanted to be a great star like him, not see him go up in smoke," 
said 15-year-old Andrew Tanner, during a break in a basketball game at the 
Potrero Hill Recreation Center, where Simpson's picture is displayed. "I really 
don't think he did it."

TELEGRAM SHOWS HOW ADMIRATION FOR SIMPSON TRANSCENDED RIVALRIES

<P>
 In the USC sports information department, files nearly a foot high hold press 
clippings from O.J. Simpson's storied college football career. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of them, an envelope contains half a dozen telegrams sent to Simpson on 
Nov. 25, 1968, the day he won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them illustrates how Simpson's talent and personality transcended 
rivalries.  
</P>
<P>
 "Warmest congratulations on your well deserved Heisman Trophy award," it 
began.  
</P>
<P>
 "You are a great credit to intercollegiate athletics and have always conducted 
yourself as a champion on and off the field. We wish you unlimited success in 
all future endeavors." 
</P>

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; USC, EX-TEAMMATES REEL FROM SHOCK, DISBELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 O.J. Simpson's jersey, No. 32, the one he wore in his Heisman Trophy-winning 
1968 season, rests in a plexiglass case in the north corner of USC's Heritage 
Hall lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 USC students, faculty members and visitors lingered by the display this week. 
Many were unable to grasp the week's news, first that he had been implicated 
in, then, on Friday, accused of the murder of his former wife and a male 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this crime, surely. And not this man. 
</P>
<P>
 How was it possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Some watched a video machine in another corner of Heritage Hall only a few 
feet from his Heisman award. They punched up the dramatic, 64-yard run that 
beat UCLA in 1967, 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, all those great runs suddenly seemed very long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 USC people had difficulty blending the athlete they remembered -- the 
grinning, charismatic kid from San Francisco's Potrero Hill district -- with 
the 46-year-old O.J. Simpson who was charged Friday on two murder counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson failed to show up for his arraignment and was being sought by 
authorities. Most of those interviewed spoke before Simpson had been declared a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating, it's overwhelming," said Pete Shugarman, a 28-year USC 
biology professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's talking about it and no one wants to believe it, especially if you 
knew him. It's so unlike the person we've known." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Grady, a former USC teammate, said: "It's unbelievable, so shocking. . . 
. I roomed with him sometimes at USC. He never showed a tendency toward what's 
described. He didn't even have a temper." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of USC's three other Heisman Trophy winners, Mike Garrett and Marcus 
Allen, did not return calls. Charles White, the third, would not comment. Nor 
would Simpson's former USC coach, John McKay. 
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson, USC's current coach, would not comment on Simpson's situation 
but said: "He's part of our family, a much-loved guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Seagren, a world-class pole vaulter at USC, was on the 1967 track team 
with Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he's innocent, that it's more of a media frenzy than anything else," 
he said. "I'm hoping and praying for the best for him. And I'm praying for his 
kids, thinking of the pain they must be going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Another former teammate, both in football and track, Earl McCullouch, 
expressed shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable when I heard it and it's still unbelievable to me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my roommate. I know this guy. For him to get in that kind of a rage 
and do this to someone -- they'll have to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Ron Yary, who won the Outland Trophy as college football's 
outstanding lineman the year before Simpson won the Heisman, offered a familiar 
refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as nice a person as I've ever met, even-tempered, cordial, polite, 
honest, lighthearted," Yary told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get this off my mind. To me, this is the equivalent of the Pope 
showing an act of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Chandler, Simpson's longtime friend and former teammate at USC and with 
the Buffalo Bills, visited Simpson on Tuesday. He told the Associated Press: 
"I've never seen him lower. He's very, very distraught. He's grieving the loss 
of the mother of his two kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no reason to suspect O.J. is involved in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox Miller, a Pasadena dentist and a former track teammate of Simpson, 
called the police portrait of Simpson drawn this week by the unfolding story 
"completely contrary to the person I've loved all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 "The things I'm hearing -- it just doesn't sound like him," he said. "O.J. has 
always been a charismatic guy, fun to be around, always in good spirits. This 
is a side I was never aware of. I'm completely shocked."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; O.J. AND A.C.: BOND TRANSCENDS TIME, TRAGEDY; FRIENDS: 
THE BOYHOOD PALS WERE TOGETHER THROUGH PRO FOOTBALL CAREERS AND BEYOND. 
ACQUAINTANCES SAY SIMPSON 'TOOK CARE OF' AL COWLINGS, WHO WAS AT HIS SIDE TO 
THE END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For as long as anyone can remember, it was O.J. and Al. Homeboys, teammates, 
soul mates. Together to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 From the unforgiving streets of Potrero Hill in San Francisco to the rough and 
tumble of the National Football League and life beyond, O.J. Simpson and Al 
Cowlings found their lives repeatedly intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Simpson fled Friday from murder charges, there was a certain awful 
symmetry that brought Cowlings to his side again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al followed O.J. like his shadow, both in their youth and afterward," said 
Joe Bell, who played high school football with both men in San Francisco. "They 
were joined at the hip, you might say." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Cowlings who was with Simpson when he slipped away from an Encino 
residence just before he was supposed to turn himself in, according to District 
Atty. Gil Garcetti and Simpson's attorney, Robert Shapiro. It was Cowlings, 47, 
police say, who piloted his Ford Bronco on a desperate and futile getaway 
attempt. And it was Cowlings, dressed in black, who seemed to be trying to 
negotiate Simpson's surrender as the nation watched on television. Now, like 
Simpson, Cowlings is under arrest, being held at Los Angeles County Jail on 
$250,000 bond, facing charges of harboring a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If O.J. could depend on one guy, it was A.C.," said former Los Angeles Rams 
General Manager Don Klosterman, who knows both men well. "There was total 
loyalty. I'm sure A.C. (didn't) even think he (was) breaking the law, knowing 
him. He just made a deal to help out his friend." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the way it had always been. Cowlings and Simpson's deep bond was 
forged through the struggle of growing up poor in one of San Francisco's 
toughest neighborhoods. On Potrero Hill, a kid met an invitation for trouble on 
every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the tightest duo in a larger group of about 15 high school athletes 
who founded a social club called the Superiors. The group hosted dances and 
parties around San Francisco, helping members to earn money -- and dates. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were also teammates on the Galileo High School football team, where 
Cowlings was the biggest, beefiest member of the squad, weighing about 220 
pounds by his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al would be there for O.J. and O.J. would be there for Al," said Lefty 
Gordon, a social worker who knew both men as teen-agers on Potrero Hill. "O.J. 
had a lot of influence on Al. They had been extremely close." 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship even survived one of the tougher challenges young men in high 
school can face -- the theft of a girlfriend. As Bell tells it, Cowlings was 
dating Marguerite Whitley -- a statuesque girl considered a prime catch -- 
before Simpson swept her off her feet in an episode reminiscent of Cyrano de 
Bergerac. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Al was younger, he had this stutter, and he never felt he could express 
himself right to Marguerite," Bell recalled. "So he asked O.J., his buddy, to 
help him out and tell her things. Well, O.J. told her things all right. But he 
wound up spinning more yarn for himself than he did for Al, and Marguerite 
ended up with him." 
</P>
<P>
 When he first spotted Simpson with his girl, Cowlings yelled and even tried to 
roll the new couple's car over, another friend said. "But a week or two later, 
they'd patched things right back up," said the friend, Calvin Tennyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and Marguerite Whitley went on to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bell, who now owns Lady Di's Thrift Shop in Richmond: "Most of us went 
our separate ways after high school. But after O.J. made it, Al figured he 
could too." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings, a defensive end, was a year behind Simpson in school, but he 
followed O.J. almost like an adoring fan. O.J. left Galileo for San Francisco 
City College. So did Al. O.J. transferred from City College to USC. So did Al, 
where he was part of a defensive line known as the Wild Bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to head to the pros in 1969, Simpson became the top draft 
pick of the Buffalo Bills. A year later, Cowlings was a first-round choice of 
the same team, and the homeboys were together again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, of all the guys, that Al was the closest to The Juice," said Vic 
Carucci, who covers the Bills for the Buffalo News. "They hung together a lot. 
Al was more or less his trusted confidante." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings was never an all-pro or a standout, whereas Simpson was touted from 
the start as perhaps "the best who ever lived." In a few years, Cowlings was 
traded to Houston and then to Los Angeles, where he played for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Klosterman, who was with the Rams then, recalls Cowlings as an emotional 
lightning rod for the team. "He was a spirit guy," Klosterman said. "He was the 
life of the team. He kept everyone going. He was an upper, always an upper. It 
was so much like him to be helping out and doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 With both men in the twilight of their careers, fate brought them together 
again when they were traded to the San Francisco 49ers. Both retired in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he ran with the football, Simpson shifted into his new life without 
breaking stride. Quickly, he became a football commentator and ad pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
 Less is known about Cowlings' life after football. His name was listed this 
week on the mailbox of an apartment on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica, 
but a neighbor said he had only stopped by briefly in the last several months.  
</P>
<P>
 Friends reported that Cowlings had worked for a time as a bartender at a West 
Los Angeles steakhouse. In the late 1980s, he appeared in several episodes of 
an HBO sitcom starring Simpson, called "First and Ten." Simpson played the 
coach of a pro football team packed with overgrown adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit TV roll and other such favors from O.J. typified the relationship, said 
Tennyson, the San Francisco man who played high school ball with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. takes care of Al; he always has," Tennyson said. "He pushed him to get 
his grades up so he could go to USC, then he brought him to the Bills and then 
to the 49ers. Alan owes his career and pretty much everything else to O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, Cowlings became something of a bodyguard for his old pal and 
was a regular visitor at Simpson's Brentwood mansion. Simpson became a suave 
and honored man of the word, but Cowlings never polished down the rough edges 
of the street, Tennyson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never seemed to want to make something of himself, for himself," Tennyson 
said. "He was just content to hang out, have no responsibilities and rely on 
O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Cowlings was there with Simpson as always. Outside the Brentwood 
church where Nicole Simpson was eulogized, Cowlings stationed himself as 
gatekeeper and greeter. He waved familiar cars into the church parking lot, 
briefly questioned others and greeted many of the mourners with hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 When another friend read a note from Simpson Friday, the murder suspect 
thanked many people. But he saved a special line for Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially A.C.," Simpson wrote, "thanks for being in my life."

SHELLING KILLS 36 IN SOUTH YEMEN; 900 FOREIGNERS FLEE ADEN 
</P>

<P>
 Northern Yemeni forces bombarded the besieged southern stronghold of Aden, 
reportedly killing at least 36 people, as 900 foreigners who fled the city by 
ferry reached safety Friday in Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 The heavy fighting came despite northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh's 
announced willingness to agree to a cease-fire.But five previous truces 
declared during the 6-week-old civil war have failed within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kuwait News Agency, which has a correspondent in Aden, said the 36 dead, 
most of them civilians, were among 170 casualties recorded in the shelling of 
Aden over the previous 36 hours. It said more deaths were expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The north, which appeared to be tightening its noose around Aden, warned 
southern civilians to stay away from strategic targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil war erupted May 4 after the 4-year-old union of north and south 
collapsed amid feuding between Saleh and his former vice president, Ali Salim 
Bidh, the southern leader. Northern forces hold most of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The 900 foreign evacuees included Americans, Britons, Tunisians and 
Palestinians, said Jean Francois Golay of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuees arrived in Djibouti aboard the 250-foot ferry Canadian Spirit 
after sailing 155 miles overnight across the Gulf of Aden.

SUDAN TROOPS ROUT SOUTHERN REBELS; AFRICA: IN STUNNING REVERSAL OF FORTUNES, 
THREE-PRONGED ARMY ATTACK LEAVES INSURGENTS WITH ONLY ONE TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In their biggest offensive of this nation's decade-old civil war, government 
forces have routed southern rebels from several key towns and are driving 
toward the Ugandan border, Western and Arab diplomats said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels -- made up of Christians and pagans from the black south -- broke 
and ran last week from Kajo Kaji, their main supply center. They now control 
only one town, Nimule, on the White Nile. It too appears in danger of falling 
to the Arab-led Sudanese army, diplomats said, and if it does, the army could 
sweep along the Ugandan border and cut rebel supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the army's three-pronged attack, launched from garrisons in the 
southern towns of Juba, Wau and Malakal, represents a stunning reversal of 
fortunes for the Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, led by John Garang, 
who holds a doctorate in agriculture from the University of Iowa. Just three 
years ago the "outlaws," as the government calls the SPLA, held virtually all 
of southern Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan is a land unofficially divided between an Arabized, Islamic north and an 
impoverished, undeveloped and drought-stricken African south. Not so long ago, 
Garang, a former Sudanese army officer and member of the Dinka tribe, said his 
goal was to create a unified Sudan, not a separate state. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May, 1991, Garang lost his major patron with the overthrow of the 
Marxist Ethiopian government, which had offered his 20,000-guerrilla army 
sanctuary, weapons and a communications base. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, two of his chief lieutenants, Riak Machar and Lam Akol, 
criticizing Garang's dictatorial style, split from the SPLA. They set up a 
rival faction. And late last year, the Khartoum government -- increasingly 
under the influence of Islamic fundamentalists -- took on a dramatically more 
aggressive posture in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of last year, the government sat back and watched rival SPLA groups 
battle it out among each other. Meanwhile, it began recruiting students and 
young men, many religious zealots, from the north for a Popular Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months ago, the government sent them into battle with the bulk of its 
100,000-man army. Although publicly the government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan 
Ahmed Bashir denies wanting to subjugate the south, it has begun referring to 
the conflict as a jihad (holy war). 
</P>
<P>
 The Sudanese civil war, which raged between 1955 and 1972 and restarted in 
1983, was traditionally a matter of southerners killing southerners, as 85% of 
the Sudanese army -- including almost all its junior enlisted men -- are 
Africans from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the first time, Arab northerners are suffering substantial 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderates in the government are not displeased at the prospect of keeping 
young religious fanatics occupied in a war. Better that they be on the southern 
front, this reasoning goes, than here at home, where they could agitate for the 
creation of an even more radical Islamic society and could eventually pose a 
threat to Bashir's military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 In Khartoum, where large numbers of Arab and African Sudanese live together 
without incident, there has never been a sense of civil conflict. The war is 
seldom even mentioned in casual conversations, and when the government tried to 
organize demonstrations last week to celebrate the fall of Kajo Kaji, no more 
than a handful of supporters showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of towns it controlled, the SPLA does not appear in danger of 
collapsing, military analysts said. Garang, who now says he is fighting a 
secessionist war, can still return to the countryside -- where the conflict 
began -- and can be effective in hit-and-run attacks, particularly on the 
government's overextended supply lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The West has kept its distance from both sides in the civil war, neither of 
which has an enviable record as human rights advocates or effective combatants. 
When, for example, the SPLA tried to take Juba in May, 1992, numerous bodies 
turned up with slit throats. Among the dead were four Sudanese employees of 
AID, the U.S. government agency for international development. They were 
executed by government soldiers, U.S. diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks, last held in May and scheduled again for July in Nairobi, Kenya, 
have been fruitless.

HAITI SANCTIONS SHOW LEAKS IN SEVERAL KEY AREAS; CARIBBEAN: AIR FRANCE REFUSES 
TO JOIN AIR EMBARGO. GASOLINE PRICE FALLS, A SIGN SMUGGLING IS FLOURISHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The new, tighter economic sanctions that are supposed to drive the military 
out of power here are proving ineffective in key areas, including the refusal 
by a major Clinton Administration ally to shut down air service as part of the 
punitive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Air France, with French government approval, is adding flights, even 
as the rest of the international community stops service to Haiti next week. 
Air France is also considering substituting its giant Boeing 747s for the 737s 
that it normally flies here. 
</P>
<P>
 This would create a significant hole in the latest U.S. effort to isolate and 
punish the military regime and its civilian allies in an attempt to force the 
restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in a September, 
1991, coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other sanctions -- bans on the import of gasoline and other fuel oils and 
on financial transactions between the United States and Haiti -- are also not 
working as effectively as they were supposed to, evidence suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of smuggled gasoline, which exceeded $9 a gallon when the 
international fuel ban took effect May 22 and was still more than $8 a gallon a 
week ago, dropped Friday to as little as $6 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the lowest figure since early spring. Although it is a high price, it 
is still affordable for the wealthy elite who own most of the 60,000 cars 
registered here. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplies are "coming in by plane, by ship and over land -- it's wherever and 
whenever you want it," said a businessman involved in smuggling everything from 
gasoline to cosmetics. "If you want it, you can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian military sees the sanctions' growing ineffectiveness and the 
embarrassing action by the French, diplomats and Haitian political experts say, 
as another sign that the United States is either not serious about restoring 
Aristide or that it lacks international support to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcing their view is the continuing inaction by the United States to follow 
up on its stated policy of punishing the military's wealthy civilian supporters 
by withdrawing their U.S. visas and residence permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one of the members of the (four most powerful pro-military) families have 
been acted against," said a U.S. official, although the U.S. Embassy here has 
sent a list of people to the State Department for inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime source for fuel, as well as most other products that can be found in 
the shops and markets favored by the wealthy, is the neighboring Dominican 
Republic, diplomats and businessmen say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dominican Republic has been the chief leak in all previous sanctions 
efforts against Haiti, dating to the 1991 coup, when newly reelected Dominican 
President Joaquin Balaguer agreed to seal the border, but the Dominican 
military joined its Haitian colleagues to make millions of dollars by flouting 
that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on there (the border) is ridiculous," a foreign official here 
said. Dominican border troops "shoot little Haitians" who are smuggling goods 
across the frontier on foot by day but "allow trucks carrying tens of thousands 
of gallons of gas to cross at night." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been at least three such confirmed shootings, including at least 
two deaths this week at border points where businessmen say they have brought 
across contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a problem," one smuggler said. "You just get the cooperation of the 
(Dominican) captain." 
</P>
<P>
 He also spoke of continuing to bring in the raw materials for consumer 
products his factory produces and exporting them to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has at least six warships and two ocean-going speedboats to 
patrol the Haitian coasts with assistance from an Argentine destroyer and a 
Canadian frigate. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. Embassy officials say there have been several interdictions of 
Haiti-bound ships, dozens are getting through, business and other sources say, 
particularly at the southern port of Jacmel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport (in Port-au-Prince) is full of planes," one source said, "and 
freighters are still getting into Jacmel," which has one of the closest harbors 
and airports to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically speaking, in terms of maintaining Haiti's economy, breaking the 
air embargo is less important than the smuggling of fuel and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials have maintained this week that the 
impending end of air service was seriously affecting Haiti's rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 Air France's action, therefore, has brought howls of private protest from the 
United States and Aristide supporters, particularly because France is one of 
five countries assigned by the international community to oversee the 
pro-Aristide strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources say Air France had a weekly round-trip capacity of 560 
passengers. But starting with the June 24 cutoff of all other air traffic, the 
airline has tentative plans to increase its available seats to 2,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist agencies and Air France reported Friday that all the flights -- in and 
out, from spots such as Santo Domingo and Martinique -- are booked through 
July, including blocks of seats reserved by the United States for several 
hundred Haitians expected to receive political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 After an executive order issued on June 12 by President Clinton, all other 
international carriers agreed to cut off all passenger service to Haiti.  
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. sources said that Air France initially had agreed to the flight ban 
but changed its mind this week when the French Foreign Ministry said it could 
keep flying, at least until early September; officials said this would give 
French citizens here sufficient time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But other sources noted that this is a time of year when the Haitian elite 
traditionally spends large sums to vacation in France.

RWANDA PEACE TALKS STALL AFTER TROOPS, REBELS CONDUCT RAIDS

 U.N.-brokered peace talks in Rwanda stalled Friday after rebels killed a 
peacekeeper and a pro-government Hutu militia, blamed for widespread massacres, 
stormed a hotel sheltering refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The talks essentially stalled because of the day's events," the commander of 
U.N. forces in Rwanda, Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, told reporters.He said a date 
for resumption of the talks would be announced later. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks had been called to discuss prospects for implementing an 
African-mediated cease-fire and other ways of preventing ethnic slaughter that 
has already killed hundreds of thousands of people, mostly minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeeper, a Uruguayan major, was fatally injured and a Bangladeshi 
peacekeeper was wounded by a rebel rocket-propelled grenade fired from close 
range at their U.N.-marked vehicle about 13 miles north of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali, a Hutu militia stormed the Mille Collines hotel in the 
government-held city center in search of Tutsis who dominate the ranks of the 
rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front. Dallaire said no one was killed in the incident. 
Up to 600 people had taken refuge in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military spokesman Maj. Jean-Guy Plante said the hotel raid, in which the 
militia opened fire, appeared to be in retaliation for an overnight rebel raid 
on a militia-controlled religious complex from which they freed about 600 
refugees. U.N. officials said at least 40 people were killed in the raid.

U.S. WEIGHS BOOST IN FORCES IN S. KOREA TO COUNTER ANY INVASION BY THE NORTH; 
ASIA: OPTIONS RANGE FROM SENDING MORE SUPPORT TROOPS TO DEPLOYING DOZENS OF 
ADDITIONAL BOMBERS AND SHIPS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration must decide soon on how rapidly to strengthen U.S. 
armed forces in South Korea to deter or, if necessary, repel an invasion by 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his senior national security advisers are considering a 
package prepared by Defense Secretary William J. Perry that outlines options 
ranging from a modest increase in support troops to deployment of dozens of 
additional bombers and warships. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure for new military moves has been mounting. Although Congress has 
generally supported Clinton's response to North Korea's refusal to allow 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, some key Democrats and Republicans have 
begun to complain publicly that Clinton is not doing enough to prepare for 
possible war. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said any decision would probably be delayed as the 
Administration tries to untangle the confusion resulting from apparently 
erroneous statements on U.S. intentions made by former President Jimmy Carter 
at the end of his visit to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, traveling as a private citizen, told North Korean President Kim Il 
Sung that the Clinton Administration was suspending its drive for U.N. 
sanctions while it assessed a new compromise proposed Thursday by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, had already vowed to keep pressing for economic sanctions in 
response to North Korea's defiance of international safeguards against nuclear 
weapons proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton warned reporters Friday not to "overreact" to Carter's statement. "I 
gave my position yesterday and it hasn't changed," the President told reporters 
on a trip to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official acknowledged Friday that the Administration 
is worried that Carter's assertion to Kim could give other countries at the 
United Nations an excuse to drag their feet in considering the sanctions 
proposal, easing pressure on North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one reason why we moved . . . so quickly yesterday with a statement to 
say we are proceeding with consultations on sanctions at the U.N.," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Administration officials said they would hold up any further action on the 
North Korean offer until after today, when Carter leaves the North Korean 
capital of Pyongyang and can talk with them on a secure telephone line to 
provide more details of his conversations with Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Robert L. Gallucci, the Administration's point man on Korean 
issues, said no major decisions are likely until early next week, "assuming 
that we have good conversations, clear conversations with President Carter 
tomorrow or Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the military package presented to Clinton included 
these options: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sending more military support personnel to South Korea to make it easier for 
the services to deploy more combat and logistic troops to reinforce troops now 
in place, should North Korea invade the South. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deploying up to 40 more warplanes to the region, including F-117 
radar-evading Stealth bombers in South Korea and B-52 long-range bombers on 
Guam. The Navy would send an extra aircraft carrier to the area. And the Army 
and Marines would beef up their forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Making preparations for rapid deployment of substantial numbers of ground 
troops to the area as reinforcements, if war should break out. Gen. Gary E. 
Luck, U.S. commander in South Korea, has said he would need 400,000 more 
troops, besides the 37,000 Americans in position now, if North Korea were to 
invade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has also been taking steps to modernize existing forces and 
bolster supplies of spare parts and ammunition to facilitate the arrival of 
reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
have sent Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea, along with 
artillery-locating radar and dozens of Apache helicopters, intended to replace 
aging Cobra gunships that U.S. forces had been using. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, except for the addition of the Patriots, the bulk of the U.S. effort 
has been modest and barely visible. And some steps that Perry had said earlier 
he would take -- such as bolstering allied ammunition supplies -- have still 
not been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials have argued that they have kept the effort 
low-key for two reasons: They want to avoid provoking the North Koreans, who 
have warned that the mere imposition of sanctions might set off a war. And they 
want to mollify South Korea, which fears that a real mobilization would panic 
the country and hurt the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite North Korea's strident rhetoric, U.S. intelligence officers have 
reported that they have seen no unusual movements of troops or equipment in 
North Korea that might suggest that the country is gearing up for an invasion. 
"Everything looks normal," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration has been under mounting pressure from conservatives to 
beef up U.S. forces in South Korea, particularly in the face of North Korea's 
increasing threats of war as the United States began to press for U.N. 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of congressional unease over the U.S.-North Korean confrontation, 
the Senate voted, 93 to 3, Thursday to urge Clinton to bolster U.S. forces in 
South Korea to a level where they could "deter and if necessary repel an 
attack" from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 What is propelling the Administration most, however, is timing. U.S. 
commanders in the field figure that it would take at least several months to 
prepare allied forces there for reinforcements and ultimately to deploy extra 
troops and equipment -- and the clock is ticking fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials spent much of Friday trying to distance themselves 
from Carter. "President Carter carried no message from us, no message from the 
President . . . neither concessions nor threats," Gallucci, a State Department 
official, said.

 Evelyn Connors' paradise on earth is safe from city lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had threatened to cut the 50-foot-long strip of waist-high 
wildflowers that the 82-year-old woman has tended for 27 years, citing codes 
that say plants in uncultivated gardens can be no higher than one foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Susan Savage and a public works official toured the wildflower garden 
and decided that only a pink dogwood tree needed trimming among Connors' 
patches of buttercups, Jacob's ladders, blue larkspurs and purple yarrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wildflowers will remain intact. They're not a problem," Savage said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors said she was satisfied with the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can go ahead and do that, but they better not touch the wildflowers," 
she said. "They can trim a little, but I'll hit them over the head if they get 
reckless."

HEAT PERSISTS IN EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION

<P>
 Temperature records fell Friday as a shroud of hot, hazy, humid weather hung 
over the eastern half of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature in Milwaukee hit 94 degrees before noon, setting a record for 
the date for the third day in a row. The rest of Wisconsin also sweltered. 
Green Bay hit 94 to break a 73-year-old mark, and Madison set a record at 95. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to remember this when it's 30 below next winter," said Steve 
Struss, who wore a "Fun in the Sun" T-shirt during a visit to the Madison zoo 
with his wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo, N.Y., also set a record for the third straight day. The mercury there 
climbed to 93 degrees Friday and was expected to remain in the 90s today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the earliest we've ever hit 90 degrees four consecutive days," 
said Dave Sage, a National Weather Service meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities setting records included Burlington, Vt., 93; Cleveland, 93; 
Flint, Mich., 95; Concord, N.H., 96; Ft. Wayne, Ind., 98; and South Bend, Ind., 
97. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one heat-related death was reported. In Nashville, Tenn., a 
2-year-old died of heat stroke after accidentally being left for eight hours in 
a van that was supposed to transport him to a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, seven firefighters were overcome by heat from a fire at a sausage 
shop. They suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only work for a few minutes at a time in this kind of heat," said 
Battalion Chief Fred Van Dorne. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup soccer fans in Chicago faced a similar problem with the heat. 
Temperatures hit 90 and the humidity made it feel like 103. Spectators wore 
sombreros and sipped soft drinks, beer and pina coladas. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse, N.Y., opened its city pools early to cool down residents. On 
Thursday, some residents threw stones at firefighters who tried to turn off 
open fire hydrants.

COMMUTERS ADRIFT AS STRIKE IDLES LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD; LABOR: TALKS COLLAPSE, 
AND WALKOUT MAY WORSEN NEW YORK CONGESTION AT A BUSY TIME. GOV. CUOMO URGES 
FEDERAL ACTION TO FORCE RETURN OF WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Motormen and conductors on Friday struck the Long Island Rail Road, the 
nation's busiest commuter line, forcing more than 103,000 weekday riders to 
scramble to find ways to reach work and idling 725 trains along 701 miles of 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming at the beginning of a weekend, many people simply elected to stay home. 
But officials feared that if the strike continued into next week, major traffic 
jams and hardships could occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked President Clinton and Congress to quickly approve 
legislation forcing the strikers to return to their jobs during a 28-day 
cooling-off period and for binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The President urged both sides to resume "serious round-the-clock" bargaining, 
stating both the economic health of the region and the interest of passengers 
must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike comes at a busy time in New York. Thousands of gay men and lesbians 
began arriving in anticipation of Gay Games IV while 1.5 million New York 
Rangers fans, by police estimate, jammed lower Manhattan on Friday to cheer the 
Stanley Cup winners, who rode in a ticker-tape parade up Broadway to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration of the Rangers' National Hockey League championship -- the 
team's first in 54 years -- could presage another parade, many basketball fans 
hope. The New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets are locked in close combat in 
the National Basketball Assn. finals. 
</P>
<P>
 What normally would be a mere trip up an escalator to Madison Square Garden 
after a ride to Pennsylvania Station aboard the Long Island Rail Road was 
turned into a major struggle for thousands of suburban fans attending game five 
at the Garden on Friday night. Some left their cars in outlying areas and took 
the subway to the game. Others drove in and jammed nearby garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between members of the United Transportation Union and management 
collapsed after about 14 hours of negotiations at the Huntington Hilton in 
Melville, Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 1:30 a.m. EDT on Friday, Edward Yule Jr., the union's general 
chairman, announced rejection of the railroad's final offer of a pay increase 
of about 12.5% over four years. Union negotiators demanded 17% over 52 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be stepped on by management," Yule said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor disputes are nothing new to the Long Island Rail Road, and based on 
their experience during the last strike, which lasted 11 days in January, 1987, 
some corporations and commuters made elaborate preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Large banks and businesses like Citibank and Chemical Bank reserved blocks of 
hotel rooms in Manhattan -- a scarce commodity given the preparations for the 
Gay Games and Cultural Festival, which holds opening ceremonies tonight. A 
massive march is scheduled a week from Sunday to commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of the Stonewall bar riot that helped launch the gay rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies like McGraw-Hill hired its own fleet of buses for the trip from 
Long Island while many commuters drove to subway stations in Brooklyn and 
Queens and then took mass transit to Manhattan. Others formed car pools with 
neighbors and drove to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we cannot replicate the service," said Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman 
for the Long Island Rail Road. "We would need 13,000 buses or more to handle 
all of the passengers. But with the assistance of the New York City Transit 
Authority and other bus companies, we are providing some bus service that will 
connect to subways and hopefully handle some of the customers that way." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last strike, railroad officials said 65% of their riders tried to 
make connections with the subway system. About 20,000 commuters drove to their 
jobs, creating in some cases traffic jams at tunnels and bridges. Still others 
simply decided to take vacations or to stay with relatives in Manhattan.

CLINTON PUSHES CRIME BILL IN CHICAGO TOUR; LEGISLATION: HE UNDERSCORES THE NEED 
FOR ACTION DURING A VISIT TO A VIOLENT HOUSING PROJECT. HIS MEASURE REMAINS 
BOGGED DOWN IN CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton traveled to one of the nation's most violent housing 
projects Friday as he sought to generate support for the Administration's 
anti-crime bill, still mired in Congress months after the President had hoped 
to sign it into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of a display of automatic weapons seized during 
controversial sweeps of buildings at the Robert Taylor Homes on Chicago's south 
side, Clinton said that "the Congress cannot walk away from this." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an enormous opportunity," Clinton said. "This will be the most major 
piece of anti-crime legislation ever passed by the United States Congress, 
beyond question. It must pass and it ought to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The House and Senate have approved differing versions of the measure and 
legislators have been trying to reconcile the two. Both versions would ban 19 
specific types of assault weapons, including many that Clinton saw during a 
quick tour led by Chicago Housing Authority police Sgt. Rogelio Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the weapons, Watson said, pointing to his own chest, "has the capacity 
to penetrate this body armor, through the rear exit, and maybe, if two other 
people are standing behind me, it'll go right on through" them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robert Taylor Homes, a vast collection of high-rise buildings south of 
this city's downtown, are among the most crime-ridden and violent housing 
projects in the nation. Indeed, when White House advance staff members arrived 
here to plan Clinton's trip, telephone company officials said that they would 
not go into the project to install the usual White House telephone lines 
without a police escort, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton used the visit to deliver a homily on the need to combine America's 
traditional concern for individual rights with an emphasis on community 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot survive as a people if our children cannot grow up safe and free 
from fear in good schools, on safe streets, doing wholesome, constructive 
things," Clinton told an enthusiastic audience of residents gathered on a 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk a lot in this country about our rights and our rights as Americans 
are the most important thing to us," he added. "But the thing that makes our 
rights work is the right of the community to exist and the responsibilities of 
citizens to help them exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep inside the spirit of you, all of you who live here, is the overwhelming 
desire not only to exercise your rights but to see this community be full of 
responsible citizens, to make the community work again." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also touted major provisions of the crime bill, including the funds it 
would provide for 100,000 new police officers across the nation. It also 
contains additional money for crime prevention programs, including drug 
treatment centers, youth basketball leagues and other recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Republicans have opposed much of the new prevention money, 
arguing that it is merely a disguised way to increase spending on urban social 
programs. But Clinton argued that the funds are important because they "will 
really give young people a chance to say 'yes' to something and not just to say 
'no' to something." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton sidestepped the most contentious item in the current congressional 
debate -- a fight over the so-called Racial Justice Act, a provision passed by 
the House that would allow defendants to challenge death penalties by using 
statistical evidence showing racial disparities in the way it is applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the provision, including a majority of the Senate, have argued 
that it effectively would end the death penalty in most states. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the controversy, Clinton said only that he wanted to "give the 
conferees a chance to work through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both in remarks to reporters after his tour and in his speech, Clinton 
strongly endorsed another controversial idea -- police sweeps designed to 
locate weapons in apartments in the project. Earlier this year, a federal court 
banned the sweeps, saying that they violated residents' constitutional rights. 
The Chicago Housing Authority, with Clinton's backing, then introduced a 
modified sweeps policy that is also being challenged in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the President opened the World Cup soccer tournament before 
60,000 fans at Soldier Field. Sporting a colorful World Cup tie, he called love 
of the game "a universal language."

PARENTS HONOR CAR PAYMENTS MORE THAN CHILD SUPPORT, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents are more likely to fall behind on child support than on car payments, 
a study released Friday by the Children's Defense Fund said. 
</P>
<P>
 The advocacy group said the national delinquency rate for used-car loans was 
less than 3% in 1992, while the delinquency rate for child support owed to 
mothers was 49% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 For its report, the group surveyed the performance of state child support 
enforcement agencies, which serve families on welfare and non-welfare families 
who ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that after a decade of federal and state government efforts to 
improve child support enforcement, progress has been slow, state agencies are 
swamped, and millions of children are not getting the support they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has estimated that $34 billion goes uncollected every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Children's Defense Fund findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Child support payments were made in 14.7% of cases in 1983. By 1992, the 
rate edged up to 18.7% of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-welfare child support caseloads have nearly quadrupled, from 1.7 million 
in 1983 to almost 6.5 million in 1992. Overall, agencies more than doubled 
their caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the current rate of improvement, it would be more than 180 years before 
each child served by a state agency could be guaranteed even a partial support 
payment.

FDA CITES RED CROSS FOR VIOLATIONS AT BLOOD BANK; SAFETY: A MIAMI FACILITY 
DISTRIBUTED BLOOD EVEN THOUGH SOME DONORS' MEDICAL RECORDS WERE INCOMPLETE. 
OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS NO HEALTH RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The American Red Cross' regional blood bank for South Florida distributed 18 
pints of blood in a two-month period last year even though the medical records 
of the donors were incomplete, federal investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators with the Food and Drug Administration found that some of the 
blood distributed between May 2 and July 6, 1993, was used in transfusions 
before the Red Cross issued a recall. Missing information included donors' 
vital signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross said there had been no health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dr. Mark Simpson, director of transfusion services at George 
Washington University Medical Center, said: "When you're not keeping records 
properly . . . there would be some increased risk of a defective product 
getting through." He reviewed the report at the request of the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA investigators discovered numerous violations of safety rules at the Miami 
center, which receives donations of about 100,000 pints of blood a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 25 report cited the "failure of laboratory personnel to follow 
criteria specified by local operating procedure" and of the blood bank to "have 
an adequate monitoring system in place . . . for documenting the final 
disposition of blood components." 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the three-page report was provided by the office of Sen. Bob Graham 
(D-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
 A Red Cross official in Washington said the problems at the Miami center did 
not endanger the blood supplies. "If public health had been at risk, we would 
have moved to shut it down," Felix Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami blood bank's top official, Steven Nathan, said some of the lapses 
have been corrected and the remainder will be done by July 1, when a Red Cross 
review of its blood bank procedures nationwide is partly completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the report, the Red Cross submitted to the FDA on April 14 a 
plan of corrective action for the Miami blood bank, FDA spokeswoman Monica 
Revelle said. She said the plan "appeared satisfactory." Details of the plan 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA licenses blood banks and monitors their compliance with the safety 
rules, which are designed to ensure that the blood collected from donors for 
transfusions is free of blood-borne diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the FDA report's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * There were no records showing the final disposition of 2,850 units of blood 
components, including 197 units that had tested positive for viruses or had 
been rejected by laboratory technicians for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood components include plasma, the liquid part of blood, and platelets, 
small disks that help blood to clot. A pint of whole blood often is separated 
into two or three components that are given to different transfusion patients, 
thereby multiplying the risk of contracting blood-borne diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 * The center neglected to have on file the necessary FDA approval to 
distribute autologous blood in interstate commerce. That is blood transfused 
from people who wish to store it for their own possible use in an emergency. 
Autologous blood supplies sometimes are shipped across state lines when the 
individual who stored them needs specialized treatment in a hospital in another 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 * The center's procedures for irradiating blood and components, used for 
certain types of transfusions, do not include instructions to change the 
expiration date of irradiated blood to 28 days. Investigators found irradiated 
blood marked with its original expiration dates, which were too far in the 
future.

HUNDREDS FLEE TOXIC CHEMICAL EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A toxic chemical exploded at a plant Friday, creating a poisonous cloud that 
forced the evacuation of hundreds of people. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 173 people were taken to local hospitals, most suffering mild 
respiratory problems.All were released after treatment. There were no serious 
injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The compound spilled and ignited at PCR Inc. after a line that was being used 
to transfer it from a tanker truck ruptured, said Keith Baucom, a vice 
president at Harris Specialty Chemicals, PCR's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews evacuated a six-square-mile area around the plant, including a 
housing development. The evacuees were allowed to return home by Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The compound, trichlorosilane, is used in a variety of chemical products, 
including silicone, said Scott Seeburger, a spokesman for Dow Corning Corp. It 
can cause burns to the eyes and skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters battled the blaze at the plant for three hours before they were 
able to seal off the leak.

5 BRANCH DAVIDIANS GET 40-YEAR TERMS; COURTS: JUDGE DELIVERS MAXIMUM PRISON 
SENTENCES TO CULT MEMBERS HE DECLARES UNREMORSEFUL. LIGHTER PENALTIES GO TO 
THREE OTHER DEFENDANTS IN SHOOTOUT. 
</P>

<P>
 Declaring them unremorseful, a federal judge Friday gave maximum 40-year 
prison terms to five Branch Davidians for their roles in the deaths last year 
of four federal agents who stormed their compound outside Waco. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. gave lighter terms of five, 15 and 20 
years to three others where mitigating circumstances seemed to apply. All the 
defendants were assessed fines of varying amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The five defendants who were given maximum sentences had been convicted last 
February of voluntary manslaughter and weapons violations committed during a 
shootout on Feb. 28, 1993. Six cult members and four Treasury Department agents 
died that day as 75 agents tried to serve an arrest warrant on David Koresh, 
leader of the Branch Davidian cult, on charges of illegal weapons possession in 
his heavily fortified compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants who received lighter terms were convicted of lesser charges. 
Still another three defendants were cleared of all charges. All 11 had been 
charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury forewoman Sara Bain, who attended Smith's two-day sentencing hearing in a 
non-official capacity, told reporters outside the courthouse that the jurors 
did not understand that the lesser charges carried such heavy penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bain, in tears, said that she was "just crushed" by the sentences, calling 
them "entirely too severe."  
</P>
<P>
 Under mandatory sentencing guidelines approved by Congress, the weapons charge 
-- carrying a weapon in the commission of a violent crime -- is punishable by a 
maximum of 30 years in prison. At the request of prosecutors and over the 
objections of defense attorneys, Smith imposed the maximum sentences on grounds 
that automatic weapons, the most destructive kind, were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 He added 10-year terms for voluntary manslaughter for cult members Renos 
Avraam, Brad Branch, Jamie Castillo, Livingston Fagan and Kevin Whitecliff. The 
judge also levied fines against them ranging from $2,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, although acknowledging that his office had been inundated in recent 
weeks with pleas for leniency from friends and supporters of the defendants, 
said that the punishment was proper because "these defendants engaged in 
conspiracy to cause the death of federal agents."  
</P>
<P>
 He added that "not one single defendant apologized or expressed any real 
sorrow for the dead or injured agents." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while some Branch Davidians asked for leniency, others had stood 
before Smith on Thursday and hurled personal insults at him, blaming the 
government for the agents' deaths. Most said that they had nothing to apologize 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith imposed a lesser sentence of 20 years on Graeme Craddock, who was 
convicted on a single charge of possessing a hand grenade, and fined him 
$2,000. Craddock had told the judge that he had never intended to hurt anyone 
and asked for credit because he had told the truth and cooperated with 
authorities after the government's long standoff with the cult ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Fatta received a 15-year sentence -- five years for unlawfully 
manufacturing and possessing machine guns and 10 years for aiding and abetting 
Koresh in possessing the machine guns. He was also fined $50,000. Fatta was at 
a gun show in Austin, Tex., on the day of the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Riddle, a Canadian and the only woman among the defendants, was given a 
five-year prison sentence and fined $2,500 for carrying a rifle during the 
shootout. The judge described her as easily manipulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 28 shootout was followed by a 51-day standoff that ended when FBI 
agents invaded the compound with armored vehicles and injected tear gas into 
the frame buildings. Koresh and more than 80 of his followers, including women 
and children, died when fires allegedly set by Koresh's top aides engulfed the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A county coroner reported that many bodies bore gunshot wounds from automatic 
weapons that were stored inside the compound.  
</P>
<P>
 In a critical report last fall, federal investigators said that the initial 
raid should have been scrubbed after officials of the Treasury's Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms learned that the Davidians had been tipped off 
that it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial last winter, defense lawyers argued that the Treasury agents 
died when cult members merely sought to defend themselves against an 
unwarranted intrusion into their peace-loving, God-fearing community. The 
lawyers also portrayed Koresh as a charismatic leader whose insistence that the 
federal government was bent on destroying his cult was accepted blindly by many 
cult members.  
</P>
<P>
 Several attorneys who are appealing the convictions said that they also would 
appeal the sentences.

GOP SLIGHTS GOV. CARLSON, ENDORSES RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans turned their backs Friday on Gov. Arne Carlson and gave their 
endorsement to former state legislator Allen Quist, a strong advocate of 
traditional family values who enjoyed widespread support from religious and 
social conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quist endorsement by delegates to the Independent Republican convention 
was a major embarrassment for the sitting GOP governor and sets the stage for a 
fractious primary contest between the two men in September.It could leave the 
party divided and demoralized, which some Republicans fear could hurt them in 
other races here in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist's victory marked the third time in three weeks that religious and social 
conservatives had emerged victorious in intra-party contests, although the 
dynamics of the fight here were different from battles the last two weekends in 
Virginia and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson did not receive the endorsement of the party four years ago and later 
lost the primary. Nonetheless, he got on the November ballot when the candidate 
who won the primary was forced to quit the race after sexual allegations were 
raised against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, who supports abortion rights and signed a gay rights bill as 
governor, long has tangled with conservatives in his party. His inattention to 
his Republican constituents made him ripe to a challenge this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quist shocked many longtime Republican leaders in the state by 
overwhelming the precinct and county caucuses that led to this weekend's state 
convention, bringing many first-time participants -- many citing concerns about 
the moral deterioration of the country and abortion -- into the political 
process.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON AD BLASTS FEINSTEIN'S SHIFT ON 
HEALTH CARE; SENATOR IS LAMBASTED FOR DROPPING HER SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
PLAN. HER SPOKESMAN SAYS SHE CHANGED HER STANCE TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY ON THE 
ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Multimillionaire Republican Senate nominee Michael Huffington has launched his 
first television ad of the general election campaign, one that picks up where 
his hard-hitting primary campaign left off with a stinging rebuke of Democratic 
incumbent Dianne Feinstein.  
</P>
<P>
 The ad targets Feinstein for backing away from her initial sponsorship of 
President Clinton's health care bill. By extension, it delivers a smarting and 
personal attack on Feinstein's career in politics and asserts that she changed 
positions for political expediency. 
</P>
<P>
 "On May 25, Feinstein flip-flopped and deserted the health plan," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only principle of a career politician -- save your own skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, characterized the ad as a 
continuation of Huffington's attempt to buy the votes of Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one principle Mr. Huffington is running on -- to spend his 
father's money . . . millions of dollars, to try to buy the election and trying 
to do it with more negative, negative, negative ads," Kuwata said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange marked the escalation of what for weeks has been a tense 
confrontation between the two candidates, who are jointly expected to break all 
records for spending in a Senate race. In the primary, Huffington set a record 
for spending by giving $6.3 million of his own money by the third week of May. 
</P>
<P>
 During the primary campaign, the one-term congressman from Santa Barbara 
virtually ignored his fellow Republican, former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of 
Fullerton, and focused his firepower on Feinstein. Feinstein initially sought 
to ignore Huffington but just before the primary joined the battle by launching 
ads that accused the Republican of avoiding California income taxes by keeping 
Texas as his legal residence. Texas has no income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington responded a day later, accusing Feinstein of failing to pay income 
taxes for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate had evidence of wrongdoing: Huffington said he was operating 
within the law when he listed Texas as his residence even though his wife and 
children lived in California. And Feinstein did not owe taxes for the three 
years he cited because of huge medical bills accrued shortly before the death 
of her second husband and because of later financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest dust-up centers on Feinstein's initial support of the President's 
health care plan. Last fall, she co-sponsored the Administration plan to reform 
the nation's health care system. In late May, she withdrew her support. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said Feinstein's action stemmed from a desire to maintain flexibility 
as the health care package that is moving through Congress changes from its 
initial framework. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to move the process along initially," he said, adding that now 
"there's no one around who believes that this is going to be the final 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to have the ability to fight for California and what's in 
California's interest. What the hell does Michael Huffington stand for?" 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign spokeswoman, Peggy Bengs, said the congressman wants a 
health care plan that would allow workers to carry insurance from job to job, 
would exclude restrictions on pre-existing conditions, would standardize 
insurance forms, reform the legal system and most importantly be run by private 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington has offered no details on how such a plan might be accomplished 
and has not signed on to any of the Republican health care reform bills 
circulating in Washington, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, Huffington speaks harshly of the federal government, saying the 
"government that gave us the welfare mess now wants to screw up health care." 
He also flatly contends that "the Clinton plan takes away your right to choose 
your doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter statement is in dispute. The Clinton plan would give health care 
recipients the choice of several health care plans made up of large groups of 
doctors. Patients signing up for a plan that includes their doctor would not 
lose access to the physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spokeswoman Bengs said the congressman believes that access to a 
physician of choice would eventually be denied to patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The health care ad marks the second time that Huffington has attempted to 
diminish Feinstein by linking her with a program advocated by President 
Clinton. Earlier in the campaign, he targeted her support for the 1993 budget.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN'S NEW AD BLAMES WILSON FOR STATE'S 
RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unveiling her first television advertisement since she won the Democratic 
nomination for governor, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown continued her attempts 
Wednesday to blame Gov. Pete Wilson for California's recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several earlier Brown commercials, the latest 30-second ad -- which began 
airing Wednesday night -- depicts the state as a place where even hard-working 
people struggle and where economic uncertainty thrives. The ad also repeats a 
statistic that has become Brown's mantra in recent weeks: the number of jobs 
that have been lost during Wilson's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Pete Wilson became governor, California's lost 550,000 jobs. That's 
550,000 people cut loose. Five hundred fifty thousand dreams fading away," a 
narrator intones as the camera pans a crowd of apparently unemployed workers. 
"Now Pete Wilson wants to keep his job. But what's he done to protect yours?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitehurst, Brown's campaign spokesman, said the ad is intended to remind 
voters that "Californians deserve more than pink slips, budget IOUs and 
foreclosure notices. We need a governor who will fight to restore California's 
promise." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst said the Brown campaign will spend $200,000 to air the ad in Los 
Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and the Central Valley for "at least a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the day after the primary election, Wilson unveiled two new ads 
that acknowledged the tough financial circumstances that have wracked the state 
and sent his job-approval ratings plummeting. But he did not accept blame, 
choosing instead to paint himself as the candidate who is best prepared to 
solve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The national recession and defense cuts have hit California hard," the ads 
began. "Nobody understands that better than Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about Brown's new ad, Dan Schnur, the spokesman for Wilson's 
reelection campaign, said that by continuing to focus on bashing the Republican 
incumbent, Brown is failing to define herself in the minds of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown continues to point to problems without proposing solutions," 
he said. "The people of California are smart enough to know that the recession 
is caused by factors that are national and international in scope and beyond 
the control of any one individual. They're also smart enough to look for a 
leader who's willing to do more than complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur predicted: "That's the way this campaign is going to run. Kathleen 
Brown raises questions, Pete Wilson provides answers. Kathleen Brown complains 
about job loss. Pete Wilson talks about . . . the way to put California back to 
work is to reform workers' comp, to streamline the permitting process and make 
California an attractive place to do business again. You're going to see that 
repeated over and over between now and Election Day."

PARENTS OF BOY MAULED BY RAT ARE CONVICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless couple whose infant son was bitten 110 times by a starving pet rat 
were convicted Friday of child neglect charges, but jurors deadlocked on 
whether the parents also were guilty of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for Kathyleen and Steven Giguere said they believe the 
jury's verdict was a partial vindication for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad enough that they lost their baby but to have a jury say that you 
killed your baby and to have to live with that for the rest of their lives was 
really weighing on their minds," said defense attorney Salvatore Ciulla. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were arrested Aug. 26 after their 4-month-old son, Steven Jr., was 
found dead in a trash-strewn, roach-infested station wagon where the family was 
living with a pet rat named Homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen, 31, and Steven Giguere Sr., 28, face up to six years in prison when 
they are sentenced July 18. Under sentencing guidelines, they would not face 
any additional prison time if convicted of manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, it appears unlikely that prosecutors will seek a retrial on the 
outstanding count, but Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki said the 
decision will be made before the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for three days, jurors deadlocked 9 to 3 Friday in favor of 
convicting the couple of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury foreman Steve Markley said the case was a draining one for jurors, who 
pored over graphic autopsy photos of the infant's mauled body and had to make 
tough judgments about parents who allowed their children to live in such filthy 
conditions.  
</P>
<P>
 Jurors had little trouble finding the parents guilty of neglect, he said. 
During the trial, jurors heard testimony that the parents spent much of their 
money on liquor and junk food and were seemingly oblivious to their unkempt 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors were unable to reconcile conflicting evidence on whether the rat 
had killed the infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that the child bled to death after the rat's sharp teeth 
struck an artery. Defense attorneys said the boy died from sudden infant death 
syndrome before the rat attacked and called it a "freak accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Giguere of La Mirada said she feels sympathy for her son and 
daughter-in-law, but said the couple are responsible for her grandson's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel they should have been found guilty for what happened to the baby," she 
said, adding that the couple have lived irresponsibly over the years. "It's 
very hard to look at them. You think, how could they do this to their child?" 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests show that the parents had traces of the drug methamphetamine in 
their systems at the time of the death, and the father admitted using marijuana 
the day before the baby died. Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino barred 
testimony about drug use.

PHILIP VERA CRUZ; HELPED CHAVEZ FOUND THE UFW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Vera Cruz, the veteran Filipino American labor leader who joined Cesar 
Chavez in founding the United Farm Workers union, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Cruz, 89, died June 11 from complications of lung surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 During the farm worker strikes of the 1960s, Vera Cruz helped unite Filipino 
and Mexican laborers, which turned the union into a major force in the American 
labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it as a duty to fight for the union," he told The Times in 1992, then 
retired and picking grapes only in his garden. "I was just doing what I had to 
do. The union helps the workers, and I'm one of them. I wanted to give my fair 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the Philippines, Vera Cruz immigrated to the United States in 1926, 
hoping to go to college and become a lawyer. Instead, committed to supporting 
his parents, brother and sister, he worked in the fields and factories on the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, he joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee of the 
AFL-CIO and led the successful Filipino farm workers' strikes in Coachella and 
Delano. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined forces with Chavez to form the UFW that year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two leaders drifted apart. Vera Cruz thought Chavez failed to give 
proper credit to the Filipinos for beginning the labor movement. Finally, in 
1977, Vera Cruz resigned his union post, incensed by Chavez's visit to the 
Philippines, where President Ferdinand E. Marcos had declared martial law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cesar's trip to a dictatorship . . . was in direct contradiction to those 
principles we stood for," Vera Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez died April 23, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the UFW, Vera Cruz moved to Bakersfield and often spoke to 
college students about labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a year after Marcos was overthrown, Vera Cruz returned to his 
homeland to accept an award from then-President Corazon Aquino for his 
contributions to the Filipino community. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Cruz is survived by his companion, Deborah Vollmer, a sister and a 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled in Bakersfield on July 1.

JOHNNY DOWNS, 81; 'OUR GANG,' MUSICAL COMEDY ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnny Downs, the all-American boy of 23 silent "Our Gang" comedies who grew 
up to be a successful song and dance man, has died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs, who more recently appeared on children's television in San Diego, died 
June 6 of cancer at his Coronado home. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Our Gang" film series was launched in 1922 by the legendary Hal Roach and 
continued until 1944. One hundred of the 221 short films were later broadcast 
on television as "The Little Rascals." Downs' appearance in the films began 
with "The Champeen" in 1923 and ended as he outgrew the role with "Chicken 
Feed" in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a memorable experience," he once said about the "Our Gang" films. "I 
think we had a privileged childhood working in those films. It was great fun, 
and certainly had no ill effects on my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Never leaving show business, Downs waited out his "awkward" teen years by 
performing vaudeville song and dance acts with "Our Gang" colleague Mary 
Kornman. He also won juvenile roles in two Broadway shows, "Growing Pains" and 
"Strike Me Pink" starring Jimmy Durante. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Hollywood, the older and still good-looking Downs was cast in a 
string of lightweight campus musicals. Among them were "Pigskin Parade," 
"College Holiday," "Junior Prom," "Turn Off the Moon," "Hold That Co-ed," 
"Hawaiian Nights," "Melody and Moonlight" and "Harvest Rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 The typecast Downs watched his popularity fizzle as World War II approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the college-boy type," he once said. "A war was shaping up and 
producers and the public suddenly wanted its heroes to act and look more like 
Bogart and Cagney." 
</P>
<P>
 Downs was shut out of films for a decade, returning to Broadway for one hit, 
"Are You With It," and then working in summer stock. 
</P>
<P>
 When lighter musical comedy films regained popularity in the 1950s, Downs was 
again in demand. He landed roles in "Here Come the Girls," "Call Me Madam," 
"The Stars and Stripes Forever," "Cruisin' Down the River" and "The Caddy." 
</P>
<P>
 Downs spent his last working years as host of television shows aimed at 
children in the San Diego area, where he had grown up. On one show, he played 
Johnny Jet, greeting young viewers with "Howdy, howdy, howdy, guys and gals." 
</P>
<P>
 Downs is survived by his wife, June, and five children: Mary of Springfield, 
Mo.; Claudia of Newport Beach; John and Molly, both of Coronado, and Maureen of 
Encinitas.

L.A. SEEKS TO ACCELERATE EVICTION OF SQUATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles city attorneys are looking for a way to speed up legal proceedings 
to clear squatters and scavengers out of vacant, quake-damaged apartment 
buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood and to seal the structures, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactics for eliminating the "ghost towns" of vacant buildings that have become 
a haven for vandals, drug users and prostitutes were discussed Friday at a City 
Hall meeting of a special task force assigned to battle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Los Angeles Police Department, the Building and Safety 
Department, the Housing Department and other agencies who participated in the 
meeting plan to outline a strategy and submit a report Tuesday to an ad-hoc 
earthquake recovery committee of the Los Angeles City Council, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, attorneys for the city were asked by other city officials 
to investigate whether they can shorten the normal 45-day process that building 
and safety officials need to clear and board up vacant buildings that have 
become a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said it is unclear whether the city can bill property owners for 
the cost if the notification process is shortened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not sure if we will be able to put liens on the properties," said Pat 
Bonino, a chief analyst for the city administrative office. "There are some 
fine legal points about what the Building and Safety Department can do." 
</P>
<P>
 If the property owners cannot be forced to reimburse the city for the cost of 
securing the vacant buildings, Bonino said, the city may consider paying the 
bills by using some of the $20 million in discretionary quake relief funds from 
the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said officials will continue to press the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to help pay for the effort, even though FEMA officials have already 
indicated that the problem does not qualify for disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern among city officials is that police may not have enough 
officers to sweep all the problem buildings before they are sealed, suggesting 
that the city may have to hire security guards to assist in the sweeps, said 
Gary Squier, general manager of the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials are considering using the HUD funding to pay for the 
security guards needed for such sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held after city officials instructed administrators Wednesday 
to come up with a plan to deal with the growing problem of scavengers, 
squatters, vandals, drug users and others taking up residence in vacant 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials have identified 10 clusters of vacant quake-damaged 
buildings, which they dubbed "ghost towns," in the hardest hit areas of the 
Valley and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and owners of businesses near the vacant buildings say they fear the 
blight and crime of "ghost towns" will spread.

STATE HAS WASTED MILLIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS, REPORT SAYS; SPENDING: 
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BLAMES MISMANAGEMENT, DELAYS, SOARING COSTS AND 
BUREAUCRATS' LACK OF EXPERTISE IN COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State agencies, enamored with computer technology and its promise of 
streamlining government, have wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on huge, 
complex systems that they had neither the knowledge nor the technical ability 
to manage, a new legislative report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen multimillion-dollar projects have either failed or are 
seriously in trouble because there has been no effective system for overseeing 
and managing them, said the report by the nonpartisan legislative analyst's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net effect of these problems is an annual expenditure for information 
technology which is not producing an optimum return on the state's investment," 
the report said. "In many cases it's not even producing a reasonably good 
return on investment." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the legislative analyst's office, projects in trouble face huge 
cost overruns -- sometimes doubling or tripling the original costs -- long 
delays in getting the systems up and running and, worst of all, an inability to 
function as their designers had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Bob Dell'Agostino, an information technology expert in the 
legislative analyst's office, the 23-page document provides the first detailed 
overview of state government's investment in computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
 It paints a generally critical picture of bureaucrats who invested vast sums 
in computer systems without knowing which systems were best for their needs and 
how to manage them once they were in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's had the cruise control on and the credit card out but no one's 
had a road map when it comes to these purchases," said Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). "This report really highlights the fact we need to 
use technology to restructure government and not just building a series of 
multimillion-dollar filing cabinets to store information." 
</P>
<P>
 The report flagged 11 projects, representing a state investment over time of 
about $1.3 billion, which it said were now in trouble because of a lack of 
management expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest is an $800-million Department of Social Services project designed 
to provide a statewide system for computerizing data on welfare cases. The 
report said the project, now scheduled to be implemented over a 12-year period, 
has been hampered by cost overruns and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same department, an $80-million automated information system to be used 
by counties in administering child welfare services is three years behind 
schedule. Similarly, a computer system that was expected to provide a tool for 
law enforcement seeking parents who failed to pay child support has soared in 
costs from $140.8 million to $152.2 million and experienced "significant 
schedule slippage." 
</P>
<P>
 The extreme example, and the one that has prompted both the analyst's and the 
Legislature's scrutiny of the state's entire computer network, is a $44-million 
project undertaken by the Department of Motor Vehicles to coordinate driver's 
license data with vehicle registration information. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has recently abandoned that much-delayed project after 
determining that it could not make it work without the expenditure of another 
$153 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The report takes to task Gov. Pete Wilson's Administration and its 
predecessors for providing insufficient oversight of computer projects and 
suggests several legislative actions to better control future computer 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson recently announced plans to appoint a task force on government 
technology policy and procurement to conduct its own examination of the state's 
information systems. Appointments to the task force are expected to be 
announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative analyst's report criticized the Administration for the lack of 
an effective centralized management system and said it has left state agencies 
free to establish a helter-skelter network of systems that frequently do not 
interact and often duplicate one another's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the level of technical expertise varies widely from agency to 
agency and that many agencies that embark on large, complex projects lack the 
knowledge and experience needed to design, test and implement their systems.  
</P>
<P>
 "The long list of troubled and failed projects over the past 20 years offers 
mute testimony to this fact," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is compounded because the Office of Information Technology, the 
state agency that has authority to review computer project proposals, often 
lacks the technical ability to determine whether a particular proposal is 
indeed the "most feasible and cost-effective solution," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It recommended that the Legislature require the Administration to bar agencies 
that lack necessary technical expertise from initiating computer projects and 
that it set up a process for certifying those agencies that do have the ability 
to implement projects.

HILL GOES INTO SECLUSION AFTER CONVICTION; LEGISLATURE: THE WHITTIER SENATOR IS 
EXPECTED TO RESIGN HIS SEAT BUT COULD BE EXPELLED FROM SENATE IF HE DOES NOT. 
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY ON POLITICAL CORRUPTION CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State Sen. Frank Hill of Whittier, found guilty of political corruption 
charges, disappeared from public view Friday amid speculation over whether he 
would voluntarily resign or face potential expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to the veteran Republican lawmaker said they did not know his 
whereabouts but believed that he had gone into seclusion with his wife and 
children in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Other legislators, who rarely shrink from offering observations on virtually 
any issue, refused to discuss Hill's situation, although expectations in the 
Capitol were that he would resign soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, was convicted Thursday of using his office as a member of the 
Assembly in 1988 to extort $2,500 from an FBI agent posing as a businessman in 
an FBI investigation of political corruption in the Capitol. He faces a prison 
sentence that could exceed six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention swung Friday to the nature and timing of Hill's expected resignation 
from the San Gabriel Valley seat he has held since 1990. Under the law, Gov. 
Pete Wilson has 14 days after a vacancy occurs to call a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said through spokeswoman Karen Caves 
that he was consulting other members of the Senate Rules Committee and the 
Legislature's lawyer on what courses of action may be available to the Senate 
and Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 It was learned that Lockyer and Hill, a popular and affable legislator, had 
spoken by telephone Thursday night but neither could be reached for comment 
about what was said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, a highly placed source suggested that Hill may have the option of 
delaying his resignation until he is sentenced Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other elected state officials, legislators are not required to 
surrender their offices upon conviction. The state Constitution empowers the 
Assembly and Senate to determine the suitability of their members and provides 
for expulsion of a member by a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source said there was speculation 
that Hill, whose legal bills are expected to exceed $1 million, may want to 
keep his seat and remain on the payroll until he is sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sticky issue," the source said. "Everyone likes Frank." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the source, "one argument runs, if he decides to appeal (the 
conviction), should he be forced out? The counter-argument is, should a 
convicted felon be voting on bills?" 
</P>
<P>
 A third option is for Hill to keep his seat until he is sentenced but forgo 
voting and participating in other official actions of the Senate, the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the Rules Committee, Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) said he 
does not know how he will vote if the issue comes before the committee. He said 
a "compassionate person" could make a case for delaying a resignation until 
sentencing, but "I think (citizens) would say that is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent history suggests that the Senate wants a quick resignation. In 1990, 
state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) became the first sitting legislator 
to be convicted in the federal investigation of political corruption in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, the Rules Committee stripped him of his committee 
chairmanships and threatened to start expulsion proceedings unless he stepped 
down swiftly. He did so within three days. 
</P>
<P>
 The last expulsion from the Senate occurred in 1905 when two Republicans and 
two Democrats were ousted as a result of a criminal scandal.

PAIR CONVICTED OF NEGLECT IN BABY'S RAT-BITE DEATH; COURTS: HOMELESS COUPLE'S 
SON WAS FOUND DEAD IN A TRASH-STREWN STATION WAGON IN AUGUST. THE JURY 
DEADLOCKED ON AN INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE, AND PROSECUTORS SAY A RETRIAL 
IS UNLIKELY.

<P>
 A homeless couple whose infant son was bitten 110 times by a starving pet rat 
was convicted Friday of child neglect charges, but jurors deadlocked on whether 
the parents also were guilty of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for Kathyleen and Steven Giguere Sr. said they believe the 
jury's verdict was a partial vindication of their clients. "It's bad enough 
that they lost their baby, but to have a jury say that you killed your baby and 
to have to live with that for rest of their lives was really weighing on their 
minds," said defense attorney Salvatore Ciulla. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple was arrested after their 4-month-old son, Steven Jr., was found 
dead Aug. 26 in a trash-strewn, roach-infested station wagon where the family 
lived with a pet rat named Homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen, 31, and Steven Giguere Sr., 28, face up to six years in prison when 
they are sentenced July 18. Under sentencing guidelines, they would not face 
any additional prison time if convicted of manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, it appears unlikely that prosecutors will seek a retrial on the 
outstanding count, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki said that decision will 
be made before the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating three days, jurors deadlocked 9 to 3 Friday in favor of 
convicting the couple of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury foreman Steve Markley said the case was a draining one for jurors, who 
pored over graphic autopsy photos of the infant's mauled body and had to make 
tough judgments about parents who allowed their children to live in such filthy 
conditions. One woman on the jury appeared on the verge of tears as the verdict 
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this was easy for anybody," Markley said. "There was no way to get 
around emotions in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors had little trouble finding the parents guilty of neglect, he said. 
During the trial, jurors heard testimony that the parents spent much of their 
money on liquor and junk food and were seemingly oblivious to their unkempt 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors were unable to reconcile conflicting evidence on whether the rat 
had killed the infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended that the child bled to death after the rat's sharp teeth 
struck an artery. Defense attorneys said Steven Jr. died from sudden infant 
death syndrome before the rat attacked and called it a "freak accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Giguere of La Mirada said she feels sympathy for her son, Steven Sr., 
and daughter-in-law but said the couple is responsible for her grandson's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel they should have been found guilty for what happened to the baby," 
Dianne Giguere said, adding that the couple have lived irresponsibly over the 
years. "It's very hard to look at them, you think how could they do this to 
their child." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests show that the parents had traces of the drug methamphetamine in 
their systems at the time of the death, and the father admitted using marijuana 
the day before the baby died. Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino barred 
testimony about drug use, saying it would be too prejudicial to the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the death, the parents were living in their car with Steven Jr. 
and their 3-year-old daughter, Karissa, who now lives with her grandparents. 
Kathyleen Giguere also has a young daughter in foster care in Los Angeles, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also living in the car was Homer the rat, who measured about 12 inches from 
nose to tail, and had free roam of the vehicle. The rat was in the advanced 
stages of starvation and was also dehydrated when it attacked the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor told jurors the Gigueres were well aware of the rat's history 
of biting people and even warned friends to be careful around Homer. Yet the 
couple left the rodent alone in the car with a helpless, 4-month-old infant, he 
told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends, former neighbors and even Steven Giguere Sr.'s parents testified that 
the couple would allow spoiled food to sit around for weeks. Officials talked 
about the stench that filled the car, which was strewn with soiled clothing, 
dirty diapers, rat feces, gnats, flies and roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions so alarmed those who knew the Gigueres that Orange County 
Social Service workers were repeatedly asked to investigate the couple. Even 
the grandparents reported them shortly before the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
 But each time, social service workers decided there was insufficient evidence 
that the children were being abused or in danger. Prosecution experts also 
conceded during the trial that Steven Jr. seemed well-fed and and showed no 
signs of physical abuse. As for a last complaint filed by the child's 
grandparents just before the death, social service workers said they were 
unable to locate the transient couple.

 HAULIN' FOOT: If you see 13 men and one woman running near Pacific Coast 
Highway in Huntington Beach before daylight today, your feet might ache just 
thinking about what's ahead of them. They're taking off in a multi-company 
sponsored Trans America foot race, which will wind up 3,000 miles and 64 days 
later at New York City's Central Park.In two previous annual races, half the 
field failed to make it.... Officials figure it at 4 million footsteps and 
nearly half a million burned up calories. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY TO CITY: Seal Beach has jail space to rent, and Cypress is among the 
cities interested. Cypress Police Chief Daryl Wicker contends it would be 
considerably cheaper than the $159 per prisoner the city pays for an Orange 
County Jail booking.... When City Council members this week asked Wicker if the 
city would be locked in the new arrangement with Seal Beach proved unsuitable, 
he said straight-faced: "We would have an escape clause." 
</P>
<P>
 HOLE-IN-CLOSE: Remember that hole-in-one contest in Huntington Beach where you 
could win $1million for an ace at Meadowlark Golf Course? The city was insured 
just in case, of course. Nobody won, but Jeff Stewart of Fountain Valley did 
get close to the pin -- about nine feet -- in the recent contest.... And the 
consolation prize wasn't bad -- a trip to Paris for two. Says Stewart: "I was 
happy with the shot because I knew it would be tough to beat." The event raised 
$8,000 to benefit the city's Fourth of July celebration.

 They've studied for hours and taken test after grueling test. They've finished 
dozens of lab experiments, gulped canfuls of cola and turned in the last of 
their last-minute thesis papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, UC Irvine's Class of 1994 will become alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,400 UCI seniors are scheduled to graduate in three ceremonies today. 
Another 640 graduate students also will receive their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in robes and mortarboards with tassels, they will accept their 
diplomas at Aldrich Park, a wooded retreat in the center of the Irvine campus.  
</P>
<P>
 Sixty more UCI undergraduates are graduating this year compared to last year, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29th graduating class is the most ethnically diverse of any at UCI, 
university spokeswoman Dorothy Jean said. The breadth of cultures at the 
university is evident in the surnames of its award winners this year.  
</P>
<P>
 John O'Toole and Paul Urayima both were named as Barry M. Goldwater Scholars 
in sciences; Nguyen-Hong Hoang, a political science major, was selected as 
UCI's first Harry S. Truman Scholar; mathematics student James Nunez received a 
National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship; and Hoang and electrical 
engineering student Matthew Siler received UCI Lauds and Laurels Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from three departments -- engineering and physical and biological 
sciences -- will go through commencement at 9 a.m. Social sciences students 
will follow at 1 p.m., and a 5 p.m. ceremony will honor students of fine arts, 
humanities, social ecology, interdisciplinary studies and information and 
computer science. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening will speak briefly at all three ceremonies, 
Jean said. The ranks of the graduates count among them young women and men who 
want to return to inner cities to teach. Others are young entrepreneurs and 
entertainers. Some are parents, like a former professional singer from Mexico 
and mother of two who will get her diploma with highest honors in social 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 4,000 stories among the Class of 1994. Here are a few of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people study at UCI so they can get jobs in traditional professional 
fields, such as finance or medicine. Eran Feigenbaum, a senior graduating with 
honors, studied electrical engineering there so he could make magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Feigenbaum, 22, tours clubs as a magician and performs in venues from 
Hollywood to Bora Bora. He never speaks during his shows; instead, he presents 
his illusions against a musical backdrop of songs by Sting, Madonna and other 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned his first magic tricks at age 6 from his grandfather, a former 
razor-blade-eating magician with a Russian circus. He remembers he didn't take 
the illusions seriously, though, until age 12, when he saw a movie about a 
magician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized he was kissing all the girls," Feigenbaum said, relaxing in his 
Turtle Rock home. "I decided it would be cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Feigenbaum, a native of Tel Aviv, immigrated to New Jersey and picked up 
English when he was 16. He moved to Irvine and graduated from University High 
School. He worked at children's parties and a few clubs on the weekends during 
his high school stint. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time to choose a college, UCLA was Feigenbaum's first choice. 
"It's close to all the clubs in Hollywood," he explains. But it was UCI that 
accepted him -- and he said he is now glad he ended up in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Feigenbaum notched as many as 20 shows each week during 3 1/2 years of 
college. The business' demands kept him from living in a dormitory or 
participating in school clubs or activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed that," he said. "Sometimes I think I would've liked to be in a 
fraternity or something. But there's a give and take there. Now I have both a 
career and an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Few magicians have degrees in engineering, Feigenbaum said. "I chose 
electrical engineering, not so much because I knew what it was all about, but 
because it could easily be connected to magic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he uses a laptop computer to run the lights, sound and prop cues for his 
shows. Electronics and theater classes have taught him what his light 
technicians must contend with during his performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he's going to try out another option: He applied to Pepperdine and USC 
law schools and plans to explore patent law. "I love talking and being in front 
of people," Feigenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, regardless of whether he becomes a lawyer, he said he still will perform 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm not incredibly busy, I go crazy," he said.  
</P>

 Twenty-five years ago, Irasema Venezia couldn't imagine attending college, 
much less graduating. Repression in the land where she was raised -- Nicaragua 
-- forced her family to move to Mexico before she could finish secondary 
school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Venezia, 39, can relax in her Newport Beach apartment and worry about 
psychology papers instead of political instability. Books on career counseling 
and social behavior lie atop her glass coffee table, and she pokes at them as 
she talks flamboyantly in rapid-fire Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm going to the graduation," she said, fiddling with a text. 
"I've already started some of my graduate work in USC's counseling psychology 
program, and it's as if I want to put things behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband shared child care of their two teen-age daughters, so she 
didn't socialize much with classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezia said she took a road to her degree that is far from typical. How many 
UCI graduates can say they were professional songstresses in Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 She opens the drawer of a night table and pulls out dozens of tapes of songs 
she composed and performed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I worked three years with Televisa," one of Mexico's largest television 
networks, Venezia said. "I had my own weekly show."  
</P>
<P>
 She also composed songs for several Latin American music festivals, she said. 
But the atmosphere was not ideal for her young daughters, she said, so she 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezia, who said she has never lived anywhere longer than five years, moved 
to Cancun and sold condominium time-shares. After she married her second 
husband and moved to Kansas in 1989, she took her first community college 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 She continued taking courses at Orange Coast College when she and her family 
moved to Orange County in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's well-regarded social ecology program was the next step, and she garnered 
a number of honors at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her interest in psychology comes from her own childhood, when her 
worries about death were heightened by the mysticism prevalent in her family, 
Venezia said. "We lived in a little house near a church and I'd always see 
funerals, and people carrying dead people by," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be why I'm thinking of working with terminally ill people. They're 
the ones who really suffer emotionally."  
</P>

 In one of UCI's nondescript, earth-toned family housing units, Anthony 
Kutscher clutches his scrapbook and points to a picture of himself in 1976. 
Sporting bell-bottoms and long hair -- much like the other band members of 
Sapient, his long-defunct Orange County rock group -- he looks more like a 
partyer than a computer scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 The years have yellowed the picture and mellowed his rebellion. There was a 
time during his teen years, Kutscher said, when he was lucky to find a place to 
sleep, much less strive for a college education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to go to Anaheim High School" to start 10th grade, Kutscher 
said. "But I never showed up for the first day of class. I had no use for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kutscher said he didn't relate to his family, and he stayed behind in 
California at age 14 when the family moved to Minnesota. He took to sleeping in 
cars and friends' garages, drinking and taking drugs, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 When he injured a knee and went to a hospital, a doctor put him on 
prescription drugs and ordered him not to drink alcohol. Stopping was so 
difficult, he said, he realized he was addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put myself in a care unit in 1978," he said, sitting on a couch beside his 
wife, Diana. "I realized it was a bad problem." 
</P>
<P>
 His first wife divorced him after he stopped drinking and partying, he said, 
but he kept his three children -- the oldest now 17 years old. He joined 
Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, where he met Diana. They had a son, now 11 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, he worked his way up from cleaning duties to become a machinist at 
3M Orthopedics in Irvine. Faced with the specter of having to program high-tech 
computerized mills and lathes, he started taking computer classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But by his 13th year in machining, he became allergic to solvents and the 
company moved him to a lower-paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife said, 'I think you should try going back to school,' " he said. "When 
I actually did it, she was pretty shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 He attended Orange Coast College to take care of "seven pages of 
prerequisites," he said, and finally arrived with a full-tuition scholarship at 
UCI in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is finishing an honors project programming cutting-edge educational 
software for children. He received two departmental awards for excellence and 
has started a summer job at Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Kutscher, who will begin studying at UCI in September, sometimes has to 
urge him to take a break from work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know there's a problem when your kids start to call you Uncle Dad," 
Anthony Kutscher said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jocelyn Vaughnes doesn't want to be caught studying too much. Her whole 
approach, she said, is to relate her education to the off-campus world. 
</P>
<P>
 Take her senior thesis, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "I interviewed teen women in central Orange County about their sexuality," 
said Vaughnes, 22. "I found that so many people speak for teen women, but it's 
very unusual their own voices are heard." 
</P>
<P>
 She explored how young women see their bodies, how they make decisions about 
whether to have sex and how they express their sexuality -- a project she 
worked on for 20 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughnes, a San Bernardino native, said she decided to attend UCI because she 
was attracted by its social ecology program stressing psychology and social 
behavior. But she said she switched to women's studies during her junior year 
so she could have the freedom to pursue research that she could relate to.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of disappointed with the way my college life was going until 
then," Vaughnes said. "People only got together to study for midterms or 
finals. Nobody really discussed things." 
</P>
<P>
 In women's studies, she often got together with fellow students to talk about 
poverty, inequity and social change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to think that people have been here for four years and don't really 
know their classmates," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vaughnes arrived at UCI in 1990, she had little idea what college really 
would be like, she said. She soon discovered that she was only one of about 300 
African American women on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't so much that I felt isolated, I just felt more visible," she said. 
"Other people could ditch and I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 In class, whenever the discussion turned to African American issues, all eyes 
turned to her as a spokeswoman. She doesn't rebel against it -- she answers 
questions and discusses her life as an African American woman -- but she 
doesn't feel comfortable in the role. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as one spokeswoman for African American women," said 
Vaughnes, who now lives on Balboa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Through talking with friends and professors, Vaughnes said she has finally 
found the nerve to speak her mind. She has participated in protests over 
student fees and went to Sacramento to speak with legislators in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 She is concerned for the future of UCI and worries about its place in 
academia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got here, you could go to the library (on the weekend) to 
study," she said. "Now it's only open from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. 
Services are really being cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughnes said she plans to stay in the world of academe. She's now preparing 
to go to New York to teach poor elementary school students with the Teach for 
America program, but afterward she will pursue a graduate degree to become a 
professor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get my Ph.D.," she said with conviction. "I want to teach, and I 
want to see women and people of color emphasized in what I do."

COUNTY JOBLESS RATE DROPS TO 29-MONTH LOW; UNEMPLOYMENT: GAINS IN THE SERVICE 
AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES ARE CREDITED WITH THE DIP TO 5.3% IN MAY. SOME 
ECONOMISTS SAY IT'S A SIGN THE LOCAL RECOVERY IS UNDERWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 An improving economy helped push the Orange County unemployment rate to a 
29-month low of 5.3% in May, the state Employment Development Department 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Job gains in the service industry and construction hiring are credited with 
the lower rate, down from 6.2% in April, which suggests the county might 
finally be on the road to recovery from a recession that began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One good month isn't enough, however, to overcome more than three years of bad 
times: A separate report by EDD labor market analyst Eleanor Jordan shows that 
while there were 4,200 more jobs in May than in April, the county figure 
remained well below the year-earlier level. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the statistics are still too fluid to establish a trend, Jordan said 
most of the new jobs in May were permanent rather than summer hires. And the 
falling jobless rate was consistent across the state. California's May 
unemployment rate of 8.1% was down a full point from 9.1% in April and the 
jobless rate nationwide dropped to 5.9% from 6.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news, said a clearly optimistic Anil Puri, head of the economics 
department at Cal State Fullerton. "There is no question that a recovery is 
finally underway." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster tax consultant Judee Slack said she sees clear signs of recovery 
as her mostly small-business clients come in for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business is out there and the work is out there," Slack said. "Some of my 
clients are doing some hiring. But we're also seeing many small businesses 
still caught in a credit crunch. They do work and get paid 60 to 90 days later, 
so they can't hire because their employees need to get paid every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Puri, who has predicted that 1994 would be a year of employment growth, said 
Orange County employers will begin adding jobs more rapidly in the second half 
of the year as optimism and economic conditions improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University economists in December predicted almost imperceptible job 
growth in 1994, but they also are revising their data. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midyear update of its annual economic forecast next week, the 
university's Center for Economic Research will also call for a modest recovery. 
But the figures will remain more pessimistic than Cal State Fullerton's, said 
Chapman economic research director Esmael Adibi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it will be that much," he said Friday, referring to 
Fullerton's October projection that Orange County will end the year with a net 
increase of 15,000 to 20,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 EDD analyst Jordan's monthly employment report now shows four consecutive 
months of job increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tally, based on reports filed by employers, shows there were 1,117,900 
full- and part-time jobs in the county in May, down 5,000 from a year earlier 
but an increase of 1.5% from 1,101,300 jobs in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri said he doesn't think that kind of growth will continue unabated. 
Permanent hiring typically slows in the summer as employers turn to temporary, 
seasonal workers, and the employment count at the end of the summer dips 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 But the economist said he is sticking with his October prediction of up to 
20,000 new jobs in the county by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, that would make 1994 the county's first growth year since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Job increases in May occurred largely in construction, up 1,800 positions from 
April, and the broadly defined service sector, which added 1,300 employees in 
businesses ranging from doctors' and lawyers' offices to catering and shoe 
repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said that amusement parks and other summer employment hot spots didn't 
increase hiring in May, which could point toward another big employment jump 
for June when they do add staff for the peak tourist season. Jobless Rate Drops 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's unemployment rate reached its lowest point in 29 months in 
May. The county's jobless rate:

CITYSCAPES / PAUL FELDMAN AND PATRICK J. MCDONNELL: GERMANS, BOLIVIANS TAKE 
FIRST DRINK FROM WORLD CUP; DURING THE . . . ROUGHLY PLAYED FIRST HALF, FANS 
SHRIEKED AS BOTH SIDES MISSED SCORING OPPORTUNITIES.

 At a Torrance beer hall, more than 200 German soccer fans quaffed pilsener and 
let their bratwurst grow cold Friday as they hooted and hollered at a pair of 
big-screen television sets displaying the opening game of the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in North Hollywood, at perhaps this nation's only Bolivian-Mexican 
restaurant, two dozen Bolivian soccer fans ate meat pies as they cheered on 
their underdog national team in front of a couple of small screens. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the tightly contested game in Chicago was over, with Germany the 
1-0 victor, German fans were smiling in their steins and Bolivians were crying 
in their Pasena, as the Bolivian beer label is known. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of the results, followers of both squads -- as well as the 
multitudes in polyglot Los Angeles supporting the 22 other participating 
national teams -- had their appetites whetted for the monthlong international 
soccer tournament, which makes its local debut at the Rose Bowl today. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Elsa Mueller of Diamond Bar jumped into her swimming pool with 
her clothes on when Germany won the World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she and her husband, Walter, remained garbed and confident as they 
viewed the first-round match at the Alpine Village Inn in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a cinch for Germany, 5-1," said Elsa Mueller, a retired restaurant 
manager, shortly before the game began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muellers, who moved to America in the early 1950s, said they had driven an 
hour to watch the game for the camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so excited," Mrs. Mueller said as half-full plates of chicken and 
bratwurst sat tepid on their table, "I can't even eat." 
</P>
<P>
 At a bar stool nearby, computer systems analyst Ronald Urbina sipped on a 
bottle of Spaten beer. Urbina, a Chilean native who has lived in Germany, was 
so excited that he arrived in Torrance two hours before the Alpine Village Inn 
opened Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I went to McDonald's to buy some 99 cent World Cup pins," he said. They 
were displayed on his German World Cup hat and his German World Cup T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of another TV screen in the balcony sat 87-year-old Julius Kresinski 
of Downey, who said he played soccer in Germany before World War II. The seat 
next to Kresinski was empty, save for a life-size black, red and yellow German 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 At game time, most German fans expressed certainty of their team's superiority 
over the Bolivian squad -- and twice, on shots that went slightly astray, the 
boisterous foot-stomping reached quake-like levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of hands and arms may not be allowed in soccer, but Mrs. Mueller more than 
made up for the players on the TV set, punching the air whenever the German 
squad made a good play. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, with the score still 0-0, the crowd had grown somewhat subdued, 
and Urbina and others said their team's performance had been impaired by the 
Chicago heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Gustav Netal, an Austrian immigrant, who was also rooting for 
Germany. The favorites, the machine tool rebuilder said, looked as if they were 
still asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 His prescription? "They need a shot of Jagermeister at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 When the German team finally took the lead -- for good -- in the second half, 
the entire crowd, except for Kresinski, stood on their feet. The octogenarian 
deliberately unfurled his flag and waved it in the air for a good 30 seconds -- 
to the delight of all but those at the table directly behind him, who 
complained that they couldn't see the instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
 At the L.A. Salsa eatery in North Hollywood, special menus featured the 
unusual Bolivian-Mexican mix of dishes and hyped the day's matchup: "Two 
Titans, face to face."  
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Velasco, 32-year-old co-owner, donned a Bolivia World Cup T-shirt and a 
cap emblazoned with his homeland's national colors, red and yellow. 
Apprehensive, he nonetheless exuded confidence that the long-shot Bolivians 
could somehow upset the powerful German team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling that we would win," said Velasco, serving Bolivian saltenas, 
or meat pies, to a crowd of anxious compatriots arrayed in front of the two 
television screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not quite so sanguine, expressing the hope that the Bolivian 
squad, in its first Cup appearance in 44 years, would at least comport itself 
honorably against its formidable opponent. The sense of national pride that 
virtually shut down soccer-mad Bolivia on Friday was clearly apparent among 
these aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 "For once Bolivia is in the spotlight for something positive," said Mario 
Torrico, a 39-year-old Bolivian native who came to the United States at age 2, 
noting the nation's usual notoriety for drug trafficking and coups d'etat.  
</P>
<P>
 During the tightly contested and roughly played first half, fans shrieked as 
both sides missed scoring opportunities. The Bolivian onlookers were proud of 
their boys. And, in their eyes, the Teutonic strongmen were wilting in the 
90-degree Chicago heat. 
</P>
<P>
 A relieved Sylvia Antezana said, "For us, a tie is a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 A nervous fan added as the second half began: "We may need the paramedic." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, dreams of a tie -- or even a victory -- were largely dashed when 
superstar German forward Juergen Klinsmann broke free and blasted the ball into 
an empty net in the 61st minute. Disbelieving Bolivians called the play a 
fluke, and possibly an offsides violation, but the celebratory German players 
on the screen recognized that they had made the decisive breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, pride at the South Americans' surprisingly strong performance 
outweighed their supporters' disappointment. "The one goal was absurd, but 
everyone knows that we played well," said La Paz native Roxana Chalco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muellers headed for home with smiles on their faces but no plans to leap 
into their swimming pool with or without bathing suits. Instead, they planned 
to watch South Korea play Spain in the second Cup match, and eat German baked 
goods and sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 For Velasco, the owner of the Bolivian-Mexican restaurant, the loss was more 
than a case of national disappointment. He would have to work something out 
with his German brother-in-law, whom he had bet $2,000 that Bolivia would 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 And Velasco would also have to enter into somewhat more delicate negotiations 
with his girlfriend, Ana Barrenechea, who had vowed to marry him if Bolivia 
won. "Well, we're still novios, " Barrenechea said afterward, using the Spanish 
term for girlfriends and boyfriends.

TRAPPED BY THE TERROR OF A VENICE STREET WAR; VIOLENCE: NEIGHBORHOODS ARE 
INCREASINGLY RESENTFUL OF GANGS, POLICE AND THE MEDIA AS LAST WEEK'S SHOOTINGS 
BRING THE DEATH TOLL TO 17.

 Four-year-old Darren stands near a doorway at Mark Twain Middle School in Mar 
Vista, waiting for his grandmother and his 14-year-old sister, Rasheka, to 
finish their interviews about the ongoing gang war in their nearby Venice 
neighborhood. Playfully, he waves a stack of Lego-type blocks that he has 
fashioned into the shape of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like guns 'cause that's what the police have," the little boy says with a 
smile. Yaa Yaanykoah, his grandmother and legal guardian, sits at the table 
across from him and shakes her head sadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't seem to stop him from making those," she says. "But I don't let him 
or his 2-year-old brother play with toy guns. It's not good for them, 
especially now with all the trouble we have around here." 
</P>
<P>
 The "trouble" is the most intense gang war raging in Los Angeles: a 
mushrooming yearlong conflict that involves black and Latino gang members from 
Venice, Culver City, Mar Vista and Santa Monica and has taken the lives of 17 
people, many of them innocent victims. More than 50 others have been wounded by 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The war hit a new peak last week when two Latino teen-age residents -- 
students at Dorsey High in southwest Los Angeles -- were shot and killed near 
Venice High School in Mar Vista. This week, when Venice High parents and 
students gathered for a graduation awards program, an assistant principal 
soberly asked anyone scheduling a graduation party to notify police so they 
could schedule extra patrols in the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 A year's worth of this mind-set has made residents highly resentful not only 
of gangs, but also of police, who are accused of oppressive tactics, and the 
news media, who are accused of sensationalizing the violence. The strongest 
bitterness is found in the Oakwood section of Venice, a square-mile 
neighborhood made up of federally subsidized apartments and small, wood-frame 
houses that has been hardest hit by the violence. Among Oakwood's African 
Americans, there is a growing suspicion that developers will exploit the 
interracial gang fighting to frighten poor blacks and Latinos into selling 
their beach-adjacent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined force of these stresses seems to be pushing the Oakwood area 
toward a collective breakdown.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a total nervous wreck," Yaanykoah says. "I've been sick for three months. 
I've stopped eating, stopped sleeping, and I'm afraid to let the kids go 
outside." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not scared normally, but I feel like I'm living in a foreign war zone," 
says Ebearl Williams, a campus aide at Mark Twain and a nine-year Oakwood 
resident. "I feel like people don't care about us or what's going on here 
because they think it's just blacks and browns fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Melton, a therapist who teaches a course on the psychology of violence 
and survival at Antioch College in Marina del Rey, says these are signs of 
post-traumatic stress disorder.  
</P>
<P>
 "Constant gang violence creates an urban, guerrilla war setting," says Melton, 
a Vietnam War combat veteran. "People live like soldiers in constant fear. That 
makes them go numb. They feel helpless, get depressed or angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Williams, a lifelong Oakwood resident who is a tutor at Mark Twain and 
has organized a new anti-violence group, heard it in the voices of her 
9-year-old twin daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls are afraid to sleep in their rooms, but after they were baptized 
recently they told their mother they felt better because now "if they get shot 
and die, they'll go to heaven," Michele Williams said. "It made (me) feel sad 
and less than as a parent," she says. "That's when I decided to start working 
for peace."  
</P>
<P>
 As is typical of many wars, the roots of the conflict are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Weaver, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Bureau 
anti-gang unit, says it began as a power struggle between the Shoreline Crips, 
a black gang based in Oakwood, and Venice 13, a nearby Latino gang, over 
control of crack cocaine sales. But that analysis is disputed by many Oakwood 
residents and at least one staff member of Community Youth Gang Services, a 
county gang-prevention agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started because a black beat up a Latino, and then it got turned into a 
gang thing," said the gang worker, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of incidents that occurred last week illustrated a frightening level 
of retaliation. With almost mathematical precision, the attacks alternated 
between Latino against black, then black against Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Oakwood's younger teen-agers attend Mark Twain Middle School, which 
lies east of Lincoln Boulevard, the informal dividing line between Mar Vista 
and Venice. They describe it as an island of calm that gives them temporary 
shelter from lives of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel speechless" about the violence at home, says Crystal Griffis, 14. 
"What I'm feeling, I can't express."  
</P>
<P>
 She is also critical of the LAPD. "Why do they take an hour to come when 
there's shooting?" she asks. "You can't respect them when they won't do their 
job. We deserve the same service that white folks get."  
</P>
<P>
 Julio Garcia, 14, says he was unhappy with his family's recent move from Santa 
Monica to Oakwood. He says he lies awake at night and listens to the gunshots 
and helicopters. "I feel scared a lot. I also pray to God to keep us safe, but 
mostly I just feel hopeless."  
</P>
<P>
 Police have complained that they are powerless to make a dent in the gang war 
unless Oakwood residents are more helpful in tipping them off about suspected 
criminals. But resentment against the LAPD is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat all male blacks here like gangbangers," Michele Williams says.  
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Richard LeGarra, commander of the LAPD's Pacific Division, acknowledges 
that Oakwood is scared and angry.  
</P>
<P>
 "They want the shooting stopped and their children safe. So do we. But what 
can we do?" he asks. "We're there in force, but people are waiting till our 
cars pass and using that window of opportunity to shoot. We're very concerned 
our presence is not a deterrent. But we can't violate people's rights to keep 
the peace. I also have 25 other square miles to patrol, and we're down in 
personnel, so we're spread really thin."  
</P>
<P>
 These cross-complaints are also a sign of the fatigue of war, says therapist 
Melton. 
</P>
<P>
 "People develop a bunker mentality, get hardened and move to despair or apathy 
when the situation remains unresolved," he said.

CURTAINS OR HAPPY ENDINGS?; OLD THEATERS ARE ENDANGERED, BUT ADMIRERS HOPE FOR 
A RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On screen at the Orpheum Theatre, the chariot race from the 1926 silent film 
"Ben-Hur" was a thrilling mix of heroics and editing tricks. Timed to the 
action, an organist blasted away on the Wurlitzer. An estimated 1,700 
moviegoers, filling even the high balcony of the enormous, gilded movie palace, 
cheered as the MGM classic whipped to its climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone stumbling upon that lively scene Wednesday night might have assumed 
that all was fine with the 68-year-old Orpheum and other chandelier-stuffed 
theaters built nearby in Downtown Los Angeles during the vaudeville era. But 
that impression would be sadly mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Ben-Hur" screening was part of a June festival aimed at saving the 
endangered theater district along and near Broadway. Only four of the remaining 
15 theaters -- the Orpheum, Palace, State and Olympic -- still show films, and 
those four reportedly fill on average just 6% of their seats. The other 
auditoriums are either closed or have been converted, with care or violence, to 
churches, swap meets, jewelry marts and a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Decay and demolition seem constant threats to these fantasized versions of 
Mayan temples, French palaces and Spanish haciendas, dipped in marble, silk and 
mirrors. Still, an extraordinary amount of attention is focused this week on 
those theaters' glorious past, troubled present and uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is how do you keep people coming to the theaters if they are 
afraid of coming Downtown?" asked Mary Margaret Schoenfeld, executive director 
of the League of Historic American Theatres, which is holding its annual 
convention this week in Los Angeles. "You can have great buildings but if 
people are not going to sit in them, you're out of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Her organization of theater operators is inspecting the Broadway district and 
offering suggestions for its use. Many conventioneers also are attending the 
"Remaining Last Seats," the five-night film festival sponsored by the Los 
Angeles Conservancy at the Orpheum and other Downtown theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more controversial step, the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency 
(CRA) this week partly unveiled a study recommending that three theaters form a 
new Latino-oriented entertainment zone along Broadway between 6th and 8th 
streets. The plan suggests that a largely untapped market of Latino consumers 
would attend live concerts at the Los Angeles, support live theater at the 
Palace and embrace a high-tech sports bar at the State. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the three renovations would total about $20 million, presumably 
from private entertainment companies eager to court the large Latino 
population, CRA officials said. Many details remain to be worked out and the 
full report is to be released next month. 
</P>
<P>
 All that attention was welcomed by Bruce Corwin, president of the Metropolitan 
Theatres Corp., which operates or owns the majority of the Broadway theaters. 
But Corwin remains skeptical of anything but an expensive neighborhood 
overhaul, emphasizing security, cleanliness and cheaper parking. Two months 
ago, his company closed the Los Angeles, a theater whose 1931 faux Versailles 
design by S. Charles Lee is considered unrivaled in lavishness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares more about those theaters than we do. We have suffered and 
sweated and tried to keep those places alive," Corwin said in a telephone 
interview. Any revival "is going to take somebody with deep pockets who is 
willing to gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld's league reports success nationwide in reviving theaters that 
similarly suffered from television, multiplexes, suburbanization and the fear 
of crime in old downtowns. In Los Angeles County, recent good news stories 
include the Alex in Glendale, restored as a performing arts center; the El 
Capitan in Hollywood, spruced up as a showcase for Disney films; and the 
Wiltern, the Art Deco movie palace in mid-Wilshire now revitalized as a concert 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Downtown Los Angeles different is the astonishing number of 
theaters that were left between 3rd Street and Olympic Boulevard even after 
middle-income and white audiences moved to Hollywood, Westwood and exurbia. 
Only New York's Times Square has more, and a campaign there, involving the 
Disney company, seeks to turn abandoned and porno theaters into family venues. 
Like Times Square, Los Angeles' Broadway struggles with the image of being a 
dangerous place at night, an image that theater boosters and Los Angeles police 
contend is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the home of the movie industry. So of all the areas in the United 
States, Los Angeles should value these buildings. But then again, Los Angeles 
has so many more," said Marian Milligan, an official of the Elsinore Theater, a 
1926 movie theater in Salem, Ore., that is a performing arts center. She and 
other conventioneers said the goal should be to save the best, not to rescue 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan and about 150 colleagues walked Broadway the other day and toured 
seven theaters' interiors. "We hope by having all these people in our town who 
have realized their impossible dreams, some of their success will rub off on 
Los Angeles," said Hillsman Wright, an activist with the Los Angeles Historic 
Theatre Foundation, whose members were guides. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors seemed both dazzled and saddened by what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orpheum, the 2,200-seat house built for vaudeville, appeared to be in good 
shape and retains such fantastical details as lobby chandeliers decorated with 
half-dressed bronze maidens; the Orpheum shows first-run movies with Spanish 
subtitles. However, the nearby 1927 Tower, used only as a filming location, 
looked battered. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors were pleased at how televangelist Gene Scott has scrubbed the 
1927 United Artists and converted it into a church, retaining murals of early 
movie stars like theater builder Mary Pickford. And they liked how the Mayan, a 
former porno house, has been turned into a successful nightclub. But they 
gasped at the former Warner Bros. theater, now a Hill Street jewelry mart, with 
the 1920 proscenium and balcony still visible. 
</P>
<P>
 In a presentation to the league, CRA consultants conceded that their district 
plan would provoke debate, particularly the proposed sports bar at the State, 
with a boxing ring, wide-screen videos and virtual reality games. But they 
stressed that more traditional uses do not appear profitable and that any 
physical changes could be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 A new assessment district is to raise street cleanup and improvement funds 
from local businesses, and city government may pitch in some more. But Charles 
Loveman, a principal of Kosmont and Associates, the plan's main author, 
stressed that private industry would have to manage the theaters and pay for 
their rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it feasible?" Loveman asked about the plan. "Yes. Will it be difficult? 
Yes. Will it be worthwhile? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although audience members did not dispute the proposed new uses, some took 
exception to the plan's Latino orientation, saying it might further ethnic 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I've been told to stay on the Westside where you belong," one white 
woman angrily declared before quickly leaving the meeting. "What about the 
melting pot? What about the tossed salad?" CRA officials said the theaters' 
venues and audience would be open to all, but that a Latino flavor was logical 
given location and demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conventioneers went on to see "The Final Curtain: Endangered Movie 
Palaces of Downtown Los Angeles," a photo exhibit by Robert Berger and Anne 
Conser, which runs at 777 S. Figueroa St. through July 29. And most attended 
"Ben-Hur," in the series that will show "Destry Rides Again" on Wednesday at 
the State and "The Bank Dick" June 29 at the Orpheum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the enthusiastic "Ben-Hur" audience Wednesday night was Marita Grabiak, a 
movie script supervisor who lives in Culver City. "It's a very exciting feeling 
to be watching this the way it was watched 70 years ago," said Grabiak, sitting 
in the balcony with her husband and two young children. "It's as if the 
happiness of 70 years sort of saturated into the walls and is still here."

PLANNED FARE HIKE POINTS UP INEQUITIES IN BUS, RAIL SUBSIDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On one side of the equation are the 1.1 million bus riders each day, most of 
whom are poor and rely heavily, if not completely, on public transportation. 
Every time each of them boards a bus in Los Angeles, taxpayers kick in $1.16. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are the far fewer passengers on the region's slowly blooming 
rail system -- one for every 15 bus riders -- who tend to be more affluent and 
less dependent on mass transit. Each of their trips commands a taxpayer subsidy 
three to 8 1/2 times that of a bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is mainly bus fares that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
seeks to raise in coming months to help bridge a $126-million operating 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strategy that community activists such as Chris Niles believe will 
penalize the most loyal but least well-off of the MTA's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely wrong," said Niles, who works with the Labor/Community 
Strategy Center in the Mid-Wilshire district. "They're putting the burden on 
the backs of bus riders (to build) very inefficient rail projects that no one's 
using. These are people who are just barely keeping their head above water who 
will be forced to find unique ways to finance their transit needs." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials counter that bus fares have remained untouched for six years. 
Even the proposed increase from $1.10 to $1.35 contained in the MTA's new 
budget would simply put Los Angeles in line with what most other large cities 
-- New York, Philadelphia, Chicago -- charge. And rail projects must be 
launched now if the burgeoning region is to have a sensible transit network in 
the next millennium, officials say.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are about two things in this agency: providing good transportation 
services for today's riders and trying to develop a transportation capability 
that can serve tomorrow's riders," MTA chief executive Franklin E. White said. 
"A lot of people forget that second obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the clashing views of White and Niles epitomize the divisive 
debate that has sprung up over fare increases and service reductions proposed 
by the MTA last month. The battle has become fierce, leading one man to wage a 
hunger strike and local politicians to speak out with unaccustomed vehemence. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the fare increases is scheduled for 10 a.m. today at the 
county Hall of Administration. The MTA's board of directors could decide the 
issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies that the MTA is in alarming financial straits just one year 
after it was formed by merging the Southern California Rapid Transit District 
and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. The MTA faces an annual 
$300-million capital and operating shortfall starting next month and has had to 
lay off workers and delay some transit projects to balance its $2.9-billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But no fare increases are expected for the Metrolink commuter train, and a 
ride on the Red Line subway would remain 25 cents. Fares for Blue Line riders 
would be increased based upon the distance they travel, but the lion's share of 
new revenue -- about $50 million -- would come from bus riders' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the fare restructuring complain that it compounds disparities 
between the funding of rail and bus systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the MTA subsidizes operating costs at a rate of $1.16 per passenger on 
its buses. Some of its most crowded routes, such as Line 204 through 
South-Central Los Angeles, require subsidies of only 34 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the subsidies stand at $3.15 for the Blue Line light rail system 
and $3.83 for the Red Line. On Metrolink trains, the public's share is $9.86. 
</P>
<P>
 To Antonio Villaraigosa, an alternate on the MTA board, the solution seems 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "With limited dollars, we have to go for the thing with the best bang for the 
buck, and the best bang for the buck is buses," he said. "We need to build a 
first-class bus system, one that's clean, safe and graffiti-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa and other opponents of the proposed fare increases also cite the 
stark differences between bus and train patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent MTA report described its bus riders as being mostly poor and 
non-white, whereas a Metrolink survey last year found its average passenger to 
be a suburban, white professional earning $63,000 annually -- more than 
quadruple the $15,000 household income of 62% of bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Those differences make investment in rail projects at the expense of bus 
service unconscionable, said James Moore, associate professor of urban planning 
and co-director of USC's Center for Advanced Transportation Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials point out that Los Angeles County voters approved a 
half-cent sales tax four years ago to raise money for commuter rail. The MTA 
has allocated $752.3 million for overall rail construction in its proposed 
budget for next fiscal year, including funding for the Blue Line extension to 
Pasadena and the Green Line trolley from Norwalk to El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Not providing longer-distance commuting options for residents because they 
happen to be more affluent and live in the suburbs would be unfair, Metrolink 
Executive Director Richard Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suburban voters "didn't say, 'Here's my money. Give it to the poor people to 
ride the buses and don't give me anything,' " Stanger said. "That's what the 
people who support the buses expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a certain extent we have an obligation as a society to do that. But we 
also have a clear obligation from the voting measure to provide transit 
alternatives to outlying portions of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanger also takes exception to assertions that the bus system is more 
cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the average trip aboard Metrolink (29 miles) is longer than on the bus 
(3.9 miles), Metrolink moves people at a comparable cost, Stanger said. 
Calculated according to passenger miles, the Metrolink subsidy is 34 cents, 
close to the 30-cent subsidy per passenger mile for the bus system. (The Blue 
Line subsidy is 35 cents, the Red Line $2.95.) 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials say establishing a network of rail lines now is crucial if the 
region is to be equipped to deal with the transit needs of a larger population 
30 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics question whether rail is the answer, especially in light of 
projections that bus riders will still form the largest group of transit users 
even when the MTA's ambitious rail projects are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The example of other cities that have recently built rail lines should sound a 
warning, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1989, federal study of eight cities that have completed rail projects 
within the last 20 years, five cities reported gains in overall transit use, 
but only at significant costs per passenger. Three cities, including Miami, 
dropped in overall ridership because of bus fare increases and service cuts 
adopted to help pay for the new rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds familiar, doesn't it?" USC's Moore said. "Los Angeles is 
replicating a Miami experience." 
</P>
<P>
 White disputes the charge, saying bus ridership has already been declining in 
recent years. It fell from a peak of 497 million annually in 1985 to 375 
million this year, although some observers attribute the drop to the doubling 
of fares from 50 cents to $1.10 within a five-year period. By raising the fare 
to $1.35, MTA officials expect to lose another 7% of passengers, mostly among 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of transit must fill the gap left by dwindling bus ridership, 
officials say. (San Fernando Valley Edition) Bus Vs. Rail 
</P>
<P>
 To help balance its $2.9-billion budget, the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority has recommended that bus fares be increased from $1.10 to $1.35. If 
approved, it would be the first fare hike in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponets accuse the MTA of turning to bus riders to subsidize costly projects 
that serve far fewer people. MTA officials say that, while expensive, rail 
systems must be developed now to serve a burgeoning population in the next few 
decades. Daily Ridership Comparison Buses: 1,100,000 Blue Line: 37,800 Red

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; NEW PLANS FOR PROJECT UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has unveiled a new development plan for 1,200 acres between the 
lakeside homes of Woodbridge and the office towers of The Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Christening the project Oakcreek village, the company seeks to build two golf 
courses, as many as 4,000 residential units and a scattering of industrial and 
commercial sites on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is set to review an environmental impact report on the 
village later this month. Although the plan has met with praise from some 
nearby residents, the relatively high density of the proposed housing tracts is 
expected to raise some concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously known as Village 12, the area is now 75% undeveloped, consisting 
mostly of orange groves and vegetable fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few major developments in the area are Irvine Valley College, the 
1,100-home Orangetree neighborhood and the county's household hazardous waste 
facility. The village also takes in the East Irvine historical district, which 
consists of structures that date back to the early days of the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakcreek development proposal was produced with the help of Orangetree 
residents, who for nearly four years met regularly with company and city 
officials to work out an acceptable plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have agriculture and nature all around you, you say 'Oh, my God' 
when someone wants to build houses and factories around it," said resident Bill 
Johann, who took part in the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Johann, a 73-year-old retired electronics designer, said the Irvine Co. was 
responsive to the concerns of residents. At the residents' request, a park just 
outside Orangetree was added to the plan and the golf course area was enlarged 
to give the village more open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 18-hole golf courses have proved to be an especially popular aspect of 
the proposal, winning praise from golfers throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to build one regulation-size course as well as one executive 
course, said Jill Griffiths, Irvine's senior planner. Railroad tracks that 
parallel the Santa Ana Freeway will run through the course. The plans include 
underpasses as safety measures for the golfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industrial sites are proposed for land east of the course, near Irvine 
Center Drive and Sand Canyon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the residential development is scheduled for the southern half of 
Oakcreek between the San Diego Freeway and Barranca Parkway. A new road that 
parallels Jeffrey Road and Sand Canyon Avenue would be built between Irvine 
Center Drive and Barranca, Griffiths said. 
</P>
<P>
 The residential section would also include some commercial shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Irvine Co. would be allowed to build as many as 4,000 homes under 
its proposal, city officials say they doubt that many dwellings would be built. 
Each project in the village would have to come before the Planning Commission 
and City Council for individual approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner said she expected the density of the residential 
units to be discussed when the council takes up the Oakcreek environment 
report. The project calls for a mix of condominiums, apartments and larger 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner said she also hopes the Irvine Co. will help pay for the construction 
of a new under-crossing at Jeffrey Road. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 1 IN GROUP OF 7 STABS YOUTH IN HOME 
</P>

<P>
 A group of seven teen-agers followed a 17-year-old into his home, and one 
person in the group stabbed him in the chest with a small knife, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members told police that the victim, Fredy Urquiza, walked out of his 
family's house in the 200 block of North Figueroa Street about 9:25 p.m. They 
said that the teen-ager turned around almost immediately and walked back, 
followed by the group, said Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that one person is responsible for the stabbing, even though he 
was accompanied by six other people," Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the stabbing, the group ran. They remain at large, and no arrests have 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's parents and a brother, who were at home when the stabbing 
occurred, took him to the hospital. His condition was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not yet established a motive for the stabbing. The knife has not 
been found, Faust said. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; TOLLWAY PROTESTERS TO PICNIC NEAR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a planned toll road that would run through Laguna Canyon are 
asking residents to bring picnic lunches today and gather near the construction 
site to see the effect of recent grading on the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something of a catastrophe out there and people who haven't had a 
chance to stop by and see what happened should come out and see it," said 
Michael Phillips, director of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy. "There's a note of 
celebration because, at least for the time being, the canyon is ours again." 
</P>
<P>
 After a court ruling in their favor Tuesday, tollway builders began grading on 
both sides of the hillsides alongside Laguna Canyon Road about a half-mile 
north of El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But after about 12 hours of work on Tuesday and Wednesday, bulldozers were 
temporarily halted by a second court order. Grading could resume next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters, who were on hand throughout both days of grading, were stunned at 
how quickly the bulldozers went to work and said they won't be caught off guard 
again. They are counting on people who attend today's picnic to be outraged by 
what they see and to join in the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, a spokesman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which 
is charged with building the road, would not comment Friday on the protests or 
on the effect such activities could have on the road's construction.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the agency had met the necessary requirements before beginning work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The corridor meets all tests of the law as determined by the resource 
agencies that have approved it and the state and federal courts that have 
affirmed it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The picnic, which is scheduled for 11 a.m., is planned to coincide with a 
previously scheduled hike and nature walk through the Jim Dilley Greenbelt 
Preserve in Laguna Canyon, which is located adjacent to the toll road site. The 
preserve parking lot is located along the east side of Laguna Canyon Road, 
three-quarters of a mile north of El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-owned land, which was not burned in the October firestorm, will be 
open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Visitors can choose from two self-guided hikes, 
including a 2 1/2-mile walk leading to a natural lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve eventually will become part of the massive Laguna Coast 
Wilderness Park. The San Joaquin Hills toll road -- which would stretch 17 
miles from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano -- will run through the 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jim Dilley Greenbelt Preserve is normally open once a month to visitors. 
After today, it will be closed through the fire season. It will reopen in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who come to the canyon Saturday are expected to focus more on the graded 
tollway sight than on the greenery at its edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "While they're here, (preserve visitors can) take a look at the destruction so 
they'll understand," City Councilwoman Lida Lenney said. "I think you have to 
see it to know." LESLIE EARNEST

 Angels on our freeway shoulders: As the week progressed, we became more 
nervous about the widespread urban folk tale that back-seat poltergeists were 
warning L.A. drivers of a disastrous earthquake on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking into the story," said a rep of the ABC show "Good Morning 
America," who phoned Only in L.A. for more information. If "Good Morning 
America" is interested. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As far away as New York and Detroit, friends and relatives of Angelenos said 
they had heard the rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence (maybe), Farmers Insurance announced it wouldn't write any more 
quake insurance, and Hollywood Park put up billboards that said, "More 
earth-shaking than, well, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Then a Norwalk woman told us Thursday: "I heard another version. A woman was 
driving down a street and saw a bright light in front of her. An angel appeared 
and warned her there would be a 'large' earthquake 'Thursday at 4.' . . . The 
angel didn't say a.m. or p.m." The name of the Norwalk woman: Marla L'Angelle. 
(Spooky!)  
</P>
<P>
 We didn't want to alarm our readers, but the quake date we had heard in most 
versions was also June 16 -- Thursday. Fortunately, nothing happened. Unless 
you count that little 5.0 shaker that struck at 9 a.m. in Yucca Valley.

 What a McInsult!McDonald's Corp. has shut down its colorful 40-year-old Downey 
stand, the last one to display the original chef mascot, Speedee. Financial 
reasons, the burger folks say, ignoring pleas from such fans as President 
Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but McDonald's has no hesitation about exploiting Speedee's 
image on a new line of hamburger wrappers as well as on souvenir milk bottle 
caps, or POGs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incongruous," said Downey City Councilwoman Joyce Lawrence, "to market 
the look of the mascot of the '50s and then turn your back on the oldest 
existing original example of the '50s."

 Doggie day afternoon: That's the thanks we get. Here we have a worldwide 
exclusive, the revelation that Striker, the World Cup canine mascot, appears to 
be a copy of the TV cartoon hero, Auggie Doggie, and what happens? We were hit 
by a series of aftershocks from a dozen readers, who contacted us only to say 
that we misidentified Auggie as the sidekick of Quick Draw McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 That sidekick "was a little mule named Baba-Louie," hissed Steve Alpert.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MEETING EMPOWERED THEM, RESIDENTS SAY

 More than 300 residents of east Costa Mesa met Wednesday to discuss safety, 
gangs, schools and neighborhood appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response was just terrific," said Patty Baugh, the resident who organized 
the meeting at Kaiser Elementary School with the aim of preventing neighborhood 
decay."It's nice to know that people care." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District Supt. Mac Bernd, crisis counselor Roy 
Alvarado and gang detail officers from the Costa Mesa Police Department spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from 11 other agencies handed out literature on ways to 
improve the neighborhood, Baugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baugh called the meeting because she said she has become increasingly 
concerned about crime and safety in her neighborhood. An Albert Place homeowner 
for seven years, Baugh said she had recently felt threatened by apparent 
transients and homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Relations Officer Sue Crouse said police have not noticed an 
increase in crime in the east side, but she said vigilance will help keep the 
neighborhood safe. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CONSULTANT HIRED TO FIND SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Education has hired a consultant for a nationwide search for a 
new superintendent for the Orange Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Gatti, who works out of the San Francisco Bay Area, handed board members 
a schedule that will have finalists selected by Aug. 15, just in time for the 
1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26,000-student district has been without a superintendent since April and 
will lose its acting superintendent at the end of June. Seven superintendents 
have come and gone since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The board recently has grappled with a strike by classified workers, a sexual 
harassment suit, a $1.7-million budget deficit and a continuing turnover of 
administrators, but Gatti told them they should not feel bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a trustee for the Oakland Unified School District and you have 
very few problems compared to what Oakland has gone through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatti will place advertisements in state and national trade magazines by June 
27. 
</P>
<P>
 David Reger, president of the Orange Unified Education Assn. Inc., also asked 
board members to bring the community into the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear you have not learned from mistakes of the past," he told the board. 
"Please let the public be involved the (decision) week of Aug. 15." 
</P>
<P>
 Gatti was superintendent of the Santa Clara schools from 1974 to 1989 and he 
has found administrators for schools in Torrance, South San Francisco, San 
Rafael and Santa Barbara, he said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; BOARD TENTATIVELY SAVES MUSIC PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees has tentatively decided to spare the school district's 
instrumental music program and make smaller cuts in library services than 
originally planned as it seeks to balance its fiscal 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in a special session Thursday, the school board gave preliminary 
approval to a plan to fund a before- and after-school instrumental music 
program for fourth- and fifth-graders. The trustees will reach into district 
reserves for the estimated $30,000 cost of the program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The music program, currently taught during school hours, was the target of 
possible cuts that would have saved the district $114,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of declining revenue and enrollment, the district faces a projected 
$250,000 shortfall in its proposed $24-million 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees also decided to restore part of the funding for the district's 
library services program, which was targeted for drastic reductions. Instead of 
the 46% cutback originally envisioned, funding for the program will be reduced 
by 20%, under the trustees' decision. The original cut would have drastically 
trimmed librarian hours at each of the 11 schools, but under the new proposal, 
librarians will work four hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will save $27,600, not the $66,000 it would have gained if the 
46% cutback were enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up the difference, trustees agreed to stop paying the district's share 
of social security benefits for its temporary employees, resulting in an 
anticipated savings of $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak said it is important not to 
drastically reduce library services because they affect "all the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Both programs were among those headed for budget cuts before a board meeting 
last week when parents, teachers and staff made pleas to trustees to save them. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to take final action on the proposed changes and adopt a 
budget at Thursday's meeting. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; BUDGET MEETING OPEN TO THE PUBLIC TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first public workshop on the city's $16.1-million budget for the 1994-95 
fiscal year will be today. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled from 8:30 a.m. to noon at the council chambers, 27801 
La Paz Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget calls for a spending decrease of 18%, but a 1% increase in police 
services funding. City officials recommended hiring two additional sheriff's 
deputies to patrol Laguna Niguel at a cost of $213,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Tim Casey said per capita spending is expected to drop from $369 
to $306 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for that, he said, was that the city has completed several 
large construction projects that were funded by state and county grants or 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The major projects planned for next year include developing the Crown Royale 
park with $50,000 in city money and creating Cabot-Colinas Park at Paseo de 
Colinas and Cabot Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The new park would cost $175,000 to install a sidewalk, a tot lot and two 
half-court basketball courts.  
</P>
<P>
 The land will be donated by the Colinas de Capistrano Homeowners Assn., which 
will pay for the park's design and maintenance.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; LIBRARY BUILDING EFFORT INTENSIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To help raise money for construction of a new library, a foundation has 
declared June as Mission Viejo Library Month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed to match all money donated to the Mission Viejo Library 
Foundation for its building fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Mission Viejo Co. has agreed to put up $10,000 when a like 
amount has been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 But foundation members also are working for community donations. City 
officials currently favor a 25,000-square-foot building that would cost an 
estimated $5 million to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to build a new library received a huge boost last week when the 
county agreed to turn over its branch library to the city, including all tax 
revenue paid by Mission Viejo taxpayers to run the county branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has purchased a site on Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road 
for the library for about $2.5 million. In addition, the city is working on a 
land swap with a developer -- a 7 1/2-acre, city-owned parcel on Los Altos 
Street for a four-acre plot next to the library site. The difference in value 
will also be used to build the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations to the library fund can be sent to the Mission Viejo Library 
Foundation, P.O. Box 2000-373, Mission Viejo, CA 92690. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the foundation at (714) 586-0439. FRANK MESSINA

single-family homes also are planned for the downtown area, along with the 
Birch Walk pedestrian mall featuring a movie theater, fountains, public art, 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing the shopping center is Watt/Craig Associates, which reports that 
80% of the complex is pre-leased. Construction is expected to be completed by 
the end of this year, with financing provided by the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchoring the shopping center will be Pay Less Drug Store, Ralphs Grocery, 
PetsMart and Cost Plus. Other tenants will include Blockbuster Video, Burger 
King, Fantastic Sam's, Starbucks Coffee, Subway Sandwiches and Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said he is encouraged by the fact that so much of the 
center has been pre-leased. The city will receive a percentage of the center's 
profits, along with 1% of the generated sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about it," Parker said of the Gateway. "It's taken us a lot of 
work to get to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is happy about the changes that have occurred over the past 
decade in this fairly affluent city of 34,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most vocal opponents of how redevelopment has been handled is 
William Vega, who said he became "outraged" when the city tried to acquire his 
mother's property in 1989 through the power of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I became an activist," said Vega, who unsuccessfully ran for the City 
Council in 1992 and is a candidate in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that redevelopment is generally a very positive endeavor," said Vega, 
37, who owns an automotive service company. "But the way it has been abused and 
misused in Brea is a travesty." He accuses city officials of misleading the 
public in order to acquire property needed for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a natural progression of steps to legally fulfill to take the 
downtown from the state that it was in 1971 to the state it's in now," Vega 
said. "Those steps have not been honestly, ethically fulfilled. People were 
lied to. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Tim O'Donnell said that acquiring property through 
eminent domain resulted in "a very valid emotional issue" for some residents. 
But he emphasized that once the decision was made to proceed with 
redevelopment, there was "no turning back." 
</P>
<P>
 When the city began acquiring property in 1985, city policy prohibited the use 
of eminent domain. However, that policy was reversed in 1989, O'Donnell said, 
because the city was having difficulty obtaining the final pieces of required 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment has taken a heavy emotional and financial toll on some 
residents, and City Hall has taken a pounding as well. Elected officials are 
routinely harangued at twice-monthly council meetings, and Carrey J. Nelson is 
the only councilman left in office who served during the time when property was 
being acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the state Fair Political Practices Commission says that Nelson, 
along with former Mayors Ronald E. Isles and Wayne D. Wedin, escaped 
conflict-of-interest charges partly because the statute of limitations had run 
its course. Nelson now abstains from voting on redevelopment matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the 
FBI are investigating whether federal laws were violated in the redevelopment 
process.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OVERALL CRIME DOWN, 1993 STATISTICS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY and GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The overall number of reported crimes in Orange County fell in 1993 despite an 
unprecedented number of homicides, according to city-by-city crime statistics 
released this week by the California Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 196 homicides were reported last year, 78 of which occurred in Santa 
Ana. This represents a 34.5% increase in homicides for that city compared to 
the previous year. Despite the increase, overall crime in Santa Ana dropped 
significantly, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster, which historically has had a handful of murders each year, 
experienced a record 10 homicides last year. But, overall crime in the city 
dropped by 12%, according to statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana and Westminster are reflective of a countywide trend of more 
homicides and aggravated assaults, but fewer rapes, robberies, burglaries, 
thefts and arsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers have gone down and that's encouraging," Westminster police Lt. 
Rick Main said. "But you don't want to get too cocky about them because they 
can swing back. What we want to do is improve upon those numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Main said the drop in crime can probably be attributed to TARGET, the city's 
gang-suppression program and to the department's Problem Oriented Policing 
program, which focuses on the city's troubled areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime declined last year in five of Orange County's seven largest cities. 
Irvine, which has gained a national reputation as one of the safest larger 
cities in the United States, had a 13.1% decrease in violent crime, the largest 
drop of any city. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities that had significant crime decreases were Fullerton, Garden 
Grove, Los Alamitos, Orange, Tustin, San Juan Capistrano and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mission Viejo remains one of the safest cities in the county, the 
city experienced a 21% jump in crime, mostly due to a steep rise in auto thefts 
and burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in pretty rough economic times, and basically, we've had an increase 
in crimes related to dishonesty," said sheriff's Lt. Randy Blair, chief of 
police services in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities which experienced increases in crime were Laguna Beach, San 
Clemente, Villa Park and Seal Beach. O.C. Crime Comparisons 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 5,500 fewer crimes in Orange County during 1993 than in 
1992. For the most part, the decline was in property offenses. However, even in 
those categories where there were increases--homicide, assault and motor 
vehicle theft--the rate of crime per 1,000 residents remained fairly stable. 
Santa Ana had the most reported crimes in 1993, but Costa Mesa had the highest 
rate. A look at types of crimes reported countywide, and all crimes in each of

POLICE CONTRACT OFFER APPEARS HEADED FOR APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $50-million police contract offer appears to have enough support among the 
Police Protective League and the City Council to end the divisive labor dispute 
next week, union leaders and council members said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to move on and get on with business," union President Danny 
Staggs said. "This will be a start for the healing process in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would give police officers a 7% pay increase over the next 18 
months, along with a 2% patrol bonus over the same period and a $1,500 cash 
payment. That is considerably more than the 6% pay raise over two years, with 
no bonuses, that officers overwhelmingly rejected last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's 115 delegates unanimously approved the deal Thursday night, 
meaning it will be presented to the 7,000 rank-and-file officers at a series of 
ratification sessions next week. From there, it will be sent to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not all council members had taken a position on the deal Friday, 
interviews suggested that there was solid support on the 15-member panel and 
even critics said they expect it to be approved next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that the contract will be approved by the council," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the chief critic of the plan. "The PPL is a very 
powerful and intimidating political force. Nothing we can do can torpedo the 
plan. All we can do is educate ourselves and members of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not put to bed, it's pretty close," said Tom Kruesopon, spokesman for 
Councilman Rudy Svorinich, who supports the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members said they were extremely eager to put the divisive 
contract dispute behind them. Still, with all the twists and turns that the 
standoff has taken to date, some officials warned that it was too early to 
close the book on the contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the questions raised about how we're going to pay for this, I would 
not quite say this is over yet," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
opposes the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was presented to union leaders by Mayor Richard Riordan and other 
city leaders at a secret meeting Wednesday night at the Biltmore Hotel. The 
fact that the deal did not emerge from the city's negotiating team angered some 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the deal held a special committee session Friday morning in an 
effort to show that the offer is too costly, will spur similar demands from 
other labor unions and will result in a reduction of Riordan's police buildup 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, the council's budget expert, called the deal too expensive and 
said it represented a significant surrender by the city. The deal will cost an 
extra $15 million that the city did not budget for this year and will force a 
cutback in the expansion of police patrols, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the situation worse, state officials announced this week that they will 
withhold $25 million of the city's share of vehicle license fees, officials 
said. Some critics raised the specter of tax increases to close the budget gap 
that would be created by the proposed deal and the anticipated state cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 To show how excessive the plan was, officials revealed that one of Riordan's 
deputy mayors, Michael Keeley, contacted the Department of Water and Power this 
week to see if the utility could transfer an additional $40 million to city 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan Chief of Staff Bill McCarley said that discussion was tied to the 
reductions in state aid, not the contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's supporters, led by Councilman Richard Alatorre, argued that the 
city can afford the plan. They said the important point is that the deal will 
end a lengthy and divisive dispute that was dividing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to keep our eye on the prize and to remain flexible," said 
Riordan spokeswoman Noelia Rodriguez. "This is good for the city of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The union will hold a series of ratification sessions at police stations next 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Staggs said officers will approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the officers will ratify it," he said. "They deserve more but 
we're not going to get more."

NON-CELEBRITY MEMORIAL; FAMILY OF SLAIN FOOTBALL PLAYER TRIES TO PAY TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was no media circus at Kevin Murray's funeral this week. 
</P>
<P>
 No boom mikes. No photographers. Just 200 or so mourners and a coffin 
containing the bullet-riddled corpse of a 17-year-old Fairfax High School 
senior who was killed in a June 4 drive-by shooting on 49th Street just west of 
Normandie Avenue in Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the deceased was a football player -- linebacker, Fairfax Lions -- he 
had no connection to O.J. Simpson. So the press and the public stayed away from 
what has so far been chalked up as just another unsolved killing. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not sit well with Kevin's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should know about these things, not just when it happens to 
celebrities," said Kevin's 71-year-old father, Albert Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 The Murrays, who live in a duplex in the Mid-City district, want to ensure 
that Kevin's death was not in vain. They are soliciting donations for a 
memorial fund to reward people who come forward with information on Kevin's 
death or other murders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far they have raised $205. They intend to put some of Kevin's insurance 
money toward the fund, collect at least $1,000 and begin paying for tips that 
could help the stymied police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's afraid to give their names, to come forward," Murray said. "You 
can't get anything done that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The father understands why witnesses may be reluctant to speak out. He 
understands that gang violence is routine and that intimidation of witnesses is 
common. But someone has to stand up to the criminals, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll sacrifice my life, if necessary," he said. "I've lived a nice, long 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 When Albert Murray came to the City of Angels in the late 1940s from Houston, 
he fell in love with the sheen of the place. But Los Angeles has changed. "The 
angels no longer have it," he says. Now "it's the city of the devils -- Los 
Diablos. " 
</P>
<P>
 The Murrays have lived in the same Mid-City duplex near Redondo and San 
Vicente boulevards, west of La Brea Avenue, for 21 years, in an area Murray 
says used to be called South Wilshire. "Now I guess it's called South-Central," 
he says, a sober reference to the way the geographically inaccurate use of 
South-Central has spread in the Central City. They raised Kevin and their two 
older daughters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Murray, Kevin's older sister, who teaches junior high school in 
South-Central, says "when I tell my students Los Angeles used to be clean, and 
the buildings used to be beautiful, they don't believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers growing up in Compton, where her behavior on the streets was 
watched by neighbors. When she misbehaved in public, Sandra Murray says, her 
neighbors would scold her before she got home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she says, that community spirit has been lost. It's a spirit she hopes a 
Kevin Murray Memorial Fund might revive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin's fund could move people because they'll know there is a source to help 
their kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have just been dormant long enough," Albert Murray said. "They say, 
'Oh, that's too bad, did you hear about so-and-so?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And a lot of the time they don't even hear. There are a lot of kids getting 
killed out there, and they're not on the news. . . . The only people who 
remember them are family and a few close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep them alive in our memories, so this won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin was a good kid who wanted to become a firefighter, who stayed away from 
gangs and generally out of trouble, his father says, "though he was a 
teen-ager, and he wasn't perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 The detective on the case, Jerry Johnson, said Kevin appears to have been 
killed by gang members. Kevin's family believes that he was the victim of a 
case of mistaken identity; that gang members, riding through the neighborhood 
to retaliate for an earlier shooting, mistook Kevin and his friends for members 
of another gang.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray and three friends had just pulled up to the curb on 49th Street in 
their 1978 Chevrolet station wagon about 11:30 p.m. when a dark car drove past 
and opened fire. One passenger threw himself over Kevin's body as the bullets 
hit. Kevin's three friends were injured; two remain hospitalized. Kevin was 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Without witnesses or anything in Kevin's past that would explain why he would 
be the victim of a drive-by shooting, there is little the police can do to 
solve the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there's just no rhyme or reason for it without any witnesses coming 
forward, or without something in the victim's background," Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for witnesses, aware that testifying against gang members 
is "like testifying against the Mafia," the detective said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin's family is determined not to let him become another statistic in 
the Los Angeles body count. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem," said his mother, Delores Murray. Those hundreds of 
murder victims "just keep on fading."

AUTHORS OF BOOKS ON HARMONY IN LEGAL DISCORD; COURTS: LAWSUIT BY GROUP FOUNDED 
BY SPIRITUAL LEADER JOHN-ROGER CHARGES BREACH OF CONTRACT BY WRITER PETER 
MCWILLIAMS, WHO IN TURN SAYS HE WAS 'BRAINWASHED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The authors of best-selling books on achieving inner peace and harmonious 
relationships are now squared off in an acrimonious lawsuit filed in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 John-Roger and Peter McWilliams co-authored two self-help series "Life 101," 
"Wealth 101," and other books, including "You Can't Afford the Luxury of a 
Negative Thought." 
</P>
<P>
 But this month the Los Angeles-based Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner 
Awareness, founded by John-Roger, filed a lawsuit against McWilliams, charging 
breach of contract and demanding more than $400,000 plus interest on past due 
promissory notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has not yet filed an answer, McWilliams charged in a statement 
this week that John-Roger manipulated him into signing away more than $1 
million in proceeds from his writing efforts. He blamed John-Roger for clouding 
his judgment, saying that like many "devotees" of John-Roger, he literally 
accepted the man as the closest thing to God on earth -- an entity that 
movement teachings call "the Mystical Traveler Consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams, whose "Personal Computer Book" became a best-seller in the early 
1980s, said he was introduced to John-Roger's teachings after attending an 
Insight personal growth seminar in 1978. He contends that John-Roger, a former 
Rosemead high school teacher, approached him a decade later about putting his 
name on McWilliams' work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, McWilliams was depressed about a friend who had died from a rare 
strain of tuberculosis, and frightened that he, too, might have the disease, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "John-Roger promised to keep me alive and healthy as long as I kept putting 
his name on the books I wrote, and as long as I published them, promoted them 
-- and gave him half the money," McWilliams said in a statement.  
</P>
<P>
 "As amazing as it sounds, he actually had me believing he had power over life 
and death, health and illness. . . . Realizing I actually believed all this 
stuff is humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Cox, attorney for the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, said his 
clients filed suit when they decided that McWilliams was not negotiating the 
payment of his debt agreements in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the negotiations, Mr. McWilliams made it clear that if we 
attempted to enforce the obligation, that he would use publicity as a weapon -- 
that he would, in his words, make John-Roger as popular on Court TV as the 
Menendez brothers," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeeni Wong, spokeswoman for the group, said: "Basically we believe that the 
allegations (by McWilliams) are not true and we prefer to debate them in 
court."  
</P>
<P>
 The Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, which teaches "individual spiritual 
progression," or "soul transcendence," has attracted such well-known figures as 
actress Sally Kirkland and author Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington -- who has 
reportedly distanced herself from John-Roger publicly now that her husband, 
Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), is a candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, John-Roger has been embroiled in controversy about the proposed 
development of 140 acres in the mountains near Santa Barbara, where an 
affiliated organization reportedly raises horses and holds seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, McWilliams alleged that besides pumping money into various 
organizations that had grown up around John-Roger, his high-profile books 
helped to "rehabilitate" John-Roger's name after a 1988 series of articles in 
The Times drew attention to alleged problems within organizations affiliated 
with John-Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams is a prolific author whose knack for obtaining publicity made his 
Los Angeles-based Prelude Press a rare self-publishing success. 
</P>
<P>
 He promoted the books bearing his and John-Roger's names aggressively, 
appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show and radio programs nationwide. He and 
John-Roger also appeared together twice on "Larry King Live," where McWilliams 
deflected callers' complaints about his spiritual "guru." 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said he shook off the "brainwashing" that had kept him loyal to 
John-Roger after being treated by a psychiatrist for depression. (He has since 
written a book on depression with that doctor). McWilliams contends that 
John-Roger grew disenchanted with their partnership in part because their most 
recent collaborations had failed to sell well. 
</P>
<P>
 When he fell behind in royalty payments, McWilliams says, John-Roger and other 
ranking members of his organizations used their "spiritual influence" to 
persuade him to sign promissory notes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness' lawsuit is successful, he says, 
it will cost him everything, including Prelude Press, his Lexus automobile and 
his three-level home in the Hollywood Hills.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; CITY TO BUILD GYM DESPITE STALLED TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Negotiations between the city and the school district over the use of a new 
gymnasium at Hurless Barton Park have stalled, but city officials say they will 
build the $2.5-million facility regardless of whether they can reach an 
agreement with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 While both sides say they will continue to meet in an effort to hammer out a 
joint-use agreement, an official with the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School 
District has said negotiators have yet to reach an accord on several basic 
issues concerning the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said their offer would allow the school district to use 
the facility during school hours with a minimum financial obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made the deal incredibly easy for the school district," Councilman 
John M. Gullixson said. "We are putting it on our property, paying for it with 
our money and all we're asking them for is (some of the) maintenance costs. I 
have no idea what's holding them back (from signing an agreement)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Supt. Kim Stallings said the deal the city has offered the 
district involves more concessions than just a portion of the maintenance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that had been the case, we would have an agreement by now," Stallings 
said. "The deal we've been offered includes the city being able to use our 
land, on a long-term lease at no cost, as well as financial concessions above 
and beyond the maintenance costs."  
</P>
<P>
 Stallings said the unspecified portion the city wants to lease is not located 
near the gym site and would not be used for that project, he said. He did not 
know what the city wanted the land for. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings would not elaborate on what the financial considerations the city is 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two sides can work out an agreement, students at Yorba Linda Middle 
School will have use of the facility during the daytime on school days, as well 
as an unspecified number of evenings and weekends. Adults and youth sports 
teams and other recreation programs would use the gym on weeknights and most 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar arrangement exists at the gym at Travis Ranch Middle School, but 
there both sides have an equal position governing the use and ownership of the 
facility. In the case of the Hurless Barton gym, the city would have complete 
ownership rights and could terminate the school district's use of the facility 
at any time.  
</P>
<P>
 The 25,000-square-foot gym will be built on the south side of Hurless Barton 
Park, near Yorba Linda Middle School. In order for students at the middle 
school to use the gym on a regular basis, the design of the building must meet 
certain requirements regarding the number of exits and ventilation, among 
others. City officials say those requirements will add 15% to the total cost of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the facility is scheduled to start in September.DANIELLE A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; DESPITE PROTEST, CITY OKS SWAP MEET TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a new tax on swap meets, despite protests from a 
charitable organization that says the action means paying thousands in new 
taxes rather than using the money in anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest came from Straight Talk Inc., a Cypress-based, nonprofit 
organization that counsels young people against drug and alcohol abuse. A 
Straight Talk official said the organization raises a "substantial" part of its 
annual income from a swap meet held weekly at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Straight Talk's complaint, the City Council announced it will, 
in effect, refund tax-increase money to that charitable organization. The 
refund will come in the form of an annual donation to the organization, the 
council said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tax will require each owner of a swap meet to pay the city $10 each 
day of operation plus 50 cents a day for every vending stall at the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax is specifically aimed at a new swap meet scheduled to open in July at 
the Los Alamitos Race Track. But the levy also affects all other swap meets 
operating in the city, including the one held for the past 12 years on the 
campus of Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Robbins, executive director of Straight Talk, appeared before the City 
Council at its meeting Monday night to protest the proposed tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would have a devastating impact on charitable services we provide for 
the community," Robbins told the council. "It doesn't seem fair. I urge you to 
find a way around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins asked that the college swap meet be made exempt from the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age instead proposed that the city return money to the 
organization. She said the donation money could simply be earmarked as part of 
the city's annual budget. The council approved the idea and gave a 4-0 approval 
of first reading of an ordinance creating the new tax. Second and final reading 
of the tax ordinance is scheduled for the council's June 27 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, in an interview, said he still has misgivings about the swap meet 
tax. He noted that reimbursement to a charitable organization must depend on 
the City Council's year-by-year budget actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're guaranteed that we'll be taxed," Robbins said. "We're not guaranteed 
that we'll always get the money back."BILL BILLITER

CHARGES AGAINST FULLERTON TEACHER UPPED TO MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal charges against a Fullerton high school teacher were upgraded to 
first-degree murder Friday after one of the women she is accused of shooting on 
June 1 died in a Pasadena hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Ruth Greene, a 51-year-old former teacher of the year at Sunny Hills 
High School, allegedly shot her ex-lover, Loretta Coller, 62, of Glendora, and 
Coller's current companion, Martha Pereida, 49, of Alhambra, in Coller's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Coller, a retired teacher who was shot in the upper chest and whose spinal 
cord was severed by the bullet, died at 1 a.m. Friday at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena, said Glendora Police Sgt. Tim Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer said 
that Coller died of complications that set in as a result of the gunshot wound. 
She had been in a coma for the past four or five days, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pereida, who was shot in the leg, was treated for her wound and released from 
a local hospital shortly after the attack. Greene still faces an attempted 
murder charge in the shooting of Pereida. 
</P>
<P>
 At her arraignment Monday, Greene pleaded not guilty to two counts of 
attempted murder. She is being held at the Sybil Brand Institute for Women in 
Los Angeles in lieu of $300,000 bail. Her preliminary hearing has been set for 
Aug. 5.

GOSPEL MUSIC'S HARD TRUTHS; ENTERTAINMENT: THE FALL OF MICHAEL ENGLISH POINTS 
UP THE DELICATE BALANCE CHRISTIAN PERFORMERS FACE BETWEEN THEIR ART AND AND 
THEIR MINISTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The press release issued by his gospel record company a year ago described "a 
sharp dresser whose finely shaped face and prominent stature would fit 
perfectly on the pages of GQ magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 That glossy image aptly described singer Michael English. At the same time, 
though, it strayed rather far from the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary Christian music world isn't about slick celebrity. In theory, 
it's about ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance is delicate, as everyone in the industry was reminded when English 
returned an armload of the Gospel Music Assn.'s Dove Awards in April, tumbling 
overnight from his status as a top Christian artist to that of "fallen man." 
</P>
<P>
 He had been having an affair with another gospel singer. She and he both were 
married -- to other people. Together, they are expecting a child. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear whether English gave up his awards and place in the industry 
because all this was soon to come out, or whether it was purely an act of 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, his very public fall brought very personal questions to the 
performers, producers and fans of contemporary Christian music, or CCM as the 
gospel subset is known. How far had they strayed from their original mission, 
to whom were they accountable, and who was to judge? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The question becomes: Is Michael English an entertainer or a minister?" said 
the Rev. Mike Smith, whose congregation at Christ Community Church in suburban 
Franklin is spiritual home to many in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to following Jesus, and that's got to be the commitment in 
this music industry," he said. "I think a number of people realize it. But a 
number of them are clueless. . . . It's easy to lose focus." 
</P>
<P>
 The gospel genre that English represents has grown over the last decade into a 
$500-million-plus industry involving major record labels, more than 100 video 
outlets, concert halls filled with adoring fans, and marketing material that 
might inflate any head. 
</P>
<P>
 It exists side by side with a world in which Madonna's lewd antics draw barely 
a yawn, where the unwed Wynonna Judd's pregnancy constituted a recent photo 
opportunity, and where infidelity is the least of sins debated on afternoon TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us have stopped and said, 'Whoa . . . that could be any of 
us,' " said Michael Card, a multi-Dove Award winner and happily married father 
of four. 
</P>
<P>
 A playful guy in a beard and glasses, he has felt the pressure. A record 
promoter suggested not long ago that if he just removed the word Jesus from the 
title of his lullaby album, it would be marketable to a far wider audience. It 
was a compromise he refused to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a real transition. . . . It's almost like there's this entity that 
has evolved its own values. Everyone seems to be carried along by this beast -- 
this CCM beast," Card said. "The Michael English question isn't even central. 
It's just a wake-up call. . . . The question is: If the industry has very 
little or no connection to the community, what are we playing for?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ego. Self-interest. Gratification. They test the ideals of doctors, lawyers, 
police officers, reporters, politicians -- all kinds of people -- every day. In 
the Christian music business, however, holding the high road is paramount to 
success. Stray, and the ministry is compromised. Stray far, or publicly, and 
all credibility is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why when English turned in his awards and was dropped by his record 
label, when his lover was dismissed from her group, when radio stations stopped 
playing his music, it was not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, though, was it as simple as it appears. Forgiveness, after all, is a 
cornerstone of Christian faith. Many in the industry, as well as fans, said 
last week that they were loath to cast stones. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some, like the wizened man who had just picked up a round of drinks 
at a local bar, who said it was a simple question of hypocrisy. "If you're 
going to be a Christian singer, then be a Christian," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
 But more seemed to share Betty Putman's gentler view. A loyal fan and devout 
Christian, she admires English, the "man's guts for confessing," the way she 
admired Jimmy Swaggart when others made fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing, the whole ballgame in Christianity, is forgiveness. I feel 
badly, but Michael is not perfect. The only man who was died on the cross a 
long time ago," she said. "The community is supposed to not only chastise you 
when you go astray, but also nurture you and lift you up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary Christian music took root in the 1970s, when young people 
impassioned by Jesus began using folk and rock tunes to express their love. 
They played in coffeehouses and church basements. They played in order to 
preach. 
</P>
<P>
 From those early years, myriad styles have flowered, as have such crossover 
artists as Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith. This one sounds like Stevie Nicks, 
another recalls James Taylor. One is rocked by a Springsteen style, or backed 
up by a haunting woodwind melody that could belong to Kenny G. 
</P>
<P>
 What all share is an intimate conversation with Christ. When these artists 
sing of losing their way, they are not talking of a love affair gone bad. When 
they speak to questions of faith, they are not focused on life's bumpy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started out 20 years ago, people sang because they had an insatiable 
desire to communicate with Christ," said Steve Camp, who has had steady success 
with 15 albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that desire is still there, just not as prevalently as it could or 
should be," he said. "It's easy to think about voice lessons or how to make a 
better demo tape . . . rather than real, genuine ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 Camp says he does not presume to judge English. Still, he absolutely approves 
of Warner Alliance's decision to pull the plug on his former colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neil Joseph, the company's president, knows that happiness is convenient, but 
holiness costs," Camp said. "I praise God for a man with integrity and 
spirituality enough to stand true to the Lord regardless of the political or 
financial ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
 And there are ramifications. English was a major star in his arena, a sweet 
tenor often compared to pop star Michael Bolton. But Warner Alliance said in a 
statement, "When he decided to take actions that were contrary to the very 
ideals he had been espousing, our only course of action was to stop 
representing that 'platform.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mark DeYoung is a local station manager who has taken English off his playlist 
for now, a decision that caused listeners to flood him with calls criticizing 
the move. But DeYoung said he would have gotten as many calls from other 
outraged listeners if he hadn't pulled English's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are really business decisions," said DeYoung, who compared his position 
to that of a friend at a secular station who yanked Michael Jackson's records 
after the singer was accused of child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christian consumers, as odd as that sounds, all have different points of 
view," he said. "Some are extremely legalistic, moralistic. Then I have 
listeners who are more liberal and really don't care. So it's tough."

IN MAJOR SHIFT, BAPTIST GROUP BACKS DIALOGUE WITH CATHOLICS; ECUMENISM: THE 
CONVENTION DECLARATION ACKNOWLEDGES SERIOUS THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BUT AFFIRMS 
SHARED BELIEF IN MAJOR TENETS OF FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics can be more than political soul mates, 
the nation's largest Protestant denomination has declared. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major step toward ecumenism, the Southern Baptist Convention said 
Thursday that "born-again" believers may be found in all Christian 
denominations, and endorsed Baptist-Catholic dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a land where there is a demonic onslaught against the forces of 
decency and righteousness, and we need to stand with good people together," 
Timothy George, dean of Beesom Divinity School in Montgomery, Ala., told the 
convention on the final day of its 137th annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration overwhelmingly approved by about 7,500 convention delegates 
places no limits on the freedom of Baptists to persuade other Christians to 
switch churches. It also acknowledges serious theological differences with 
Catholics on such issues as papal infallibility and the relation between the 
Bible and church tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Set against the historical enmity between the nation's two largest religious 
groups, the formal declaration of the desire for dialogue was seen as 
historically significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is a major step to consider whether members of other churches 
really are part of the Body of Christ," said Father Frank Ruff of the 
Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 Baptists and Catholics have had informal discussions since 1971, beginning 
with informal regional dialogues and progressing to national conversations 
between Catholic and Baptist scholars. This year, participants in a 
Catholic-Baptist dialogue jointly sponsored by the Baptist Home Mission Board 
and the bishops conference published pamphlets offering biblical reflections on 
social issues, including the environment and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 What brought the discussion into the forefront this year was a widely 
publicized appeal for closer relations signed by conservative Catholic leaders 
and prominent evangelicals, including Pat Robertson, Charles Colson and the 
heads of both the Home Mission Board and the Christian Life Commission of the 
Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "As evangelicals and Catholics, we dare not by needless and loveless conflict 
between ourselves give aid and comfort to the enemies of Christ," said the 
declaration.

CATECHISM EXPECTED TO OFFEND, COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homosexual acts are grave depravities, but homosexuals must be accepted with 
respect. Euthanasia is murder, but doctors may discontinue burdensome means to 
preserve life. Women may not be priests, but sex discrimination must be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the teachings contained in the new English translation of the 
Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is expected to be an instant bestseller 
when a first printing of 566,000 copies hits bookstores Wednesday. The document 
will comfort and offend the faithful on both ends of the political and 
theological spectrum, say some prominent church observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican II was proposed to open up the windows of the church to the modern 
world, and the first catechism since the historic council of the 1960s does not 
back away from council teachings or hesitate to venture into cutting-edge 
issues in medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who thought it would turn the clock back to pre-Vatican II days will be 
disappointed," said Bernard Marthaler, a professor of religion at the Catholic 
University of America. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither will liberals or conservatives be completely satisfied, he said, 
with the document that confronts contemporary society on issues ranging from 
the gravity of abortion and divorce to the sinfulness of tax fraud or poisoning 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In an analysis in Commonweal magazine last year, Timothy Luke Johnson, a 
professor of the New Testament at Emory University, said there is an apparent 
schizophrenic quality to some of the catechism teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the catechism closes the door on the issue of women's ordination, 
but upholds the equal dignity of men and women and declares that every form of 
social or cultural discrimination in fundamental personal rights on the grounds 
of sex must be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area of homosexuality, the catechism appears to break new ground by 
saying men and women with deep-seated homosexual tendencies do not choose their 
condition; "for most of them it is a trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, basing itself on the Bible, "which presents homosexual acts as acts of 
grave depravity," the catechism declared that under no circumstance can 
homosexual behavior be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Even subtler ethical distinctions are made in the area of medical ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, particularly as new technological advances create unprecedented 
issues in medical ethics, Catholics will have to make their own ethical 
decisions in individual cases, some scholars say. 
</P>
<P>
 The catechism maintains: "A human being must always obey the certain judgment 
of his conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics expecting the catechism to be a rule book for life "are going to be 
horribly disappointed," said the Rev. James Hennessey, a historian at Canisius 
College in Buffalo, N.Y.

 Six teachers from Roman Catholic elementary and high schools in some of Los 
Angeles County's toughest neighborhoods will spend 10 days at Harvard 
University this month learning about the spiritual growth of children from 
noted psychiatrist Robert Coles. 
</P>
<P>
 The six are among 22 Catholic schoolteachers nationwide who have been chosen 
to take part in the "Teaching for Spiritual Growth Institute," which begins 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The program draws heavily from the research and teaching of Coles, a Harvard 
professor and internationally recognized expert on children in poverty. The 
institute is a joint venture of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic 
Activities Inc., the National Catholic Education Assn., and the 
Jesuit-sponsored Weston School of Theology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to expose our best and brightest teachers to Coles' philosophy and 
his approach to the spiritual growth of children," said Mike Carotta, director 
of the institute, now in its second year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we chose young people who showed promise and (whom) we wanted to 
stay in this field. This year, we found ourselves drawn to a mix of rookies who 
are diamonds in the rough (and) veterans who have not given up, who want to 
retool." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants from Los Angeles schools are Galen Chappelle of St. Agnes 
Elementary School, Michael B. Fabian of Junipero Serra High School, Joseph Neeb 
of St. Thomas the Apostle Elementary School, and Patricia L. Neff of St. 
Frances X. Cabrini Elementary School. Diana M. Solis of Ramona Convent 
Secondary School in Alhambra and Martin Zemanek of St. Anthony High School in 
Long Beach were also selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers receive fellowships to attend the institute, as well as a 
commitment from their schools that they will be able to initiate a project that 
springs from their work at Harvard. 
</P>

 Before leaving this week, Neeb, who teaches religion and family life, said: 
"Dr. Coles writes that teachers can't possibly use the same curriculum to teach 
religion in Brentwood as in Pico-Union where I work, even though the ultimate 
message is the same." Neeb is looking forward to getting help at the institute 
on a project he originated that uses self-esteem and religious concepts to 
teach abstinence and combat teen pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles will work intensively with the teachers, Carotta said, by "using stories 
to uncover the moral and spiritual perspectives of kids." Eight other 
professors will also give presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be time for reflection and recreation, Carotta said, because at 
work "these folks never get a break."

 Re: "Clergy Polish Counseling Skills to Aid Parishioners" (May 28): 
</P>
<P>
 We appreciate you giving this important topic some much-needed public 
attention. There are more and more clergypersons who choose to specialize in 
counseling or psychotherapy and seek to blend the spiritual resources of our 
religious traditions with the modern tools of the behavioral sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the more sophisticated and notable pastoral counseling centers and 
training programs in this region were omitted from your article. The other 
major omission was any reference to the American Assn. of Pastoral Counselors, 
which is the professional and certifying organization for clergypersons who are 
working in specialized ministries of pastoral counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the state of California does not license pastoral counselors, it is 
important for the public to know that there is a certifying and accrediting 
procedure for pastoral counselors. There is a wide degree of competency among 
those clergy who call themselves pastoral counselors.

GANG SWEEP IN SAN CLEMENTE NETS 34 ARRESTS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES 
SAY THEY SURPRISED GROUP THAT WAS FIGHTING AND DRINKING AFTER GETTING A TIP 
ABOUT AN INITIATION PARTY. 
</P>

<P>
 In what investigators called the largest gang sweep in South County, 34 
suspected gang members were arrested following an initiation party near a 
remote park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies, who had been tipped-off about the meeting, 
surprised the group Thursday night and began making arrests, Lt. Dan Martini 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects -- 11 of them juveniles -- were arrested at a police roadblock 
near the park on suspicion of fighting in a public place and conspiring to 
engage in street terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invited ourselves to the party and arrested everyone," Martini said. "It 
is our statement for the summer. We are not going to tolerate this activity and 
this is the kind of reaction that the gangs can expect from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that the young men arrested are suspected members of the 
city's largest street gang, which has an estimated 60 active members. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived at a private field next to Rick Steed Memorial Park about 
9:50 p.m. and saw members of the group fighting and drinking, said sheriff's 
investigator Paul D'Auria, who joined the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We observed about five physical fights between several members of the group," 
D'Auria said. "Based on our experience, we recognized this as a way of 
initiating new members." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Auria said the initiation consisted of members of the group surrounding the 
potential new member and "jumping in," or beating and fighting with the 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrested the group without incident as they drove from the party on 
Avenida Pico. There were no weapons recovered at the scene, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of the 34 people arrested were identified by authorities as active 
gang members or gang associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were: Balfred Brito, 20; Alfredo Aguilar Cabrera, 18; Alejandro 
Carrillo, 22; Abel Sanchez Diaz, 18; Raymond Diaz, 20; Raul Pera Flores, 20; 
Raul Gonzales, 19; Marcio Garcia Guerra, 23; Ramiro Ochoa Llamas, 23; Juan 
Carlos Llamas, 23; Sergio Aguilar Martinez, 19; Juan Gabriel Mejorado, 24; 
Adolfo Diaz Murillo, 18; Charles Mark Salazar, 21; Brett Raymond Sansom, 19; 
Juan Francisco Vasquez, 20; Alejandro Enrique Villa, 23, and Oscar Enrique 
Gonzales. All are residents of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested were: Robert David Aguilera, 19, of San Bernardino; Juan Manuel 
Banda, 19, of Santa Ana; Guillermo Palacio, 19, and Loreto Trujillo, both of 
Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults were being held at County Jail and one was booked at Anaheim City 
Jail for a parole violation. Three of the juveniles were taken to Orange County 
Juvenile Hall and eight others were released to their parents with criminal 
complaints to be filed, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the arrestees were on parole or probation, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep was organized through a special gang enforcement unit from San 
Clemente, with the help of deputies throughout South County and other law 
enforcement agencies, including parole and probation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Tom Davis, chief of police services in San Clemente, said he 
couldn't predict how the sweep would affect gang activity in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it does send a clear message to the gang members of this city that we as 
a community are involved in trying to put an end to its membership," Davis 
said. "I know there's still going to be problems and it's something we have to 
continually work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Local concern about gang activity reached a peak in October when 17-year-old 
Steve Woods was fatally pierced through the head with a metal paint roller rod 
during an altercation at a local beach. Six youths, alleged gang members or 
associates, were charged in the death.  
</P>
<P>
 The death of the San Clemente High School senior caused outraged San Clemente 
residents to hold meetings, marches and demonstrations to protest gangs and 
youth violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Brito, one of those arrested Thursday night, initially was arrested in 
connection with the Woods attack but later was released because of lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials on Friday praised the efforts of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an attitude of zero tolerance for gang behavior," said Mayor Scott 
Diehl. "This fits that philosophy. Hopefully, it will once again show those who 
are not involved in gangs that it's not a good lifestyle. It's a dead-end 
street."

RALLY ROUND THE COUNTIES; RESISTING A SACRAMENTO MONEY DRAIN-OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deep cuts proposed in Gov. Pete Wilson's new state budget surely would 
hurt Los Angeles and Orange counties. That's because both the Republican 
governor and some legislative Democrats want to balance Sacramento's budget by 
taking state funds from the counties. The outlook is especially grim for large 
counties. There must be a better way. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CUTS: Although L.A. County has only about a third of the state's 
population, it would endure more than half of the total cuts in statewide 
county funding that Wilson is proposing, according to Chief Administrative 
Officer Sally R. Reed. Altogether, L.A. County would lose $362 million in 
health care funds and property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed diversion of property taxes, Los Angeles and 11 other 
counties would lose $500 million; Los Angeles would be hit with a reduction of 
more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate-Assembly conference committee is offering an alternative budget plan, 
but it does not offer much relief for the counties. In fact, the alternative 
plan adds a new headache for counties -- a proposed cut of $32 million in 
annual subsidies to county probation camps. The result would be a Los Angeles 
cutback of as much as $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his latest budget revisions, Wilson largely had spared counties of any 
further cuts in state funds. This new round of proposed reductions in state 
funding could not come at a worst time. Los Angeles County -- already reeling 
from budget problems caused in part by previous state cutbacks -- has yet to 
agree on a new county budget. The proposed state cuts make this task a torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, too, would suffer from the Democratic proposal to end the 
annual subsidies to the county probation camps. But Orange County's loss of 
funds due to the shift of local property tax revenues would, it is hoped, be 
partially offset by projected increases in interest earnings on county 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 THE COUNTERATTACK: Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has scheduled an 
emergency meeting Monday in Sacramento with Los Angeles County representatives, 
legislators, the Department of Finance and others to review the magnitude of 
the proposed reductions in state funding to counties. The participants will try 
to identify alternatives to the proposed county budget cuts or find ways to 
raise revenue to avoid the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency meeting should put all plausible options on the table. There's 
been some talk in Sacramento of even a temporary salary cut for all public 
employees, legislators included. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is still grappling with the aftereffects of the defense 
downsizing, recession and the Northridge earthquake. With the recent defeat of 
state bonds to finance earthquake repair, residential rebuilding efforts have 
already suffered one major setback. Trying to balance Sacramento's budget on 
the backs of counties exacts an unfair toll on Los Angeles and California's 
other densely populated areas, and that cannot be good for the future economic 
life of this state. All Assembly and state Senate members who care about their 
communities must rally around the counties.

SPORTS WATCH; A VERY FULL CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even after Friday's colorful opening ceremonies in Chicago and the first 
contest (Germany 1, Bolivia 0) in the 52-game soccer tournament that will 
culminate in Pasadena's Rose Bowl a month from now, there is no doubt that many 
U.S. citizens still are wondering what all this World Cup fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
 That's inevitable in a country where soccer is far down the list of popular 
sports.And that may not change much once the world's biggest sporting event has 
finished and one country among the 24 that began the tournament has been 
crowned champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, watching the excitement of a sellout crowd in Chicago, and anticipating 
similar excitement this weekend at the Rose Bowl when the first two of eight 
games are played there (Colombia versus Romania and Cameroon versus Sweden), 
few escaped exhilaration at the thought of the world holding one of its biggest 
sporting parties here in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many U.S. citizens are only vaguely aware of it, the quadrennial 
World Cup tournament is every bit as big as the Olympics. In fact, the 
television audience for its championship game is bigger than for American 
football's Super Bowl. Both the Olympics and the Super Bowl have been held here 
in Los Angeles in recent years, and this community did itself proud hosting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 We look forward to playing host again as still another world-class sporting 
event arrives. And who knows? In the process we just might learn a bit more 
about a game that excites passions almost everywhere else in the world. At 
least it will be fun trying.

THE 'CONSCIENCE' OF THE SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No member of Congress has been more persistent, more voluble, more passionate 
in condemning the huge profits in commodities trading made a decade ago by 
Hillary Rodham Clinton than Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). No member of 
Congress has been more scornful in his dismissal of Mrs. Clinton's 
explanations, none has sought to make greater political hay out of the First 
Lady's pre-White House speculations than New York's junior senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to the surprise of no one who has followed D'Amato's ethically ambiguous 
career, a distinct sewage-like odor of gross hypocrisy is seeping from beneath 
the door of his private office. For D'Amato, as he now admits, has also been in 
the happy position of reaping big bucks in the speculative marketplace. To be 
precise, $37,125 of them in a single day of trading last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take a stroke of genius for the senator to pocket those profits. 
D'Amato is the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, which oversees Wall 
Street and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he was let in on one of 
those sweetheart deals often offered to influential members of Congress. 
Through his broker, D'Amato bought an initial offering of 4,500 share of stock 
in a small California company at $4 a share. Later that same day he sold at 
$12.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the brokerage firm that did D'Amato the favor had SEC fraud 
charges pending against it; it has since been fined and sanctioned. D'Amato, so 
he has been quick to proclaim, did nothing illegal in making a fast profit. Nor 
does he appear to have violated congressional ethics rules. But an act can be 
technically legal and can meet the feeble ethics standards of Congress and 
still be perceived by any ordinary person of common sense as wrong, wrong, 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato has found himself in trouble before, most famously having been rebuked 
by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1991 for letting his brother, who was 
subsequently convicted of mail fraud, use his office while he was representing 
a defense contractor. Now he's revealed as profiting from a favor extended by a 
firm of highly sullied reputation. And this is the man who natters on about the 
ethical flaws of others! Will someone please open a window.

ISRAELI RABBI AND ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with profound sorrow that I read The Times article titled, "Former 
Israeli Chief Rabbi Calls on Jews to Kill Arafat" (June 9). 
</P>
<P>
 I once had the pleasure 30-plus years ago -- it was a pleasure then -- to 
interview Rabbi Shlomo Goren in Los Angeles. In those days he fell into the 
normal range of religionists, a range that includes the very liberal to the 
very fundamental, but not so liberal or so fundamental to act as if they were 
God and not God's humble servants. 
</P>
<P>
 In his earlier period, Rabbi Goren was an Orthodox rabbi whose rulings were 
tempered by the fact that he served in the military whose command and personnel 
had special needs to make secure the new state of Israel.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not the same Rabbi Goren whose statements as reported would endanger 
the state of Israel or its negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, his former moderateness and his previous high rank obscure this 
extremism on his part. This obscene behavior makes normal fundamentalism look 
radical by comparison.  
</P>
<P>
 Jews everywhere, including in Israel, Jews everywhere, including in Israel, 
have reason to honor the Rabbi Shlomo Goren of yesterday and to have profound 
sorrow for the state of mind, faith and perhaps health to which he has 
descended. 
</P>
<P>
 How sad it is that among the ultra-extremist orthodox preservers of faith, be 
they Jewish, Christian, Islamic or otherwise, there is an unforgivable fringe 
that not only acts as if it were above the laws of men and women, but also 
above the laws of God. 
</P>
<P>
 RABBI WILLIAM M. KRAMER 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The phenomenon, as you reported on June 9, of the past holder of the two 
politically appointed offices of chief military rabbi and chief rabbi of Israel 
issuing a religious ruling to kill Yasser Arafat must be examined in its 
context, which has very little to do with religious Judaism and more with the 
peculiar political personality of one individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Goren has built an illustrious and photogenic career catering to the 
political winds in Israel in a manner that is envied by lesser politicians. 
Having no written constitution, Israel does not enjoy the protection of the 
separation of church and state. This situation in Israel has led to the strange 
phenomenon of religious official appointments being made largely by persons 
with no special religious affinity, and not based on any extraordinary Jewish 
religious merit or expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Goren received his military rabbi appointments, to a large extent, from 
Israeli political ministers and military commanders who, for the most part, 
were characterized by their Jewish irreligiosity and their socialist political 
orientation. Later, Rabbi Goren was appointed to the post of chief rabbi in 
Israel not by any religious body, but by a vote of members of the Israeli 
Parliament, the Knesset. The majority of Knesset members are not religiously 
observant Jews, but irreligious or secular Jews, atheists and also include Arab 
Muslims and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the strange situation of Israeli politics, it is easy to deduce that 
Rabbi Goren's formal rulings are not binding on anyone. If Rabbi Goren attempts 
to carry out his own ruling, he would speedily find himself before an Israeli 
civil court being tried for his crime and probably end up sitting in prison 
from where he could continue to hand down his "formal rulings" to his extremist 
political sympathizers.

CONFRONTATION WITH NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One would give the astute North Koreans more credit than to resort to the 
film-flam hollowness of an old shell game by shifting, rearranging and changing 
the history of the spent atomic fuel rods to outwit and frustrate the cognizant 
Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (June 3). 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy of the Koreans is quite simple and operates worldwide, "justice 
delayed is justice denied." When one form of duplicity has obstructed world 
progress to contain atomic proliferation beyond reason and the ax is about to 
fall, another cry is heard as the North Koreans plead to convene for bilateral 
discussions with peer groups or going back to square one.

 * Israel took out Iraqi nuclear facilities in the early 1980s and we all 
cheered. We must do the same in North Korea. Haven't we finally learned that 
trying to appease the likes of a Saddam Hussein or a Hitler does absolutely no 
good except to reassure ourselves that we did everything we could reasonably do 
before we took military action? We should take out Kim Il Sung's nuclear 
war-making capacity right now, before he uses it. 
</P>
<P>
 As "leader of the free world," Americans ought to be disgusted with their 
diplomats negotiating to appease the latest reincarnation of Attila the Hun. 
The end of history is a long way off, and it is up to us to make sure it comes 
out as good as we can make it.

 * Even though the United States has the largest and most potent arsenal in the 
world, we fear for our survival when Third World "rogue" regimes begin to 
construct nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Third World countries do not need 100 or 1,000 times overkill to threaten the 
United States. 
</P>

 Although we fear the nuclear intentions of North Korea, this Third World 
country has no fear of our nuclear capabilities.

showing North Korea as a monkey-like creature walking on all fours, and having 
a mouth from one protruding cheek to another.

 As an Asian American, I wonder if such a caricature would have been allowed if 
North Korea was an African or European country.

 * After the Korean War, the South gained economically from the U.S. The North 
has gone deeper into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration was correct to offer North Korea both economic and 
diplomatic concessions to give up its desire for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting a second Korean War will cost a legion of American lives. No American 
wants this to happen, but what if the terrorists who attacked the World Trade 
Center had been armed with a nuclear device bought from North Korea?

READING PLAYBOY IN FIREHOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am concerned that the recent victory and extensive media coverage of Fire 
Captain Steve Johnson and his fight to read Playboy at the firehouse might 
leave the impression that all firefighters are pre-pubescent males with 
out-of-control hormones. Much of the news commentary I have seen and read has 
been directed at the lasciviousness of the magazine and the right to look at 
"girlie pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 By the commentary, I can see that much of the media don't understand what 
firehouse life is really like. I do believe that these types of magazines can 
contribute in creating a hostile working environment, not only for women but 
for anyone, male or female. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to reassure the public that many of us use our spare time to improve 
ourselves personally and professionally and are not counting the minutes until 
our next break so we can read Playboy. We use our time to study the numerous 
volumes of department manuals in our station library preparing for promotional 
exams. We read Time, Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal, Sports Illustrated, 
Boating, Fishing, Hunting, and many of us even use our spare time to read our 
Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
 While many would like to paint us with the broad brush of "boys will be boys," 
I would like to reaffirm that the citizens of Los Angeles County are being 
protected by highly trained professional men and women who do this job 
primarily out of a desire to serve.

 * The voters rejected bond issues which would have provided money for some 
worthwhile, even needed, government spending. Those who don't understand should 
look at L.A. County's wasteful consideration of legal action in response to the 
court ruling on Playboy in the firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel did his job and defended county rules; the court decided 
the issue. If government has money to file appeals and continue a desperate 
legal campaign for this cause then we, the voters, are right to deny more money 
for increasingly out-of-touch bureaucrats.

SPEAKING OUT ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "AIDS Walk Lifts Spirits," (June 6): 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the article seems to be that it's time to speak out . . . when 
you lose somebody close to you. 
</P>
<P>
 I maintain that it is past time to speak out and recognize the scourge of AIDS 
after it takes a life. 
</P>
<P>
 One should speak out against homosexual behavior and convince people not to 
participate in this destructive lifestyle before friends die of AIDS.

SCHOOLS BUDGET CALLS FOR NO MAJOR CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The governing board of the Westminster School District has approved its 
1994-95 budget, which calls for no significant cuts in programs or staff for 
the first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education approved the $35-million spending plan without comment 
at its regular meeting on Thursday.It proposes a 2% raise for classified 
personnel, and no change in the current level of staffing or programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, the district was forced to cut $3 million in programs and 
personnel because of plummeting funding from the state. Those cuts included the 
loss of school nurses, psychologists and teachers and resulted in larger class 
sizes, prompting bitter complaints from parents and school employees alike. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, no one from the public spoke during the budget hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our schools have had a really tough time for the past five years and its hard 
for anyone to work well under those conditions," district spokeswoman Audrey 
Brown said. "However, this is the first year that we're not deficit spending so 
we can breathe a little." JON NALICK

EVERYONE HAS AN IDEA ABOUT WHERE DODGERS SHOULD GO FOR RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To reverse the trend of Dodger relief pitchers blowing saves, why not start 
with a reliever for the first three innings -- he'll give up three or four runs 
-- then, for a stopper, bring in a starter for the last six, allowing the 
offense to rally and win the game? 
</P>
<P>
 If you need any further advice, I can be contacted through my psychiatrist.

 Why don't the Dodgers make Orel Hershiser a middle reliever? When he starts, 
his limit seems to be six innings. As a reliever, he can pitch three or four 
and add five years to his career.

READERS SAY TYSON DESERVED DAY IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Sigmund Downey's psychoanalytic hanging of Mike Tyson (June 13), 
I suggest you move his column to the Life & Style section. No one defends Mike 
Tyson as a model citizen, but it doesn't take a Ph.D. to figure out his 
conviction was not an uncontested slam dunk.He deserves his day in court 
without Dr. Downey taking Freudian cheap shots from 2,000 miles away.

 Tyson was not tried and convicted of being a "raging bully," nor for what he 
may or may not have done to his former wife, Robin Givens, nor for anything he 
may or may not have said to heavyweight Razor Ruddock. His sentence was 
rendered solely upon his conviction for the Desiree Washington rape charge.

 "Tyson cornered her like a foe. He overpowered her." Thank you, Mike Downey, 
for finally shedding light on this convoluted event. Up until this time I was 
under the impression that only Ms. Washington and Iron Mike were in the room 
that evening, but now the world knows that you were secretly hiding under the 
bed to get the story firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I will be the first to agree with you that Mike Tyson should remain in 
jail if he, in fact, did rape Desiree Washington. I can't say though that I'm 
convinced here. Society has demonstrated that a guilty verdict in court is not 
necessarily a revelation of truth, nor does a not-guilty verdict absolve 
accused parties of blame (see: Rodney King, Latasha Harlins, William Kennedy 
Smith, etc.)

MARV GOUX THE GOOD, MARV GOUX THE BAD

 Marv Goux is not known in Trojan history for selling student football tickets. 
He is known as a 165-pound linebacker-center who made the Notre Dame 
all-opponent team three years in a row.He was the most inspirational Trojan 
coach ever and gave his heart, body and soul for USC. To ever think Marv should 
not be included in the first elite group of athletes and coaches inducted to 
the USC Hall of Fame is an insult to Marv and the great tradition of USC 
sports.

 Tom Nessinger (Viewpoint, June 11) has obviously read only the one story about 
Coach Goux. Were he to read broader, he would learn that Marv Goux was a 
marvelous player, a great coach, a master motivator and a leader of men. If Mr. 
Nessinger would leave him out of the Hall, he might as well ban Trojan spirit.

 In February 1980, I bypassed BYU, Notre Dame, UCLA . . . virtually any college 
in the nation to attend USC on a football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 My experience at USC was so discouraging due to the physical abuse and antics

BLAZING TRAILS -- 600 AND ON; OUTDOORS: THE RAILS TO TRAILS CONSERVANCY HOPES 
TO HAVE 10,000 MILES OF TRAILS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rails to Trails Conservancy dedicated its 600th trail this month with the 
promise that there will be more and longer trails. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dedication in Indianapolis of trail No. 600, 6,989 miles of abandoned 
railroads had been converted to trails, said Peter Harnik, RTC's vice president 
for trail development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to have 10,000 miles by 1997," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement to convert abandoned rail lines to trails began in the mid-1960s. 
By the time the conservancy was created in 1986, more than 100 such trails were 
scattered around the country. Since then it has been helping local groups and 
coordinating a national network. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1992 there were 500 rail-trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are an additional 650 projects, 11,800 miles, under development, 
but "some are not going to happen," Harnik said from his Washington office. "We 
may get half, two-thirds. We're not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 As RTC, a non-profit group, approaches its 10th anniversary, "we're starting 
to shift to quality instead of quantity," Harnik said. "There are some 
exciting, long trails" slowly being assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the Allegheny Highland Trail, 315 miles of trails and canals 
connecting Washington and Pittsburgh, "an entirely off-road route between the 
two cities." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're well on our way with 220 miles (of segments) in existence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Nebraska, we're close to closing the deal on the longest rail-trail, over 
300 miles with part of it along the Niobrara River, a wild and scenic river," 
Harnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest current rail-trail is the Katy Trail along the Missouri River near 
St. Louis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even bigger plans in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very exciting effort is the East Coast Greenway, from Boston to Washington, 
600 miles that some people have dubbed 'The Appalachian Trail for the rest of 
us,"' Harnik said. There's discussion about some day extending that trail all 
the way down the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rail-trails represent the ideal multiuse trail," Harnik said. "Where else do 
you see roller-bladers sharing a trail with equestrians and bird-watchers 
stepping aside to allow a family on bicycles to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The longest trail under development, he said, is the "Discover Michigan 
Trail," 1,500 miles of trail around both of the state's peninsulas. 
</P>
<P>
 Historic trails include the route from Washington through Maryland into 
Pennsylvania, "the route (President Abraham) Lincoln took to Gettysburg to give 
the Gettysburg address," Harnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan and Wisconsin are at the top of the rails-to-trails conversion list. 
Wisconsin has 759.4 miles in 41 rail trails while Michigan has 729.8 miles in 
55 trails.

MARSHALL PLAYS TOUGH IN JOB FIGHT; BASEBALL: IN HIS BATTLE TO KEEP THE HEAD 
COACHING POSITION AND WEST TEXAS A&M, THE FORMER CY YOUNG WINNER HAS GONE 
PUBLIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They called him Iron Man when he stuck his bare hand out to catch a whizzing 
throw for the Montreal Expos more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Marshall still plays tough. 
</P>
<P>
 After West Texas A&M officials announced May 9 they would not renew his 
one-year contract as head baseball coach, Marshall demanded a grievance 
hearing. He went to the media with a two-inch-thick binder of memos, 
evaluations and supportive letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall -- veteran of 14 seasons in the major leagues, winner of the Cy Young 
Award, doctor of philosophy -- wants his job back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about those kids and how much this is going to hurt them," Marshall 
said of the Buffaloes, who finished 8-48 in their first year of NCAA 
competition since 1971. "I also don't think it's a good lesson if I just walk 
away and don't stand up for my rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall and 55 others applied for the head coaching vacancy that Athletic 
Director Mike Chandler hopes to fill by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 But before anyone is hired, Chandler said, Marshall will receive a grievance 
hearing. That hearing has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Marshall, Chandler has a hard time explaining what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know," he mused. "A real problem in communication, between he 
and I." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall brought lengthy credentials to the Texas Panhandle: He became the 
first relief pitcher to win the Cy Young, going 15-12 with a 2.42 ERA for the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in 1974. He had 21 saves while appearing in a record 106 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a career record of 97-112 with a 3.14 ERA and 188 saves while with 
Detroit, the Seattle Pilots, Houston, Montreal, Minnesota, Atlanta, Texas and 
the New York Mets. Then, he consulted professionally and coached for seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Chandler said, "I don't think in this case those things matched with 
what we evidently needed in the position." 
</P>
<P>
 So Chandler announced that the WT baseball program needed new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, as players and parents rallied to Marshall's side, WT President 
Barry Thompson issued a statement listing reasons the contract wasn't renewed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Failure to require players to comply with accepted standards of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lack of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lack of commitment to the university. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lack of "demonstrated knowledge of the fundamental skills of baseball based 
on the players' performance during the 1994 season." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have it all documented," Thompson said, declining to elaborate because of 
possible litigation. "We'll just leave it as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 51, adamantly denies the university's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent tour of the baseball stadium he and his players built last 
year, Marshall showed off the mound, the backstop, the maroon outfield wall. He 
fretted about cracks in the dry soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I sit," he said, pointing to a little desk in one dugout. "This 
is what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 And Marshall says he did it well at West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a $30,000 salary and teaching nine semester course hours, Marshall 
recruited players and directed construction of the stadium. He says the players 
improved drastically throughout the season, which they finished 2-18 in the 
Lone Star Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Hughey said Marshall showed his son, Robert Hughey, how to throw 100 
pitches in practice without getting sore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is a tremendous coach. He knows what he's talking about," the father 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said he made it clear before being hired that he needed several years 
to build a program. School administrators understood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time for them (players) to pitch my style of game -- one year to get 
into shape and throw correctly, a second year to manage games." 
</P>
<P>
 But the contract specifies no "obligation on the employer to offer continued 
employment beyond the term herein contracted." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's non-renewal marked the 10th departure of a head coach at WT during 
Chandler's three years as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hire someone, I never expect that they're going to be around for just 
one year," Chandler said. "I'm always hopeful that people will be here forever, 
if it works out." 
</P>
<P>
 Memos as far back as October reveal tension between Chandler and the coach 
over issues such as stadium construction and players' use of profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chandler described a philosophical disagreement about the importance of 
winning: The actual won-loss record wasn't as significant as Marshall's 
attitude about winning, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning and losing means nothing to me," Marshall says. "The only thing that 
matters was that they improve their skills." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Chandler knows little about baseball and has treated him with 
disrespect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therein lies the problem ... everybody thinks they know about coaching."

 Rate Deals for MCI, Others Ruled Out: Federal regulators generally cannot give 
long-distance telephone companies competing against AT&T greater leeway to 
decide what rates to charge customers, the Supreme Court ruled. By a 5-3 vote, 
the court struck down a Federal Communications Commission policy that allowed 
MCI and other AT&T competitors to offer rates and services not specified in 
filings with the commission.The policy was designed to foster more competition 
for AT&T, which holds a 60% share of the nation's long-distance market. AT&T 
had successfully challenged the policy in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia. Agreeing with that court, the justices said federal 
communications law generally does not authorize the FCC to let smaller 
long-distance telephone companies cut such special deals with customers.

COURTNEY LOVE BANDMATE KRISTEN PFAFF FOUND DEAD; POP MUSIC: THE BODY OF HOLE'S 
BASS PLAYER IS DISCOVERED IN HER BATHTUB IN SEATTLE. NO CAUSE OF DEATH HAS BEEN 
DETERMINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kristen Pfaff, the bass player of the acclaimed rock band Hole, was found dead 
at her Seattle home Thursday, according to Seattle police. 
</P>
<P>
 Hole is fronted by Courtney Love, the widow of Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain, who 
died from a self-inflicted shotgun blast in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Pfaff, 27, was found in her bathtub by a friend. The police report 
noted that a nearby purse contained syringes and other drug paraphernalia. An 
autopsy was completed Friday, but a spokesman for the King County coroner said 
that no cause of death had been determined, pending results of toxicology 
tests, which are expected in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the band's label, Geffen Records, said that Pfaff had 
completed a drug rehabilitation program last winter and was preparing to move 
back to her previous home in Minneapolis to wait until Hole resumed touring 
that had been on hold since Cobain's death. The surviving members of the band, 
whose album "Live Through This" was released to highly positive reviews shortly 
after Cobain's suicide, say that they plan to regroup and continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deeply anguished over the loss of an extremely talented musician, 
beautiful soul and a great friend," said Love, guitarist Eric Erlandson and 
drummer Patty Schemel in a statement released through Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Cobain's suicide, reportedly after his return to heroin use, Love 
lamented the easy availability of heroin in Seattle. Pfaff's is the latest in a 
string of deaths of Seattle alternative-rock musicians. Andrew Wood, the lead 
singer of Mother Love Bone, died of a heroin overdose in 1990 shortly before 
the release of the band's debut album. (Two members of the group went on to 
form Pearl Jam.) Stefanie Sargent, the guitarist for the all-female band 7 Year 
Bitch, also died from a heroin overdose in 1992, while Mia Zapata of the band 
the Gits was killed last year in a still-unsolved case. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaff was raised in Buffalo and trained as a classical pianist. At 22 she 
became infatuated with rock music. Living in Minneapolis, she founded the band 
Janitor Joe and later joined Hole in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was a fan of rock since I was a teen-ager," she told The Times' Robert 
Hilburn in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor's Note: Sunday Calendar's Pop Eye column includes an item on Courtney 
Love using a computer bulletin board to communicate with fans. The section was 
printed before the news of the death of Love's bandmate, Kristen Pfaff, became 
public.

'FILENAME: FUTURFAX'

<P>
 Re Lewis Segal's review of my piece ("Compelling Visions in 'Borders,' " May 
23): 
</P>
<P>
 "Filename: FUTURFAX" was misspelled. As anyone with a computer knows, file 
names can't have over eight letters.The piece may not belong in a dance series, 
but then, by the same token, it should not be reviewed by a dance reviewer -- 
nor, for that matter, should any of my pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't do "grandiose earth-mother or queen-bitch roles"; I have played the 
Earth (in a very unmotherly way) and the Death Crone (ditto). Aside from being 
snide, insulting, sexist and speciesist, the queen-bitch thing is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years I have played: a monk, a scientist, a gorilla, a Neolithic 
King, Marie Antoinette, Tsaritza Alexandra, a bag lady, a hominid, a tectonic 
plate. Never a "queen-bitch." As for my lament being for " her world, her life" 
(emphasis Segal's), I have never done a less (emphasis mine) autobiographical 
piece. Too bad Segal brings so much baggage to his viewing that he can't 
discern what's there for the projections he imposes on it.

STERN'S TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was fun listening to Claudia Puig's attempt to interview Howard Stern. Her 
resulting story was just what Stern wanted. The only thing she left out was his 
not realizing that she writes for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be self-proclaimed, but Stern definitely seems to have the media as 
"his audience." It's amazing how many journalists are willing to accept his 
wrath by doing interviews "on his terms." You can't tell me The Times didn't 
get what it expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the "Howard hype" gets front-page Calendar coverage ("Move Over, 
Woodward & Bernstein," June 2). I personally enjoyed the story, but wouldn't a 
feature on ABC's "Jacqui's Dilemma" (reviewed on F9), exploring teen-age 
pregnancy, have had more relevance?

'THE COCKTAIL PARTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re " 'Cocktail Party' Loses Its Fizz" by F. Kathleen Foley (May 27) -- Foley 
has only been on the Theater Beat a short time and already she has made 
history: She is the first reviewer ever to accuse Nobel laureate T.S. Eliot of 
"psychobabble." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliot's "The Cocktail Party" has multifaceted characters, comedy, pathos and 
several twists in its fascinating plot -- everything that a great play should 
have.It's a complex play filled with poetic images that lead the audience to 
conversation and debate. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was Foley's critique? She wanted the director (me) to approach the 
play with "a healthy spirit of iconoclasm." Where does she get the impetus to 
suggest that the play should be performed other than how its author intended?  
</P>
<P>
 It used to be a compliment to suggest that a director was true to the 
playwright's vision, but that was back when a director could direct a "Macbeth" 
that actually took place in Scotland. Nowadays directors feel compelled to 
impose their own "visions" on famous plays with choreographed movement, special 
effects, gender role reversals and other "tricks of the trade." Such tricks are 
sometimes appropriate, but, with "The Cocktail Party," a director need only see 
to it that the actors give great performances (which Foley acknowledges) and 
that the staging and design of the show (which Foley ignores) bring the 
playwright's words and ideas to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays like "The Cocktail Party" are timely but make their points about the 
human condition with an eloquence that is increasingly absent from today's 
plays, where the four-letter word is king.

 OK, I'm reading Susan Kandel's art review over a cup of coffee ("Visions of 
Seduction, Repulsion," June 9). I'm sitting in the breakfast nook, my decidedly 
generous tush in a pair of decidedly generous rumpled sweat pants, my 
middle-aged bosom a lot farther south than in the accompanying illustration.The 
snide descriptives -- "pathetic," "absurdly bloated," "less failures than 
mutants," "overstuffed," "with their massive thighs . . . (they) wholly elude 
the reach of the pornographic" -- keep piling up, and I'm starting to wonder 
exactly what is being reviewed here: the artist's creative expression or the 
presumed prior gustatory offenses of the models? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know much about art, but the pictured woman looks OK to me. I've 
actually seen reproductions of some famous old pix of women who expressed a 
variety of body types, many of which were not only considered erotic in the 
good old 15th Century but still somehow manage to stir men's souls today. 
</P>
<P>
 A suggestion (food for thought?): "Fat" is not a pejorative, simply one of the 
Creator's many options. Look around, Ms. Kandel: I'm everywhere.

TICKETMASTER'S FEES AND SERVICE RAISE IRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Pearl Jam vs. Ticketmaster: Choosing Sides" (June 8): 
</P>
<P>
 Ned S. Goldstein states that Ticketmaster "operates fully and squarely within 
the parameters of all applicable laws." That, however, does not necessarily 
make the service fees they charge fair. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently bought a $15 ticket for the band Shonen Knife at the Palace; the 
service charge I paid at my local Ticketmaster was $4.75. This may not seem to 
be a lot of money, but considering that it comes to nearly 32% of the face 
value of the ticket, it is clearly outrageous. For the upcoming WOMAD festival, 
I paid a $6 service charge on a $15 ticket (a 40% increase in the cost of the 
ticket). 
</P>
<P>
 Such abusive fees are unfair to both the fans and many of the bands trying to 
compete in a market where established bands can command extraordinary prices. I 
wish the best of luck to Pearl Jam in trying to open up this issue.

 About all the phone sales people at Ticketmaster will tell you is that the 
available seats are somewhere in the building. We have a firm rule -- no 
attendance at any event that sells through Ticketmaster, including high culture 
events. Voting with our feet has been our only form of protest to date. 
Ticketmaster is a rip-off in price and service.

 I am having trouble finding the words to express the pride I feel for the 
members of Pearl Jam. They have proven that they truly care more for their fans 
than for the money they would have made had they been able to tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ticketmaster -- let's see now: If you want to book a concert at any 
major venue in the country, you have to deal with them, no choice. If you want 
to buy a ticket to a concert at any major venue in the country, you have to 
deal with them, no choice. That sounds exactly like a monopoly.

POP MUSIC REVIEW ; VOLUPTUOUS HORROR TWISTS OUT SOME CRACKED FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black is as twisted and enterprising as its 
name suggests. With up to nine members on stage at once, the New York 
performance-art-meets-rock group plays hard-edged new wave with a glammy twist, 
while a cast of mainly topless females in Kabuki-style face paint does routines 
around crude props. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday at the Whisky, the G-string-clad performers' matted wigs and 
blackened teeth gave them the appearance of decomposing centerfolds, but inside 
the context of the whole show, the display came off as original and 
entertaining rather than sensational or gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and leader Kembra Pfahler sang like an underdeveloped Exene Cervenka, 
while in between songs she chatted with the crowd in the same campy and 
exaggerated tones of Elvira.  
</P>
<P>
 Pfahler and a little evil-looking bat girl (this troupe's equivalent to Blind 
Melon's bee-girl) ripped Kleenex out of holders to the beat of one song, while 
the band banged out its bumpy pop. A series of colorful props -- painted 
cardboard cutouts of bathtubs, ocean waves and ladybug wings -- gave the sweet 
and enthusiastic feel of a school play.  
</P>
<P>
 More inviting than confrontational, the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black 
offers cracked fun in an often dark and tortured realm. LORRAINE ALI

TV REVIEWS; DISCOVERY ENTERS THE WORLD OF 'DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as a dreamer can be too much in love with his dreams, the three-hour "The 
Power of Dreams" on the Discovery Channel is too much in love with its subject. 
</P>
<P>
 While it emerges as a wonderful look inside the minds of certain artists who 
have used their dreams as creative fuel, it also seems afraid of being too 
scientific. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark up another soft science program for the channel that was supposed to be 
the science outlet on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Because producer Katherine Carpenter's study of dreams has a clear bias toward 
the view that dreams do have content with specific meaning for the dreamer, any 
alternative views in the scientific community receive short shrift.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Allan Hobson is briefly on screen in the first hour, explaining that our 
dreams are probably no more than the result of the brain's cortex trying to 
make sense of the random firings of neurons in the brain's upper section during 
sleep. He calls efforts to make sense of it all "a fool's errand"; renowned 
physicist and brain researcher Francis Crick says that dreams are "the brain's 
waste bin" that allow it to function the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overwhelming number of those interviewed and profiled here strongly 
insist that dreams are more than neurons going off. The program gives a gloss 
on the dream research of both Freud and Jung, without detailing the two 
psychoanalysts' severe conflicts with each other and the recent debunking of 
Freudian analysis. Jungian Robert Bosnak, however, makes a very good case for 
dream interpretation, citing several cases (including one of an AIDS patient 
whose story has been turned into a play) of mental and physical healing through 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks practiced this, and today, writers such as William Styron (who says 
he doesn't put a lot of weight in his dreams) experience powerful dreams that 
can trigger key ideas or, in Styron's case, break a bout of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The second hour serves up an interesting sampling of how such different 
artists as video maker Bill Viola, writer Isabel Allende and songwriter Billy 
Joel revive their dreams and put them on the page or screen. For once in this 
show (especially in Viola's brilliant installations), dreams do have meaning. 
The third hour, on dreams and religion, was not available for review. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Power of Dreams" airs at 8 p.m. and again at 11 p.m. Sunday on the 
Discovery Channel. ROBERT KOEHLER

NEAR AND DEAR; COLLECTING TREASURES FROM THE RECENT PAST IS WISE FOR; PRACTICAL 
AND EMOTIONAL REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may have missed buying Mission furniture and Art Deco pieces for a few 
hundred dollars in the early 1970s, and that Tiffany lamp you could have had 
for $75 in 1969 is long gone, but don't despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about collecting furniture and accessories created closer to today's 
date. It's a good bet that at local consignment stores, swap meets, garage 
sales and auctions, there are little Cinderella-like bargains just waiting to 
be dusted off and looked at in a new way. What's destined to be the next 
collectible trend? No one knows for sure, but it's easy to suppose that just as 
"Maverick" and "The Flintstones" are huge nostalgic successes, so will be the 
furniture, accessories and rugs from the 1930s, '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for collecting items from the immediate past are both practical 
and emotional. The high prices of 18th-Century pieces and their relative 
scarcity makes collecting them a rich person's game. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be believed that anything before 1825 was handcrafted and therefore 
of quality, but that after 1825 the Industrial Revolution and its machines 
lowered quality and true artistic value.  
</P>
<P>
 Using this definition, true antiques had to be at least 100 years old in 1925. 
You are obviously not going to run into these pieces at a garage sale. And many 
of these items don't relate to the way we live today, with our smaller spaces 
and lack of time (or servants) to maintain ornate silver, crystal and heavy 
wooden furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's collectors are more emotional buyers, purchasing what they really 
like, not what someone has decreed they should like. 
</P>
<P>
 Pieces are purchased not only because of their beauty and craftsmanship (or 
lack thereof), but also because of their sentimental value. Many collectors are 
young, so items from the '40s and '50s hark back to a time when life seemed 
simpler but still accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 These old things are being used in a new ways, though. Living rooms have 
decorative ceramics and jars that were once found in kitchens; pine furniture 
is prized for the paint peeling off, and old fabric remnants and Spanish shawls 
and serapes are thrown over chairs to cover worn spots. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, collectors are looking to America and especially California for 
inspiration in decor, not to a European life they've never lived. Hence, 
American country is hot, with its aged furniture and chipped pottery, as is the 
country-Western funk look with Pendleton blankets, '40s tea towels and 
tablecloths and cowboy dishes. What seem to be on the horizon are both a Deep 
South look and the cozy atmosphere of a country or beach cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a resurgence of the cottage look," said Wendi Young, interior designer 
with Kitchens Del Mar in Corona del Mar. "People like a warm look of 
comfortable furniture, aged kitchen cabinet doors, bright colors and 
accessories from the recent past." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitty Sue Pease, president of the Santa Monica Antique Market Dealers Assn. 
and a dealer, agrees. "We're not refinishing as we used to. Now we want to show 
the scars of a piece without it being touched up. I call it the 'faded glory' 
look. You see beauty in things that other people don't and make it your own. 
Find what look is right for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the trends that Pease sees in collecting are pieces of garden 
furniture, metal plant boxes, plant stands and even old, rusty iron accessories 
used both inside and out. "I used to be selling ceramic cows, and now it's 
flowers and flower-related objects," she said. And flowers are seen everywhere: 
painted on canvas slipcovers, plopped in pitchers doubling as vases, sewn on 
fabrics tossed over chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hot new collectibles are old typewriters, plastic radios, chintz china 
from the 1920s and anything that is California-style. California style includes 
pottery made here -- such as Catalina pottery and Brayton ware made in Laguna 
Beach, plein air and other landscape and floral paintings, handcrafted tiles 
and arts and crafts items.  
</P>
<P>
 Objects from California that were made during the '30s and '40s are especially 
sought after. 
</P>
<P>
 "People today are seeing the '30s and '40s as long enough ago to make the 
pottery and the furniture collectible," Pease said. (With the decline in 
cigarette smoking, ashtrays seem destined to be rare objects in the future.) 
</P>
<P>
 Blond maple furniture by Heywood Wakefield is becoming collectible. It was 
designed in the '50s in a spare, streamlined way that fits in with the '90s 
idea of a return to natural materials. Chairs by Eero Saarinen and Charles and 
Ray Eames are also prized and can still sometimes be found for reasonable 
prices. They're mindful of the modernist time in the '30s and '40s when 
industry and art seemed like a perfect match. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, the molded plywood chair, table and screens introduced by the 
Eameses in 1946 came from designs for stretchers and leg splints they developed 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Saarinen's 1948 mass-produced fiberglass "womb" chair came into being when he 
found the surface of early fiberglass products too rough. Although we've 
encountered similar chairs in waiting rooms throughout the world, used singly 
they make a design statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Designing using a "retro" look can be fun and not horribly expensive. Formica 
and metal kitchen sets in bright colors, heavy metal toasters and other 
appliances, McCoy pottery and flower pots and funky lamps in bright colors 
create a cheerful look for today's smaller kitchens or dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Living rooms with used, over-stuffed furniture, colorful plastic lamps and 
ceramic collectibles are inviting and can even be humorous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when bought at swap meets and garage sales, these offbeat items can 
be inexpensive, running tens of dollars rather than thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since these things aren't expensive, you can turn them into something else," 
Pease said. "Some fun ideas in lighting are to make lamps out of old sports 
trophies, birdhouses, statues and other things. People are also painting and 
decorating lamp shades with bangles and beads to fit their color schemes. Using 
your imagination, you can turn unusual mantels into headboards, make shelves 
out of old picket fences, have aged windows become mirror frames, shutters 
become paintings and architectural pieces like corbels or brackets become 
individual book stands." 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s may well go down as the time when home decor became truly 
individualistic due to economic necessity and interest in recycling and 
reusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's impossible to know if that rusty garden watering can will one day 
be valuable, it's much better just to enjoy it now and forget the investment 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Most collectibles have two values anyway, the monetary one and that of the 
emotional enjoyment. If you buy something because you love it, you will get 
your money's worth. And old chairs, rugs, dishes and other household items are 
usually less costly to buy and tend to hold their value better than new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 And who knows, you may be as lucky as the person who bought a Shaker chair in 
1972 for $125 that was worth $500 in 1982, $1,650 in 1989 and $4,675 today.

GARDENING; BIG PRODUCTION: BLOOMS FOR ALL SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gardener's right of passage to summertime usually involves ripping out tired 
fall annuals and replacing them with summer-blooming annuals. Marigolds, 
petunias or impatiens usually fill the empty holes in the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a vast selection of perennials that will reward the grower with 
long seasonal color for many more months than annuals can produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Discriminating garden enthusiasts seek choice perennials or shrubs with 
nonstop color from either showy flowers or pleasing foliage. There are many 
plants that will reward gardeners in mild winter areas such as ours with 
colorful blooms practically year-round. The key is to find those that thrive in 
the long, sunny days of summer and fall and also flourish in our mild winter 
with its shorter days. 
</P>
<P>
 Such old standbys as lantana, hibiscus and even true geraniums (Geranium 
incanum) demand little and produce mightily. 
</P>
<P>
 Others can be used as ground covers, along borders or as garden focal points. 
Some are improved hybrids of standbys, other are new introductions such as 
Scaevola aemula 'Blue Wonder,' which "really is a wonder plant that jumps out 
at you in the landscape," said Kevin Naughton, owner of Laguna Hills Nursery in 
Laguna Beach. "It's hardy, a vigorous grower, and gives a blaze of vibrant blue 
color much of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Naughton encourages his customers to include plants in their gardens that are 
free-flowering most of the year yet demand minimal maintenance. Among his top 
recommendations are Gaura, a perennial that produces vertical spikes of 
whitish-pink flowers for at least eight months; several varieties of lavender; 
Salviagregii, with a pungent aroma, and Helichrysum 'Golden Beauty,' an 
overlooked strawflower. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Barton has been gardening for more than 20 years. He maintains an 
English cottage garden at his Santa Ana home but selects plants more suited to 
the dry conditions of Southern California. One of his favorites is Phlomis 
fruticosa (Jerusalem sage), which he prizes for the woolly gray-green foliage 
and the endless spikes of yellow flowers that emerge in ball-shaped whorls. He 
encourages continuous flowering by cutting the plant back after each bloom 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Heliotropium arborescens used to be planted widely in Southern California 
gardens at the beginning of this century. It gradually fell out of fashion and 
almost disappeared but has been making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Heliotrope is highly fragrant, grows to four feet and produces continuous 
clusters of delicate flowers in white, dark violet or bluish-purple. The white 
variety, 'Alba,' is the most fragrant and free-flowering but may be harder to 
find. Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino propagates it for sale during 
its yearly major plant sale and also its monthly sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some plants are noted for long periods of bloom and relatively easy 
care, heavily blooming plants usually need regular water and fertilizer. In 
general, avoid fertilizers with high amounts of nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much nitrogen can encourage the plant to produce new growth rather than 
flowers," cautions Wade Roberts, director of Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends a consistent fertilizing program beginning in early spring and 
continuing until the start of cool weather in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Day length is the important factor," he added. "A plant usually doesn't need 
as much fertilizer in cooler weather, when the days are shorter, but you have 
to interpret what each plant needs." Some Nonstop Bloomers 
</P>
<P>
 * Argeranthemum frutescens 'Butterfly.' Compact, brilliant yellow Marguerite 
daisy. In our mild climate, blooms year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Begonia Richmondensis. Sturdy plant produces two-foot-long arching stems 
with profuse, salmon pink flowers. Attractive deep green foliage with red 
undersides. Sun or partial shade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brachycome iberidifolia 'Swan River Daisy.' Annual native to Australia 
produces blue, white, rose and bicolor flowers in spring, summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysanthemum hosmariensis 'Moroccan Daisy.' Low mounding plant that thrives 
in heat or cold (to 20 degrees). The silver-green foliage is topped with large 
white flowers with big yellow centers, similar to daisies. Blooms October 
through July. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dipladenia 'Red Riding Hood.' Bush produces prolific dark rosy-red flowers 
year-round. Loves warmth but will bloom along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * Euryops. Shrubby evergreen perennial with yellow, daisy-like flowers. Long 
bloom season, but needs to be cut back after flowering to prevent woody, 
scraggly growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Erigeron karvinskianus. This variety of fleabane is also called Santa 
Barbara daisy. Perennial, with daisy-like flowers; has trailing growth, 
suitable for rock gardens, ground cover or hanging baskets. Naturalizes easily 
and can be invasive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Felicia. South African shrubby perennial with blue, daisy-like flowers. 
Vigorous grower, needs pruning to maintain an attractive appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gaura. Native to the Southwest, this perennial produces four-foot flower 
spikes with whitish-pink flowers. Excellent for vertical color to tuck between 
other plants. Blooms spring through fall and reseeds freely. Needs full sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helichrysum bracteatum 'Golden Beauty.' A perennial strawflower popular in 
Europe and new to the United States. Thrives in heat as well as cold and is 
free-flowering throughout the year. Compact plant for containers or landscapes. 
Flowers can be dried and used in arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heliotrope. Very fragrant perennial shrubs with cascading growth. 'Alba' has 
a vanilla-like aroma. Continuous bloom year-round. Excellent for slopes. 
Prefers sun but will bloom in part shade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lavendula Provence. This heavily fragrant lavender is the tallest of the 
many varieties of lavender, forming clumps four-feet wide and sending up 
four-foot tall spikes of sweet-smelling blue flowers. Repeat flowering 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 * L. pinnata. This lavender produces multitudes of vibrant blue flower spikes 
but no fragrance. Gray-green foliage is softer in appearance than Provence.  
</P>
<P>
 * Osteospermum 'Sparkler.' New ever-blooming bush-type African daisy. This 
improved variety blooms year-round with iridescent white flowers larger than 
the traditional freeway daisies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salvia leucantha. Mexican bush sage. Produces velvety five-foot blue spikes 
in spring, summer and fall. Drought tolerant but performs well with increased 
water. Cut back once yearly to control growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Verbena bonariensis. Tall graceful spikes topped with tiny lavender flower 
clusters. Annuals that reseed freely and bloom spring through fall.

 If Bill Ryan had to come up with a word to describe his taste in home decor, 
it would be contemporientique.  
</P>
<P>
 The ocean-view Dana Point townhouse he shares with Briget Barr is filled with 
a surprisingly well-balanced and uncluttered combination of contemporary 
leather and canvas furniture, Victorian antiques and Chinese lacquered pieces, 
including a chest nabbed for $200 and an end table for $100 at a consignment 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy on the East Coast, Ryan would comb the city dump for "buried 
treasure." Now the former IBM financing specialist says the secret to finding 
valuable, one-of-a-kind collectibles is shopping the secondhand stores in 
wealthier or artsy areas, such as Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the best deal, he advises, learn to haggle over price without being 
obnoxious. The dealers respect that. "It's a matter of pride to negotiate 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan also hits garage sales, retail liquidations and the "scratch and dent" 
departments of such chain stores as Ikea and Pier I Imports, where he bought a 
tortoise stool. (Sandpaper and a little paint can undo almost any damage, he 
says.) He picked up a pair of discontinued dining chairs, $55 each at Bif 
Korea, to flank the Chinese chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr tolerates the constant quest for deals, even finds it amusing -- up to a 
point.  
</P>
<P>
 When she finally moved West last year to join Ryan, she knew there would be 
little room in the house for her furniture. But she didn't expect Ryan to pick 
her up at the airport in a car crammed so full with garage-sale goodies -- 
scored along the drive -- that there was barely enough space for her. JOANNA

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; PAINTING TO AVOID 'HOLIDAYS'

 Q. I was recently frustrated in painting a bedroom. I was careful, but after 
the paint dried I found that I had missed a number of spots. After I put the 
furniture back in place, I found even more. Before I paint another room, I want 
to find out if there's a trick that professionals use to make sure they don't 
have to keep touching up a job. 
</P>
<P>
 N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A. Pro painters have the same problem with missed spots; they call them 
"holidays," says Angel Miranda of Homestead Paint & Wallcovering in Mission 
Viejo. It's especially a problem when you're painting a room a color that's 
similar to the old paint. Make sure you're consistent while painting. Start by 
the door from the bottom and work your way up and to the right. After you've 
finished the room, look over the walls carefully to see if any holidays are 
exposed. If your wall is in need of primer, have the primer tinted to match the 
new paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have a flagstone fireplace that has become stained from soot and smoke 
over the years. What can be used to restore it? 
</P>
<P>
 M.M. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 A. Most stores that specialize in fireplace supplies have a fireplace cleaner, 
says George Moelter of Anaheim Patio and Fireside in Brea. Starting from the 
top of the stone and using rubber gloves, you spray the cleaner on and brush it 
off. You should be able to get most of the soot off as well as the accumulated 
dirt. It's effective on the stone as well as on the grout. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We bought an old home that has wood siding. I've noticed that some of the 
nails have popped out and need to be re-hammered. How can I hammer them without 
damaging the paint and wood? 
</P>
<P>
 E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. You can use a common wood punch and set the nails back in place, says Frank 
Eckert of Arrow Hardware in Orange. If you can set it in far enough, the nail 
goes past the outer skin of the wood and the wood swells in around it. When 
this occurs with wood decks, you can soak the wood, punch the nails in and, as 
the wood dries, it more effectively keeps the nail in place. Try this in a 
small area first and see how effective it is before doing it to the entire 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have two large trees in our front and back yards and have been cutting 
roots that extend to the house and driveway whenever we've detected them. We 
are concerned, however, about deeper roots that we can't see. Is there anything 
we can do to prevent damage from them? 
</P>
<P>
 H.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A. The roots just below the surface are the ones you need to worry about, says 
Steve Sink of Angelus Quarries in Santa Ana. As long as you've been cutting 
those, you should be OK. Tree roots can do a great deal of damage to driveways 
and foundations. Roots can crack the slabs on which houses are built, so it's 
an issue to take seriously, especially with large trees close to the house. If 
the roots are too numerous, consider removing the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have a Queen palm that is approximately 30 feet tall. It's healthy, but 
it needs to be moved. Is there any service that will remove and transplant it 
for free? 
</P>
<P>
 C.B. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 A. Transplanting a large, heavy tree like that is a major operation, says 
Dennis Huddleston of Loma Vista Nursery in Fullerton. It's not likely that 
anyone would want to do that for free. Several tree removal companies are 
listed in the Yellow Pages; check with them to get an estimate.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; FIX A LEAKY FAUCET WITHOUT FEELING DRAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The toughest part of fixing a leaking faucet is getting to the job, but you 
shouldn't put it off. Only one drop a second will waste a shameful amount of 
water -- 2,300 gallons a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The tools needed for faucet work are a large adjustable wrench, flat-blade 
screwdriver, Phillips screwdriver and pliers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the faucet is a tub-shower kind, you may need a set of special socket 
wrenches that cost about $10. These reach behind the wall to remove the packing 
nuts so you can remove the valve stems. With the stem out, tub-shower washer 
service proceeds as with smaller faucets. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is to turn off the water supply. If you're fixing just one 
side, hot or cold, of a dual-handle faucet and the fixture has handy shut-off 
valves beneath it, you need to turn off only the side to be worked on. Lacking 
under-fixture shut-offs, you'll have to turn off the branch water supplies or 
the main house supply. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove the faucet handle, loosen the Phillips-head screw that holds it to 
the stem. Sometimes this screw is beneath a decorative trim cap in the center 
of the handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The cap either unscrews or can be snapped off by prying it with a putty knife. 
Handles lift or are pried off the upper end of the stem. If the old faucets are 
badly corroded, consider replacing them. It may be advisable to replace the 
entire faucet assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 Directly below the handle is the packing nut. Remove this nut to reveal the 
stem and any old packing around the stem. On the other end of the stem, you may 
find a rubber O-ring and, just beyond, the seat washer secured to the end of 
the stem with a washer screw. Then you will see the packing-nut washer and the 
faucet seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove any old packing from around the stem and examine the stem. If it shows 
areas that are badly rusted or corroded, replace it if possible. The seat 
washer is probably the source of the leak or the drip. Check it for a flattened 
appearance or a groove. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also be ragged or cracked because it has become brittle with age. 
Replace this washer even if it seems in good shape. It is secured with a screw. 
If the screw is rusty, replace it with a brass screw. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not easy to tell much about a faucet seat by looking at it. For best 
results and to avoid having to repeat this whole procedure soon, replace it 
too. Be sure to get one of the same size and shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Always take small parts to be replaced when you go to the supply or hardware 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 While at the store, buy a small pack of flexible packing if you had to remove 
old packing from around the stem. This is simply wound around the stem just 
above the threads for four or five turns.

MATERIALS; HOMELY CAST IRON GETS FANCY IN SHOW OF ITS CULTURAL QUALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cast iron traditionally has been the ugly stepsister of the more ornate 
wrought iron.  
</P>
<P>
 But a new show -- "Cast Iron From Central Europe, 1800-1850" -- creates 
Cinderella qualities worthy of display behind glass, with special lighting, 
museum labels and a squad of security guards standing watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 230 items on display through Aug. 7 at New York's Bard Graduate 
Center for Studies in Decorative Arts are a tiny pincushion shaped like a 
chair, a pocket-watch holder in the shape of a sunflower and a fan in delicate 
filigree. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also hair ornaments, necklaces, decorative boxes, letter scales, 
sewing notions, thermometers, paperweights, a sugar bowl, incense burners, 
medals, candlesticks and busts -- and a scale model of a furnace like the one 
used to create ore so the iron could be cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The show and catalogue tell the little-known story of the cultural and 
economic role that cast-iron objects played in 19th-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the 19th Century, the wave of popularity enjoyed by 
applied arts objects cast in iron originated in a single place, in Germany," 
according to Elisabeth Schmuttermeier. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmuttermeier is co-curator of the exhibit and curator of metalwork at the 
Austrian Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, where the exhibition originated in 
an abbreviated form. 
</P>
<P>
 While factories in other countries eventually caught up, Germany and 
surrounding territories were the major exporters of decorative cast iron to 
Europe and the United States in the first half of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such artfulness lavished on such a base material? Partly because a new 
technology allowed molten iron to be poured into delicate forms. Also, King 
Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia wanted to boost his country's economy, and he 
needed precious metals for the war effort against Napoleon. So he furnished his 
palace at Potsdam with cast iron, hoping his subjects would follow suit. He 
also used cast iron to barter for valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those subjects who donated their valuable gold jewelry to be melted down to 
pay for the war received cast-iron pieces of jewelry in return, inscribed with 
the words: 'I gave gold for iron,' " Schmuttermeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 While intrinsically interesting in itself, the exhibit demonstrates the role 
that style plays in determining value. It also points to a trend of scholars 
taking seriously what once was considered trivial. 
</P>
<P>
 As more consumers buy antiques and collectibles, many want to learn more about 
them, said Derek Ostergard, co-curator of the exhibition and dean of the Bard 
Graduate Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The school offers a master's degree in the history of the decorative arts, 
publishes a scholarly journal, "Studies in the Decorative Arts" and has a 
library with 15,000 volumes on the history of decorative and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Bard College in Annandale, N.Y., the graduate school is one of a 
handful of institutions offering advanced training in the history of the 
decorative arts.

ENVIRONMENT; APPLIANCES THAT WORK BETTER, CLEANER, CHEAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advancing technology has produced a whole range of improved products that save 
energy in your home. If you take advantage of them, your family can live 
better, cleaner and cheaper.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider these options: 
</P>
<P>
 Appliances 
</P>
<P>
 Because they run 24 hours a day, refrigerators use up to 20% of household 
electricity. Also, manufacturers have long relied on ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for both coolants and in the making of insulation 
for refrigerator doors and walls. But help is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Another appliance with a major environmental impact is the washing machine. 
Consider purchasing a top-loader model, which requires about a third less water 
than the average front loader. If you wash eight loads a week, it will save up 
to 500 gallons of water a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows 
</P>
<P>
 If your home had simple double-pane windows 20 years ago, you were among the 
vanguard of the environmentally conscious. But today, even untreated triple 
panes aren't the best. Look for low-emissivity windows with a special coating 
that blocks heat from escaping. Or try new super windows, which use thin 
HeatMirror films as heat barriers. They are three times more effective than 
triple-pane glass alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Toilets 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the water washing down household drains annually in this country 
passes through toilets. These thirsty fixtures average about five gallons per 
flush. Do streams and rivers a favor by switching to 1.6-gallon-per-flush 
models, which are becoming the mandated standard for new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lights 
</P>
<P>
 Fluorescents require much less electricity to operate than the typical 
incandescent bulbs. For instance, a 75-watt incandescent can be replaced by an 
18-watt compact fluorescent. Not only will fluorescents save energy, they last 
seven times longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heating 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many furnaces achieve 90% efficiency or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent advances include improved heat-recovery ventilation systems to 
keep heat in the house, better insulation techniques and refined passive solar 
designs.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR WATER METER VALVE IS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emergency, would you be able to locate and shut off your water-meter 
valve or, if you live in the country, your pump switch? If not, it's a good 
idea to familiarize yourself with the task. 
</P>
<P>
 The main shut-off can be found at the water meter. Previous homeowners may 
have covered your meter with cabinetry or a pipe chase, so look for an access 
panel. Utility rooms and basement stairwells are also good places to look. If 
all else fails, follow the cold water inlet pipe from your water heater back to 
its source. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have located your meter, notice that there is a valve on each side of 
it. Many meter valves have handles, but some will have only a bar that must be 
turned with a wrench. Both of these valves will stop water from entering your 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 If you merely wish to shut the water off, as when you leave on vacation or in 
the event of an emergency, either valve will do the job. If, however, you need 
to drain your water system, then both valves will need to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 To drain your water system, first shut the street side of the meter off, then 
the house side. Place a bucket under the meter and loosen the meter union next 
to the house-side valve. A small amount of water will trickle out of the opened 
union. Then go through your home and open all the faucets to prevent air lock. 
Return to the basement and open the house side valve and slowly drain the water 
into the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, such as during toilet repairs, there is no need to drain the 
entire system. A toilet usually has a shut-off valve between the riser and the 
supply line under the tank. Some homes have shut-off valves under sinks and 
lavatories as well. When these valves are present, use them. It is almost 
always easier to isolate a single fixture than to put the entire system out of 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 To drain your water heater, shut off its water supply. If your heater has a 
cold water inlet valve, use it and leave the cold water side of the system on. 
If no inlet valve is present, you will have to shut the water supply to the 
entire house down at the meter. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the water to the heater is shut off, open all the hot water faucets to 
prevent air lock. Then open the spigot or drain valve at the base of the heater 
and drain off as much as you need for repair. Electric heaters require that 
power be first turned off to prevent the electrical element from rapidly 
burning out. 
</P>
<P>
 To recharge the system, just as you opened all the faucets to prevent an air 
lock when draining the system, you will need to open them to bleed air from the 
lines when recharging the system with water. Open the meter valves only 
partway. Then bleed the air from the newly charged lines. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the air in the system has escaped through the faucets, turn the 
faucets off and turn the meter valves all the way open. Small bursts of air may 
still escape through your faucets when you first use them after recharging, but 
all the air should be dissipated after the first full pressure draw. If you do 
not bleed trapped air from supply lines, the shock of air released under full 
pressure could damage faucet and supply tube seals.

FURNISHINGS; FRESH LOOK IS JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY 
</P>

 Yabba dabba doo. Fred and Wilma Flintstone have come to the big screen, just 
in time to greet the real-life stone furnishings and accessories that are 
rocking the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone furniture dates back to the time of the first cavemen. It was nothing 
fancy, just a jagged slab of sandstone or a flat hunk of shale. The centuries 
rolled by, styles changed, but stone endured. And today Fred, Barney and the 
rest of the gang will be gratified to find that their stone-age furniture is 
making a splashy comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, artists, interior designers and retailers are romancing the stone, 
and the next wave of designers is primed to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York City, 
Jenna Goldberg, a graduate student at the Rhode Island School of Design, 
introduced her "bone chair," a prehistoric-looking seat with earth-tone leather 
upholstery, a carved wood "bone" back and a grassy rope skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 With a nod to whimsy, Goldberg also whipped up a a pair of matching mules, 
which Betty Rubble would surely have worn in the movie, while washing the 
dishes with water filtered through an elephant's trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of furniture, stone's appeal is largely in the fun of the material. 
You do a quick double-take upon entering a room and encountering the freshness, 
the surprise, the sheer eccentricity of a chunky cement slab table or a porous 
stone vase, not to mention the wacky joy found in Edward Zucca's caveman 
television, which features a stone where the TV screen should be and antennas 
made of curved horns.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an oddball thing, really," said Zucca, an artist who doesn't like TV 
violence. "The screen is a rock that I got from my back yard. I wanted to use a 
primitive material to encourage meditation. You look at the screen and use your 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Social commentary aside, creative folk wax eloquent on the virtues of the 
common rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I adore the material," said Thomas Hucker, a New York City-based artist who 
created a craggy, rough-edged table with a gray stone top. "Stone is honest. 
Stone is gutsy. It has mass. It has texture. There's a depth to it, a quality 
to the composite that is absolutely wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Designers like to point to stone's illustrious history as a building material 
-- used for defense, for shelter and as an early framing device (see Roman 
arch).  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout most of this century, stone furniture has mainly been associated 
with the garden. Think rustic stone settees, carved benches and playful 
ornaments, and you get the picture.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, faux stone was the rage, as in floors, walls, ceilings and 
furnishings that replicated the rich look of Cararra marble and travertine 
flushed with blood-red veins. Now the trend is toward the real thing. No fakes 
or substitutes. Just the sheer raw power of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of 'faux' is instant gratification. It was part of the '80s 
free-for-all, a fantasy. It really wasn't necessary that the stone be real," 
said Alex Locadia, a designer who has fashioned many different objects from the 
real McCoy. "Now, in the '90s, people are much more interested in using honest 
materials -- wood, metal, stone. Maybe they're doing it out of guilt, or maybe 
there's just more openness about what's real." 
</P>
<P>
 In putting the ancient material to contemporary uses, Locadia designed a watch 
with a stone face, a white stone phone and a stone radio with a curlicue metal 
antenna. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put stone into the mix, it looks somewhat unorthodox," Locadia said. 
"It's a mix of high-tech and non-tech. Stone is so basic, but when you place it 
against technology, it takes you for a spin." 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designers also are mining the stone renaissance, using stone to 
enhance and enliven decor.  
</P>
<P>
 "Stone unquestionably has a vibrant, tactile sensation, whether it's smooth 
marble or rough Belgian block," said Fred Kentop, a Long Island interior 
designer. 
</P>
<P>
 For one client he created a "geological" fireplace, using bars of feldspar 
embedded with nodes of quartz crystals ("very craggy and naturalistic"). In 
another home, he fashioned an archway with carved blocks ("rough, uneven, 
exotic and ethereal"). 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Goldberg, meanwhile, have nicknamed her creation the "Flintstone" 
chair.

INTERIORS; STYLISH HOME IS A PET PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can a home with pets be as attractive as one with no barks or purrs? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Jane Victor says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," Lovejoy Duryea says. 
</P>
<P>
 For these decorators -- and many of their clients -- a house isn't a home 
without a pet. Yet each has high standards for ambience and housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly it's a matter of knowing what not to have, says Duryea, chairwoman of 
the interior design department at the School of Visual Arts in New York and a 
breeder of Norfolk terriers. She wouldn't use shiny lacquer furniture or glass 
tables or nubby textiles that cats, especially, will claw and knead into 
unsightliness. Instead, she'd choose tightly woven fabrics and low-gloss 
surfaces of wood, stone, ceramic or synthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 No-no fabrics for families with felines include Haitian cotton, raw silk, 
brocade, hand-woven textiles and leather. Cats also get their claws into looped 
carpets such as Berber and needlepoint. So opt for smooth fabrics such as 
chintz, tight woven cottons and cotton-polyester blends and cut pile rugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor, chairman of the New York chapter of the American Society of Interior 
Designers, says a well-trained pet helps make for a well-maintained home. 
Because dogs and cats are creatures of habit, they seldom stray from places set 
aside for sleeping, eating and playing, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 At her home, Victor installed a pet entrance in an unused fireplace in the 
dining room. To teach her two dogs and a cat to use the low swinging door, she 
crawled through the opening then called for them to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figured it out instantly," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The fireplace, with its original decorative mantel, offers convenient, 
unobtrusive access to indoors and outside. The door can be locked, and the pets 
make sure no other animals, wild or otherwise, cross the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the best-trained pets aren't perfect. As insurance against dog urine 
stains on the rug, Duryea suggests keeping an enzyme cleaner such as Nature's 
Miracle on hand. Follow instructions, and it should lift out any stain. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how fastidious your cat -- or how diligent your housekeeping -- 
litter boxes are equated with odor. Where possible, Victor advocates hiding 
them, usually in a little-used bathroom. One suggestion is behind a swinging 
door in the vanity beneath the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cats are inherently graceful, but there's no reason to risk breakable 
objects. Duryea advises weighting delicate vases by putting small stones in a 
muslin bag inside them. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than a carpeted scratching post from the pet shop -- "They teach the 
cat to claw something you don't want them to claw" -- she advocates a log, such 
as white birch, with the bark still intact. The bark should help keep the cat 
happy and the claws short. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ways to discourage cats from jumping onto the furniture. For a 
favorite table, stretch a piece of Contact paper, sticky side up, over a piece 
of cardboard. Tape the board to the tabletop with drafting tape, which won't 
leave marks when it is removed. A few forays into sticky territory are likely 
to deter all but the most stubborn cat. Put inflated balloons on upholstered 
pieces you want to make off-limits. One or two loud pops should send the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Duryea household, the living and dining rooms are off-limits to the 
dogs. Now well-trained, they make no attempt to enter. In the past, they were 
barred by a piece of garden trellis. For large dogs, she recommends hanging a 
decorative iron gate. 
</P>
<P>
 For clients who want their pets to have the run of the house, Duryea suggests 
washable slipcovers with sleeves over upholstery. Victor recommends shades or 
valances rather than long draperies. 
</P>
<P>
 For future pet owners who want a presentable home, Duryea's advice is to 
consider your furnishings and available time: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have Norfolk terriers, which are small dogs that can be exercised 
minimally and need to be combed only once or twice a week. Sheep dogs, by 
contrast, can require up to an hour's worth of grooming every day."

CLEARING THE AIR ON THE BEST FILTERS TO KEEP DUST AND POLLEN AT BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your choice of furnace and air-conditioning filters used to be quite limited. 
You could opt for either the 50-cent disposable filter or the $500 electronic 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, you can get a filter in the $10 to $30 range that captures 94% 
of the dust, dander, pollen and other particles that float through a house. 
These new air filters are divided into two types: pleated and electrostatic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electrostatic filters. When air passes through the fabric of these filters, 
it creates a small electrostatic charge. This charge acts like a magnet and 
traps small particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-charging electrostatic filters need no electricity to operate. Simply 
slide them in the slot where your regular filter fits. To clean, remove the 
filter and backwash it with a hose or shower. Cleaning is recommended about 
every 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 These filters generally last three to five years. Prices range from $30 to 
$50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pleated filters. These are disposable, and they trap up to 95% of airborne 
particles. Their pleated contours and fine mesh fabric expand the total surface 
area used for filtering and help trap particles as small as 5 microns (about 
one-hundredth the size of the head of a pin). Some pleated filters also carry 
an electrostatic charge. Pleated filters cost from $6 to $20 and usually last 
up to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benefits. Cutting back on indoor air particles brings relief for many 
allergy sufferers. Better air filtration will also reduce the amount of dusting 
you do in your home. 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit of having cleaner air is that your air-conditioning and 
heating equipment will stay cleaner and operate more efficiently.

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; QUIET ENCINO HOME PLAYS ROLE IN DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Set among traditional, shingle-roofed ranch houses, the oversized, 
contemporary home on Mandalay Drive has stood out ever since it was built. But 
residents of the 16000 block of that secluded street in the Santa Monica 
Mountains say they had little hint of the role it would play in the O. J. 
Simpson drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime Friday morning, the celebrity ex-athlete slipped out of the house 
with his college roommate and fellow football player Allen G. Cowlings -- 
baffling police, his attorney and friends, and setting in motion the manhunt 
and bizarre freeway chase that ended with Simpson's arrest at his Brentwood 
home Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, charged Friday morning with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole, and 
her friend, Ronald L. Goldman, was supposed to have surrendered to Los Angeles 
police at the Encino home, but instead he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is, we were told he'd be there; we went, he was not," said Lt. 
John Dunkin, an LAPD spokesman. "How he left, when he left, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said Simpson was originally supposed to turn himself in at LAPD 
headquarters Downtown under an agreement reached with his defense attorney, 
Robert Shapiro. But Shapiro phoned Friday morning to ask that police instead 
take Simpson into custody at the Encino residence of his close friend, Robert 
G. Kardashian, who had offered his home to Simpson as a refuge from reporters, 
Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic news conference Friday, both Shapiro and Kardashian described 
how Simpson had managed to elude not only them but several physicians who had 
come to the home to examine Simpson for depression. 
</P>
<P>
 The entourage retired to an upstairs conference room to discuss Simpson's 
condition. When they returned, he had left, apparently in the vehicle of his 
longtime pal, Cowlings, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's presence at the house and the fact that he spent the night there 
came as a surprise to neighbors, who watched all day Friday as carloads of 
police officers came and went, offering no more explanation than that they were 
"conducting an investigation."  
</P>
<P>
 "When my husband came home just now he said, 'What's going on? Is O. J. 
Simpson up here?' And I said, 'Are you kidding?' " neighbor Pia Jackson, who 
lives across the street, said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of cops," said another neighbor, Ted Tepelidis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about O. J.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian -- who described himself Friday as one of Simpson's closest friends 
-- moved into the house about a month ago after its owners and builders failed 
to sell it, neighbors said. "We were amazed at how many moving trucks came," 
Jackson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said Kardashian, a composer, and his girlfriend waved to Jackson's 
husband as he left for work Friday morning, giving no indication that the 
celebrity murder suspect was staying with them.

GRADS SAY GOODBY IN STRANGE WAYS; PRANKS: HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ACROSS THE COUNTY 
PULL PUBLIC AND SOMETIMES ILLEGAL FAREWELL STUNTS THAT RANGE FROM THE QUIRKY TO 
OUTRAGEOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With pocket combs, bedsheets and a bullet-riddled car, Ventura County's high 
school seniors pulled farewell pranks this week that ranged from quirky to 
outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As schools from Ojai to Simi Valley prepared for graduation, certain students 
-- school officials won't say who -- flaunted the spirit of the Class of '94 in 
public and sometimes illegal ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Memorial High School students stripped a '63 Chevrolet wreck, 
splattered it with school colors and hoisted it onto the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo High students sandbagged the teachers' lounge door. Oxnard High 
seniors festooned trees with toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nordhoff High seniors promised new Principal Mike Maez that they would 
absolutely not pull any pranks, because they liked him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Maez said, they actually kept the promise. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura High School, senior class officers Mike Schodorf and Phyra Prum 
bought $30 worth of combs and handed them out to their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 At graduation on Thursday, every single senior trooped across the stage, 
graciously accepted a diploma, and then handed baffled Principal Jerry Barshay 
a comb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids don't pull pranks, they pull a surprise," said Barshay, who last 
year received a handful of change from every senior to help pay for a time 
capsule project that ran short of funding. "It's a loving tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Barshay said he gave away most of the 345 combs that had piled up in a box as 
the ceremony progressed. He still has enough to last him a lifetime, but he 
admits he did not quite understand why he was given combs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know why we did it?" Schodorf said in amazement Friday. "We gave it 
to him because his hair is always perfect. At graduation the wind was blowing 
like crazy and his hair didn't move." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in September, Newbury Park High School seniors plastered the numbers '94 
and the paw print symbol of their school's panther mascot onto more than 70 
discarded bedsheets they strung up on a mountainside facing the school, 
Principal Chuck Eklund said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Eklund's blessing, the massive banner reappeared Thursday night to greet 
students, parents and teachers arriving at the school Friday for graduation 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a real nice expression of the class' spirit," Eklund said. The 
banner took students about three weeks to sew together from bedsheets donated 
by local motels. "It took a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of work also went into the car that appeared briefly atop a locker 
building at Moorpark Memorial High School on Wednesday morning, according to 
school officials and the students who put it there. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduating senior Jared Kira said he and about 15 friends had been dreaming of 
a way to top the prank they pulled in 1993 -- putting all the lunchroom tables 
on the school's roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thinking of making a farm inside the quad with all different kinds of 
animals -- pigs, cows and sheep," said Kira, 18. "We thought it would be pretty 
funny, but then we thought it would be tough to get ahold of the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they dragged a wrecked 1963 Chevrolet Impala wreck out of a drainage 
ditch and towed it to a friend's auto shop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welded out the whole frame and axle, we dropped the whole bottom out of it 
and we painted it with 'Class of '94,' " Kira said. "It probably weighed like 
1,500 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors then trucked it to the school at about 1 a.m. that morning and 
muscled it up onto the roof, Kira said. Once there, they set it atop trash 
barrels they had borrowed from around the school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Cary Dritz said school officials walked in Wednesday to find the 
Chevy perched atop the locker building, the message in school colors of green, 
gold and white reflecting the morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty neat stunt, and the students didn't hurt anybody," he said. 
"I'd like to say they used their knowledge of physics to put it up there, but 
I'm pretty sure they used brute force. We had to use a forklift to bring it 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many senior classes around Ventura County graduated quietly and without 
incident, as in Thousand Oaks, where school officials sent letters to parents 
and held student assemblies urging good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters and speeches told "how important it was to keep our act together 
and what our expectations were in terms of their behavior," said Keith Wilson, 
principal of Thousand Oaks High School. "We haven't had much of a prank problem 
because our district's taken a very strong stand on pranks." 
</P>
<P>
 And all the pranks around Ventura County were ultimately harmless, officials 
said -- though some seniors at Oxnard High had to paint over graffiti left on 
school walls by their classmates, Assistant Principal Peter Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If students damage property, that's one issue, but a prank -- that's what it 
is, just a prank," Ortega said. Like most officials, Ortega good-naturedly 
shrugged off this year's stunts as inoffensive fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year they had tires on the flagpole, down around its base," he added. 
"And for the life of me I don't know how they got those little boogers on 
there."

MAN RECEIVES 2 DEATH SENTENCES IN TEEN SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Robinson Jr., a bespectacled former college student, received two death 
sentences Friday for the execution-style murders of two teen-agers during a 
robbery at a Northridge sandwich shop where he once worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 25, sat silently as San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen 
told him: "You have done something atrocious. You have forfeited your right to 
live and I do sentence you to die." 
</P>
<P>
 The slightly built, owlish-looking defendant -- who was a part-time student at 
Cal State Northridge -- listened impassively as his mother, Jackie Robinson, 
rehashed the trial testimony during a lengthy statement to the judge and the 
victims' families. She implored them: "I just want you to think before you take 
my son's life." 
</P>
<P>
 He displayed no reaction to the heated words spoken by the mother of one of 
his victims, a youth who was visiting a friend at the Subway sandwich shop on 
Zelzah Avenue the night of June 30, 1991, when Robinson burst in at closing 
time, ordered them to the floor, then shot both teen-agers in the head after 
they complied with his orders to open a floor safe and cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 "James, you murdered my son Brian," said Terry Berry, mother of 18-year-old 
Brian Berry. "You have destroyed my life. . . . I pray that God will never 
forgive you for what you've done, and I look forward to seeing you at your 
execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Coen imposed the death penalty twice, once for the murder of Berry and once 
for that of James White, 19. The youths, close friends since the fourth grade, 
were buried together. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the sentence, defense attorney Richard Leonard urged the judge to 
reject the jury's conclusion that a death sentence was warranted, arguing that 
race played a role in the decision. Robinson is black, and the two victims were 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth L. Barshop stated that Robinson's "callous, cruel, 
vicious actions" -- not his race -- determined his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor pointed out that testimony showed that White "more than likely 
was on his knees, begging for his life" when he was killed and that Berry, who 
was shot in the face, probably "saw it coming." Robinson also shot Berry a 
second time, in the side of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a planned execution," Barshop said. "He went there to rob and kill 
everyone and anyone who was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a former Subway employee who was fired because his supervisors 
suspected him of stealing $200, got about $580 in the holdup. About 12 hours 
after the robbery and double slaying, he used the money to rent a bachelor 
apartment nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Barshop said, Robinson "chuckled and laughed and giggled about 
executing these two boys" and told a friend next time he'd "have to get a gun

 Robinson was convicted on two counts of murder and robbery, but the first jury 
could not reach a decision on whether to impose the death penalty. A second 
jury delivered a death verdict last month, after deliberating less than three 
hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the slayings, Robinson had no record of violent crime.

DEATH SPURS QUESTIONS ON PCH SAFETY EFFORT; ACCIDENTS: THE LATEST FATALITY ON 
THE HIGHWAY COMES AMID A CAMPAIGN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND CALTRANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a road that's harsh on driver mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Coast Highway has few guardrails to prevent cars from tumbling off its 
high cliffs into the ocean. No street lights illuminate the sharp curves. The 
seaside scenery can be a deadly distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's nine-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway claimed another 
motorist's life last weekend, raising questions about the effectiveness of a 
yearlong campaign to reduce accidents along the route between Oxnard and the 
Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program started, fatalities on PCH have actually increased. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Staci Morse, who has helped implement the 
safety campaign, said she is not discouraged by the increased deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that tells me is that the program is needed," Morse said. "With what 
we've been given, we feel we've done really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the CHP, the California Department of Transportation and local law 
enforcement agencies launched a driver safety campaign known as COAST -- short 
for Concentrate on a Safe Trip. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, officials cited statistics showing that from 1989 to 1991, the 
coastal highway was the scene of 13 fatal accidents and 284 injuries. In 1992, 
six fatal accidents and 98 injuries occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, when the safety program began, only two were killed and 78 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 1994 less than half gone, the highway has already had four 
fatalities. Injury statistics were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP and Caltrans officials defend their progress, saying they believe 
motorists have a heightened awareness of the road's dangers. As evidence, Morse 
cited "a lot of positive feedback" from people who tell her they have noticed 
new cautionary billboards on the road and have heard the campaign's public 
service announcements on radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse and Caltrans engineer Bob Houle said the program can do only so much, 
and they expect a certain number of accidents regardless of any safety 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When officials announced the $282,000 program, they said they intended to add 
more CHP officers to patrol that area, post warning signs and install 
reflectors on the ocean side of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far progress has been slow. Morse said that because the campaign 
involved several agencies, officials needed months of planning to coordinate 
the project properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any good program needs to be properly planned," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the highway have been repainted so motorists can see better, and some 
passing lanes were moved to less dangerous stretches of the highway. Six new 
warning signs were built along the route. Several public service announcements 
were issued to radio and print media. 
</P>
<P>
 But plans to beef up CHP patrols didn't get started until a few weeks ago, 
Morse said, because CHP officials decided that the summer months are the most 
popular time for motorists to use the coastal highway. Patrols were not stepped 
up last summer, she said, because officials were still gathering accident 
statistics and figuring out the best time to add more officers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Memorial Day weekend, CHP weekend patrols were boosted from two to eight 
officers at a time. When the program ends in September, the CHP will lose the 
overtime funding needed for those six extra officers, Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials are still awaiting funds for the roadside reflectors, Houle 
said, and it will be July, 1995, before all the roadside reflectors are 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey aimed at reducing the 55 m.p.h. speed limit has been requested but 
has not been conducted yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Caltrans officials estimated that about 16,000 cars use the nine-mile 
ocean route annually. The most common cause of accidents was excessive speed 
and drunk driving, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People drive faster than they ought to," Houle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety program also includes Oxnard Boulevard, which connects the coastal 
highway to the Ventura Freeway. Police say Oxnard Boulevard has had more 
accidents than any other thoroughfare in the city and blame the problem partly 
on its high concentration of bars, liquor stores and late-night restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police have been working with the CHP to curb the number of accidents 
along the thoroughfare by establishing sobriety checkpoints and adding more 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 But along the coastal highway, officials particularly warn against speeding 
motorists who take turns too quickly on the winding route. 
</P>
<P>
 "One needs to be very careful on it," said Alice Huffaker, transportation 
planner for the California Highway Patrol. "People are trying to drive it like 
a four-lane highway, rather than a two-lane highway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the latest victim to die on PCH was traveling about 60 
m.p.h. at the time of her accident. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, 80-year-old Patricia Van De Water was on her way from Long Beach to 
attend her granddaughter's graduation party in Santa Barbara when she lost 
control of her car for an unknown reason. Shortly before noon, Van De Water's 
car plunged off the cliffs south of Deer Creek Road and landed upside down in 
the ocean, causing her to drown. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives said the elderly Long Beach woman was an alert driver who was 
familiar with the route, but had not driven it for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had been on the route numerous times, but not as a driver," said Alice 
Van De Water, her daughter-in-law. "I can't remember the last time she drove 
that route, but she was not the type to fall asleep at the wheel or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Morse said PCH, with its scenic views, winding route and numerous pedestrians 
can distract motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only takes a quick second to check out the surf and have a pedestrian get 
in front of you," Morse said.

GROUP TRYING TO KEEP MEDFLY OUT OF COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has wreaked havoc throughout Southern California, the tiny, pestiferous 
insect known as the Medfly, forcing night-time helicopters to spray Malathion 
over schoolyards, neighborhoods and farmers' fields. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite coming as close as Granada Hills, no fertile Medflies have ever 
been located in Ventura County -- and a local group wants to ensure it remains 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Fruitfly Action Cooperation Task Force (FACT) and a 
consortium of state and local agricultural groups are kicking off a statewide 
anti-Medfly educational campaign, beginning with Ventura County, which they say 
is extremely susceptible to the Medfly epidemic because of its proximity to the 
infested Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems likely that if L.A. keeps having this problem, we're going to have 
it here," said Elisabeth Brokaw, project manager for FACT, a volunteer group 
formed by the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a 16-minute video titled "Spoiled Rotten: The Medfly Threat to 
California," Brokaw and other FACT members began spreading the message Friday 
to city council members, county government officials and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The video, produced by the Alliance for Food and Fiber, a statewide coalition 
composed mainly of agricultural groups, will also be distributed to every 
television station in California. 
</P>
<P>
 All avocados, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers and citrus fruits grown in 
Ventura County are susceptible to Medfly infestation, officials said. Those 
fruits and vegetable crops accounted for 51% of the county's $848-million total 
harvest last year, Brokaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the Medfly, agricultural officials released sterile Medflies into 
Los Angeles County to disrupt the bugs' reproductive cycle. Last March, they 
let loose about 430 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, about 700 sterile Medflies have been found in the hundreds of 
Medfly traps positioned throughout Ventura County by the Agricultural 
Department -- a testament to the insects' well-known "hitchhiking" ability, 
Brokaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between January and April of this year alone, 294 sterile Medflies have been 
found in the traps, mostly in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. Entomologists 
believe that for every Medfly trapped, there exists 500. 
</P>
<P>
 If a single fertile Medfly or larvae were found near a food production area, 
it would require widespread aerial spraying of Malathion pesticide, which 
remains controversial despite studies by the National Cancer Institute and the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture proclaiming its safety. All sides 
in the debate agree that it is a great nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, in addition to killing Medflies, Malathion spraying kills many 
"beneficial" insects, which are commonly used by farmers in Ventura County as 
an alternative to pesticides. The result would be more chemicals in Ventura 
County fruits and vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the Medfly is firmly established, like it is in Hawaii, the bug is almost 
impossible to eradicate, experts said. For that reason, officials said it is 
paramount to halt the threat in its early stages. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture urged county residents to take these steps 
to reduce the chance of a local Medfly epidemic:  
</P>
<P>
 * Travelers should not bring fruits into the county from other states or 
countries, or fruits grown in quarantined areas such as those in Los Angeles. 
They could be carrying Medfly eggs or larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anyone who discovers larvae inside of a home-grown fruit or vegetable should 
immediately call the county agricultural commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents should allow agricultural workers to access their property and 
check Medfly traps for signs of infestation.

MAY JOBLESS RATE DIPS TO 6.4%, LOWEST SINCE '91; ECONOMY: A YEAR AGO, COUNTY 
UNEMPLOYMENT WAS 7.8%. BUT STATE OFFICIALS CAUTION THAT METHODS OF CALCULATING 
THE FIGURES HAVE CHANGED. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County's unemployment levels in May dipped to 6.4%, the lowest rate 
recorded for the county since 1991, the state Employment Development Department 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, the county's jobless rate was 7.8%, but state officials 
cautioned against comparing the two numbers because methods of calculating the 
figures have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Bruce Devine of the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
nonetheless called the drop a hopeful sign of an improving economy. "This is a 
very good number," Devine said. "This is the first time in a long time that I 
think we've seen some year-over-year gains that sound solid in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, about 3,300 county residents found work in May, according to state 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a gain in employment, no two ways about it," said Devine. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 jobs were added in both construction and retail sectors. Economists 
had looked to the January earthquake to bolster the faltering construction 
trade, which until now had not received much of a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we are seeing some earthquake effect now," said Mark Schniepp, director 
of the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecasting Project. "Construction is up." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the number of building permit applications has increased 41% 
since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Schniepp and Devine said the drop in unemployment appeared to 
indicate an upward turn in the county's economy, both cautioned that the trend 
would have to continue for a few months before being taken too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor force dropped by 400 people from April to May, a figure that 
Schniepp considered significant. "The labor force is not increasing," Schniepp 
said. "Normally if the economy is doing better more people get out and start 
looking for jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the gains in retail jobs may be attributed to the opening of the 
Oxnard Outlet Mall. Many employers began hiring in May, and Oxnard Unemployment 
Office counselor Chris Cruse pointed out that with the exception of store 
managers, most of the positions were filled by county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cruse said the jobs available are likely to pay little more than 
minimum wage, a discouraging sign for residents who have been out of work for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the jobs we've been seeing have been in retail and other low-paying 
jobs," Cruse said. But he said one Camarillo videocassette manufacturer, 
Technicolor Video Services, was expanding its business, and added employees in 
May at wages ranging from $7 to $12 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing jobs were up by about 600 positions, half of which were in 
non-durable goods such as food-packing and processing. "That's packing the 
strawberries," Schniepp said. "That's Smuckers out in the field making that 
stuff into jam." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally agricultural jobs account for a jump in employment figures each 
spring. But during May, 400 agricultural jobs were lost, and Cruse said some of 
those unemployed workers are starting to trickle into his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "In May they were still picking a lot of strawberries, but now they are 
starting to get laid off," Cruse said.

CITY STEPS UP EVICTION TRY IN QUAKE-HIT GHOST TOWNS; RECOVERY: OFFICIALS 
ATTEMPT TO SPEED UP ELIMINATION OF SCAVENGERS AND SQUATTERS FROM 
EARTHQUAKE-DAMAGED VACANT APARTMENT BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles city attorneys are looking for a way to speed up legal proceedings 
to clear squatters and scavengers out of vacant, quake-damaged apartment 
buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood and seal the structures, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual tactic to eliminate the "ghost towns" of vacant buildings that 
have become a haven for vandals, drug users and prostitutes was discussed at a 
City Hall meeting Friday of a special task force assigned to battle the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, building and safety, housing and other city officials who took part in 
the meeting plan to submit a report Tuesday outlining a recommended strategy to 
an ad hoc earthquake recovery committee of the Los Angeles City Council, 
participants in the meeting said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, attorneys for the city were asked by other city officials 
to investigate whether they can shorten the normal 45-day process that building 
and safety officials need to clear and board up vacant buildings that have 
become a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said it is unclear whether the city can bill the property owner 
for the cost if the notification process for building owners is shortened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not sure if we will be able to put liens on the properties," said Pat 
Bonino, a chief analyst for the city administrative officer's department. 
"There are some fine legal points about what the Building and Safety Department 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
 If the property owners cannot be forced to reimburse the city for the cost of 
vacant buildings, Bonino said the city may consider paying the bills by using 
part of $20 million in discretionary quake relief funds from the federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said officials will continue to press the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to help pay for the effort, even though FEMA officials have already 
indicated that the problem does not qualify for disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing everything we can to do it faster and we are trying to get as 
many financial resources as we can," Bonino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern among city officials is that police may not have enough 
officers to sweep all the problem buildings before they are sealed, suggesting 
that the city may have to hire security guards to assist in the sweeps, said 
Gary Squier, general manager of the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city officials are considering using the HUD funding to pay for the 
security guards needed for such sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was held because city officials Wednesday instructed 
administrators to come up with a plan to deal with the growing problem of 
scavengers, squatters, vandals, drug users and others taking up residence in 
vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials have identified 10 clusters of vacant quake-damaged 
buildings, which they dubbed "ghost towns," in the hardest hit areas of the 
Valley and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and owners of businesses around the vacant buildings say they fear 
the blight and crime of "ghost towns" will spread. City officials say squatters 
may be responsible for at least two fires in vacant buildings in Hollywood.

PURSUING THE WORK; JUDAISM: VALLEY MEMBERS OF ULTRA-ORTHODOX CHABAD MOVEMENT 
PRESS ON WITH EFFORTS TO FULFILL THE MANDATE OF LATE GRAND RABBI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By outward appearances, it was just another day at the Chabad of the Valley 
last week. Only four days after the death of the rebbe or grand rabbi -- 
thought by many of his followers to be the Jewish Messiah who would usher in an 
era of peace in the world -- the Valley headquarters of the international 
Hassidic movement seemed to be functioning as if nothing unusual had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 No consternation, tears, nor trappings of mourning. No frenetic politicking 
nor gossip over who might fill the shoes of Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, the 
messianic leader who departed childless and without choosing a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Just rabbis and office staff pressing on with their daily work in the small 
complex in a converted house hidden behind a tall hedge on Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what the late spiritual leader would have wanted, said Rabbi 
Joshua B. Gordon, leader of the San Fernando Valley's contingent of the 
200-year-old Lubavitcher movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would rather just sit back and cry, but we were taught by the rebbe that 
along with tears, along with the mourning, comes a recommitment to the teaching 
of the one that passed away," Gordon said, measuring his words to negotiate the 
doctrinal crisis raised by Schneerson's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said he completed his own formal mourning when he attended the funeral 
last Sunday in New York, tearing his jacket at the ceremony in the disciple's 
customary gesture called kriyah . 
</P>
<P>
 Further memorial prayers are being said for the rebbe at each service, held 
three times a day in Encino, and a candle has been lit. 
</P>
<P>
 "With God's help, we plan to keep going for a full year," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Jewish tradition, a large public memorial, or Shloshim, will be held 
a month after the rebbe's death. The event, scheduled for Sunday, July 10, at 
Eretz Cultural Center in Reseda, will bring together members of the movement 
from across the Valley, Gordon said. Tonight Gordon and the eight other Chabad 
rabbis will gather at his house for a small private memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other than those modest displays, the grief will be borne privately as work 
continues to fulfill the rebbe's mandate, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goal, he said, is to bring about true peace on earth with the 
coming of the Messiah. The movement being pragmatic as well as mystical, 
however, Gordon said his immediate task is the completion of Chabad of the 
Valley's $3-million headquarters on Burbank Boulevard in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years in construction, it has been stalled by lack of funds. But Gordon 
said a bank recently extended $1 million credit for its completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That building, God willing, will be finished in eight months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, a New Jersey native, received his mandate 22 years ago when Schneerson 
asked him to bring the ultra-Orthodox Chabad movement to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from scratch, Gordon built an establishment of eight centers with 
nine full-time rabbis. Each center holds services at least once, and as often 
as three times, a day, and offers services such as Hebrew school, religious 
studies and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread out from North Hollywood to Ventura, the centers have approximately 
2,000 children enrolled in preschools, day camps, Hebrew schools and teen-age 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said those numbers offer the best measure of the movement's Valley 
membership because Chabad, an acronym coined by Lubavitchers from the Hebrew 
words for wisdom, knowledge and understanding, keeps no membership roster and 
collects no dues. 
</P>
<P>
 It relies on fund-raising events such as an annual dinner and fees for 
services such as Hebrew school, to finance its $1.4 million operational budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is linked spiritually to the worldwide Lubavitcher headquarters in 
Brooklyn, where the rebbe lived reclusively, Chabad of the Valley is a separate 
entity which has taken on the low-key style of its 45-year-old hand-picked 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 A small, intense man, Gordon not only retains his composure, but also a wry 
sense of humor, in this time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, you see, we have real children," he said, cracking a smile after posing 
for a photograph in the bustling playground at Chabad's Tarzana Hebrew school. 
"Now we can send them back to the rental agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his counterpart on the Westside -- the flamboyant and 
controversy-seeking Rabbi Shlomo Cunin -- Gordon has avoided publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 He downplays the doctrinal clashes that have fueled controversy over the 
Chabad movement within Judaism, and chides the media's taste for the "exotic 
and controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said he sees no crisis of succession. He believes the elders of the 
movement will nominate no one because the rebbe was too great a person to be 
replaced. His teachings, contained in thousands of books, tapes and videos, 
will continue to guide the movement's 2,000 autonomous centers around the 
world, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneerson was the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe . Born in Russia and educated in 
Berlin and Paris, he steered his disciples out of the usual seclusion of 
Hassidic practice, using modern media techniques in a campaign to draw Jews 
around the world to Orthodox Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 While creating the world's largest and most powerful Hassidic movement, he 
antagonized the less stringent conservative and reform Jewish mainstream, in 
particular with his political maneuvers to allow only Orthodox Jews to 
immigrate to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 His aggressive, hard-line emissaries often ruffled feathers, and his 
followers, numbering hundreds of thousands, stirred controversy by promoting 
the rebbe as the Jewish Messiah. Schneerson neither endorsed nor denied that 
claim, but critics said he had encouraged it by saying that the coming of the 
Messiah was near. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sad commentary . . . that one has to wait for a man to deny it," 
said Rabbi Harold Schulweis, senior rabbi of the conservative Valley Beth 
Shalom synagogue of Encino, who sees disillusionment ahead for many of 
Schneerson's followers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when a movement (depends) on a miracle man who is considered to be in 
a real sense infallible, it spawns self-destruction," Schulweis said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orthodox Rabbi Marvin Sugarman of Shaarey Zedek Congregation in North 
Hollywood had a more favorable analysis. Foreseeing "a very difficult period to 
have to go through," he said, nonetheless, the movement is "too resilient and 
energetic to have any major repercussions. I can't conceive of Judaism without 
the input of Chabad." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon dismissed the predictions of mass defections now that followers have 
witnessed their rebbe's mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe this will be a big disillusionment," he said. "I believe 
there will be a tremendous feeling of pain and sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the rebbe's death ends his personal hope that Schneerson was the 
Messiah, but doesn't dampen his belief in the rebbe's messianic vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe everything the rebbe said is valid and true," Gordon said. "Surely 
the prediction of the arrival of a true peace in a messianic era will still 
come about. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now that the rebbe has passed on, God will find a way to bring it about." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he paused, always measuring his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prediction is a bad word. It's more like promise or revelation."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MAN FOUND GUILTY OF MOLESTING GIRL

<P>
 A Ventura County jury has convicted a 22-year-old Moorpark man of four counts 
of child molestation on charges that he sexually attacked a 12-year-old girl on 
her way home from Chaparral Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Magdaleno, who said the girl willingly had sex with him, faces up to 34 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Allan Steele acquitted 
Magdaleno of a fifth count of child molestation in its decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who testified during the trial, accused the defendant of taking her 
to an unoccupied home and attacking her on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdaleno was arrested several hours after the incident when the girl 
identified him in a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca L. Day told the jury that the 
girl was a virgin prior to the assault and that she told Magdaleno she did not 
want to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Joe Lax said the girl consented to the sex, but accused 
Magdaleno of using force against her because she was late arriving home that 
day. DWAYNE BRAY

 Campaigning under the banner of more multiculturalism in the school district, 
IRS auditor Ted Green said Friday that he will run for a seat on the Moorpark 
Board of Education this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, 47, will face current board members Pam Castro and Gary Cabriales, who 
both plan to run for reelection when their terms expire in November.David 
Pollock, a corporate planner from Moorpark, last week announced his intention 
to run for a seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, education committee chairman for the Ventura Chapter of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, has been highly critical of the 
Moorpark Unified School District board over the last several years. His 
differences with the board have included frequent requests for the district to 
remove the controversial novel "The Cay" from its high school reading list. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Green said, he would push the district to hire black teachers and 
rid the school library of "racist" literature.  
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be a rubber-stamp of the school administration or the teachers 
union," he said. "I will push for affirmative action and multiculturalism and 
also push for academic excellence instead of sports achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Green and his wife have lived in Moorpark for 10 years. He has three grown 
sons. SCOTT HADLY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; PARK JUDO CLUB TAKES A STANCE AGAINST GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bud Tinaza teaches judo as a way to combat gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tinaza, an instructor at the Stonehurst Judo Club, does not advocate the 
use of the martial art against knife- or gun-wielding gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants teen-agers to learn to do judo in place of gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids here would be on the streets, running with gangs," said 
Tinaza, 26, a black belt and an instructor with the club that meets three times 
a week in a room at Stonehurst Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place where they can be themselves. Everyone here is a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 At every meeting, the students go through a series of exercises including 
stretches, throwing opponents over their shoulders, rolls and floor work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell the kids 'You take judo so you don't have to use it,' " instructor 
Phil Tabbi said. 
</P>
<P>
 One teen-age boy came into the room very late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty pushups," commanded Tinaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I had homework," said the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an acceptable excuse. Not acceptable is associating with gangs or 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 One teen-ager in the club kept secret his membership in a gang. But other judo 
students found out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can stay with us," a student told him, Tabbi said. "But the gangs 
pressured him to go with them." 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 100 registered members of the club, who come to Sun Valley 
from as far away as Whittier. Some are as young as 5. 
</P>
<P>
 No tuition fees are charged to students, and the club helps those who cannot 
afford to pay a $30-a-year fee for insurance and a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the club form close friendships. But that doesn't mean they cut 
each other a break in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're friends when you're off the mat," said Yvonne Carrera, 15, a brown 
belt. "And when you're on the mat you just go for it." ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; PROGRAM FOR EX-PROSTITUTES IS PERSEVERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outside the Reseda house, a repair crew has just finished removing the rest of 
the brick chimney downed by the Northridge temblor. Inside the quake-damaged 
home, the work of the Rev. Ann Hayman and Binah Waite, co-directors of the Mary 
Magdalene Project's residential program, never seems to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing compassion, time and attention with healthy doses of surrogate 
parenting, they're helping women repair lives scarred by years of prostitution. 
In some ways, the two repair efforts share a certain parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 Women trying to leave "the life" find the road back from the streets filled 
with unexpected twists, turns and major stumbling blocks. The world's oldest 
profession is not a victimless crime, contends Waite, who's been working with 
the project for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The victimization of any prostitute usually begins with childhood physical, 
sexual and emotional abuse, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Sales, 38, says she was arrested four times for prostitution in 2 1/2 
years. "When I got arrested the last time, I knew I couldn't do it anymore," 
she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Sales arrived at the Mary Magdalene house in April and says she believes she 
finally has the support, stable home life and help she needs to handle her 
grief over her son, who died from leukemia. "Something would always happen the 
other times I tried to quit, which left me feeling I had nowhere to turn but 
back to the streets."  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Sales and the other five women now living at the facility, the 
January earthquake did not bring down the house and their recovery efforts. It 
did, however, inflict between $50,000 and $60,000 in damage, knocking down the 
chimney, breaking water pipes, smashing windows and cracking plaster. It also 
created major problems for the Mary Magdalene Project's expansion plans. When 
it hit, the project was ready to move forward with its plans to purchase an 
apartment building to house more women.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the two buildings we were looking at ended up being 
red-tagged," or uninhabitable, said Hayman. Now, she says, the project at some 
point will probably use the $300,000 in its acquisition fund to buy a vacant 
lot near its location to construct its own building. JIM CROGAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EX-COUNTY OFFICIAL GETS SUSPENDED TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-ranking Ventura County administrator who resigned after being arrested 
in January for exposing himself at a local department store was sentenced 
Friday to a one-year suspended jail term, probation and community service. 
</P>
<P>
 In handing out the sentence, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Lawrence 
Storch said William E. Murchie, 66, apparently suffered from a psychological 
problem but that he probably would not offend again. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch said Murchie, a land-lease manager with the county, appears to have 
been traumatized by publicity from his arrest and embarrassment by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days of him exposing himself, as far as this court is concerned, have 
come to an end," Storch said, adding that he would consider ordering Murchie to 
serve the jail term in December if the defendant does not perform the community 
service as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchie's attorney, Mark Pachowicz, asked that his client be allowed to work 
in his old job with the county for the community service. Storch, however, said 
Murchie would probably do the same type of work as every other defendant 
assigned to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may be folding sheets" at the county hospital, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchie pleaded guilty in April to two counts of indecent exposure, but those 
were not his first offenses for such conduct. In 1967, Murchie was convicted of 
disturbing the peace in Los Angeles County for an indecent-exposure related 
incident. In 1984, he was convicted in Ventura County for indecent exposure.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HANDBOOK TO OFFER HIV INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ana Vargas, a client outreach coordinator of the Valley HIV/AIDS Center in Van 
Nuys, found in her conversations with private physicians in the San Fernando 
Valley that although most provided HIV testing, many didn't know what to do 
with their patients who tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told them to seek another physician," said Vargas, or to continue coming 
to them even though they had no experience in dealing with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 To help inform doctors and let them know what HIV and AIDS services are 
available in the Valley, the center and the San Fernando Valley HIV Consortium 
have put together a handbook: "Quick Look: A Guide to HIV Services in the San 
Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas said it will be published within the next three weeks. "It provides the 
names of the agencies, addresses, hours of operation and fees, if any," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quick Look" will be distributed for free to people infected with HIV and to 
the clients Vargas encounters at early intervention programs at local clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide includes information on case managers, burial assistance, food 
programs, outpatient facilities, and hot lines including suicide prevention and 
Alcoholics Anonymous, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Spanish edition of the handbook will be published, she said, if $4,000 can 
be raised to print 10,000 copies. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CITY URGED TO LOOK AT DUMP ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon requested Friday that the city 
suspend efforts to extend the life of the Lopez Canyon Landfill near Lake View 
Terrace until other waste disposal options have been studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who has been an adamant opponent of the landfill in his district, has 
already instructed Public Works officials to explore other alternatives to 
extending the dump's operating permit after it expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bureau of Sanitation report released in March suggested that by renewing the 
permit to keep the city-owned dump open until the year 2000, the city can save 
$72 million over the cost of hauling city waste to other local dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon and neighbors of the dump were angered by the report, saying that 
the city needs to investigate other alternatives. One option, Alarcon has 
suggested, could be to haul city waste by rail to a remote landfill in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pursuing an extension before all options are exhausted is a sham," Alarcon 
said. "It is deceiving and it is a clear indication that the city is attempting 
to go back on their promise to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's proposal will likely be considered by the City Council next week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the council's Public Works Committee held a meeting in Lake View 
Terrace that attracted about 150 residents to hear about closure plans for the 
landfill. Most said they did not want the landfill to remain open after 1996.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WRIGHT ENDORSED 2 IN RACE FOR CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), who is running for lieutenant 
governor, broke tradition and endorsed two rival candidates in the Republican 
primary for a congressional seat representing Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Wright endorsed Richard Sybert, a Calabasas resident and former 
senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, in the 24th Congressional District contest to 
nominate an opponent to Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich came to me before he even formally announced," Wright said this week. "I 
thought he was well qualified." And, she said, it helped that he was willing to 
commit substantial personal funds to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, two weeks before the June 7 primary, Wright received a call from Newbury 
Park businessman Sang Korman, who Wright had endorsed in the 1992 GOP contest 
in the same district. Korman, who filed to run months after Sybert, had done no 
active campaigning to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really admire him for the reason that he came to this country without a 
dime in his pocket," Wright said. "He feels he was successful because of this 
country and he wanted to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 So, even though she felt that Korman "didn't have a chance," Wright agreed to 
endorse him too. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright acknowledged that some voters might feel misled by her unconventional 
twin endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could," Wright said. "But you have to understand you have some loyalty."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RECYCLE CENTERS TO TAKE USED MOTOR OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County residents who do their own oil changes and other auto repairs 
can recycle their used motor oil by taking it to one of at least 16 locations 
around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Solid Waste Management Department has contracted with private 
auto-repair centers countywide to collect used motor oil from 
do-it-yourselfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Every gallon of oil that is thrown into a sewer, down a storm drain or on the 
ground has the potential to seep into ground water supplies and contaminate up 
to 1 million gallons of drinking water, county officials say. In addition, the 
storm drains can carry the oil into the ocean. Because of the pollution danger, 
state law forbids the dumping of used motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new oil-collection program, the state pays private auto-repair 
centers 16 cents for every gallon of used oil that they collect. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto-repair centers that have contracted with the county to collect used

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; HAZ-MAT TEAM REACTS TO CHEMICAL SPILL

<P>
 A chemical spill prompted the response of a hazardous-materials team to a 
basement at Granada Hills Community Hospital, but no evacuation was necessary, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 No patients were in the building where the spill of ethylene oxide occurred 
late Wednesday, said Los Angeles City Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells.There 
were no injuries but a maintenance worker was examined at the hospital and 
later released. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 firefighters responded to the incident, which was reported at 10:25 
p.m. The spill came from an undetermined leak, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ethylene oxide is used to sterilize medical equipment, Wells said the 
chemical can be poisonous if inhaled in large quantities and can cause burns in 
contact with the skin or eyes. But Wells said the spill "apparently was not in 
the quantity that could be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was turned over to County health officials for investigation, Wells 
said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; 3-YEAR DRIVE ENDS IN COOL RELIEF AT SCHOOL

 School will be much cooler next year at Lockhurst Drive Elementary, thanks to 
a three-year fund-raising drive by parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents raised nearly $70,000 for the purchase of air conditioners for 12 
classrooms, the last of which is being installed this week, to protect their 
children from furnace-like conditions in the late summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievably hot in the classrooms, sometimes 95 to 100 degrees," said 
Lockhurst Drive Principal Ilene Meyers. "Kids would get nosebleeds, upset 
stomachs, crayons would melt in their hands. You couldn't really have an 
instructional program." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, parents began raising money by holding weekly fund-raisers 
such as book fairs and T-shirt and bake sales, and by seeking donations from 
local businesses and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 When the last unit is installed, all 17 of the classrooms used by the school 
will have air conditioners. KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN, 18, ACCUSED OF ROBBERY AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Los Angeles resident was arrested here Thursday after he 
allegedly broke into a woman's apartment, robbed her and then fled in a stolen 
car, detectives said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Napolean Martinez was in custody at Van Nuys Jail on suspicion of 
residential armed robbery, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Winthrop Taylor.He was 
being held in lieu of $130,000 bail and scheduled for arraignment Monday, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, the 44-year-old woman had returned to her locked 
apartment near Fulton Avenue and Kittridge Street when she was confronted by a 
man with a handgun waiting inside. When her attacker hit her with the gun and 
demanded money she complied, giving him jewelry as well as cash. He then fled, 
stealing a car parked in front of the apartment building, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez drew the attention of a patrol officer near Victory Boulevard and 
Tyrone Street when he collided with a parked car. When the patrol car turned 
back to investigate, Martinez allegedly ran, leading officers on a foot chase 
that included briefly boarding a city bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was finally arrested in the 14000 block of Haynes Street after 
officers cordoned off the area and tracked him down with trained dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said police drove the robbery victim to the arrest scene and that she 
identified Martinez as her attacker. LESLIE BERGER

 Oxnard police arrested a 20-year-old Southgate man after he led officers on a 
high-speed chase in a stolen car through the streets of Oxnard and crashed, 
injuring himself and his 15-year-old passenger, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Jimenez, who suffered a broken collarbone, was being held at Ventura 
County Jail on Friday.He was arrested on suspicion of vehicle theft, drunken 
driving, evading a police officer and causing serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Jimenez was seen driving about 11:50 p.m. Thursday on Erica Place 
near H Street without his headlights on. When officers tried to pull him over, 
Jimenez took off southbound on H Street, speeding in excess of 125 m.p.h., said 
Senior Traffic Officer Don Mulville. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez led officers several miles south before he crashed into three parked 
cars on J Street south of Oleander Drive. His passenger, who is an Oxnard 
resident, was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he was listed 
in serious condition Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; LANDFILL PETITION IS CALLED INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A petition to place the Weldon Canyon landfill initiative on the November 
ballot should be denied certification by the county clerk because it is special 
legislation being used for the gain of a private corporation and because the 
petitions failed to include the complete texts of the county ordinances it 
would amend, Ojai's city attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent this week to the county clerk, City Atty.Monte L. Widders 
calls the petition "procedurally defective" and urges the clerk not to certify 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as procedural issues are concerned, that is his job," Widders said 
Friday. "If it is procedurally flawed . . . he has the administrative duty not 
to certify." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition was submitted by Taconic Resources of San Diego County last week 
with nearly twice the number of signatures as required. The clerk has 30 
business days to certify it. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure asks voters to amend the county's General Plan and certain zoning 
ordinances to allow construction of a landfill and recycling center on 551 
acres in Weldon Canyon, which lies between Ventura and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 But Widders said the petition violates the elections code by not containing 
the full text of the ordinances it proposes to amend. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can someone intelligently sign a petition without knowing what they are 
changing?" Widders asked. "I don't think anybody knows what portions of the 
plan and ordinances they want changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also states that the initiative would give a private corporation -- 
Taconic Resources -- special benefits, which is unlawful according to the 
California Constitution, the city's lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Taconic Resources said they are confident the petition is 
legally valid. TRACY WILSON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; LIFE, RELEARNING: GIRL OVERCOMES TUMORS, COMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine having to learn how to eat, walk, talk and master junior high math in 
only 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what 14-year-old Stefanie Gabler -- who woke up from a coma with no 
memory after surgery for a brain tumor -- had to do to finish the seventh and 
eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to relearn everything," said Stefanie, who lives in Van Nuys with her 
parents. Although her energy flags at times, she seems no different from any 
other teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came home, I got real frustrated that I couldn't do some 
things," she said. "I worked really hard to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday Stefanie graduated eighth grade with her 34 classmates from Valley 
School in Van Nuys. The ceremony marked the first time she had been reunited 
with her schoolmates since January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Stefanie, complaining of headaches, was found to have two brain 
tumors. She underwent two surgeries to remove the growths, after which she 
slipped into a coma for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stefanie woke up in March, she was blind and barely able to function. But 
her condition improved and she soon let her parents, Sophia and Steven Gabler, 
know that she wanted to finish school. The Gablers hired a home teacher and 
eventually Stefanie was doing school lessons in English, geography, history and 
art along with her physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another surgery in October, but soon thereafter Stefanie completed 
her seventh-grade course work. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one subject, she greatly improved. "I'm a lot better at math," she 
said, crediting her tutor, Victoria Pellikka. "That was my worst subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefanie received more than emotional support from her school. Her medical 
bills had climbed to over $1 million, $200,000 of which was uninsured. To help, 
the private school held a car wash and other fund raisers to net nearly $9,000 
for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Principal Joyce Collins, who used to be her seventh-grade history 
teacher, summed up the feelings at the school: "She is truly a miracle child." 
</P>
<P>
 For her fellow students, the miracle was that they had their friend back. 
"It's pretty much unbelievable that she could go through all that and still be 
the same person she was," said Ashlie Passon, 14, of Redondo Beach, who has 
known Stefanie since elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefanie hopes to attend school again, on her way to becoming a veterinarian. 
Meanwhile, she hopes her miracle can serve to send a message to other students 
who find school a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education is very important and you have no excuse," said Stefanie. "You have 
to keep studying no matter what happens." JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COLLEGE TO OFFER EVENING CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Community College Child Development Center will offer evening 
child care to night school students starting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the service will vary, however, according to how many children a 
student brings to the center and how many nights a week the student uses the 
center, said center Director Linda Manzano-Larsen.The base price will be a low 
$1.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 To receive the subsidized day care, students must stay enrolled in school and 
regularly attend classes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Community College District Board of Trustees voted this week to 
approve the evening child care program. The vote did not allocate money for the 
venture. The center is not subsidized by the college and instead is supported 
by grants and fees for daytime day care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening program, which will accommodate up to 12 children a night, four 
evenings a week, was created to meet the needs of a large number of students 
who attend night classes because they have full-time jobs during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Child Development Center will use evening day care as a nighttime lab for 
students studying early childhood education, Manzano-Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is also used as a lab during daytime hours, when students work for 
credit with the 57 children, ranging from infants to 11-year-olds, the program 
serves each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who come to the center are not "baby-sat," Manzano-Larsen said, 
adding the kids are involved in child development programs designed to teach 
them social and emotional skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs show children how to express themselves, including how to get out 
their anger, how to share with their peers, how to lose and how to care about 
one another, Manzano-Larsen said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 Police said Friday they will allow prosecutors to decide whether criminal 
charges should be brought against the parents of a 3-year-old Ventura boy who 
was accidentally wounded by a shotgun blast from his young stepbrother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Detective Gary McCaskill said he will put together a case and send it 
to the Ventura County district attorney's office next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1991 law, it is illegal to store firearms where they are accessible to 
children, McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cook was wounded when 6-year-old Keith Cook loaded and fired a shotgun 
he found in the family's motel room Wednesday. David was in critical but stable 
condition Friday at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured boy's stepfather, Joe Richey, said the gun belonged to a man who 
was a friend of the family. The accident occurred as the children's mother, 
Sharon Richey, was sleeping in the room where the children were playing. PEGGY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BANK FILES SUIT OVER RADISSON PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bank that holds the loan on the Radisson Suite Hotel in Oxnard sued the 
city and the developer Friday over property rights to the sprawling parking lot 
at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court, comes just four months 
after Manufacturers Bank declared Westland Co. of Ventura in default on $14 
million in loans and $4.8 million in interest payments on the 250-room hotel at 
the River Ridge Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old hotel is the site of the Los Angeles Raiders' summer training 
camp. Its construction was partly underwritten by the city to lure the football 
team and gain favorable publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the bank, the developer and the city could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Radisson was constructed in 1986 when the city saw a chance to polish its 
image and boost tourism, after the Raiders announced that they were looking for 
a new training field for their six-week summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the hotel site and built the parking lot by issuing a 
$9-million bond. The hotel's developer was to offset the city's $985,000 yearly 
bond payment, but it had no money left after payments on construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said in the lawsuit that the property-rights issue regarding the 
parking lot needs to be settled so it can determine whether to foreclose on the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials have said that the hotel would probably stay open even with a 
change of ownership. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; $250,000 EXPECTED FOR NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon has pulled together a wide range 
of Sun Valley community leaders to run a neighborhood program that will use 
federal dollars to try to turn the community around. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is the last of eight similar committees that have been formed in 
neighborhoods across Los Angeles as part of a new neighborhood initiative 
program. The idea behind the program is to direct money from a variety of 
federal agencies into a small section of a neighborhood, hoping to make enough 
of an impact to affect the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about the potential of bringing a lot of money into Sun 
Valley," said Alarcon, who admitted that he was at first skeptical of the 
program after seeing other attempts to organize communities that then did not 
get the financial backing they needed.  
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon and other city officials are now enthusiastic about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The city created the Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative at the invitation of 
the federal government as a two-year demonstration project. The city applied 
for up to $80 million from four federal agencies in March, and the City Council 
allocated $115,000 to start a Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The first federal funds -- $2.3 million in transportation aid -- are due in 
July. Of that, about $250,000 will be spent in Sun Valley for street 
improvements, tree planting, sidewalk upgrading, lighting and adding more 
visually appealing items such as kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley neighborhood committee of about 14 members will determine 
exactly what improvements will be made and how to spend the rest of the funds. 
They have been encouraged to get as much community input as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first meeting of the Sun Valley group Wednesday night, new committee 
members and the public quizzed Alarcon and representatives of the Los Angeles 
Neighborhood Initiative organization about how the project will work. One 
person asked if they will have to compete with the other seven neighborhoods 
for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 No, was the answer from Alarcon, explaining, "The only thing you have to do is 
spend the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Sun Valley is expected to receive as much as $10 million in 
federal funds, which will be spent in a small area near Sun Valley Park for 
programs such as home improvements, shuttle service and transportation, the 
retention of new business, the creation of new jobs and graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the neighborhood is small, "LANI (Los Angeles Neighborhood 
Initiative) is the hub of the wheel and we are hoping the impact will spread 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to be the best turnout, the best attended meeting," said Jessica 
Stepner, coordinator of special projects in Mayor Richard Riordan's office. ED

QUAKE VICTIM TURNS ANGST TO ART; THOUSAND OAKS: MICHELE RELKIN USES SHARDS FROM 
THE WRECKAGE OF HER HOME TO CREATE COLLAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dazed and grieving, Michele Weston Relkin stood in her wrecked Thousand Oaks 
house, gazed at the glittery carpet of glass and thought of art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning January earthquake had just knocked her once-solid home 
off-kilter, tilting the walls, cracking the foundation and blowing out every 
ground-floor window. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in her despair, Relkin found inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional artist, she had spent the past two years gluing shards of glass 
over her painted canvases to craft sparkling collages. The violent tremor 
provided a heap of new material -- and enough Angst to fuel a creative 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the months following the disaster, Relkin incorporated chips from 
her shattered cups, plates and windows into the glass-flecked collages. The 
resulting "earthquake art" will be on display -- and on the auction block -- 
during a fund-raiser fellow artists are holding for her Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started the series, I didn't know where to get all that glass," 
Relkin said. "Little did I know, two years later I'd be walking through it in 
my own house. It certainly made me think about how fragile life is." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after the earthquake, Relkin, her husband and her 10-year-old son 
are still struggling to rebuild their lives, upended during a frantic 
half-minute on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most immediate hope is a cash grant from Thousand Oaks, which could 
cover a substantial chunk of their estimated $75,000 to $100,000 home-repair 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant program, organized just last month, offers needy residents a shot at 
the $501,000 recovery fund the federal government handed Thousand Oaks after 
the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 200 homeowners have requested grants, and on Tuesday the City Council 
will consider extending the application deadline to July 18. Meanwhile, 
building inspectors will visit each applicant during the next few weeks to 
assess damages. Before doling out any money, however, Thousand Oaks officials 
must verify that recipients have exhausted every other possible source of 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take some time," warned management assistant Dan Severn, who is 
coordinating the grant applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a cursory look at the applications, Severn said he feels confident 
the city will have enough money to meet most requests. 
</P>
<P>
 But because council members have voted to limit the grants to a maximum of 
$30,000 per home, Relkin and her family are looking to other sources for help 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been paying for the Relkins' 
temporary housing, a two-bedroom apartment in Thousand Oaks. FEMA can offer 
housing vouchers for up to 18 months but cannot cover home repairs when the tab 
tops $10,000, spokesman Marty Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turned down for a Small Business Administration loan, Relkin lodged a request 
for funds with the state's Individual Family Grant Program. She's still 
awaiting word on that application -- anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until she gets some money from somewhere, Relkin cannot even hire a contractor 
to plot repair strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I'm in checkmate," she said. "The house just sits there and there's 
nothing I can do. People in Thousand Oaks think everything's back to normal, 
but for a handful of us, it's not. Thank God for my art. Without it, I'd be a 
dead fish."  
</P>
<P>
 Relkin will display her earthquake glass collages, priced at $125 to $400, 
during Thursday's fund-raiser auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists she's never even met have contributed pieces to the auction, ranging 
from cheery ceramics to abstract paintings. Friends have organized the event, 
mailing 2,000 invitations and securing donated refreshments from Anzio's 
Ristorante. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artists are by nature really generous, and when you hear about something this 
terrible, you want to help," Thousand Oaks painter Charlotte Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can contribute something beautiful that you've created," Miller said, 
"and you know it will give someone else comfort." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The silent auction to raise money for Michele Weston Relkin's home-repair fund 
is scheduled for Thursday from 5 to 7 p.m. at Gallery 9, located in the 
Hamburger Hamlet Plaza at 29020 Agoura Road in Agoura Hills. The auction will 
feature work from more than a dozen local artists. For information, call 
Gallery 9 at (818) 597-9629.

DEVELOPER SEEKS LOAN TO BUILD LOW-INCOME SIMI UNITS FOR SENIORS; HOUSING: CITY 
OFFICIALS ON MONDAY WILL CONSIDER WHETHER TO EXTEND $230,000 FOR THE 
LONG-AWAITED APARTMENT COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A long-awaited 108-unit apartment complex for low-income senior citizens could 
be under construction this summer if the Simi Valley City Council agrees to a 
developer's request for a $230,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 USA Properties Fund is also asking the city to modify plans for Las Serenas, 
formerly called Yosemite Gardens, altering the project to cater exclusively to 
low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, when the council originally approved the plan to build the 
complex on a vacant lot at Yosemite and Los Angeles avenues, developers 
intended to reserve half of the units for low-income seniors and rent the rest 
at market rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project stalled when financing deals repeatedly fell through for the 
original developer, who finally sold the site last year to USA Properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis, who serves on the city's Affordable Housing 
Subcommittee, said he is relieved to see the project on its way to 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting a long time for this," Davis said. "And the need in the 
city just keeps growing." 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the request at Monday's 6:30 p.m. meeting at City 
Hall, Las Serenas would be the second-largest low-income housing development in 
the city. The largest is Ashley Manor, a 112-unit development on Cochran 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 Simi Valley senior citizens -- nearly half the city's residents 
over the age of 62 -- are eligible for low-income housing because their annual 
income is less than $25,000, said Dulce Conde-Sierra, deputy director for 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has just 327 affordable housing units for seniors, Conde-Sierra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many seniors are on a fixed income, and they find it difficult to pay market 
rent," Conde-Sierra said. "The need is always there for more housing." 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the development agreement, USA Properties plans to 
break ground in July and complete the project within 10 months, Vice President 
Steven Gall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're as anxious as anybody to get this up and running," Gall said. "We think 
it's going to be a fabulous project." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the project call for a series of two-story stucco buildings 
surrounding a courtyard, swimming pool and recreation room. Units would be 
equipped with central heating and air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex would be located on one of the city's four bus lines and within 
walking distance of a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents on the one- and two-bedroom apartments would range from $365 to $630, 
Gall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall said his company is asking the city for a no-interest, $230,000 loan to 
help subsidize 54 units set aside for very-low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to keep all of the units in the affordable range," Gall said. "It 
ended up to the point where we needed some additional help, in terms of being 
able to offer that to the seniors in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who said the USA Properties loan request was reasonable, compared it to 
a $700,000 low-interest loan the city recently made to Griffin Industries to 
help build 70 homes for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at what this is doing for the truly needy citizens of this 
city, I think you can say this is a very good deal," Davis said. "I'm quite 
happy with it."

DONALDSON MAY FACE 3RD STRIKE WITH PRISON WEAPONS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paroled sex offender Robert Lee Donaldson, who is awaiting trial on charges he 
raped four children and teen-age girls just months after his release from 
prison, has been charged with another crime that could send him to prison for 
life under the state's recently enacted "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson, 35, who has been held on $2 million bail since his arrest last 
fall, was charged last month with possessing a weapon in prison, a felony that 
would be his third strike, Deputy Dist. Atty.Jacquelyn Lacey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson faces about 150 years in prison if convicted of the rape charges, 
but a third strike conviction would guarantee that he would be ineligible for 
parole for at least 25 years, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bobby R. Black said that Donaldson had been hospitalized 
after a recent assault in a courthouse holding cell. "It is my understanding 
that he picked up a shank in jail," Black said, using the prison slang term for 
an improvised knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey said she learned earlier this week about the weapons charge, which was 
filed by prosecutors at the downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sex case, a pretrial hearing in San Fernando Superior Court was 
postponed Friday so the weapons case could be transferred to the San Fernando 
court from downtown. Lacey will prosecute both. 
</P>
<P>
 Between August and October, Donaldson allegedly raped several Pacoima 
schoolgirls, ages 9 to 16, as they walked alone to school. He was earlier 
convicted of raping a 15-year-old boy in the same Pacoima neighborhood in 1982. 
The string of attacks generated fear among parents before Donaldson was 
arrested in Inglewood, allegedly as he stalked a fifth victim.

PROPOSAL FOR GALA BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR CITY FAILS TO WOW OFFICIALS; THOUSAND 
OAKS: PROMOTER'S OFFER WOULD COST TAXPAYERS NOTHING. BUT SOME CALL PLAN TOO 
EXTRAVAGANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jackson Madnick wants to throw Thousand Oaks a party. 
</P>
<P>
 A party with laser lights and water plumes. A party with thousands of singers 
and hundreds of dancers. A party that would wrap up the Civic Arts Plaza's 
grand-opening weekend with an enormous, dazzling bang. 
</P>
<P>
 A party that would cost the city absolutely nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks leaders aren't too sure that's the kind of party they want. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationally renowned entertainment director, Madnick has offered to host a 
gala affair to celebrate the city's 30th birthday and the cultural center's 
inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he would raise at least $220,000 from corporate sponsors to pay for 
the show. He would even bankroll overtime pay for police officers and public 
works employees. He would charge absolutely no admission fee, and would earn 
absolutely no profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the idea of 50,000 spectators stacked in bleachers along Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard, of a glittering video show projected onto the walls of the Civic 
Arts Plaza, strikes some council members and arts leaders as a bit too 
extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a fairgrounds or a harbor," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski agreed. 
"It doesn't seem appropriate for this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders are concerned that Madnick's fund-raising efforts will 
detract from the Alliance for the Art's quest to raise a $10-million cultural 
center endowment. They also worry about crowd control, and they fear the 
pyrotechnics will distract drivers on the nearby Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they fret that the spectacular special effects will overshadow the 
more down-home events planned for the grand-opening weekend, including a 
community talent showcase, an outdoor sculpture show, and a display of ceramic 
tiles painted by children. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter those objections, Madnick emphasizes that he would organize the 
show around an educational theme: the history of the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The show would incorporate video clips from the city's archives. And thousands 
of local artists would join the celebration, as Madnick plans to choreograph 
parts for the performers, who would range from preschoolers to senior citizens. 
His nonprofit educational foundation, WET LIGHT, will present the gala. Madnick 
also owns a for-profit entertainment company based in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a beautiful, touching, moving story, not just fire in the sky," 
said Madnick, who has won national awards for his outdoor extravaganzas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 residents have already spent months planning other grand-opening 
events for the weekend of Oct. 22 and 23. The planned festivities include a 
black-tie party and two concerts featuring Bernadette Peters and the Conejo 
Symphony Orchestra. Madnick's 90-minute laser show would take place Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget for the grand-opening weekend, excluding the proposed laser 
show, tops $317,000. The City Council will kick in $75,000 from taxpayer funds, 
and the rest of the money will come from ticket and souvenir sales. 
</P>
<P>
 While council members approved the concept of a water-and-light show last 
month, they had no information on the cost of such a program, and several said 
they envisioned a more low-key affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is the expense. The cost is awesome," Councilwoman Judy Lazar 
said. "It would certainly have to be scaled down a bit," she added, 
recommending that the budget be slashed to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar also voiced concern that Madnick's fund raising would siphon money from 
the endowment, which she termed a "much more critical need." The endowment, 
which stands at $4.5 million, will provide money to subsidize the cultural 
center's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely extravagant to throw money away on a one-night affair," said 
Dick Johnson, who directs the endowment fund-raising campaign. "It's bound to 
have a psychological effect on all donors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields suggested that any psychological 
effect would be positive. By generating excitement and drawing in tens of 
thousands of residents, he said, the show would boost community support for the 
Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Frields said, the show's $220,000 budget represents "just the 
proverbial drop in the proverbial bucket" compared with the Alliance for the 
Art's goal of raising a $10-million endowment. "It's just not a threat," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The promoter's arguments won over at least one council member, Mayor Alex 
Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a very ambitious program," Fiore said, "and if it can be 
pulled off without costing the city, I think it would be magnificent."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; INTERSTATE ANTIQUE CAR RACE TO STEER INTO 
AREA; LANCASTER: BUSINESS LEADERS, OFFICIALS LOBBIED FOR OVERNIGHT STOP, HOPING 
TO DRIVE UP NATIONAL ATTENTION FOR THEIR CITY. 
</P>

 Hoping to give the local economy a $120,000 boost, Lancaster will roll out the 
welcome mat Sunday as the first overnight stop on a popular cross-country 
antique car race. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, Lancaster business leaders and city officials began 
lobbying for a place on the route of the 12th Annual Interstate Batteries Great 
American Race, which runs for 14 days from Huntington Beach to Wilkes-Barre, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff is Sunday, when up to 20,000 people are expected to gather on 
Lancaster Boulevard to watch about 80 antique cars taking part in the race. 
Cars must be pre-1942 models, although a few more recent classic cars may join 
the procession but not compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Race participants have reserved 300 local hotel rooms, and city leaders have 
organized a large festival linked to their arrival. The unusual competition is 
expected to bring national attention to Lancaster, which pleases city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of cities that bid on us coming to town," said Butch Wilson, 
chief spokesman for the race. "We bring a lot of economic impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Race officials say about 700 drivers, navigators, family members, contest 
directors and reporters usually travel with the procession. 
</P>
<P>
 On overnight stops, they spend more than $120,000 at local hotels, 
restaurants, service station and other businesses, according to race 
organizers. That windfall appealed to Lancaster's hospitality industry, which 
has been hurt by Southern California's economic slowdown, particularly in 
aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to find a way to put heads on beds, as they say," said Sandra 
Dack, executive director of the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce, which along with 
the city and the Antelope Valley Convention and Visitors Bureau helped prepare 
for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the race reception has been combined with an annual event in 
downtown Lancaster. The combined festival, called "Vintage Dreams: Cars, Games 
and Aeroplanes," will take place from 2 to 8 p.m. Sunday along Lancaster 
Boulevard, which will be closed to regular traffic between 10th Street West and 
Beech Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities will include gold-panning and watermelon-eating contests, musical 
entertainment, and craft, game and refreshment booths and video presentations 
about the area's history as a flight test center. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The race will wind into town at 4 p.m. The antique cars, estimated to be worth 
more than $5 million altogether, will be parked for public viewing along the 
boulevard. The drivers, who must finish each day's route within specific time 
limits, are competing for $250,000 in cash and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as this is a parade of old-time cars, it's also a competition," said 
race spokesman Wilson. "There's serious money involved." 
</P>
<P>
 A small antique car show for local vehicle owners is also scheduled. Jeff 
Heller, a 38-year-old grocery store manager from Pearblossom, will enter his 
restored bright red 1937 Ford Club Coupe in the local judging. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heller confessed, "I'm more interested in seeing the old cars that come 
through on the Great American Race. I think they're the pioneers of the 
automobile industry, and I've never had a chance to check them out before or to 
talk to the drivers."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB TAKES IN $150,000; YOUTH: 
ORGANIZERS BELIEVE THE EARTHQUAKE MAY HAVE BOOSTED DONATIONS TO HIGHEST LEVEL 
IN FOUR YEARS. 
</P>

 Despite complications due to the January earthquake, a fund-raiser for the 
Santa Clarita Valley Boys & Girls Club raised $150,000, the highest total in 
four years, according to club officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community really came out in support of us," said Jim Ventress, executive 
director of the club."I think our volunteers dug a bit deeper this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23rd annual auction was held June 11, with top bids going for donated 
automobiles -- $22,000 for a 1994 Ford Explorer and $18,500 for a 1967 
Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow with 87,000 miles on the odometer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 items were offered at the auction, ranging from autographed 
baseball equipment to dinner coupons to vacation travel packages.  
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club serves about 1,300 youths in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
The club operates a popular youth center in the Newhall community equipped with 
pool tables, Ping Pong tables and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the organization's income is generated by the fund-raiser. 
Although the event made more than $200,000 annually during the late 1980s, 
tougher economic times cut that nearly in half in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, organizers wanted to top the club's 1993 auction take of $120,000, 
but were skeptical after the Northridge earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth center served as an American Red Cross emergency shelter for about a 
month after the temblor, and preparations for the fund-raiser were delayed for 
at least that long. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we met right after the earthquake, we decided we could do it or postpone 
it," said Bruce McFarland, the auction's publicity coordinator. "A lot of other 
people postponed their events." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventress believes the temblor may have boosted donations by reminding 
community members where their priorities are: with children. 
</P>
<P>
 The last club auction that generated more than $150,000 took place in 1990.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; JUNETEENTH CELEBRATED IN PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The liberation of slaves in the United States more than a century ago will be 
celebrated here today with the Antelope Valley's Second Annual Juneteenth 
Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The event stems from the day -- June 19, 1865 -- slaves in Texas learned that 
Abraham Lincoln had set them free by signing the Emancipation 
Proclamation.Although that proclamation had been signed more than two years 
before on Jan. 1, 1863, the news, according to folklore, traveled slowly and 
arrived by mule. 
</P>
<P>
 June 19 has been an official state holiday in Texas since 1980, but Juneteenth 
had been celebrated there for decades. Recognition of the day has been 
spreading to other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale the event will be marked with food, entertainment, carnival rides, 
community choirs concerts, a fashion show and other activities.  
</P>
<P>
 The all-day celebration is scheduled for 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at McAdam Park, 
38115 30th St. East.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN, 73, KILLED WHEN TRUCK HITS CAR 
</P>

<P>
 A man drove a truck through a red light Friday, striking a car and killing a 
73-year-old woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertha Olsen of the Friendly Valley retirement community was killed in the 
three-vehicle crash about 10:15 a.m. at Sierra Highway and Whispering Leaves 
Drive.Olsen's vehicle was hit as she tried to make a left turn, causing her car 
to spin and hit a van stopped at the traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck driver, Steven Dortman, 35, of Hesperia, said to be suffering from 
AIDS, was listed in critical condition Friday evening at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia with a ruptured spleen, said Deputy Mark Slater 
of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was hospitalized, Dortman was arrested for vehicular manslaughter, 
Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have enough from independent witnesses that show him driving in a 
pattern that shows disregard for others," Slater said. "That's at least enough 
to arrest him, and the district attorney's office can decide whether to file 
charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Mayo officials declined to elaborate on Dortman's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 John McDurfee, a Canyon Country resident, said he stopped alongside Dortman's 
truck at a stoplight on southbound Sierra Highway less than a mile from where 
the collision occurred and saw Dortman swaying back and forth unsteadily. 
</P>
<P>
 The van driver, Paul Travers, 55, of Saugus, said he had stopped at the 
traffic light on the northbound side of Sierra Highway at Whispering Leaves 
Drive when he saw Dortman's truck speed southbound and run the traffic light, 
striking Olsen's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was making a left hand turn and the guy in the truck ran a red light and 
hit her right broadside and she came around and hit me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers said he was not seriously injured.

PLAN FOR GALA FAILS TO WOW OFFICIALS; THOUSAND OAKS: PROMOTER'S OFFER FOR A 
PARTY WOULD COST TAXPAYERS NOTHING. BUT SOME CIVIC LEADERS CALL THE PROPOSAL 
TOO EXTRAVAGANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackson Madnick wants to throw Thousand Oaks a party. 
</P>
<P>
 A party with laser lights and water plumes. A party with thousands of singers 
and hundreds of dancers. A party that would wrap up the Civic Arts Plaza's 
grand-opening weekend with an enormous, dazzling bang. 
</P>
<P>
 A party that would cost the city absolutely nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks leaders aren't too sure that's the kind of party they want. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationally renowned entertainment director, Madnick has offered to host a 
gala affair to celebrate the city's 30th birthday and the cultural center's 
inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he would raise at least $220,000 from corporate sponsors to pay for 
the show. He would even bankroll overtime pay for police officers and public 
works employees. He would charge absolutely no admission fee, and would earn 
absolutely no profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the idea of 50,000 spectators stacked in bleachers along Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard, of a glittering video show projected onto the walls of the Civic 
Arts Plaza, strikes some council members and arts leaders as a bit too 
extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a fairgrounds or a harbor," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski agreed. 
"It doesn't seem appropriate for this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders are concerned that Madnick's fund-raising efforts will 
detract from the Alliance for the Art's quest to raise a $10-million cultural 
center endowment. They also worry about crowd control, and they fear the 
pyrotechnics will distract drivers on the nearby Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they fret that the spectacular special effects will overshadow the 
more down-home events planned for the grand-opening weekend, including a 
community talent showcase, an outdoor sculpture show, and a display of ceramic 
tiles painted by children. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter those objections, Madnick emphasizes that he would organize the 
show around an educational theme: the history of the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The show would incorporate video clips from the city's archives. And thousands 
of local artists would join the celebration, as Madnick plans to choreograph 
parts for the performers, who would range from preschoolers to senior citizens. 
His nonprofit educational foundation, WET LIGHT, will present the gala. Madnick 
also owns a for-profit entertainment company based in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a beautiful, touching, moving story, not just fire in the sky," 
said Madnick, who has won national awards for his outdoor extravaganzas. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 residents have already spent months planning other grand-opening 
events for the weekend of Oct. 22 and 23. The planned festivities include a 
black-tie party and two concerts featuring Bernadette Peters and the Conejo 
Symphony Orchestra. Madnick's 90-minute laser show would take place Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget for the grand-opening weekend, excluding the proposed laser 
show, tops $317,000. The City Council will kick in $75,000 from taxpayer funds, 
and the rest of the money will come from ticket and souvenir sales. 
</P>
<P>
 While council members approved the concept of a water-and-light show last 
month, they had no information on the cost of such a program, and several said 
they envisioned a more low-key affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is the expense. The cost is awesome," Councilwoman Judy Lazar 
said. "It would certainly have to be scaled down a bit," she added, 
recommending that the budget be slashed to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar also voiced concern that Madnick's fund raising would siphon money from 
the endowment, which she termed a "much more critical need." The endowment, 
which stands at $4.5 million, will provide money to subsidize the cultural 
center's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely extravagant to throw money away on a one-night affair," said 
Dick Johnson, who directs the endowment fund-raising campaign. "It's bound to 
have a psychological effect on all donors." 
</P>
<P>
 But Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields suggested that any psychological 
effect would be positive. By generating excitement and drawing in tens of 
thousands of residents, he said, the show would boost community support for the 
Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Frields said, the show's $220,000 budget represents "just the 
proverbial drop in the proverbial bucket" compared with the Alliance for the 
Art's goal of raising a $10-million endowment. "It's just not a threat," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The promoter's arguments won over at least one council member, Mayor Alex 
Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a very ambitious program," he said, "and if it can be pulled 
off without costing the city, I think it would be magnificent."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; LATE PUSH GIVES SOUTH KOREA TIE WITH 
SPAIN; GROUP C: TYING GOAL COMES IN THE FINAL MINUTE OF 2-2 DRAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 South Korea scored twice in the final six minutes to earn a 2-2 draw with a 
shorthanded Spain in their World Cup group C match on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain appeared to be coasting to victory with second half goals by Barcelona 
reserve team strikers Julio Salinas and Juan Goikoetxea. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spirited South Koreans refused to give up and pulled a goal back 
through Hong Myong-bo in the 84th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish defence began to get the jitters and Seo Jung-won scored a 
dramatic equaliser in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain had been reduced to 10 men in the 25th minute when captain Miguel Angel 
Nadal was sent off after he tripped Ko Jeong-woon on the edge of the box. 
</P>
<P>
 But goalkeeper Jose Canizares, in for suspended Andoni Zubizarreta, saved 
Spain with two superb stops in the second half, one with his legs from Hwang 
Sun-hong 10 minutes before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, who adopted a 4-4-1 formation to replace their 5-4-1 starting line-up, 
came out fired up in the second half and took the Koreans by surprise when 
substitute Jose Caminero set up Goikoetxea on the right in the 51st minute. 
</P>
<P>
 His cross found Salinas and the deadly striker needed no second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Goikoetxea appeared to have sealed victory with a headed second goal five 
minutes later, set up by Caminero who had two shots blocked before chipping the 
ball back across the face of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreans, notorious in the qualifying rounds for fading in the closing 
minutes, refused to be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 They have never won a World Cup tie but they could have ended up winners as 
Spanish defender Rafael Alkorta robbed Seo in the box with the goal at his 
mercy four minutes before he equalised. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain had dominated until Nadal was dismissed. The Koreans then began to look 
quite threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 From the resultant free kick on the edge of the box, Hong Myung-bo sent a 
fierce shot curling around the wall which goalkeeper Canizares did well to 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Canizares saved Spain again 10 minutes before halftime when he charged out to 
deny top striker Hwang Sun-hong with his legs after the Korean broke through. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea, a far more attacking side than when they played in the 1990 
finals, also went close twice in the first half with long-range shots, one 
going agonisingly wide from midfielder Lee Young-jin.

HOW WE TREAT THE EAGLES AND OTHER POP ICONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest and appreciation Mike Boehm's comparison of the Eagles to 
local rockers the Missiles of October ("Life in the Fast-Buck Lane: Enough 
Already!," June 2). I went to high school with Bob Hawkins (of the Missiles) in 
the late '60s and remember what a great guitarist he was even then. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm is to be commended for bucking the current sycophantic trend of the 
media establishment in lauding the return of such musical "legends" as the 
Eagles and Streisand to the concert stage, when all these events really 
represent is the triumph of marketing over music. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Eagles are by no means the only group to have sold out to rock 
capitalism, their precedent-setting concert fees seem especially incongruous 
with the group members' espoused concerns over such issues as the environment 
and the plight of the poor and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it have been refreshing if the Eagles (or Streisand, for that matter) 
had staged a free concert for some of the hundreds of thousands of Southern 
Californians who have lost their jobs due to corporate politics in recent 
years? Or how about if the Eagles had chosen East L.A. instead of yuppified 
Irvine as the site for their concerts? (I guess they might not have sold as 
many T-shirts that way.) 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm's article pointed out another thought-provoking phenomenon of modern 
culture -- the way we, the public, reward our pop icons with measures of fame, 
fortune and cultural recognition completely out of proportion to any skill, 
talent or artistic merit they may possess. 
</P>
<P>
 How much "better" or more worthy of acclaim are the Eagles than dozens of 
local groups like the Missiles of October? No better, by any standard of 
technical or artistic worth that one could devise. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates the Missiles of October from the Eagles is the same thing that 
separates me from the guy down the street who won the lotto -- he was in the 
right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we need heroes in sports, entertainment and the arts to inspire and 
(occasionally) enlighten us, but we also should be aware of the many talented 
and dedicated, but not-yet-famous artists in our own back yard, and support 
their efforts with our applause and, more important, our pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not for a moment delude ourselves into believing (as some of our current 
icons seem to have convinced themselves) that our superstars actually are 
deserving of the godlike status we have bestowed upon them. Let's appreciate 
but never idolize them. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's not hesitate to slap their wrists occasionally when, as seems to 
have been the case in point, they start to believe their own PR. After all, if 
there's one thing a media god does understand, it's a drop in box-office 
receipts. 
</P>

 As I predicted several weeks ago, Mike Boehm came through and did his 
anti-Eagles feature. But this time even he pushed the envelope a bit -- 
comparing a group that has sold more than 80 million albums and will perform to 
more than 2 million fans this summer to an unsigned local band performing at 
the Marine Room Tavern. 
</P>
<P>
 No disrespect intended to Mr. Boehm or the Missiles of October, but is it any 
wonder why the Eagles ticket price is greater than the $2 cover at the Marine 
Room Tavern?

A NEW APPRECIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How wonderful that Knott's Berry Farm's new attraction, Mystery Lodge, is a 
life-affirming blend of old mythology and new technology rather than just 
another cartoon-oriented thrill ride ("Reflection: Lodge's Most Special 
Effect," May 31). 
</P>
<P>
 And isn't it ironic that after so many years of purposely destroying the 
American Indian cultures in the arrogant, ethnocentric belief that we are 
civilizing them, we now turn back to the myth and culture of the Native 
Americans to find a positive lesson of life and family and hope?

NATION TRANSFIXED BY EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE; CHASE: MILLIONS ARE RIVETED TO

 A day of high drama capped by a cinematic and at times surreal car chase 
across Southern California transformed the nation into a mesmerized -- and 
sometimes participatory -- audience Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 From the freeway overpasses -- where some residents flocked to cheer O.J. 
Simpson as though he were a legendary outlaw -- to a tiny tavern in a Nevada 
mining town, people suddenly stopped their lives to watch a white Ford Bronco 
and to see an American tragedy unfold.

 Law enforcement and television caught up with Simpson in Orange County as the 
Bronco sped south on the Santa Ana Freeway through rush-hour traffic. Was he 
headed for Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest where his ex-wife was buried on 
Thursday? Or was he perhaps headed for her family home in Monarch Bay? 
</P>
<P>
 As the nation tuned into the gripping drama that never stood still, the chase 
took more turns and ended up back in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, office work went untouched while television 
sets worked overtime. "This is the day Los Angeles stopped," said David Colden, 
an entertainment attorney. "Everything just ground to a halt. . . . I bet 
billions of dollars was lost today in lost productivity. No one's gotten 
anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 At Chaya Brasserie in West L.A., patrons came to dinner equipped with tiny 
television sets that they perched on their tables. In health clubs, people 
lingered after workouts, afraid to miss a single moment of the rolling 
melodrama playing out on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the audience were moved to join the show, striking a bizarre 
note as they cheered on a man who, only hours before, had been charged with 
murdering his ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 With dozens of police cars falling in behind and saturation television 
coverage tracking every movement -- north on the 5, west on the 91 Freeway, 
north on the 405 -- huge crowds gathered on overpasses to watch as Simpson, 
reportedly with a gun pressed to his head, whizzed by in the car driven by his 
former college teammate and close friend Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Intersecting Simpson's path back toward his Brentwood estate, motorists 
stopped, got out of their cars in the middle of the rush-hour freeway traffic 
and waved. Others spilled into the traffic lanes near the loping Bronco. They 
cheered, honked horns and lined the roadway waving -- a scene more reminiscent 
of a parade or victory procession than a police pursuit of a murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were glued to television sets when they realized the pursuit would be 
passing nearby them, so they said they jumped in their cars and positioned 
themselves on on-ramps or along the freeway so they could join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be therapy for O.J. if he saw motorists honking and 
bunching up behind him," said Steve James of Diamond Bar, who joined the 
pursuit in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Castellanos, 22, of Garden Grove, said he was sure that the chase would 
end near the MainPlace mall in Santa Ana when he joined up, equipped with a 
police scanner. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we got to Buena Park, I said, 'We might as well go for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, Castellanos ended up going all the way to the jammed streets 
outside of the Simpson mansion in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The harrowing chase started around 6 p.m., when law enforcement authorities 
traced the Bronco to Orange County by following cellular phone transmissions 
from the truck. By 7:15, after several tries, officers started talking to the 
Bronco's occupants on the car phone. They weren't the only callers. Radio 
listeners took to the airwaves and urged the one-time football hero to give 
himself up. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 8 p.m., as Simpson's vehicle left the freeway at Sunset 
Boulevard, near his estate, people were waiting in the middle of the street, 
some lunging toward the vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 A large, boisterous crowd gathered at Rockingham Avenue and Sunset as the 
drama wound down, some of them cheering and chanting, "Free O.J." Others held 
signs saying "Save the Juice" and "We Love the Juice." About 50 young people 
tried to clamber over an ivy-covered hillside leading to the Simpson home, but 
police pushed them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to make sure he didn't commit suicide," said Brian Washington, 
25, who drove down from Lancaster with his pregnant wife. "Let's just go on 
from here. You've got young and old out here and we are all pulling for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Gibson, 21, drove up from Orange County after spotting Simpson on the 
freeway. Holding a sign that said "Go O.J.," he wanted to get one last glimpse 
of his hero, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most incredible thing in my entire lifetime," Gibson said. "For 
him to go down like this, well, it's just not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Damran Kuykendall, 21, a Navy sailor who lives in Orange, chatted with his 
buddies Clark Hays, 22; and Seth Alexander, 23, who also live in Orange. They 
had followed Simpson from the Santa Ana Freeway to the Artesia Freeway and all 
the way to Los Angeles in their Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juice was in the back. He was laying up against the seat," Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Shue, 19, and John Donahue, 22, of Ukiah, were at Universal Studios when 
they heard what was going on on the radio and decided to leave the park and 
come to Simpson's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard the news while we were in the gift shop and we came right over," 
Shue said. "We couldn't miss it. We just followed the trail of helicopters. 
It's crazy. It's just crazy I can't believe how many people take this as a 
joke."  
</P>
<P>
 Brochelle Hale, 35, of Hawthorne, said she was glad when Simpson finally 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make any sense for him to go through all he has gone through," she 
said. "He should have turned himself in at the beginning. He ain't no hero." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, though, the mood was festive, and in almost every case, supportive 
of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Juice is loose!" several people shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to bring my family to see this," said one man with a small child on his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rest of the country, the action was confined to television screens, but 
was no less riveting for those caught in its grip. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City alone, nine television stations preempted regular programming 
to carry coverage of the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC interrupted coverage of the New York Knicks championship basketball game, 
joining ABC and CBS in televising what could only be regarded as an 
extraordinary spectacle -- a fallen hero, pursued by police and reporters in 
full public view. 
</P>
<P>
 At Waterhole No. 1 in the tiny northeast Nevada mining town of Golconda, owner 
Judy Wilson watched the California freeway chase and later developments 
surrounded by 15 to 20 patrons at any one time in the evening. It was a switch 
for the tiny bar; usually they just watch sporting events and the news -- and 
then only in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite a show," Wilson said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Sheggeby, a book editor in San Francisco, had been watching television 
for the past two hours, since she got home from work at 7 p.m. "We think it's 
the most ridiculous thing we've ever done, but we just can't stop. " 
</P>
<P>
 At the police station in Buffalo, a city in which Simpson braved ice and 
bitter temperatures for a decade to become a football legend, half a dozen 
local police personnel crowded around a small radio at headquarters to follow 
the drama as they waited to book the night's suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's listening," said Christine Dipasquale, a technician in the auto 
unit. "Everybody just feels so bad. My son was just saying this afternoon that 
Los Angeles probably feels bad, but for Buffalo it's worse.  
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. played for us for so long, he lived here for a long time. We remember 
our stars," she said. "Everybody feels like maybe he did do it, but we just 
wish he didn't." Pursuit Path 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson led authorities on a freeway pursuit Friday after being charged 
with murder in the slayings of his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Here is the 
path taken by the car carrying Simpson and his longtime friend and former 
teammate, Al Cowlings.

SPORTS SUPER-AGENT JOINS FIGHT TO KEEP RAMS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nationally prominent Orange County sports agent who spearheaded San 
Francisco's successful drive to prevent the Giants baseball franchise from 
moving in 1992 is primed to lead the fight to keep the Rams in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, county businessman, homeowner and sports fan, says he wants 
to protect his turf, and that includes the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is there," said Steinberg, whose sizable group of National 
Football League clients includes star quarterbacks Joe Montana, Troy Aikman and 
Warren Moon. "This is a fight that needs to be made for the economic vitality 
of Orange County and for fans who enjoy professional football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams belong here, and we don't intend to let them leave. I live here, I 
have two boys, and I want the most positive business climate and most exciting 
sports scene possible. Now it's our obligation to show Mrs. Frontiere (Rams 
owner Georgia) that they can stay here. We can save this team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steinberg plan: 
</P>
<P>
 * It's not the city of Anaheim's fight; it will require the involvement of the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * County businesses will have to buy blocks of season tickets or assist in 
marketing and promotional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 * A task force of prominent local business leaders recently formed to look at 
the Rams' situation must be expanded. Steinberg says he intends to join forces 
with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private investors must be recruited to study the possibility of building a 
new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * The team's radio and local TV deals must be re-evaluated with an eye on 
improving revenue opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * The team needs to be renamed the California or Orange County Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 * Football fans will have to set aside their feelings about recent poor 
results and disregard for team management and buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have any chance under any scenario of keeping the Rams here, they have to 
be assured of a sellout," Steinberg said. "From Georgia Frontiere's 
perspective, she sits and looks at a half-empty stadium while there are cities 
elsewhere with losing teams where it's impossible to buy a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "When games aren't sold out, they are not shown on local TV, and so the major 
marketing tool for a football team can't be used. If the Rams were on TV, they 
would be more popular." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have yet to consummate a deal to move, but conventional wisdom has 
them playing in Baltimore in 1995. They executed an escape clause in their 
Anaheim Stadium lease on May 3 and provided 15 months' notice. Team officials 
have talked with St. Louis, Hartford, Conn., Toronto, Memphis, Tenn., San 
Antonio and Baltimore about moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority reaction locally: Good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 Season-ticket sales this season have plunged more than 30% from a year ago, 
and radio rights that earned the team $2.5 million in 1993 recently sold for 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll of Orange County voters commissioned by The Times found 68% saying it 
is personally unimportant to keep the Rams. Anaheim city officials, saying 
there is little they can do to improve the team's financial situation, sound 
resigned to its departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself recently in the same mode as everyone else until I realized 
how stupid that is," Steinberg said. "There's been this constant refrain that 
the Rams are history, that they are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But none of that is true. The Rams are here in Orange County, getting ready 
to play another season." 
</P>
<P>
 And are the Rams still open to the prospect of staying? 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," said John Shaw, Ram executive vice president. "We'd entertain 
any deal from Orange County that's competitive with deals being offered by 
other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting together such a package would not be easy. But Steinberg said it must 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County cannot afford to lose the Rams," he said. "It is a team with 
the dateline of Anaheim connected to it, and along with Disneyland, the Angels 
and Mighty Ducks, it's the most publicly identifiable business here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous competition from other states to take our primary 
industries. It sends a chilling message to businesses across the country to 
have one of the most publicly identifiable businesses in this area leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who are deeply concerned about a business like Taco Bell leaving 
Irvine and locating in some other area, the Rams have a much stronger national 
impact. It's a move that will be seen on Wall Street and in corporate board 
rooms across the country. . . . When the Raiders left Oakland, it triggered an 
acceleration of a downward economic cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg was instrumental in organizing the drive to keep the baseball Giants 
in San Francisco two years ago and now is a special adviser to a task force 
working to keep the A's rooted in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started in San Francisco there was already a signed purchase 
agreement from Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., to buy the Giants," Steinberg said. 
"The Giants were determined to go, the public had turned down several bond 
issues to build a new stadium, and National League owners were convinced the 
Bay Area couldn't support two baseball teams." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan solicited Steinberg's help after area 
newspapers printed headlines declaring the Giants were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans had acquiesced, and the initial reaction to trying to save the team 
was one of great skepticism. But eventually it worked, the team is still there, 
and last year Giant attendance increased more than 1 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg says it is now the responsibility of sports fans here to rally to 
the Rams' aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good sports town doesn't mean 100% of the people have to be sports fans. 
For those people who don't care about sports at all, this entire issue is of no 
interest. . . . But for those of us who consider sports a treasure, something 
to be handed from father to son, this fight needs to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg says the NFL has given the county its one chance at pro football. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average sports fan needs to understand it's not a matter of the Ram team 
leaving and someone else filling the spot," Steinberg said. "NFL owners will 
never bring football back here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sitting at a critical juncture here in Orange County. Are we content in 
Orange County to never have a regional, cultural and geographical identity? The 
business community here needs to embrace that question." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the attractive deals being offered by other cities, promises of 
spending taxpayer money to build state-of-the-art stadiums and lucrative 
financial packages? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be the last one to take money from the homeless or unemployed, but it 
might make good business sense to build a new stadium -- with private 
investors. That's what we worked on in San Francisco, and private investors 
believe there is a profit in such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams aren't saying they need that new stadium tomorrow. It doesn't exist 
in some of the places they are talking about. But they need to see some light 
at the end of the tunnel. The modern sports environment insists on a 
state-of-the-art stadium and tremendous community support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Municipalities all across the country are putting public and private funds 
together and crawling on their hands and knees and begging for professional 
sports franchises because they recognize the unique public and private benefits 
a franchise brings to a geographical area." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg added: "Orange County needs to be much more accommodating now and 
much more aggressive in speaking to the Rams' needs. The capacity exists to do 
that. . . . A first-class facility (the Pond of Anaheim) was put together to 
lure hockey and the Mighty Ducks here." 
</P>
<P>
 But public sentiment suggests local fans might be unwilling to make the 
commitment necessary to prevent a move. Empty seats and banners demanding the 
Rams' departure overwhelmingly outnumbered rallies urging the team to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, people have held up banners exhorting the owner to sell the team or 
move, but all they are really doing is expressing frustration. That shouldn't 
be seen as a serious expression or desire to have the team leave Orange County. 
A truly universal attraction of sports is the ability of fans to complain and 
be frustrated with a team's lack of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have known the owner of the Rams for many years, and she is a very positive 
woman who has been misunderstood in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess my argument here is that a divorce is not in order, but maybe some 
counseling is needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg says the relationship is salvageable and that on-the-field success 
would help. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those fans who are discontented with the Rams' losing record or who have 
antipathy toward present ownership, better days will come. Teams go through 
winning and losing cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams are on the verge of having a much better team. They are lacking a 
major identifiable star, but it's not because they haven't tried. If (longtime 
quarterback) Jim Everett had been successful he would have been that star. 
(Everett was traded to New Orleans after last season.) Fans are more 
star-oriented here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now (running back) Jerome Bettis has the makings to be that star, and I know 
(recently acquired) quarterback Chris Miller, and he can be a very popular 
figure in this area. They have the makings to be a much more marketable and 
interesting team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe people will come to watch the Rams. There is no question they could 
fill the stadium. Hey, this is not as daunting as baseball. We're talking about 
10 home football games, 65,000 people a game, and so this is not really that an 
enormous of an undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people talk about the wide range of entertainment possibilities in 
Southern California, but that's also true in New York and Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Most solutions to the Rams' plight that have been suggested previously involve 
the team being sold to local investors. But Frontiere has said repeatedly that 
she has no interest in selling control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, who put together the local investor group that ultimately bought 
the Giants, said he does not want to unseat Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Rams were offered for public sale the line of purchasers would go from 
here to the Pacific Ocean," Steinberg said. "But the preference here is to have 
Mrs. Frontiere keep the team. This is Georgia Frontiere's team, and it's up to 
us to take our head out of the sand and show her support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a countywide issue, and it needs to be squarely addressed by the Board 
of Supervisors, and it needs countywide funding." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner, whose district includes Anaheim, said 
Steinberg's sports connections will bring needed "stature" to a difficult 
effort. Steiner characterized past overtures to the Rams made by government and 
business as one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for us to pick up the phone here when there is no one on the other 
line," the supervisor said. "There hasn't been any two-way communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met repeatedly with (Anaheim Mayor) Tom Daly to see what we could do. 
I've presented resolutions to the Board of Supervisors offering our support. 
But the Rams seem not to have a commitment to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Rams leave, Steiner was more optimistic than Steinberg about the 
chances of attracting another NFL franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "My common sense tells me that we're a great sports market. You only need to 
look at what happened with the Mighty Ducks to see that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to think that the Rams would be our last chance for professional 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinberg said county residents still need a wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we act, we're pushing the Rams out of Orange County. It's put up or 
shut up time for Orange County, and if we don't make this fight people will 
feel the consequences." 
</P>

BIOLOGICAL MOM WANTS JIMMY PETERS BACK; FAMILY: THE COLORADO WOMAN LAST SAW 
TROUBLED O.C. SPECIAL-ED STUDENT SHORTLY AFTER HIS BIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The mother of the 6-year-old special-education student whose school district 
went to court last month to oust him from his kindergarten class said Friday 
she will soon file for custody of the boy because she believes his father is 
exploiting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilia A. Rodriguez, a 28-year-old Aurora, Colo., hairstylist who lost custody 
of Jimmy Peters shortly after his birth and has not seen him in five years, 
said she decided to take action when she learned of the recent battle over the 
child's education. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez has contacted a Newport Beach attorney, hoping to remove Jimmy from 
the center of an increasingly bitter dispute at Circle View Elementary school, 
where school officials say he has been repeatedly disruptive and violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my son used as a pawn," said Rodriguez, who intends to take 
Jimmy to Colorado. "I have never done anything good for Jimmy, and now is my 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want custody. I want to do what is right," said Rodriguez, who lived with 
Jimmy's father, James D. Peters III, for several years but never married him 
and is raising two other children on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters responded that "I have full custody of (Jimmy), so that sounds like 
something that's going to happen a long time down the road, if it happens at 
all."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jim Peters and Ocean View School District personnel agreed Friday 
that the boy will receive one-on-one lessons at Circle View Elementary this 
summer, temporarily solving the fierce battle over whether Jimmy should be 
schooled in a regular or special-education classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At a three-hour meeting Friday morning, Peters and district officials arranged 
for Jimmy to have private, two-hour sessions with a teacher for 29 days this 
summer. The plan is a compromise between the district's desire to place him in 
a special-education class and Peters' insistence that he learn in a mainstream 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters says his son suffers from a communication disorder, but district 
officials contend that his disability is more severe and includes 
characteristics of autism. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and school officials will decide this summer whether Jimmy will be in a 
regular or special-education classroom for first grade next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the arrangement a "hodgepodge program," Peters said he agreed to the 
one-on-one schooling only because the district had refused to provide adequate 
support for Jimmy in a mainstream classroom during the summer session. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are being totally unreasonable," Peters said after the meeting. "They 
won't stop attacking little Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ocean View Supt. James R. Tarwater said Friday he believes one-on-one 
sessions are the only reasonable alternative to special education for Jimmy. 
"He won't be able to handle summer school (if it is in a regular classroom)," 
he said. "It would be a nightmare." Peters, who in federal court documents said 
he has been unemployed since 1989 and receives government assistance, has been 
battling Ocean View officials for years, contending that the district was not 
trying hard enough to meet Jimmy's special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters insisted this year that Jimmy remain in a mainstream kindergarten class 
despite what the district alleged were repeated incidents in which Jimmy 
disrupted the class with screaming and violent tantrums. Peters denies the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation blew up this spring, when Jimmy allegedly bit his teacher 
and the district went to court May 25, seeking to permanently oust him from the 
classroom. In the first case of its kind in Orange County history, a federal 
court judge ordered Jimmy back to the classroom after a three-week absence, 
touching off a raucous June 9 demonstration by parents of some of the other 
children on the day Jimmy returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it appears the case is once again headed to a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach attorney Terri Cleland said she spent Friday collecting 
documents and investigating whether California is the appropriate jurisdiction 
for a custody battle between Peters and Rodriguez. Jimmy was born in Las Vegas, 
and that is where Peters won sole, legal custody of the boy in 1988, both 
parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point it looks like I'm going to be (representing her)," Cleland 
said. "I'm just doing some fact-finding myself," she added. "At this point, I 
have no idea if she can get custody or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said acquaintances in Orange County contacted her after reading news 
accounts of Jimmy's battle with the school district. She said she decided to 
pursue custody of Jimmy, in part out of concern for his educational future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe (Jimmy) is being deprived of the proper education that he needs. 
Special-needs classrooms -- I believe that's what he needs," Rodriguez said 
Friday. "I'm not a professional, I have to read up on it, I have to call my 
principal and the teachers . . . but I know that I can help him. I want to save 
him. I want him to turn out to be the best kid and adult that he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater, who has already been contacted by Rodriguez, said that if Jimmy's 
mother attains even partial custody of him, it could have a major impact on the 
struggles over the boy's educational plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she wants him in the special day class and he wants him in a mainstream 
class, then the fight would be between them -- not us," he said. "We'd be out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters has long been married to Renee Harris Peters, a Westminster 
hairstylist. Rodriguez said she met Peters 10 years ago, while she was working 
as a receptionist at a Colorado hair salon the couple owned. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she moved with Peters to Sacramento when the salon closed in 1985. 
They lived together for several years and had moved to Las Vegas by the time 
Jimmy was born on Dec. 14, 1987, according to interviews with Rodriguez and Jim 
Peters' friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters declined to comment on Rodriguez's version of those events. He also 
refused to discuss where he and Jimmy are living. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters said custody is not the immediate issue facing Jimmy. "This whole 
thing is about education, and full inclusion, and Jimmy's rights, those things 
. . . there's just nothing to comment on (custody) realistically." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Peters, who has acted as Jimmy's mother for years, said Friday that she 
had no comment on any aspect of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's birth and custody records are closed to the public, but Rodriguez said 
she and Peters split up shortly after Jimmy's birth. Rodriguez said she 
returned to Colorado from Las Vegas with Jimmy and Sabrina, her daughter from 
another relationship who is now 8, and initially won custody of Jimmy in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters won custody of the boy months later, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who is identified as Jimmy's mother in legal documents obtained by 
The Times, said she lost custody in a hearing that she did not attend. "He got 
custody, not because I was an unfit mom, but because I didn't know about the 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said she was awarded supervised visitation rights, but has seen 
Jimmy only twice -- when Peters brought the boy to Colorado -- because she did 
not know where he was living in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who grew up in Colorado, now lives with Sabrina and another 
daughter, 3-year-old Patricia, in a two-bedroom, two-story townhome in Aurora, 
a suburb of 228,000 people east of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Her only memento of Jimmy is a videotape of him playing as a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have good times with the kids you do have," Rodriguez said, choking on 
sobs. "I lived, but it's like I'm alive physically . . . but I've always been 
dead. My heart has never been healed."

MATCH BRINGS O.C. FANS TOGETHER 
</P>

<P>
 The opening of the World Cup games Friday brought Orange County soccer fans 
together to celebrate in pubs, clubs, bars and homes everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As Germany and Bolivia battled it out on the field, more than 300 supporters 
of the teams gathered in opposite corners of Anaheim to watch the game on 
big-screen TVs, poised to spring from their seats whenever their team gained an 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Phoenix Club, a popular hangout for German Americans, about 250 fans 
enjoyed a feast that included beer and sauerkraut as they roared when Germany 
scored its first and only goal. The spacious hall filled with shouts of 
approval as the Mexican referee acknowledged the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is the national sport of Germany. There, every hamlet and village, no 
matter how small, has its own soccer team, said Hans Pietsch, 58, who 
immigrated to the United States in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fan" is too mild a word to describe Pietsch, a former professional player who 
now resides in Placentia with his family, which includes a 22-year-old son who 
graduated to basketball when he grew too tall for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people played soccer, there wouldn't be war," Pietsch said, as he stole 
anxious glances at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups of fans in Anaheim disagreed on which team should win, but they 
did agree on one thing: The United States would be a much better country had 
soccer been the nation's pastime instead of baseball or football. 
</P>
<P>
 While the German fans watched on a 10-by-10-foot color screen, about 70 
Bolivian fans squeezed into Verda's Pizza Submarine Shop across town to watch 
on a 32-inch TV, which was accompanied by a Spanish radio announcer blaring a 
play-by-play in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 They shouted encouragements at their team and booed the referee who awarded 
Germany the score. It did not really matter, though, that Bolivia was losing. 
When the game ended, they danced to a popular Bolivian song, "Viva Mi Patria 
Bolivia," which praises the country's cherished team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bessie Jacobowitz, whose father is German, had no problems deciding who to 
root for. She swears allegiance to her home country, Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is (Bolivia's) first time in the World Cup, and we are proud of our 
people," said Jacobowitz, who was visiting the Southland for the World Cup. 
"When I was a kid, every Sunday we went to the stadium and watched. All the 
months they play" soccer in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is an inexpensive sport that anyone can play, said Adolfo Ramos, 44, 
who is splurging on two tickets worth $636 for a match in Boston next week, 
when Bolivia faces South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born kicking a ball," Ramos said. "When you're kids (in Bolivia), you 
stole your mother's and sister's nylons and rolled them into a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Although rivals for the day, neither the Germans nor the Bolivians had any 
harsh words for each other's teams or countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always people better than you," Pietsch said. "I'm a sportsman. If 
they win, (let it) be so." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, perturbed by his country's defeat and what he called "unfair referees," 
was not so understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad the mistakes were worse against our country," he said.

RAMS' SEASON-TICKET SALES OFF 30%; FOOTBALL: MANAGEMENT PROJECTS A LOSS OF $5 
MILLION OR MORE. TEAM OFFICIALS SEE LITTLE HOPE FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS IN 
ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The search for long-term financial gains in other cities apparently will throw 
the Rams for a substantial loss this year: Season-ticket sales are off more 
than 30% from last season, and the Rams say they project a loss of $5 million 
to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Season tickets are slightly under 24,000," said John Shaw, Ram executive vice 
president. "The deadline for selling season tickets is well passed, and it is 
what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reasons we haven't sold tickets the last number of years. 
We've had a steady decrease compounded by the uncertainty of what we're doing. 
I'm disappointed that it's not more, but not terribly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' ticket office reported that the team distributed 37,055 season 
tickets last season. In 1990, following an 11-5 finish in 1989 and an 
appearance in the conference championship game, 49,428 were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the Rams lost money during the 1987 NFL strike and would have 
incurred a small loss last season had they not received an expansion payment 
from Charlotte and Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 A drop in attendance, a higher payroll because of the introduction of the 
National Football League salary cap and reduced radio revenue have contributed 
to the Rams' projected loss in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the team has little chance for economic success if it remains in 
Anaheim Stadium and has positioned itself for a move in time to play elsewhere 
in 1995. Shaw said he has met with representatives from Baltimore, St. Louis, 
Hartford, Conn., Memphis, Tenn., Toronto and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Anaheim maintains its present posture, I would personally recommend to 
ownership that we move," Shaw said, "but I don't have the final say." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, however, has the ear of owner Georgia Frontiere and the expertise to put 
together an attractive deal elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Angelos, majority owner of baseball's Baltimore Orioles, said recently 
that a deal with the Rams could be concluded as soon as six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that, and frankly, I'm surprised by it," Shaw said. "I feel we're in 
the process of negotiating with Angelos as we are in the process of negotiating 
with the city of St. Louis, the city of Hartford and other ownership groups in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally untrue that we've narrowed it down to Baltimore. To be honest 
with you, I'm not even sure they are the front-runner." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said there remain six or seven unresolved major issues with Angelos, as 
well as with other pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised by Mr. Angelos' statement because I don't feel we're very far 
along," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major issues that threaten to block a move to Baltimore revolve 
around Frontiere's reluctance to sell controlling interest in the Rams. She has 
said she is willing to sell a minority share of the team to facilitate a move, 
but Ram suitors are demanding complete control in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Majority ownership passing to a minority buyer and when that will be done is 
one of the larger issues," Shaw said. "It's Georgia's wishes that she would 
just like to sell a straight minority interest, and that's our current 
position. I kind of expect it to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not inconceivable that there could be a move without the sale of a 
minority interest. It happens in a lot of situations. I think this is a large 
issue whether she sells a portion of the team or not, but I don't think it's a 
large issue of whether she moves or not." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been reports that Shaw has been urging Frontiere to sell to local 
investors and allow them to deal with the present poor economic conditions in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaw said Frontiere remains adamant about not selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has changed," he said. "We have been approached by a number of people 
from cities elsewhere who want to buy a majority control, but there is no 
interest in doing that at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody locally has stepped forward and (they) probably won't because they 
know she will not entertain a majority sale. We're looking for a solution where 
she maintains control of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw identified Baltimore, St. Louis and Hartford as the most aggressive 
cities vying for the Rams' attention. He said two or three local investors have 
talked about building a stadium for the team, but those discussions are now "on 
the back burner." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing what we said we were going to do, and that is exploring 
everything. If it's the perception that we are close to something with 
Baltimore, it's an inaccurate one," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at all deals now and are not close to making a deal anywhere. 
I'd say I have spent more time with another ownership group than with Angelos." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw wouldn't be more specific, but the Baltimore Sun newspaper has identified 
the second group as being headed by attorney Robert Schulman.

DODGERS NOT CLOSE AGAINST THE ROCKIES; BASEBALL: COLORADO SCORES 11 RUNS IN 
FOURTH, FIFTH AND SIXTH INNINGS OF 13-5 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For once, things were calm. Ugly, but calm. 
</P>
<P>
 No Dodger bullpen angst. No late-inning drama, no comebacks, no closer 
controversy -- and no chance from the middle innings on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado Rockies took care of all that for the Dodgers, rocketing 
baseballs all over the park on their way to a rollicking 13-5 victory before 
39,609 at Dodger Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was it for the Dodgers? The Rockies' left fielder, Eric Young, who 
started the game with a .220 batting average and only four doubles and 14 runs 
this season, had hits in his first four at-bats, including three doubles, and 
scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad? The Rockies crushed Orel Hershiser and Roger McDowell for 11 runs in 
the fourth, fifth and sixth innings combined. By the top of the sixth, after 
Dante Bichette knocked in three with a bases-loaded double -- his third hit of 
the game -- it was 12-4, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a good lineup," Dodger third baseman Tim Wallach said. "When they 
get on a roll offensively, it's tough to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, who do fine against Colorado while in Denver, the defeat was 
an unwelcome reminder of the last time the Rockies were at Dodger Stadium: Last 
August, the Rockies swept a four-game series, knocking the Dodgers out of the 
division title chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's loss shrunk the Dodgers' division lead over the second-place Rockies 
to four games and ended Colorado's three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, starting pitcher Lance Painter, who brought an 0-2 record and 6.87 
earned-run average into the game, survived the Dodgers' three-run first inning 
and lasted 5 2/3 innings, giving up five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 He was relieved in the sixth with two out, the score 12-5, and the bases 
loaded, when Willie Blair was brought in to face Mike Piazza, who earlier had 
doubled and also hit his 14th home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair jammed Piazza, whose blooper was caught by shortstop Walt Weiss, to end 
the Dodgers' last meaningful moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser (3-4) started out shakily -- he gave up hard-hit balls to everyone 
he faced in the first. But a home run saving catch by Cory Snyder in left 
field, a line drive caught by shortstop Jose Offerman, and a pickoff of 
Bichette at second base held the Rockies to one run in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger hitters, as they usually do when Hershiser pitches, put runs on the 
board. They gave Hershiser a 3-1 lead in the first, keyed by Piazza's two-run 
double off the right-center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hershiser's 14 starts, the Dodgers have scored an average of more than five 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rockies' bombardment was only beginning. The first four Rockies got 
hits in the fourth inning, including a two-run home run by Andres Galarraga, 
his 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's double scored two more, and a Hershiser wild pitch plated two more for 
a 6-3 Colorado lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser's seven-run, nine-hit, four-inning stint ended an 11-game run in 
which Dodger starters pitched at least six innings and the aggregate ERA for 
the starters was 2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pitched very poorly, and when you pitch poorly, sometimes things like this 
happen," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the shortest outing this season for Hershiser, who has lost his 
last four decisions. In three previous career starts against Colorado, 
Hershiser had given up only two runs in 23 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with Painter on the mound for Colorado, the Dodgers were still in the 
game. Until the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 With McDowell on the mound, Galarraga led off with a single. Charlie Hayes 
then belted a deep home run to left field, making the score 9-4. The Rockies 
followed that by scoring three more runs in the sixth against McDowell before 
anybody was out. It took rookie reliever Ismael Valdes to get out of the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAY OF DRAMA 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring five runs in the ninth inning to defeat the Chicago White Sox, 
5-3, the Angels retreat to the clubhouse to watch the O.J. Simpson saga unfold.

ROOM AT THE INNS; AGENT'S OVERPRICING COST THEM BUSINESS, HOTELIERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hype came early and often. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel industry was told that soccer's World Cup, the 52-game international 
spectacle that opened Friday in Chicago and comes to the Rose Bowl today, would 
be its chance to cash in on the world's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But World Cup bookings have fallen short of expectations in the nine cities 
involved, and some hoteliers now grumble that because of overpricing, their 
opportunity was booted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Official" room rates -- for accommodations purchased through the World Cup's 
exclusive, for-profit contractor -- are in some cases double the price 
typically available to business travelers and significantly higher than the 
"rack rate," or the full declared price normally printed on a card on the hotel 
room door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like greed and smells like greed," said Roland Baumann, general 
manager of the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, near Washington's National Airport 
and 10 miles from Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, the venue for five Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann said the 450 rooms he blocked out for sale by the World Cup 
Accommodation Bureau, the official contractor, were offered at $190 a night -- 
about $40 higher than he expected and far too expensive for his area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 685 rooms to sell, and I'm selling something like 50 or less," he 
said. "With rates more reasonable, we at least would have had a chance at more 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, the Accommodation Bureau now expects to provide about 
500,000 hotel room-nights during the one-month tournament. That's about half 
the number of room-nights originally blocked out, or committed to the bureau, 
by more than 600 U.S. hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-area hoteliers say bookings are running at about 50% of the number 
blocked, but they expect to do far better in the last week of the tournament, 
culminating in the July 17 championship game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 As foreign bookings have failed to materialize, the Accommodation Bureau has 
given rooms back to the hotels to market on their own to domestic customers. 
The returns have come in stages since December, with some rooms being released 
as late as this week. In Detroit, Dallas and Orlando, Fla., many hotels got all 
or most of their rooms thrown back and have had to scramble to try to fill 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of additional rooms have been booked outside the official 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup USA -- the organizing committee -- projects that the Cup will 
generate $4 billion nationwide through foreign and domestic travel and tourism, 
licensed product sales, media rights fees, corporate sponsorship, game tickets 
and other items. The estimate comes from a USC study. 
</P>
<P>
 High room rates are one reason cited by hoteliers and tourism officials for 
low occupancy. Others include weak economic conditions abroad and the failure 
of several of the most popular teams to qualify for the 24-team championship 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six teams with the largest retinues of traveling, spending fans, four 
fell short in the qualifying rounds: Britain, France, Japan and Australia. Fan 
favorites Germany and Italy made it, but so did some teams with minuscule 
followings, such as Bulgaria and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never said this was going to be 52 Super Bowls," Jaime Byrom, owner 
and president of the Accommodation Bureau, said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrom also defended his pricing. Hoteliers who signed with the bureau all 
agreed to supply rooms at 75% of their 1993 rack rates and were told that the 
bureau would mark the rooms back up to rack rate or a little higher before 
offering them to foreign tour operators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final rate to foreign tourists, of course, would be higher after the tour 
operators added their own profit margin, Byrom explained, but he asserted that 
in no case did he charge tour operators more than 8% above rack rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody twisted anybody's arm to sign these contracts," said Randy Villareal, 
general manager of the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what we were signing and we expected what happened," he said, adding 
that bookings in Los Angeles have been well below the rosiest projections but 
in line with the expectations of hoteliers with international experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrom, a Mexican citizen who lives in Manchester, England, got into the World 
Cup business eight years ago when Mexico hosted the event. He parlayed a minor 
role in that tournament into a larger contract with the 1990 World Cup in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a year ago, he landed the prime contract for the U.S. World Cup. He 
said it represents the largest single international travel undertaking in 
history, topping the Barcelona Olympics of two years ago. Byrom said he has 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars developing computer systems that enabled 
him to offer a consumer-friendly innovation: a system of prepaid hotel room 
vouchers that eliminates the need for specific reservations tied to the guest's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrom and World Cup USA said organizers took pains to avoid the experience of 
the Italian World Cup, where rooms were selling at two or three times rack 
rates and fans were forced to pay large deposits and book multiple-night stays 
if they wanted game tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Accommodation Bureau does not control tickets -- the most precious 
commodity -- it has no monopoly and is just another competitor, said Sunil 
Gulati, chief international officer for World Cup USA. 
</P>
<P>
 With equal access to tickets, tour operators have been free to book rooms in 
hotels that did not sign with the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some hoteliers, that's precisely the problem. Some hotel and tourism 
officials say they were told there would be a link between tickets and official 
hotel rooms -- providing a powerful incentive for hotels to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrom said no link was ever promised or implied during the year he has been 
involved with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco expects to sell 25,000 room-nights through the Accommodation 
Bureau, down from the 188,000 room-nights in the original block, said John 
Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The hoteliers "know we have stuck to the deal," Byrom responded. "We've been 
disappointed in some cases with the level of demand, but we couldn't create 
business where no business could be had."

 RELATED STORIES: A1, C1 A $4-Billion Kick in the Economy 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a USC study, World Cup officials estimate the total economic impact 
of the nine-city, 52-game event will exceed $4 billion. The estimated impact on 
each of the cities, in millions of dollars: Los Angeles: $623 New York: $452 
San Francisco: $338 Dallas: $266 Boston: $255 Washington: $244 Chicago: $231 
Orlando: $209 Detroit: $180 Note: The total is less than $4 billion because 
some revenues are not linked to a particular area. Source: World Cup Organizing

BROADCASTING'S CREATORS OF A NEW WORLD; PERELMAN, BEVINS CREDITED WITH 
TRANSFORMING THE TV STATION OPERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With two bold and quick moves, billionaire Ronald O. Perelman has pushed his 
54%-owned New World Communications Group Inc. from relative obscurity to the 
attention of Wall Street. An alignment with Fox and the recruitment of 
programming whiz Brandon Tartikoff have added sizzle to the stock, which jumped 
this week to a high of $14.175 -- up 50% from its price a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Communications was organized just seven months ago, with the merger 
of Perelman's modest TV programming assets and seven TV stations acquired in 
1993. Until late May, the company was perceived as a station operator, with its 
stock trading at about nine times its cash flow -- typical of broadcast stocks. 
But Tartikoff's hiring called attention to New World's potential as a TV 
programmer -- boosting its price to the higher multiples typical of program 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood and Wall Street executives are intrigued by the skilled 
transformation of some debt-ridden TV stations and rag-tag TV libraries into 
the framework of a vertically integrated entertainment company. The credit, 
they say, belongs to Perelman, 50, and William C. Bevins, New World's 
low-profile chief executive who hammered out the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly seem to be putting the right pieces together," said Jessica 
Reif, a securities analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelman gained fame with his hostile takeover of Revlon in the 1980s, but he 
has prospered from a number of acquisitions in Hollywood -- including 
Technicolor and Marvel Entertainment Group. He is also known in Los Angeles as 
the multimillion-dollar backer of the annual "Fire & Ice" ball, which was 
founded by Tartikoff's wife, Lilly, to raise money for women's cancer research 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevins, 48, spent most of the 1980s negotiating deals for Ted Turner before 
joining Perelman in 1988, just as Perelman sold Technicolor for $780 million. 
In early 1989, Bevins helped negotiate Perelman's $82.5-million purchase of 
Marvel from the faltering New World Entertainment, and a few months later, 
Perelman agreed to acquire the bulk of New World for $141 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevins admits to a rocky start. He overestimated New World's chances of 
profiting from the prime-time programming business and was forced to refocus on 
production for the international market. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevins discovered he needed a domestic sales force to distribute his programs 
in the United States and ultimately paid $30 million for Genesis Entertainment. 
But the big move came last year when Perelman decided to spend $100 million for 
a 54% stake in the former Storer station group, which was mired in a bankruptcy 
proceeding. The move was gutsy, according to one investment banker, because it 
also meant assuming more than $550 million in station debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first four years were not a lot of fun," Bevins said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the $500-million investment from Fox and the charismatic Tartikoff 
on board as production chief, he says, "We have all the pieces in place, as far 
as the television business goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bevins said the company has already budgeted about $100 million for TV 
production this year and will easily double that amount in the next fiscal year 
with the addition of Tartikoff's Moving Target Productions and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, Bevins reads no TV scripts and harbors no interest in 
expanding into feature film production. The native of Kingsport, Tenn., is an 
accountant by training who joined Turner Broadcasting System in 1979. There, 
Bevins' work ethic became legend, as he toiled on Turner's frustrated bid for 
CBS, then its $1.2-billion acquisition of the MGM library, which precipitated a 
$576-million bailout of Turner by a group of cable operators. While still in 
his 30s, Bevins suffered the first of two heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bevins quit in 1987, Turner assigned two executives to take his place and 
asked him to stay on as a director. Former Turner colleague Robert J. Wussler 
describes Bevins as an executive who doesn't waver once he has settled on a 
strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't let small things get in the way," Wussler said. "He doesn't 
involve a lot of people; he works close to the vest." 
</P>
<P>
 Bevins said he has better control of his schedule now, but he has suffered one 
more heart attack since joining Perelman and underwent quintuple bypass surgery 
last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of his hospital release, Bevins appeared in his office to continue 
working on a deal, recalled entertainment attorney Ken Ziffren, who represented 
Tartikoff in the latest transaction with New World. 
</P>
<P>
 On the deal front, in addition to its seven TV stations, New World has a 
pending $350-million agreement to acquire four stations from Great American 
Communications Inc. and has an option to acquire Argyle Television Holdings' 
four stations for $716 million (including debt). 
</P>
<P>
 New World has marked five TV stations for sale to bring its ownership below 
the federal limit of 12: KNSD-TV in San Diego; WSBK-TV in Boston; WGHP-TV in 
Greensboro-High Point-Winston Salem, N.C., and two Birmingham, Ala., stations: 
WBRC-TV and WVTM-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Financing isn't an issue, thanks to the deal Bevins struck with News Corp. 
Chairman Rupert Murdoch, switching 12 New World-owned stations to Fox 
affiliates. Earlier in the year, New World raised $205 million from a rights 
offering and negotiated a $300-million credit facility with a group of banks 
for the purchase of TV stations. The company has additional borrowing capacity 
of $70 million to finance its TV production.;

HUGHES WINS $114 MILLION IN PATENT CASE; TECHNOLOGY: IT IS THE LARGEST SUCH 
AWARD EVER AGAINST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BUT IT FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE COMPANY'S 
EXPECTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a two-decade legal battle, a judge Friday awarded Hughes Aircraft $114 
million for the aerospace firm's patent claim that the U.S. government stole 
the technology that enabled the communications satellite revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the award ranks as the largest ever levied against the federal 
government for patent infringement, it falls far below even the smallest sum 
that Hughes hoped to win in the high-stakes case. Both sides are expected to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trial began in 1988, Hughes had sought an award of $1.2 billion, and 
at one time company attorneys speculated about a potential award of $6 billion. 
But the firm's high hopes were dashed Friday by a 26-page opinion from U.S. 
Court of Claims Judge James T. Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked that it is this low," said Mark Meltzer, a former Hughes 
attorney who worked on the patent case. "This is a lot lower than anybody 
expected. Taxpayers should be delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 But Victor Savikas, an attorney representing Hughes, said the award "is a lot 
of money, though we asked for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department lawyer Vito Di- Pietro, representing the government, said 
Turner's decision on the actual value of the patent "was exactly what we had 
proposed and exactly what was supported by the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes patent involved a device invented by Donald T. Williams, a 
brilliant young Harvard-educated engineer at Hughes in the 1960s who later 
committed suicide. Williams devised a simple, lightweight system to control the 
attitude of a satellite with a single rocket thruster. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, Hughes launched its Syncom, the first communications satellite. It 
paved the way for Hughes to dominate the world market, which it does even 
today. The effort was all the more impressive given that the Pentagon's own 
attempt to build such a spacecraft resulted in a design so heavy that no rocket 
at the time could launch it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the technical success of the Williams patent, Hughes had long 
expected to reap major rewards. Last fall, Turner ruled that the government had 
infringed the patent on 81 satellites over the years, worth a total of $3.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The final step in the case involved determining the royalty rate and an 
interest penalty. In both areas, Hughes got less than it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner rejected the company's assertion that it deserved a royalty of 15% on 
the $3.5 billion worth of government satellites using the device. Instead, 
Turner awarded a 1% royalty rate, exactly what the Justice Department had 
proposed as fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the millions of documents involved in the case, a few key pieces of 
evidence appear to have seriously deflated Hughes' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Turner found that shortly after obtaining its patent, Hughes 
offered a direct competitor a license at a rate equivalent to about 1.2%. In a 
letter, Hughes cited that as its normal royalty for scientific and experimental 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Hughes was never able to license the invention to even a single 
company, excluding Ford Motor Co., which settled a separate infringement suit 
by Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Savikas said the letter cited by Turner was involved in settlement 
negotiations for a civil suit and thus should not have been admitted as 
evidence -- apparently raising a potential appeal issue. And he said the 
failure to obtain other licenses resulted in large part from the government's 
infringement in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 For Judge Turner, the ruling means he is free at last of the long-running 
dispute, and in honor of the occasion, he retreated to his chambers and broke 
open a bottle of champagne after handing down his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of the award will be consumed by legal fees remains unclear. Meltzer 
said Hughes' past legal expenses have amounted to "a significant percentage of 
this award." But Savikas, Hughes' current attorney, insisted that the company's 
legal fees are "not anywhere near a substantial part of the award."

INFLATION JITTERS RATTLE STOCKS AS BOND YIELDS SOAR; WALL STREET: DOW 
INDUSTRIALS PLUMMET 34.56. PRECIOUS METALS AND GRAINS ADVANCE SHARPLY. OIL 
PRICES HIT A 14-MONTH HIGH.

<P>
 Stocks tumbled and bond yields rose sharply Friday in a panic about inflation, 
as precious metals and grains soared and oil prices hit a 14-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.56 points to 3,776.78, though the 
widely watched barometer gained 3.33 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond soared to 7.44% from 
Thursday's close of 7.35%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, 
dropped 15/16 point, or $9.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors don't like to see credit market interest rates rise because 
that increases the cost of money to companies and makes shares less attractive 
relative to interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market selloff came as the dollar slid to an eight-month low against 
the German mark. A weak dollar increases the cost of imports and can indicate 
inflation down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dropped to 1.611 German marks from 1.632 on Thursday. It also 
relinquished all of Thursday's gains against the Japanese yen, falling to 
102.80 from 103.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices surged due to the dollar's slump and inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 On New York's Comex, gold shot up $6.20 to $391.60 an ounce. Light, sweet 
crude oil for July delivery was 80 cents higher at $20.71 a barrel on the New 
York Merc. It last reached that price on March 8, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The most compelling evidence of higher inflation was the Commodity Research 
Bureau's index of 21 futures contracts, which rallied 2.10 points to 239.38. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation worries touched off fears that the Federal Reserve Board will be 
forced to push interest rates higher sooner than expected to check inflation 
pressures. Higher rates on new securities would tend to hurt the value of 
fixed-income instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they were reluctant to read much into the session's 
activity, given the volume tied to the quarterly triple witching. 
</P>
<P>
 Those quarterly expirations of stock index futures, stock index options and 
options on individual stocks mean many market participants must realign their 
portfolios, which typically leads to volatility in prices. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 129 million shares traded in the first half-hour as 
expirations-related program business flooded in. It was the third-most-active 
opening half-hour to date at the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some expirations distortion, no question," said Paul Hennessey, vice 
president of trading at Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 13 to 7 on the Big Board, where 
386.99 million shares changed hands, up sharply from Thursday's 256.39 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller-company stocks were among the hardest hit, with the more volatile 
technology stocks ending the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq composite index 
tumbled 5.62 to 729.35, losing 4.90 in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks mostly fell abroad, but in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended 
135.83 points higher at 21,503.30. London's Financial Times 100-share average 
closed down 7.2 points at 3,022.9. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average finished the week at 2,050.72, down 
4.19 points. Mexico City's Bolsa index dropped 16.3 points to 2,310.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
fell 3.48 to 458.45, losing 0.22 for the week, while the NYSE's composite index 
fell 1.70 to 253.29, losing 0.30 over seven days. At the American Stock 
Exchange, the market value index lost 1.52 to 440.26, dropping 1.58 in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Unisys led the NYSE most-active list, ending unchanged at 9. The company said 
second-quarter earnings will be lower than the 17 cents a share in the first 
three months of the year. Lehman cut earnings estimates for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quaker Oats rose 7 3/8 to 78 1/2. The stock rallied amid takeover rumors, 
but the company declined to comment on them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheyenne Software lost more than half its value, falling 8 3/8 to 8. The 
company forecast fiscal fourth-quarter results below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valence Technology fell 2 1/8 to 3 7/8 after it reported a 33-cent-a-share 
fourth-quarter loss and said it expects delays in shipping first-generation 
batteries to Hewlett-Packard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medalist Industries, maker of industrial fasteners, dropped 5 to 8 1/4 after 
forecasting a second-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMC rose 1 to 14 5/8 after the company said it is ahead of schedule in 
manufacturing its new 5000 Series mainframe storage devices. 
</P>
<P>
 * IDB Communications Group gained 13/16 to 8 9/16. Smith Barney revised 
downward some earnings estimates for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * New York Times gained 1/2 to 24 3/4. The company has agreed to sell its 
women's magazine division to a unit of Bertelsmann.

OFF THE TICKER: FUNGUS 1, COCKROACHES 0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new pesticide hopes to win the battle of the bugs by using natural agents 
instead of synthetic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bio-Path Cockroach Control Chamber uses the fungus Matarhizium anisopliae 
to kill cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The fungus, normally found in soil, lives inside a small plastic chamber and 
jumps on any roach that crawls through. But unlike some other types of roach 
traps, this one lets the roaches crawl out and live long enough to brush up 
against others, infecting them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bio-Path is the first insecticide registered in Florida that doesn't contain 
chemicals, according to its manufacturer, EcoScience Corp. of Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be available to the public by the end of the summer.

ROOM AT THE INNS; AGENT'S OVERPRICING COST THEM BUSINESS, HOTELIERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hype came early and often. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel industry was told that soccer's World Cup, the 52-game international 
spectacle that opened Friday in Chicago and comes to the Rose Bowl today, would 
be its chance to cash in on the world's most popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But World Cup bookings have fallen short of expectations in the nine cities 
involved, and some hoteliers now grumble that because of overpricing, their 
opportunity was booted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Official" room rates -- for accommodations purchased through the World Cup's 
exclusive, for-profit contractor -- are in some cases double the price 
typically available to business travelers and significantly higher than the 
"rack rate" or the full declared price normally printed on a card on the hotel 
room door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like greed and smells like greed," said Roland Baumann, general 
manager of the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, near Washington's National Airport 
and 10 miles from RFK Stadium, the venue for five Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann said that the 450 rooms he blocked out for sale by the World Cup 
Accommodation Bureau, the official contractor, were offered at $190 a night -- 
about $40 higher than he expected and far too expensive for his area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 685 rooms to sell, and I'm selling something like 50 or less," he 
said. "With rates more reasonable, we at least would have had a chance at more 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of hotels in Orange County, however, were lucky enough to snare 
World Cup corporate sponsors who are using the sporting event to wine and dine 
important clients and top employees. The event also is filling rooms at two 
hotels that are hosting foreign teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup will not mean additional business for most Orange County 
hotels and restaurants. The Westin South Coast Plaza, for example, believes its 
June and July occupancy rates will inch up as it books rooms for tourists who 
decided to pass on hotels in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, the Accommodation Bureau now expects to provide about 
500,000 hotel room/nights during the one-month tournament. That's about half 
the number of room/nights that originally were blocked out, or committed to the 
bureau, by more than 600 U.S. hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-area hoteliers say bookings are running at about 50% of the number 
blocked, but they expect to do far better in the last week of the tournament, 
culminating in the championship game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As foreign bookings have failed to materialize, the Accommodation Bureau has 
turned back rooms to the hotels to market on their own to domestic customers. 
The givebacks have come in stages since December, with some rooms being 
released as late as this week. In Detroit, Dallas and Orlando, many hotels got 
all or most of their rooms thrown back and have had to scramble to try to fill 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of additional rooms have been booked outside the official 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club has booked 500 of its 570 
rooms to Mars Inc., the Hackettstown, N.J.-based candy manufacturer. Mars' 
Snickers Bar is the official snack food sponsor of the U.S. World Cup team, and 
the company plans to celebrate that status for four days leading up to the 
World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew more than a year ago that we'd be booked by the Snickers people," 
Smith said. "So we didn't have to wait to see who would be in the finals and if 
their fans would be coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Newporter is serving as home-away-from-home for the 45-member 
Romanian team, which has booked 30 rooms for about two weeks. While the hotel 
is used to booking big groups, it did make some unusual accommodations, such as 
securing a practice field at nearby UC Irvine and making room in the hotel 
kitchen for the Romanian's tag-along chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Fullerton Marriott, which is hosting the Colombian national 
team, has set aside 28 rooms for the brief Cup season. The team is practicing 
at Cal State Fullerton's nearby field, and has directed the hotel to make sure 
that Colombian foods are on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup USA -- the organizing committee -- projects that the Cup will 
generate $4 billion nationwide through foreign and domestic travel and tourism, 
product sales, media rights fees, corporate sponsorship, game tickets and other 
items.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High room rates are one reason cited by hoteliers and tourism officials for 
low occupancy. Others include weak economic conditions abroad and the failure 
of several of the most popular teams to qualify for the 24-team championship 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six teams with the largest retinues of traveling, spending fans, four 
fell short in the qualifying rounds: Britain, France, Japan and Australia. Fan 
favorites Germany and Italy made it, but so did some teams with minuscule 
followings, such as Bulgaria and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never said this was going to be 52 Super Bowls," Jaime Byrom, owner 
and president of the Accommodation Bureau, said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrom also defended his pricing as reasonable. Hoteliers who signed with the 
bureau all agreed to supply rooms at 75% of their 1993 rack rates and were told 
that the bureau would mark the rooms back up to rack rate or a little higher 
before offering them to foreign tour operators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final rate to foreign tourists, of course, would be higher after the tour 
operators added their own profit margin, Byrom explained, but he asserted that 
in no case did he charge tour operators more than 8% above rack rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Accommodation Bureau does not control the most precious commodity 
-- game tickets -- it has no monopoly and is just another competitor, said 
Sunil Gulati, chief international officer for World Cup USA. With equal access 
to tickets, tour operators have been free to book rooms in hotels that did not 
sign with the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But to some hoteliers, that's precisely the problem. Some hotel and tourism 
officials say that they were told that there would be a linkage between tickets 
and official hotel rooms -- providing a powerful incentive for hotels.  
</P>
<P>
 Byrom said no linkage was ever promised or implied during the year he has been 
involved with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco currently expects to sell 25,000 room/nights through the 
Accommodation Bureau, down from the 188,000 room/nights in the original block, 
said John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never would have blocked near as many had we felt that rooms and tickets 
weren't tied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the hoteliers) know we have stuck to the deal," Byrom responded. "We've 
been disappointed in some cases with the level of demand, but we couldn't

CONSOLIDATION BY THRIFT HOLDING FIRM RSL FINANCIAL MEANS 82 O.C. LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RSL Financial Corp., a thrift holding company in Wichita, Kan., that operates 
one of the bigger mortgage banking operations in Orange County, will lay off 82 
workers at its California subsidiary as it consolidates the operations into its 
Railroad Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to absorb the subsidiary, RSL Mortgage Corp., was prompted by a big 
drop in home mortgages in the California market after interest rate increases 
this year killed the long boom in the home refinancing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the layoffs already have occurred, and the consolidation is expected 
to be completed by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 RSL Financial said that secondary marketing, loan servicing, accounting and 
administrative operations of RSL Mortgage will be assumed by Railroad Savings, 
its main subsidiary. A company official said that 43 RSL Mortgage sales 
employees and loan officers will remain in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected losses at the subsidiary this quarter will likely give RSL Financial 
"break-even" quarterly earnings compared with net income of $1.2 million in 
last year's second quarter.

 William P. Foley II's title insurance company, waging a hostile takeover 
battle for one company, has acquired a 31% stake in another Orange County 
company, this one a manufacturer of automated post office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Micro General Corp. in Santa Ana said in a prepared statement late Friday that

GRAPHIX ZONE GETS $3.9 MILLION IN STOCK OFFERING; INVESTMENT: THE IRVINE 
COMPANY ISSUES 1.2 MILLION SHARES TO RAISE WORKING CAPITAL FOR MULTIMEDIA 
PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Graphix Zone, a multimedia company best known for making an interactive 
music compact disc for the singer formerly known as Prince, raised $3.9 million 
Friday in an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The company issued 1.2 million shares at $3.25 a share on Nasdaq. Cruttenden & 
Co., an Irvine-based investment bank, managed the underwriting. Some portion of 
the money raised goes to the underwriters; the rest will be used as working 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Graphix Zone was formed in August, 1989, by Chuck Cortright and Angela 
Aber, a husband-and-wife team who worked as marketing managers in the early 
years of AST Research Inc., which has become multibillion-dollar computer 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortright, Graphix Zone chief executive, and Aber, executive vice president, 
said they wanted to take advantage of opportunities in multimedia, or the 
blending of video, sound, animation and text in a single computer program. The 
founders did not sell any of their stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Their company started out as a desktop publishing software retailer in the 
original Computer City Super Center store in Garden Grove. Computer City went 
on to become a nationwide computer sales chain. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year, the Graphix Zone moved to the Irvine Spectrum and focused on 
marketing high-tech equipment and offering computer production services such as 
desktop publishing and laser printing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company dabbled in various projects, such as creating a three-dimensional 
computer program that helped train U.S. Olympic wrestlers in 1992, and a 
service dubbed Creator Center, an editing laboratory that enabled film editors 
to create their own special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphix Zone focused on multimedia publishing in the past year, dedicating 
more than half of its 30 employees to creating interactive computer programs 
known as CD-ROMs, for compact disc, read-only memory. 
</P>
<P>
 It published a guide to using multimedia for beginners and, in June, began 
shipping an interactive music CD-ROM for the music star best known as Prince, 
who changed his name to a hybrid male-female symbol that has no translation in 
the English language. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc blends Prince trivia, four music videos, 52 songs and animation. It 
was made as part of a deal with media giant Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes much of its future revenue will come from such multimedia 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported net income of about $15,000 on revenue of $1.7 million 
for the 11 months ended June 30, 1993, compared with a loss of $457,765 on 
revenue of $1 million for the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had a short fiscal year since it changed its year-end from July 31 
to June 30. The company has roughly 2.5 million shares outstanding.

 Intel Seen Cutting Pentium Chip Prices: The company, seeking to keep rivals at 
bay, is expected to cut prices of its top-of-the-line Pentium chips as much as 
25% in the second half of the year. For consumers, that means lower prices on 
fancy personal computer systems in time for Christmas.Intel Corp.'s 
microprocessors are the brains inside an estimated 75% of the world's PCs. The 
cuts come as Intel seeks to present Pentium as the standard chip for PCs, 
aggressively cutting into the market of companies that make clones of Intel's 
previous-generation 486 chips. It's also trying to ward off competitive threats 
to Pentium from PowerPC, a chip developed jointly by Motorola Inc., 
International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. Some analysts 
said the cuts could be even deeper -- as much as 45%.

COURT STRIKES DOWN RULES FAVORING AT&T COMPETITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Friday struck down federal regulations that give 
long-distance phone companies competing with AT&T more freedom to set rates and 
arrange special deals with customers. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 5-3 vote, the court ruled against a Federal Communications Commission 
policy that allowed MCI and other long-distance companies -- but not American 
Telephone & Telegraph Co.-- to offer rates and services not specified in 
filings with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was designed to foster more competition for AT&T, which holds a 60% 
share of the nation's long-distance market. The policy has been in place for 
more than 10 years and is credited by some with fostering greater competition 
and innovation in interstate telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T had successfully challenged the policy in the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Antonin Scalia said the court has "considerable sympathy" for 
arguments by smaller long-distance companies that the costs of filing tariffs 
with the FCC can be prohibitive and that filing tariff rates can stifle price 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission does have some limited authority to change filing requirements 
or even waive them, Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what we have here goes well beyond that," he added. "It is effectively 
the introduction of a whole new regime of regulation . . . which may well be a 
better regime but is not the one that Congress established." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent that Friday's decision adopts a 
"rigid literalism that deprives the FCC of the flexibility Congress meant it to 
have."

QUAKER OATS STOCK BOILS OVER ON TAKEOVER TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quaker Oats Co., maker of popular products ranging from oatmeal to Gatorade, 
was rumored Friday to be a takeover target of Nestle, and the talk sent its 
stock to a 12-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares in the Chicago-based company closed $7.25 higher at $78.625 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 A Quaker Oats spokesman could not be reached for comment. Quaker Oats declined 
to comment on its stock activity, according to a statement from the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company stated that its policy is not to comment on unusual market 
activity or rumors," the exchange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Swiss food giant Nestle also could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist Dan Dorfman reported the rumors on CNBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quaker is often mentioned as a possible takeover target," said analyst Ellen 
Baras of credit agency Duff & Phelps Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole company is very well put together, so who knows," said Jack 
Maxwell, analyst with Wheat First Butcher & Singer. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not clear, however, is whether Nestle would be the likely buyer, said 
Joanna Scharf of S.G. Warburg Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems unlikely that Nestle would wish to invest in a U.S. cereal company, 
given its international cereal partnership with General Mills Inc.," Scharf 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership, Cereal Partners Worldwide, is marketing cereals in Europe and 
has begun to enter new markets, such as Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nestle is said to be cash-rich and seeking an acquisition after Gerber, 
the largest U.S. baby food maker, accepted a $3.7-billion bid from Sandoz, the 
Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal has spurred merger talk and subsequent stock run-ups within the food 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 An alliance with a large conglomerate such as Nestle could help Quaker Oats 
expand marketing of its Gatorade sports beverage, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gatorade has had trouble getting distribution they need in some markets," 
Baras said. The sports drink had sales of $750 million in the United States and 
Canada last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaker, which makes Cap'n Crunch cereal, is a small player in the 
$8-billion-a-year ready-to-eat cereal market, lagging leader Kellogg Co. and 
second-place General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Quaker dominates the hot-cereal market with its Quaker Oats oatmeal.  
</P>
<P>
 Its other well-known products include Rice A Roni and Aunt Jemima pancake mix.

 Consumer Sentiment Index Rises: The University of Michigan's preliminary 
consumer sentiment index for June rose to 94.5 from 92.8 in May, the highest 
reading since September, 1989, according to people with access to the 
survey.The rise in confidence "is telling me that the consumer sector will 
continue to grow in tandem with a growing economy," said Alan Levenson, a money 
market economist at UBS Securities. The index has a base of 100, set in 1966. 
When the monthly reading increases, consumers are becoming more optimistic 
about the economy. Since 1966, the record high for the sentiment index is 101, 
set in March, 1984. The record low is 51.7, set in April, 1980.

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; SHAKESPEARE THE MAN PLAYS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are among that very vocal group that thinks William Shakespeare did not 
write the plays, you might look in on Gregory Bell's "Alms for Oblivion," 
Shakespeare Orange County's opening production of its 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 It might change your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Written and performed by Bell, under Sherman Howard's crystal-clear direction, 
"Alms" is an introduction to the playwright himself, popping through a time 
warp to make it perfectly clear that: He is not uneducated; he is conversant 
with court figures and their shenanigans in London, and he is and always had 
been, from early youth, a poet. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admonishes us that his literary children should not be taken from him 
any more than the children of any proud parent should be. Even the illustrious 
Ben Jonson said the plays were his. So there. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's Shakespeare is very convincing, primarily because a ton of research has 
allowed him to create the full-blooded, rounded figure of a man, a playwright, 
a family man -- even though he strayed in several directions -- and a father 
who grieved because his wife, Anne, would not join him in London, where his 
work took him. 
</P>
<P>
 This Bard is a man of all time, at home wherever -- even on present-day Venice 
Beach (which he calls "lost Italy"). He stumbles on stage over an anachronistic 
metal folding chair and professes his amusement at such modern-day 
accouterments as sunglasses, hair tinted neon colors and shoes with wheels. But 
that's all only a conceit to draw the viewer with him back in time, to the 
cobbled streets of Elizabethan Stratford. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He explains how he fell head over heels in love with theater, wearing his 
first jerkin at age 5, watching the Queen's Players on tour. The stage was a 
lover he would never desert. And prepared for the relationship he was, by the 
drudgery of schoolboy Latin and history and by his insatiable curiosity. Bell's 
Will not only could, but probably did, write the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The first act is light, airy, gossipy and detailed with the many moments and 
moods that lead Shakespeare eventually to London and to the Globe Theatre. He 
is a raconteur, a wit, willing to poke his elbow at his listener to punctuate a 
joke or take a pratfall to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of the evening slowly develops into something darker. Here we 
find a portrait of the maturing Shakespeare, bemoaning the early death of his 
son Hamlet, finding his way through the labyrinthine political puzzle of royal 
politics into which his plays, particularly "Richard II," sometimes led him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's Shakespeare grows in size and develops a deep, ocher patina. At the 
end, he quotes Prospero from "The Tempest." Shakespeare is at the end of his 
own tempest; when Prospero speaks of breaking his magical staff, the poet 
breaks his quill pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Howard has given Bell an intricate framework for his insightful 
portrait, physically inventive, varied in tone and splashing joyfully over the 
playwright's life like a cascade of recalled incident and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, however Bell's variegated hues and delicate pirouettes of intellect, 
both in writing and performance, that give life to his creation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a Shakespeare as alive as his plays and sonnets, as much fun as a romp 
through the Forest of Arden, as full of truth and humanity as any character 
born through his pen.

CALL IN THE SPECIALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As dust motes float in the sunlight streaming through the warehouse window, 
the camera limns every glistening bead of sweat that rolls across Sylvester 
Stallone's straining pectorals. Here on the set of "The Specialist," the 
atmosphere is as thick as the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every shot," says producer Jerry Weintraub, "is like a videotape painting." 
</P>
<P>
 "Provocative," says director Luis Llosa. "We want this scene to be 
provocative." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Stallone is pumped. "Ten years ago I wouldn't have done this scene this 
way," says the shirtless star, toweling off after the sixth take and looking at 
a playback on a television monitor. "It's got a feminine quality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Director of photography Jeffrey L. Kimball likes this scene, too. In a movie 
about a lone-wolf explosives expert drawn into an obsessive plot to wreak 
vengeance on a family of Cuban mobsters, Stallone's workout-dance early in the 
story plays against a bass-heavy love-song soundtrack in which co-star Sharon 
Stone is heard talking about her lingerie. The scene is intended to establish a 
sensual, noir-ish feel that could distinguish "The Specialist" from the herd of 
action-adventure romps punctuated by fisticuffs and fireballs.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Stallone: "I'm using my body in a masculine-feminine thing. Is it karate 
or is it a sensuous workout? It's not just pumping iron, it's pumping irony." 
</P>
<P>
 All irony aside, Kimball is aware that such moody, back-lit set pieces can 
call so much attention to themselves that they overpower plot, character and 
even a star of Stallone's wattage. The phrase Kimball uses is "over the top." 
</P>
<P>
 "With a film like this, it's important to style it out, to present scenes in 
an exaggerated way without going over the top," says Kimball, 51, whose recent 
cinematography credits include "True Romance," "Curly Sue" and "Revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to convey a mood, a feeling, and still tell the story." 
</P>
<P>
 In the warehouse scene, the story lingers on the sensitive, reluctant hero 
being tempted out of retirement by a sexy voice on the phone. As Stallone 
stretches his sculpted body and furrows his brow in thought, we watch through 
the indoor haze, in the sunbeam cast by a xenon spotlight, next to the slowly 
turning window fan, on the other side of a furry cat hunched over a bowl of 
food.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gorgeous scene, photographed to make an impression," says Kimball. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it too much? 
</P>
<P>
 Kimball hopes not. "The look of the movie has got to be tasteful, which means 
what you don't see could be as important as what you do see," he says. "Miami 
is an energetic, vibrant city, filled with water and wonderful light. So I 
watch what nature is capable of, and try to mimic it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part, the technical part, is capturing that light, and making it 
last all day." 
</P>
<P>
 A Weintraub/Warner Bros. production with a budget of $40 million, "The 
Specialist" has Stone as Stallone's love interest, and also stars James Woods, 
Rod Steiger and Eric Roberts in what pre-production publicity describes as "a 
taut thriller of vengeance, obsession and betrayal set in Miami." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-winning composer John Barry ("Midnight Cowboy," "Dances With Wolves") is 
scoring the picture, and Emilio Estefan, husband of Gloria, is contributing 
some music. The film is scheduled for October release. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear the principals tell it, "The Specialist" is a risk for everyone 
involved. Weintraub, who produced the "Karate Kid" trilogy and "Oh, God!," says 
he's not known for action pictures. Peruvian-born director Llosa is hardly 
known at all; he's gripping the reins of his first big-budget American 
production. And Stallone, after larger-than-life incarnations as Rocky, Rambo 
and the Demolition Man, says that at age 47 he's about to reveal his softer 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 With all these reputations at stake, Kimball might seem like the perfect 
choice to record it all. "He's one of the top five cinematographers in the 
world," says Stallone, "a great artist totally unaffected by the Hollywood 
syndrome," meaning perhaps that Kimball seems more driven by the images he 
captures on film than by his image at a Malibu party. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub says he hired Kimball because "I wanted to use long lenses, and 
Jeffrey Kimball does that better than anyone else. He is not afraid to push the 
envelope, so we get shots we wouldn't normally get." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want that certain look," says Weintraub, "with the texture of the 
'Godfather' movies." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although a film's director of photography gets billing in the upper-third of 
the credits, the average moviegoer could no more name the person who shot "Top 
Gun" than he or she could identify the character Bob Hope played in the 1963 
classic "Call Me Bwana." (Answers: Jeffrey Kimball and Matt Merriwether). 
</P>
<P>
 Kimball, a tall, easy-going man with a mop of graying curly hair, knows that. 
But working downstage of big-name stars and directors does not lessen the 
seriousness he brings to his task. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director deals with the actors and the story, and my job is to fulfill 
the director's image and interpret it," says Kimball. "The key is to set up all 
the shots and light them." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Kimball has developed a style characterized by sharp visual 
contrasts, of color, light, even action and stillness. He is known for 
photographic extremes that can stray into excess. And he has gone over the top. 
In "Revenge," for example, at least one critic suggested that a dramatic 
dining-room table scene was lit with too many candles, distracting from the 
story line.  
</P>
<P>
 Of that same film, another critic, Roger Ebert, noted that co-star Madeleine 
Stowe was introduced with "a voyeuristic camera shot that starts at her ankles 
and climbs hand over hand up every wrinkle in her dress." As an effective 
establishing shot, Ebert liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most recent picture, 1993's "True Romance," which was directed by Tony 
Scott, Kimball was called on to record scenes that ranged from a dingy drug pad 
to an oceanfront setting. At times the images are horrifically violent; blood 
spurts, and walls get slimed by bullet-riddled bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout "True Romance," sunlight seems to be breaking in like an 
irrepressible dawn, lighting up faces, intensifying colors and casting shadows 
in surprising ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimball particularly likes the lighting in the scene between Christopher 
Walken, playing a cruel gangster, and Dennis Hopper, the hapless father who 
won't reveal his son's whereabouts. As the confrontation develops, Walken seems 
to grow darker in shadow and evil while rising sunlight illuminates Hopper's 
face in his final moments of courageousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The set for Stallone's dance scene was created inside an abandoned warehouse 
on the Miami River. Carpenters built a wooden deck for the workout and added an 
upstairs loft, which also serves as the living quarters of the character 
Stallone plays. 
</P>
<P>
 And when filming inside is finished, the entire warehouse is to be blown up, 
of course.  
</P>
<P>
 Born in Dallas, Kimball developed an interest in photography as a young boy 
after he won a camera by selling newspaper subscriptions. In high school, he 
says he apprenticed himself to a local photographer and began to experiment 
with Super-8 films. He studied filmmaking at North Texas State University and 
by the time he graduated in the mid-1960s had begun to look for work in 
commercials. His first break came with a series of Pepsi ads in the 1970s, and 
from there Kimball went on to make commercials for such clients as Coca-Cola, 
Marlboro, AT&T, Federal Express, Volvo, Estee Lauder and Seagrams (with Stone). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miami is currently enjoying a boom as a filmmaking center, and other 
major pictures, including the spring box-office hit "Ace Ventura: Pet 
Detective," have been shot here, no one film has ever captured the city's 
sunlight, clouds, pastel colors and Latin rhythm as well as the television 
series "Miami Vice." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimball takes that as a challenge. Scenes in "The Specialist" are set in 
trendy Art Deco South Beach, along the grimy Miami River, in Little Havana, 
outside a Spanish-style church in Coral Gables, in Coconut Grove and on the 
causeways over Biscayne Bay.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're working with the whole city here, and so as we go along, I am trying to 
keep open to the possibilities," he says. "Control of light is always the key, 
and because of that Miami is filled with opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the water. This may be the best place in the world to film scenes on the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected in a movie about an explosives expert lured out of 
retirement, the warehouse is not the only thing that will be dynamited in "The 
Specialist." Several scale-model sets as well as some expendable Miami 
buildings have already gone boom.  
</P>
<P>
 Scenes featuring explosions, of course, have to be captured in one take, and 
Kimball says failing to be prepared for the right shot "is a cinematographer's 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the warehouse goes up, Kimball will have at least eight cameras 
running, positioned just out of harm's way. "Clay Pinney, our special-effects 
coordinator, will tell us how high, how big the blast, and where it's safe," he 
says. "I love these action sequences because they are not so dependent on great 
light. When the whole screen is exploding, no one worries about the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this movie is going to be visually striking. But movie-making is such 
a collaborative effort that it's a wonder anyone ever makes a great movie. In 
the middle of it all, I can't really tell if the movie will be poor, good or 
great. All I can do is what I want and satisfy myself and the director."

BOYZ HIP-HOP TO L.A. BIG TIME; RADIO: KPWR DEEJAYS NICK AND ERIC VIDAL ARE 
STRAIGHT OUTTA BAKERSFIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The strains of the sitcom theme song are familiar but hard to place. Then the 
listener is assaulted by two loud, slightly off-key voices singing their own 
rather sophomoric lyrics. The tune turns out to be the "Sanford and Son" 
opening theme, and the lyrics are what two young brothers might come up with if 
they were clowning around at home in front of the TV set: "It's the Baka/It's 
the Baka Boyz/In the Morning/In the Morning/It's the Baka Boyz/And we're gonna 
wake your ass right up/Because we're two fat Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be misled by the self-deprecation. The Baka Boyz -- a.k.a. brothers 
Nick and Eric Vidal -- have defied the odds in Los Angeles radio. Barely into 
their 20s, with only a few months experience in a big-city market and not much 
more in a small market, they've somehow managed to wangle a gig presiding over 
the airwaves from 6-10 a.m. at KPWR-FM (105.9), the most popular 
English-language station in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 And the audience seems to be responding. In the four months they've been on 
the morning shift, the show's ratings have climbed from 13th place to sixth, 
just one-tenth of a point behind the well-established "Mark and Brian Show" on 
KLOS-FM (95.5), according to Arbitron "trend tabulations." (The more reliable 
quarterly ratings won't be out until next month.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a couple of guys who only last year were toiling next to nowhere 
-- at KKXX-FM, a small station in their hometown, Bakersfield (hence the name 
Baka Boyz). They'd been there for all of a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't try to consider it a big come-up because we figure whatever comes up 
must go down," said Nick Vidal, 21. "That's what I like to keep in my mind."  
</P>
<P>
 Eric, 24, spins off his brother's comments, as is his style: "You can never 
think you're too big. We try to stay humble. We don't ever want to feel like we 
made it. We don't want to lose sight of being small-town." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other popular morning shows, "Baka Boyz" is not talk-heavy. The 
Vidals play a lot of music, filling the time between cuts with light banter, 
clowning, listener calls and their own singing and rapping -- skills they've 
been honing since junior high school, when they began working as deejays at 
parties, clubs and weddings. It's a hip-hopping, spontaneous style that is 
completely unlike anything else on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people that have been doing this for years and years, and they wake 
up at 3 in the morning and prepare," Nick Vidal said. "They have a staff of 
five writers. That's Old School radio. That don't work no more. We come in at 
5:56 and go on the air. We talk about everyday things. That's what people like. 
We're not fake. We don't have nothin' written for us. We come in, be ourselves, 
introduce records and entertain people the way we know how." 
</P>
<P>
 One of their features is what they call a "rap roll call," an interactive rap 
tune with listeners. They sound as good as the rap stars whose records they 
play -- sometimes better. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Mr. Roll Call/Who's on the line?/That sounds cool and that may be/But 
where you calling from, baby?/What ci-ty?," they rap as callers offer names, 
city and a short message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say we're rappers," Nick explained off the air. "I'd say we're 
rythmically inclined." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a few years ago they invested in some pricey record producing 
equipment and, through record company contacts in Los Angeles, produced cuts 
for the likes of Kid Frost, House of Paint and Cypress Hill -- and continue to 
do so. Their original thought had been to find a night radio job and produce 
records during the day, but "our vision has flip-flopped now," Nick said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the show they scarf down a veritable smorgasbord of junk food -- 
potato chips, Twinkies, Snickers bars, Cokes and high-cholesterol McDonald's 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Their diet has produced a kind of kiddy corpulence that seems out of place in 
KPWR's lean, high-tech corporate environment. Eric is the more serious brother. 
Baseball cap turned backward, mustache bristling, he tries to look menacing but 
really succeeds in looking shyly sweet. Nick is younger, plumper, more 
ebullient. With an engaging charm, he is often the spokesman for the two, 
talking a mile a minute. They live together in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance encounter in February, 1993, that led to their KPWR gig. The 
brothers were hanging out listening to mariachi music with a friend from a 
record company when they met KPWR disc jockey Dave Morales. Over dinner and 
succeeding rounds of drinks, Nick Vidal talked about wanting to work the 
airwaves in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The station happened to be looking for somebody to host a hip-hop show and 
Morales suggested they apply. So the pair passed a tape along to program 
director Rick Cummings, who liked what he heard and hired them in March, 1993, 
for a Friday night show. When longtime morning host Jay Thomas was fired in 
May, 1993, the Vidals and several other KPWR deejays got a shot at trying out 
for the high-profile weekday job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings said he chose the brothers because of their feel for the music and 
their high-energy, streetwise style. "They totally get rap music, they totally 
get hip-hop," Cummings said. "But they don't feel this compulsion to be 
hard-core gang rappers. These guys are positive. They're fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It also helped that they are more like KPWR's listeners than was the white, 
40-ish Thomas. The majority of the audience is Latino and falls between ages 18 
and 34. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually (fall into the target audience)," said Nick. "But we understand 
we have to appeal to the masses, not just 1,000 homeboys in East L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 One would be hard-pressed to find another brotherly duo hosting a 
morning-drive-time radio show in any major market, let alone at one of the 
country's most popular radio stations. But the Baka Boyz take it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main goal is to take care of my parents," said Eric Vidal. "To pay back 
what they did for us. They believed in us, they always supported us. They never 
said, 'You'll never amount to nothing.' I'll never be able to pay them back no 
matter how much I make." 
</P>
<P>
 With guileless excitement, the pair proudly report that they are moving their 
mother from Bakersfield to their Hollywood Hills digs, eagerly anticipating the 
delicacies she'll be cooking for them. "I will gain weight," Eric promised. 
(Their father, who has been working out of town, will be moving to the Los 
Angeles area soon to join them.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We live together, we're brothers and we work together," Nick said. "For the 
most part, business is always first for us. It makes it more efficient because 
we can talk about things. We don't have to sit down and have a meeting. (But) 
we fight like brothers. I don't think business partners could fight like we 
do."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LEON REDBONE SHOW: AN EXERCISE IN TOTAL RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world of Leon Redbone is a place filled with tunes that, as the Beatles 
once put it, were hits before your mother was born and where the band looks 
like something out of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Redbone's 70-minute nostalgic excursion Thursday at the Coach House reflected 
quieter, if not necessarily simpler, times. The singer-guitarist could have 
made the evening a bit timely by sticking to and plugging his current 
"Whistling in the Wind" album of oldies and original period pieces. Yet he only 
pulled a handful of numbers from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, it was business as usual as he strummed, warbled and mugged his way 
through the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a versatile four-piece band, Redbone seemed in a blue mood, focusing 
on tales of love gone sour and heartbreak while keeping his usual between-tune 
high jinks to a minimum. He jumped into one blues number with a gruff, 
Delta-like delivery before soothing the sound with his accustomed mellow croon. 
</P>
<P>
 His enunciation, smeared as if mumbled through a mouthful of marshmallow, made 
bits and pieces of lyrics hard to follow. That technique worked just fine on 
such familiar pieces as "Love Letters in the Sand" and "Ain't Misbehavin'." But 
on less familiar tunes, such as Irving Berlin's 1914 ballad "When It's Night 
Time in Dixie," the lack of clarity kept those of us too young to remember the 
original from understanding the all-important lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 Redbone's band gave the evening strong Dixieland flavors. Cornetist Peter 
Ecklund, employing a variety of mutes, used every opportunity to swing, and 
Redbone sometimes helped facilitate this by jumping up the tempo when it was 
the cornet's turn to solo. Bob Gordon's clarinet, by contrast, worked best in 
response, answering the brass calls or crying along with the vocalist in fine 
Bourbon Street style. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility player was Vince Giordano, plucking away on upright bass, huffing 
up a storm on sousaphone or booming on the gigantic bass saxophone. Also 
showing many talents was drummer John Gill, who kept time on a snare cymbal 
setup, added slide antics on trombone and did a little strumming himself. In 
addition, he endured the blunt of Redbone's between-tune, vaudeville-inspired 
banter. 
</P>
<P>
 Heard the one about the girl Redbone met in an alley? "She said she'd do 
anything I wanted for $50." 
</P>
<P>
 Gill: "So what'd ya do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Redbone: "She's over paintin' my house right now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this silly bit, Redbone pretty much stuck to business, though his 
familiar routines -- snapping photos of the crowd with a Polaroid, sipping 
daintily from a pint glass -- were there to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, he used the glass for a little slide guitar and a discourse on Don 
Ho: "I like Don Ho . . . he's very relaxed." But he didn't take the opportunity 
to perform the Hawaiian lament "My Little Grass Shack," as he does on the new 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished up with what have become signature tunes for him, "Up a Lazy 
River" and "Diddy Wah Diddy," before coming out to encore with the 
announcement, "It just so happens that I know one more tune." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the only disappointment with a Redbone show. With the hundreds of 
tunes in his repertoire, you can't help but feel cheated when he doesn't do 
your personal favorite (in our case, "Bouquet of Roses" from the new album). 
Then, after an hour's escapism, he turns you back to the real world.

THEATER REVIEW; GENDER-BENT 'PERVERSITY': DATE LIVES IN INFAMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Mamet, who has carved out a career as playwright/warcorrespondent in the 
ongoing battle between the sexes, first made his mark with the 1976 "Sexual 
Perversity in Chicago," a short one-act about two men and two women in a highly 
charged and venomous dating scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The war has been good business for the Fritz Theatre, which has been running 
the show as a 10 p.m. offering Friday and Saturday nights since April 10, 1992, 
with occasional forays into the 8 p.m. slot. In September, to mix things up a 
bit, artistic director Duane Daniels put a fresh spin on the story by casting 
women in the men's roles and men in the women's roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes proved provocative and challenging -- definitely low-tech -- but 
well worth catching as the second half of a double feature after an 8 p.m. show 
or even as an unusual post-dinner date (if you want to make sure you're not 
going to run out of things to talk about). 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want a double dose of Mamet, you can catch "Perversity" after 
"Oleanna" at the Old Globe. ("Oleanna" continues through June 26.) Not only 
would doing so satisfy any Mamet-mania, but it would give insight into just why 
the vengeful female lead in "Oleanna," written last year, was so absolutely 
unappeasable. 
</P>
<P>
 Though keep in mind if you mix "Oleanna" with "Perversity," it's a 
doubleheader that can push even seasoned theatergoers into culture shock. After 
all, the Globe experience is about theater that fills the senses, impeccable 
acting talent in a beautifully appointed 600-plus seat venue, with set, 
lighting and costume designs that interweave their own sensory stories with the 
written one. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 80-seat Fritz, the production is uneven, the performers young and of 
mixed talents, the sets composed of four white plastic chairs; a big costume 
change consists of putting on sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet for those who see theater as an adventure and the script as 
everything, it's a theatrical trip with unexpected rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 While Daniels is the credited director on the piece, assistant director 
Beverly Delventhal, who has had the unique distinction of playing all the parts 
at various times in this production, is responsible for directing this 
particular cast, young actors all: Debbi Ayers as the hardened macho male 
Bernie Litko; Mara Holguin as his uncertain disciple, Danny Shapiro; Justin 
Brinsfield as the girl that Danny falls for, and Kevin Six as Deborah's 
suspicious roommate, Joan Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plot in this 57-minute show is simple. Boy (Danny) meets girl (Deborah). 
Boy gets girl. Friend (Bernie) talks boy out of girl. Friend (Joan) talks girl 
out of boy. Now alone and stripped of any faith in love, boy and girl seemed 
destined to become clones of their caustic friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fritz's gender switching, however, is a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
 At times it seems to nullify the very point of the play. But at its best it 
flips sexist remarks by Mamet's men into comic absurdity by having the lewd 
remarks about the women's anatomy come out of the mouths of actresses. At those 
times, it refracts the meaning, injecting sexual stereotypes into a Looking 
Glass world where strange truths are revealed.  
</P>
<P>
 Watching Ayers and Holguin swagger and strut like men while Brinsfield and Six 
exude tragic vulnerability and repressed anger puts a new spin on the 
assumptions loaded onto male/female relationships over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this challenging framework, the Fritz delivers a competent, though 
hardly definitive production.  
</P>
<P>
 Ayers is the best of the ensemble, conveying Bernie as a heartless, but darkly 
funny sex-driven soul. But Holguin's vulnerability as Danny still seems too 
feminine in nature and ultimate conversion to cynicism less than completely 
convincing.  
</P>
<P>
 Brinsfield, while towering over Holguin, manages to hit the classic feminine 
reactions without making fun of them. And Six gets the repression down but with 
far too much chill. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On July 24, as a special benefit for the Fritz, all the 30-plus actors who 
have ever been in the show here are scheduled to take part in a performance of 
"Sexual Perversity in Chicago." Sounds crowded, sure, but different enough to 
be right at home at the Fritz.

place where his Top 10 list originates. City officials renamed their abandoned 
and crumbling City Hall building the Home Office, complete with a sign and 
reserved parking space for Letterman. Local companies sent him everything from 
jeans to honey. "We've made David Letterman," said City Manager Hank Sinda.

 Back Again: Expected next week, 25 years after it was a minor hit for Michael 
Jackson and his brothers, is a re-release of "Big Boy," the long-lost song that 
marked Michael Jackson's recording debut. Ben Brown, the owner of Steeltown 
Records, for which the Jacksons recorded several songs before becoming 
superstars for Motown, said he recently uncovered the original tapes for "Big 
Boy" in the pantry of his kitchen. Brown, who has re-mastered the song, said 
Jackson was about 9 years old when the song was recorded, although he was about 
10 when it was released in 1968. THE ARTS

four-concert engagement at Wembley Arena, outside London, in April. The singer 
also donated $25,000 each for musical education to schools in each of the areas 
where she performed, including Spurgeon Intermediate School in Santa Ana and 
her Brooklyn high school, Erasmus Hall High. (Streisand's label, Sony Music, 
matched each school donation.) The additional monies went to 25 charities that 
were allowed to sell $1,000 tickets to Streisand's concerts and keep $650 from 
each sale, he said. ART

ANGELS SUBDUED AFTER BIG RALLY; BASEBALL: O.J. SIMPSON SAGA PUTS TEAM IN SOBER 
MOOD AFTER DRAMATIC 5-3 VICTORY OVER WHITE SOX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels barely took the time to shake hands on the field Friday, quickly 
retreating to the clubhouse after their dramatic 5-3 victory over the Chicago 
White Sox at Comiskey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They turned on the TV sets, pulled up their chairs and sat in near silence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if it hardly mattered that they scored five runs in the ninth inning 
off closer Roberto Hernandez, capped by Chili Davis' two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if it was insignificant winning two consecutive games for the first 
time since May 26-27, enabling them to pull within 3 1/2 games of the 
first-place Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but just like the rest of the country, the Angels were mesmerized, 
watching the O.J. Simpson saga unfold on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes your day kind of depressing," Davis said. "Winning a ballgame is 
great, but we're talking about a man's life here. I've always been an O.J. 
Simpson fan, and I still am." 
</P>
<P>
 Said third baseman Spike Owen: "Baseball is very important to all of us, but a 
situation like this is really sad. It's a tragedy. I was one of those guys that 
was hoping it was all wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, say it isn't so." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Manager Marcel Lachemann kept watching a small TV on the right corner of 
his desk while talking about his team's comeback. He never had been introduced 
to Simpson, but he also attended USC, and several times said hello while 
passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk about the game," Lachemann said, "but it's tough. I mean, his life 
is over for all intents and purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (29-29) probably will begin to realize the significance of their 
comeback victory sometime today. Only once in 35 times this season have they 
won when trailing after eight innings. This night, they simply took advantage 
of Hernandez's wildness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who had failed to reach third base since the first inning, began 
their comeback with Chad Curtis' leadoff double against starter Wilson Alvarez. 
First baseman J.T. Snow and Mark Dalesandro then received back-to-back walks, 
loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox Manager Gene Lamont summoned Hernandez, much to the chagrin of the 
33,210 fans. Although Hernandez saved 38 games last season, he had blown two 
save opportunities already this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, well-aware of Hernandez's problems, told his team to lay off 
pitches. Make him throw strikes, and let him beat himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds immediately heeded the advice and walked on five pitches, forcing 
in a run. Spike Owen followed with a one-hopper toward the mound. The ball 
caromed off Hernandez's glove, and everyone was safe, with Snow scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Damion Easley, just activated Friday from the disabled list, made the first 
out with a shallow ball to right. Hernandez, however, then fell behind to Tim 
Salmon, and walked him, forcing in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, with the crowd loudly booing, followed up by yielding a two-run 
single to Davis. The Angels had a 5-3 lead, and Hernandez (1-3), a former Angel 
farmhand, was again looking for answers. It was Hernandez's third consecutive 
blown save, and fourth in 11 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to go back to the way I did things before all this madness," 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one was more elated with the White Sox's collapse than Angel 
starter Brian Anderson (5-1), who reaped the victory without pitching another 
inning. He yielded nine hits and three earned runs in eight innings while Bob 
Patterson obtained his first save in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you the truth, this is the best I've felt since college," Anderson 
said. "Win or lose, my arm hasn't felt like this since the Arizona game in 
college. It was nice to end this way on a bizarre night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, when the game ended, guys said, 'Oh yeah, nice job Andy, now let's 
got watch O.J.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the wildest thing I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 So fascinated by the turn of events, the Angels refused to even leave the 
clubhouse after the game until the local newscast was complete. They walked 
out, hearing the words, 'O.J. Simpson has surrendered.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll celebrate this victory," Davis said, "but now is not the time 
or place."

 Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois is a political pro, but he's definitely a soccer 
novice. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking last Wednesday at the opening session of the 49th Congress of FIFA, 
soccer's world governing body, Edgar addressed the head of the American 
organizing committee for the World Cup, Alan Rothenberg, as Alan Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar also welcomed the delegates on behalf of "the 11 1/2 people of 
Illinois." The state has about 11 1/2 million residents.

 Finally separated: Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson have split up their

agreement with Nike, a rival shoe company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got so associated with the Dan and Dave thing, it drove me crazy," O'Brien 
said. "People thought we were joined at the hip, and that we did everything 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? Emmitt Smith, Dallas Cowboy running back, on owner Jerry Jones: 
"We know he's not really fair to everybody. You don't expect everybody to be 
treated fairly, but you expect everybody to be treated decently, at least with 
some kind of respect."

 Bird crisis: Attention white pigeons: Head directly to Atlanta. You are needed 
there. Olympic officials want thousands of white homing pigeons to be released 
during the opening ceremony for the 1996 Games, but there are only a few 
hundred of them in the Atlanta area. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Cockrum, an Atlanta pigeon breeder, says it takes less than a month to 
produce a bird, but the training requires much more time.

 New York, New York: Bob Verdi in the Chicago Tribune: "Sports Illustrated, 
with its think tank a short walk from Madison Square Garden, is slobbering all 
over the New York teams.

 "I don't know what they'll do at SI if both the Knicks and Rangers win, but 
don't look for an expose on 'Is Badminton Dying?' More than likely, an Anthony 
Mason swimsuit issue."

 So there: Mario Lemieux of the NHL Pittsburgh Penguins, protesting the "clutch 
and grab" tactics against him:

 "From now on, I'm not going to get involved in anything with the league or do 
any promotions or any of the stuff. They can promote the marginal players if

 Malone, 39, was waived Friday.

<P>
 He had been acquired as a free agent last August to serve as a backup and 
mentor to the 76ers' $44-million draft pick, Shawn Bradley. Malone averaged 5.3 
points, 4.1 rebounds and 11.2 minutes a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 His numbers were a lot more impressive in his previous stint with 
Philadelphia. He played there from 1982-86, leading the 76ers to the NBA 
championship in 1983. Malone, a three-time most valuable player, also has 
played for Buffalo, Houston, Washington, Atlanta and Milwaukee in 18 pro 
seasons, the second-longest career in the league's history behind Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar's, which lasted 20 seasons.

 GROUP A 
</P>
<P>
 at Silverdome, Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland vs. United States 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 8:30 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ABC, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: This could be a game in which the teams' strengths and 
weaknesses cancel each other.Switzerland's strength is up front, with striker 
Stephane Chapuisat and forward Adrian Knup. The U.S. team also has most of its 
experience and skill up front. If the American forwards have to spend their 
energy dropping back to help out on defense, it could be a long, scoreless day 
for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans have done well winning balls in the air. This, plus their 
fitness, should be an advantage, especially late in the game. Older, slow Swiss 
defenders can be defeated by U.S. quickness, but, so, too, might the Swiss 
forwards' ballhandling skills befuddle the U.S. back line.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic has shown a willingness to play with as many 
defenders as necessary. If Switzerland scores early, look for a traffic jam of 
U.S. players in front of their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: With three points for a victory, the Americans can reasonably hope 
to get beyond the first round. The Swiss are not a complete team, but they do 
well with what they have and finished only one point behind Italy in 
qualifying. The U.S. team has shown resilience, a trait it has cultivated while 
falling behind in most games. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Considering that the United States will finally be playing before a 
supportive home crowd, and that the heat and humidity will hurt the Swiss more 
than the Americans, and that the U.S. team appears to be peaking: United States 
by one goal. JULIE CART

 Colombia vs. Romania 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:30 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Colombia has been picked by Pele as the favorite in the 
tournament and plays a wide-open style that was favored by Brazil during Pele's 
era.The game will turn on how well Romanian defenders handle the multifaceted 
Colombian offense with the best playmaker in the world, Carlos Valderrama, 
trying to set up forward Faustino Asprilla and midfielder Freddy Rincon. 
Romania could be hurt by its overdependence on spectacular midfielder Gheorghe 
Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Unlike the other venues, the weather in Pasadena is not expected to 
have an impact on the game. The game will start late in the afternoon and the 
weather service is predicting temperatures around 65-68 degrees under partly 
cloudy skies. It could be an explosive match. Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu 
said he expects to reach the semifinals. Said Colombian Coach Francisco 
Maturana: "I think we have the technical ability and mind set to make it to the 
finals." 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Colombia, 2-1. And maybe if the crowd is lucky -- at least one 
cartwheel by Asprilla, a personal tradition after he scores. LISA DILLMAN

 First, there was the Cotton Bowl Fence controversy, which begat the Cotton 
Bowl Fence II controversy.Here's a watered-down version: 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas World Cup organizers were persuaded to take down a security fence 
around the stadium because international soccer officials believed it was 
unbecoming of a Cup facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But while taking down the fence on a 95-degree day earlier this week, workers 
were reprimanded for drinking Ozarka water, radio station KSCS-FM reported. 
Organizers told the workers to stop drinking the water because it was not the 
official bottled water of the World Cup. ELLIOTT ALMOND

 Johnny Oates said that rumors of his dismissal as manager of the Baltimore 
Orioles have not altered his approach to the job, and he lashed out at the 
media for depicting him as a nervous leader struggling to hang onto his post. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, owner Peter Angelos said Oates' job was not immediately in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles are two games out of first place in the American League East. But 
Angelos has expressed displeasure with the team's performance, and a newspaper 
article Friday quoted Angelos as saying Oates was "obstinate . . . not a very 
good manager." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep being the same manager that I've always been," Oates said. 
"I'm not going to change my style of managing just because someone thinks I 
should. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good enough to get me here. If it's not good enough to keep me here, 
I'm not going to make any sacrifices. I'm no different than I was last year."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BLAUSER RESCUES BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, is hitting home runs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone except Jeff Blauser. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta shortstop, who hit 15 home runs last season, connected for only 
the second time this season in the bottom of the ninth inning Friday night at 
Atlanta, rallying the Braves to a 6-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves' fourth consecutive victory was the 1,000th for Manager Bobby Cox, 
who is 1,000-883, a .531 winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 The homer capped a four-hit game for Blauser, who was nonetheless perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange. I had an awful day in the batting cage . . . . Then I hit the 
ball hard four times," he said. "I can't figure this game out and I'm about to 
quit trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Blauser was delighted to provide Cox with his milestone win. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a heck of a milestone getting up there with guys like Sparky 
(Anderson), (Tony) La Russa and (Tommy) Lasorda " Blauser said. "Bobby's one of 
the elite managers in the game and this just reinforces that." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's Greg Maddux (11-2) became the majors' first 11-game winner. He 
struck out eight and walked none. Jeff Brantley (4-3) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was the first between the Braves and Reds since the May 29 trade that 
sent Roberto Kelly to Atlanta for Deion Sanders. Kelly had two doubles, drove 
in a run and scored twice. Sanders went two for five with a stolen base and 
scored a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 10, Montreal 8 -- In a game of big hits, Mariano Duncan's was one 
of the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan tripled in the tying run and scored the go-ahead run on Pete 
Incaviglia's single in the eighth inning at Montreal as the Phillies rallied 
for six runs to beat the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies beat John Wetteland (2-4) to snap Montreal's three-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Quantrill (2-0), acquired May 31 from Boston, pitched two innings for the 
victory. Doug Jones got his National League-leading 18th save. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 6, Chicago 1 -- Bill Swift gave up eight hits at San Francisco 
but was bailed out by three double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift (8-4) won his fifth game in six decisions, beating Jim Bullinger (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Royce Clayton went three for four and scored twice for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the Giants' second victory in their last 11 games at Candlestick 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 7, St. Louis 4 -- Rookie Jon Lieber (3-2) pitched eight effective 
innings and Al Martin went four for five at St. Louis. Hot-hitting Pittsburgh 
had 16 hits off five St. Louis pitchers and has had more than 10 hits in six of 
its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury (8-6) lost his fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 3, Houston 2 -- First baseman Eddie Williams hit his first major 
league homer in nearly four years at San Diego and Bip Roberts went two for 
four to extend his hitting streak to 20 games, longest in the NL this year, as 
the Padres snapped the Astros' three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Benes (5-9) broke a personal four-game losing streak to the Astros and 
won his third consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Swindell (5-4) lost his third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, New York 5 -- Greg Colbrunn hit a three-run homer at Miami after an 
intentional walk and Kurt Abbott homered for the fourth consecutive game to 
help the Marlins win their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Weathers (7-5) beat Pete Smith (3-7).

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their second year, with the new three-division format and with the San 
Francisco Giants struggling, are the Colorado Rockies ready to compete with the 
Dodgers at the top of the National League West? 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Don Baylor, whose Rockies trail the Dodgers by four games after 
Friday's victory, isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consistency is what it takes to be in every pennant race," Baylor said. 
"We've improved our defense, our hitting's probably about the same as last 
year, but we're still near last in pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be at least somewhere in the middle of the pack or in the upper 
echelon of pitching -- that's where your consistency is. If we're giving up 
five runs a game, that means we have to score six." 
</P>

 Cory Snyder, not known for his leaping ability, saved two runs in the first 
inning Friday, jumping high to grab a deep shot by Charlie Hayes that was 
heading well over the left-field fence when Snyder brought it back for the 
third out with Andres Galarraga on first base. TIM KAWAKAMI

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GRIFFEY EQUALS RUTH WITH NO. 30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 30th homer of the season Friday night, Edgar Martinez 
added a three-run shot and Dave Fleming ended a personal five-game losing 
streak as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Kansas City Royals, 5-1, at Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's homer enabled him to match Babe Ruth's mark for most home runs 
before June 30. Ruth hit 30 by that date in both 1928 and 1930, finishing with 
54 in 1928 and 49 two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's goal is the all-time single-season home run mark of 61 set by Roger 
Maris in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Fleming (4-9) gave up only four hits over six innings in outpitching 
David Cone (10-3) and winning for the first time since May 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's homer was a towering 428-foot blast into the upper level of the 
fountain in right-center field in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 8, New York 1 -- The struggling Yankees dropped a little lower at 
New York. And their top hitter, Paul O'Neill, fell lower than he has been all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they still lead Baltimore by two games in the American League East, 
the Yankees are 5-11 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, hitless in four at-bats, dropped to .397, the first time his average 
has been below .400. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Nilsson hit a grand slam for Milwaukee, but pitcher Cal Eldred (7-7) was 
the main star. He pitched a three-hitter, his third complete game in 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsson's first career grand slam came in a five-run fifth in which losing 
pitcher Scott Kamieniecki (4-3) walked three batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 8, Boston 1 -- The Indians say they have known since spring training 
what the rest of the world is discovering now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't joking. We're really serious about winning this division," Dennis 
Martinez said at Cleveland after the Indians beat the Red Sox to tie a 
43-year-old franchise record with their 16th consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' streak at Jacobs Field is the longest in the majors since Boston 
won a record 24 in a row at Fenway Park in 1988. Cleveland won 16 in a row at 
Cleveland Stadium in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, winners of seven in a row overall, took over the best record in 
the American League (38-25), a half-game better than the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox dropped their ninth in a row -- their first nine-game skid since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is 5-4, but the Indians are 6-1 in his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 After his teammates gave him a big lead Friday, he wasted little time 
finishing off the Red Sox. Of the 38 pitches he threw in his final four 
innings, 35 were strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have that kind of lead, you have to go right after the hitters and 
make them swing the bat," Martinez said. "But I still used all my pitches. I 
had to keep my game plan, keep them off balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 9, Minnesota 2 -- Ben McDonald earned his 10th victory as the 
Orioles ended seven-game winning streaks by the Twins and pitcher Kevin Tapani 
at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald (10-4) pitched an eight-hitter, striking out five and walking none. 
The Orioles broke the game open by sending 11 men to the plate in a five-run 
fifth inning that gave them a 7-0 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Tapani (8-3) had not lost since April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 4, Texas 2 -- Stan Javier homered twice and drove in three runs at 
Arlington, Tex., lifting the Athletics to their sixth victory in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first two-homer game of Javier's career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers lost for the sixth time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland pitcher Todd Van Poppel (3-5), an Arlington native, was making his 
second appearance in his hometown. The loser was Hector Fajardo (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, Detroit 4 -- Paul Molitor had three hits at Detroit, including a 
three-run homer, to help the Blue Jays end a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, playing before a crowd of 36,210 -- their largest since opening 
day -- lost their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stewart (5-5) beat reliever Mike Gardiner (2-1).

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; KNICKS NEED TO RING UP ONE MORE FOR RILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All those nights watching the New York Knicks smash backboards with their jump 
shots. All those nights wondering if he would have to bail John Starks or 
Anthony Mason or Greg Anthony out of some jail. 
</P>
<P>
 After a journey that would have made Odysseus think twice, the Knicks are a 
victory away from an NBA title, a remarkable development that has less to do 
with the heart and soul they advertise so proudly than the sheer will of one 
man who is, of course: 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night's 91-84 victory over the Houston Rockets put them up, 3-2. 
Sunday's game will not only be their big chance but their 24th playoff game 
this spring, tying the record for the longest postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 The record belongs to the '88 Lakers coached by -- who else? -- Riley, who had 
to go seven games with the Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks and Detroit Pistons to 
win the back-to-back title he had guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that that one didn't take its toll on all of them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Lakers went down, 2-1, to the Jazz, Riley benched Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and James Worthy at the end of Game 3, then vowed 
the next day to keep them sitting if they didn't want to play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next series, Riley decided he couldn't stand the sight of Mark Aguirre 
schmoozing with his buddy, Johnson, in the Laker locker room any more and 
stationed his publicist, Josh Rosenfeld, at the door to keep Aguirre out. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pistons' Isiah Thomas sprained an ankle while scoring 42 points in a 
Game 6 loss in the finals, the Raiders let him use their facility for 
treatment. Before Game 7, a Raider official wished Riley's wife, Chris, good 
luck. Chris said the Raiders had undermined her husband's chances and told the 
official to get away from her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say that '88 title was Pat's championship," says his old Laker 
assistant, Bill Bertka. "He would not let them lose. He would not let them 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Those days, Riley had Kareem, Magic and Big Game James. Now he has Patrick 
Ewing, John Starks and Charles Oakley. Believe this: It's not the same. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment this series started -- with the Rockets coming off an 
eight-day break and the Knicks a seven-game series against the Indiana Pacers 
-- Riley was all over his players' heads, refusing to entertain the notion they 
would be tired, ordering them to start making their shots, letting them know 
there would be none of that "good learning experience" stuff if they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a season of injuries, cold spells, disappointments and tabloid hell, 
Riley held them together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking about that before the game," Riley said after Friday's game. 
"It seems like we've been out there forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out at midnight Oct. 6. We wanted to be the first team to hit the 
floor in '93 and hopefully, the last team to leave in '94. Right now we're on 
the brink of what they've been dreaming about." 
</P>
<P>
 They might have dreamed about it, but before he took over, they had no idea 
how soon it could happen and how much it would take. They found out, even if it 
almost finished them off. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, in an uncharacteristic burst of detachment, said a couple of days ago 
he was eager to see his players win one, for all it would mean for them and do 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But he, himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not gonna change me," Riley said. "I'll be happy if we win it, but 
another ring or whatever else comes from it is not going to change me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, in the beginning it was wonderful. It was a different feeling the 
first time I won it. It was just like these guys feel right now and how 
desperate they all are to get that." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, the insatiable, sated? You know how hard this season had to be if the 
man who never gives an inch sounds like he's wondering if it's worth it any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll worry about that in a week. Between now and then waits his destiny. 
Besides, he has been stuck on four since '88 and still needs one for the thumb.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; AFTER THE FALL, SHOW GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Down went Oprah and so did Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same stadium where Gene Tunney once got knocked off his feet and stayed 
that way for a very long count, then got up to win a famous heavyweight fight 
with Jack Dempsey, the world's greatest football tournament kicked off Friday 
with some pretty sloppy footing. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening-act Oprah Winfrey, mistress of ceremonies for the World Cup '94 soccer 
pageant, lost her balance and fell on stage after introducing singer Diana 
Ross. More embarrassed than hurt by her pratfall, Winfrey went on with the 
show, welcoming an estimated 750 million TV viewers worldwide and a Soldier 
Field audience that included numerous dignitaries, among them President Clinton 
and popular Times sportswriter Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton in turn made a snappy speech welcoming two fellow chief executives and 
soccer buffs, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia and Helmut Kohl of Germany, 
saying, "I say especially to President Sanchez and the people of Bolivia, buena 
suerte today. And to Chancellor Kohl and the people of Deutschland, viel gluck. 
Good luck to you all and welcome to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 And viel gluck to you all too Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't quite "Ich bin ein Berliner," but it'll do. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this gluck obviously rubbed off on the gutty little Bolivians, who 
kept favored Germany scoreless for a full 60 minutes, or two-thirds of a game. 
Soccer's reigning champions won, though, 1-0, when Juergen Klinsmann scored 
into a goal as wide and inviting as a tunnel painted onto a mountain by Wile E. 
Coyote to halt the Roadrunner. 
</P>
<P>
 With an impetuosity he would regret, the goalkeeper for Bolivia, one Carlos 
Leonel Trucco, wandered much, much too far from his assigned post. In his 
haste, Trucco slipped on the Soldier Field sod as though on the peel of a 
Bolivian-grown banana. Splat, he went. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinsmann could have pushed the ball into the goal with his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Final score, one to nil, as the Europeans say, with the only goal going to the 
dashing young Klinsmann, the man who during the '90 World Cup drove to all of 
his team's practices in a '67 Volkswagen Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling conditions "very brutal, very hot" and complaining that the 
battlefield of Soldier Field was wet and slippery, Klinsmann nonetheless 
praised the host city and host country for a good beginning to these World Cup 
festivities, implying that he enjoyed himself even more than he had at that 
Chicago White Sox game the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting on a show, Chicago brought in 35,000 balloons, a 40-foot replica of 
the World Cup, 10,000 yards of gold fabric, 4,700 yards of sequined fabric, 
1,500 kids from local high schools, a 300-kid children's choir, the "one and 
only" (as she was introduced) Oprah, the one and only Diana, presumably 
one-and-onlies Daryl Hall and Richard Marx, four F-16 fighter jets and 
everything but a 40-foot replica of Refrigerator Perry for the opening 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there weren't quite the 150,000 people who packed Soldier Field for a 
1944 wartime speech by Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- who at no time wished 
anyone from Germany viel gluck -- it was nonetheless a large and demonstrative 
crowd here Friday, with tens of thousands primed for Day 1 of a thrilling month 
o' soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 More accustomed to playing 12,000 feet above sea level or above Lake Titicaca 
or wherever it is Bolivia usually plays, the underdogs were a sentimental 
choice among whichever part of the crowd did not hail from Chicago's enormous 
German-American community. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the unforgettable words of forward William Ramallo, who said, 
"Actually, we run faster at sea level," the Bolivians made several strong bids 
to get on the board, particularly with a left-footed blast just barely wide to 
the left of the net by Erwin (Magic) Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 (No, sorry, wrong nickname.) 
</P>
<P>
 About the only good swift kick for Bolivia after that, though, was one by 
forward Marco Antonio (El Diablo) Etcheverry, aimed at a German opponent, that 
got El Diablo kicked right off the field and right onto el bench.  
</P>
<P>
 The Germans hung on for a hard-earned victory, on a day with only the one 
talk-show host injury reported.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; GERMANS AVOID AN OPENING SLIP; SOCCER: 
TOURNAMENT BEGINS WITH A WHIMPER, NOT A BANG, AS BOLIVIA FALLS, 1-0, ON GOAL BY 
KLINSMANN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In bringing the World Cup to the United States, the lords of soccer hope that 
their sport will prove irresistible to a country that so far has not been 
overwhelmed by its charm. They could not be particularly optimistic after 
Friday's opening game, which produced as many spills as thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 If videotapes of the game are replayed repeatedly in the future, it most 
likely will be at seminars for referees and linesmen as they study new 
interpretations of the rules that are supposed to make the sport more 
attractive. If they are not successful, it will not be because referee Arturo 
Brizio Carter of Mexico was lax in his responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He was almost as relentless as the defending champion Germans, who survived 
the heat -- 87 degrees on the beach at nearby Lake Michigan but no doubt higher 
on the grass at Soldier Field -- and a game Bolivian team for a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, neither team was satisfied, the Germans because they did not 
perform with the efficiency to which they have become accustomed and the 
Bolivians because they came so close to a tie that would have gone down in 
history as a stunning upset. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not have been deserved, because the Germans were clearly superior, 
but the Bolivians still would have considered it vindication. They have spent 
recent months defending themselves against criticism that they advanced from 
their South American qualifying group only because of their home-mountain 
advantage, playing games at two-mile high La Paz. 
</P>
<P>
 That might or might not be true, but, when Germany's goal brought them 
crashing back down to sea level, it had almost nothing to do with poor play and 
almost everything to do with poor luck. 
</P>
<P>
 If they had been among the crowd of 63,117, or the estimated 750 million 
television viewers, they might have been able to see it coming during the 
colorful opening ceremony. Almost no sooner had it begun than the hostess, 
Oprah Winfrey, was being helped off the stage after falling. Although she soon 
returned, it was a portent because players from both teams were slipping and 
sliding on the grass once the game began. No one had good things to say about 
the condition of the turf, particularly after it was watered at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Its most prominent victim was Bolivian goalkeeper Carlos Trucco, who appeared 
to be living up to his nickname, El Loco, when he strayed from his line and 
seemed to dive at the feet of Germany's onrushing midfielder, Thomas Haessler. 
In reality, Trucco, realizing he was alone after Haessler got past Bolivia's 
defenders, tried to cut down the angle on a potential shot and slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 All Haessler had to do at that point was tap the ball to wide-open striker 
Juergen Klinsmann, who sent the ball into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got the ball, there was almost nothing I could do wrong," said 
Klinsmann, whose goal came in the 61st minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia's coach, Xavier Azkargorta, complained that Haessler was offside when 
he received the original pass from sweeper Lothar Matthaeus. It did appear 
close, but, according to one of the new interpretations of the rules, the 
linesmen is supposed to give the benefit of the doubt to the attacking team. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision that probably will be discussed longer came with about seven 
minutes remaining. In a desperation attempt to pick up his offense, Azkargorta 
sent his most explosive player, Marco Etcheverry, onto the field in the 79th 
minute as a forward. Etcheverry suffered a severe knee injury in November and 
had not played since, but he figured he had at least 10 good minutes in him. 
</P>
<P>
 He will never know. After becoming entangled with Matthaeus, Etcheverry did 
live up to his nickname, El Diablo, and aimed a kick at the German captain's 
backside. Four minutes after entering the game, he was back on the bench, the 
recipient of a red card. 
</P>
<P>
 Etcheverry apologized profusely to the Bolivian people, specifically his 
parents, for embarrassing them, then said the mistake was Carter's for being so 
quick on the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter already had proved himself a no-nonsense referee, dispensing five 
yellow cards in response to a directive from FIFA to make room for offensive 
players to operate. He set the tone early, giving German defender Juergen 
Kohler a yellow card only seven minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Germany pressed early in an attempt to take control before the 
heat became a factor. But the Bolivian defenders proved surprisingly adept at 
turning away the attacks, and, with about 15 minutes remaining in the first 
half, they began creating space for themselves offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Erwin Sanchez was particularly effective at finding the seams in 
the German defense, and, in the 34th minute, blasted a shot toward the net that 
forced goalkeeper Bodo Illgner to dive in order to make the save. That resulted 
in Bolivia's only corner kick of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of chasing Sanchez, Germany sent him a message early in the second half 
with a hard tackle by Thomas Berthold. Sanchez left the field on a stretcher, 
and although he was back two minutes later, he displayed the same verve only in 
flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sanchez went, so went the Bolivians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans dominated the second half, although it was not evident on the 
scoreboard. If they are going to become the first team to repeat as champion 
since Brazil in 1962, their usually efficient engine will have to be tuned.

U.S. OPEN; MONTGOMERIE'S 65 PUTS HIM TWO UP; GOLF: PUDGY SCOT IS LEADER AFTER 
TWO ROUNDS, WITH IRWIN, COOK AND EDWARDS TIED FOR SECOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Open took on a slightly European flavor Friday at Oakmont Country 
Club, where pudgy Scot Colin Montgomerie went on a diet of birdies and took the 
second-round lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie, 30, whose geographical golf pedigree extends from the Scottish 
links to Houston Baptist University to the 1987 Scottish Amateur title, toured 
storied Oakmont in 65 shots for 136, taking a two-stroke lead over Hale Irwin, 
who shot a 69, and John Cook and Dave Edwards, who also shot 65s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Maggert and Jack Nicklaus are three shots back at 139. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone is chasing the man they call Monty, which is just the way he 
would have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sort of looking forward to the pressures, actually," Montgomerie said. 
"I have nothing to lose right now. I wanted to get in contention in a major 
championship and I am certainly that." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery's 36-hole total is six under par and has him in contention for his 
first major title. 
</P>
<P>
 Five birdies, an eagle and a single bogey contributed to Montgomerie's 65. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as good as I can do, I think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He came up with the main Montgomerie minute on the par-five, 474-yard ninth 
hole, when he knocked his second shot, a four-iron, into a bunker, then holed 
it from eight yards out for an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie, who missed the cut at the Masters, is looking to revise recent 
history. No player from the British Isles has won the U.S. Open since England's 
Tony Jacklin in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Nobilo, Steve Pate, Curtis Strange and Ernie Els are at 140 and in 
fourth place. The only other golfers under par are Scott Triplett, Tom Watson, 
Emlyn Aubrey and Jeff Sluman at 141. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, with his 65, took eight strokes off his first-round 73. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old, whose best U.S. Open finish was a tie for fourth in 1981, 
said he is carrying the flag for the 30-something generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack (Nicklaus), obviously, when he is on, he is the greatest player that 
ever lived, because how many people are still contending in their 50s as good 
or close to it as they were in their 20s and 30s?" Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the remarkable aspect of Cook's 65 is that he didn't get a lot of work 
on the greens because he didn't arrive in Pittsburgh until Wednesday morning 
from his home in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least he had a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at home, watching my daughter in a piano recital and with my little boy 
in an 8-year-old all-star (baseball) game," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin's 69 matched his first-round score, but it was a lot more adventurous -- 
three birdies, two bogeys, an eagle on No. 9 followed by a double-bogey on No. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of lost my concentration a little bit," Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved into the lead with his eagle on the long ninth hole. He hit a 
two-iron on his second shot and knocked it within four feet, then rolled in the 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
 But on No. 10, Irwin hit his drive in the rough, chipped out 40 feet and 
three-putted from the front of the green. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he preferred to look at those two holes another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take the two holes and put them together, I have two pars," Irwin 
said. "Sort of a simple way of doing it, but I am pretty simple-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 Pate, of Agoura, made it look pretty simple with a 66 that shot him into a tie 
for third at 140. 
</P>
<P>
 Following up Thursday's 74, Pate toured the course at five under, rolling in a 
60-foot birdie putt on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit a putt that was going off the green, hit the pit and went in," said 
Pate, whose best U.S. Open finish was in 1988, when he was third at Brookline 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making that bomb on the last hole makes you feel a lot better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, the first-round leader, wasn't feeling so well, but if he was looking 
for anyone to blame, he could start with his bag. It's his putter's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson missed a six-foot birdie putt on No. 4, a 10-footer on No. 5, an uphill 
15-footer on No. 6, a 15-footer on No. 7, a five-footer on No. 9, a 15-footer 
on No. 11, an uphill three-footer on No. 13 and three-putted from 14 feet on No 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let a pretty good score get away from me today," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus was more forgiving of his round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I made the cut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual cut isn't known yet because 18 golfers were still on the course 
when play was stopped -- for the second day -- just before 8 p.m. because of 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's certain that defending champion Lee Janzen isn't going to make 
it. He is at 148, seven over par. The cut figures to be no more than five over, 
which would spare Scott Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 However it shakes out, Montgomerie is not threatened, at the moment. He isn't 
the most popular Scot here, though -- Sam Torrance is -- and he has his 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Ryder Cup teammate David Feherty, describes one of Montgomerie's 
looks as that of "a wart hog who's just been stung by a wasp." 
</P>
<P>
 If he wins the U.S. Open, though, even Montgomerie's detractors may have to 
come up with something nice to say about him.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; U.S. FINDS ITSELF ON THE HOT SEAT; FIRST 
ROUND: GAME AGAINST SWITZERLAND IN EXPECTED HUMIDITY OF SILVERDOME SHAPES UP AS 
A MUST-WIN SITUATION FOR BOTH TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They have brought it on themselves, the players and their leader. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is pressure on the U.S. World Cup team to advance beyond the first 
round -- and there is, to a considerable degree -- the team can blame its own 
sporadic success and the brash prediction of the president of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation, a man well familiar with hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a lead-pipe cinch to get out of the first round," Alan Rothenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He made that bold and hopeful boast months ago. But it comes home to roost 
today, when the United States opens its World Cup campaign against Switzerland 
in the Silverdome. The U.S. players are hoping they don't have to dine on 
Rothenberg's words. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since 1930, when the United States was invited to play in the World Cup in 
Uruguay, has an American team made it to the second round. It is a fact that 
rides uncomfortably against another: Never has the host team failed to make it 
past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes today's game something of a must-win situation. U.S. 
coaches, U.S. Soccer Federation officials and, until recently, U.S. players, 
all have commented that to advance, they must beat Switzerland. The theory is 
that among the Group A teams, which include Colombia and Romania, Switzerland 
is the team the United States has the best chance to beat. In the Swiss camp, 
of course, the sentiment is the same about the vulnerability of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant drumbeat of must-win has receded recently and been replaced by a 
let's-be-sensible approach, which notes that if the Americans can't earn the 
three points for a victory over the Swiss, there are always Colombia on June 22 
and Romania on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to win, yes, everybody wants to win," U.S. midfielder John Harkes 
said. "But it's not devastating if we don't win the first game. It's not like 
if we lose against Switzerland, our hopes have gone and we will wither away." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes was on the U.S. World Cup team in 1990, the much-maligned "bunch of 
college kids," the youngest team in the tournament with an average age of 24. 
Six players on this team were on the 1990 team, and each professes to be eager 
to erase the memory of three consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a different team, better and more experienced," said Tab Ramos, 
another veteran of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The USSF has spent millions to make sure the team is different. In Italy, U.S. 
players were encamped in a bleak facility in Tirrenia and visited with their 
families through bars in a fence. This team is ensconced in a posh resort at 
Dana Point and works out at a multimillion-dollar training center built to the 
specifications of Coach Bora Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the presence of Milutinovic, more than anything, that has raised the 
expectations of the team. Indeed, so influential has Milutinovic been that the 
team has taken on his unpredictable personality, showing flashes of brilliance 
amid periods of mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's coyness with reporters extends to the team as well. No player, 
with the possible exception of goalkeeper Tony Meola, has been told if he is 
starting, and the defenders have not been told if the team will play with four 
backs in a flat formation or with a sweeper who roams behind three defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic probably will play the four-back scheme against Switzerland. In 
the four-back system, Thomas Dooley plays as a defensive midfielder, where he 
can help initiate the offense while also being available to mark an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that Harkes play at right back rather than in the midfield 
appears to have been rejected. That means the defense will line up with Alexi 
Lalas, Marcelo Balboa, Cle Kooiman and Paul Caligiuri. With Claudio Reyna 
nursing a strained hamstring, the midfield figures to be manned by Ramos, 
Dooley, Mike Sorber and Harkes. Eric Wynalda will play at forward and Ernie 
Stewart at striker. 
</P>
<P>
 From Switzerland, the United States can expect an organized, disciplined 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put pressure on the ball, but at the same time they have some weaknesses 
we can exploit," U.S. assistant coach Timo Liekoski said. "If we win the ball 
early enough, I think it's important that we try to play the ball forward 
quickly so they can't set up defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure-cooker conditions will probably prevail in the Silverdome. The 
plexiglass-covered arena is likely to be a cozy, humid environment for the 
revolutionary indoor grass, a pampered lawn that was cultivated in Camarillo, 
Calif., and nurtured in the Silverdome parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 If they could spend $1.5 million on grass, you'd think someone might have been 
able to spring for an air conditioner, but the Silverdome, seldom used in the 
summer, has none -- and temperatures in the Midwest the last few days have been 
in the 90s, with high humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 When Germany and England played here last summer, the players raved about the 
condition of the field but most estimated they had lost eight to 10 pounds of 
water weight in sauna-like conditions. Switzerland included a visit to a sauna 
as part of its preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, however, little can be done about the sticky heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great factor, but it is a factor," said U.S. assistant coach Steve 
Sampson. "At this level and in this competition, every factor in the game 
becomes important."

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; A WILD WEEK IN HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was a week of chaos and goofiness in the heavyweight division, and it was 
hard to keep up even if you were one of the principals involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, we were very, very close to a deal to fight Lennox Lewis for the 
undisputed title in the spring," Michael Moorer's manager, John Davimos, said 
Friday. "And I wake up this morning hearing that they're announcing a 
Lewis-Riddick Bowe fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they were talking, but yeah, I'm surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic Bowe-Lewis announcement, a bout tentatively set for November but 
which also could be delayed until spring of 1995, capped seven strange days of 
maneuvering and manipulating among heavyweights as Mike Tyson's release from 
prison draws nearer. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moorer's camp completed a deal to fight George Foreman in November, 
probably at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, on HBO, and had only a few details to 
negotiate before signing a multi-fight deal with Time Warner, HBO's parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tyson's appeal for a sentence reduction was rejected, making a May, 1995, 
release probable. The intensity of the coverage before the appeal rejection 
only reinforced the belief that Tyson remains the most fascinating fighter in 
the world -- by far. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former champion Evander Holyfield went to a faith healer in Philadelphia 
and said he felt cured of the heart problem that only recently prompted his 
retirement. Late this week, Holyfield underwent tests and might be cleared -- 
at least by his personal doctors -- to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the verge of an agreement to fight Moorer, Lewis' promoter, Panos 
Eliades, struck a surprising deal with Rock Newman, Bowe's promoter, and both 
Eliades and Newman said that the winner of Bowe-Lewis should be viewed as the 
real champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sticking point preventing Moorer-Lewis, according to Davimos, was a 
demand from Eliades that Lewis be guaranteed an immediate rematch should he 
lose. Davimos said he'd think about it and get back to them. Before he did, 
Eliades cut the deal with Newman, who, like Eliades, had grown weary of jumping 
through hoops to get his man into the ring with Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He panicked," Davimos said of Eliades. "He gave away the store, and he didn't 
have to. He could have had us for the undisputed title in the spring. Instead 
he has a very difficult fight for less money. Stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 According to those knowledgeable about the deal, Bowe will get 35% of the 
gross earnings, Lewis 65% -- and, unusual for a championship match, Lewis will 
get no cut of Bowe's future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Bowe will be seeking to regain the World Boxing Council belt he 
threw away -- and Lewis picked up -- after Bowe had beaten Holyfield in 
November, 1992, for the undisputed title. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliades said he spoke with WBC President Jose Sulaiman, no fan of Bowe or 
Newman since the belt trashing, and said he had Sulaiman's word that the WBC 
would look favorably upon a Bowe fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever wins this fight is in the strongest position in boxing," Eliades 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new deal throws Bowe's scheduled July 15 fight against Buster Mathis Jr. 
at Hollywood Park into serious jeopardy, given Bowe's recent cancellation of a 
bout because of back problems and Newman's stated desire to keep things safe 
and sane for Bowe leading up to a Lewis fight. Newman was uncertain when asked 
about the Hollywood Park fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also has a mandatory title defense in September against Oliver McCall, 
scheduled for London. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what does this all mean? It means multiple champions for the foreseeable 
future, and it means Tyson is the only fighter who really controls his own 
destiny -- once he is back in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer has the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation belts, 
Lewis has the WBC title, and Tyson has the ability to draw more attention than 
both men combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless Mike Tyson doesn't return to the ring, I don't think you're going to 
see a unification fight for a very long time," said Dan Duva, who has 
promotional interests in Moorer, Lewis and Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Mike Tyson gets out, the opportunity for either Moorer or the winner of 
Bowe-Lewis to fight Mike Tyson will be far more seductive than to fight each 
other for the undisputed championship." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Tyson ambles out of prison, he will have his choice of champions 
to fight for huge money: Moorer, if he beats Foreman, or the winner of the 
Lewis-Bowe grudge match. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson could also fight former champion Holyfield, his old nemesis, if fate, 
attending physicians and some boxing commission should approve. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens to Moorer? Assuming he gets past Foreman, Moorer could fight 
Tyson in late 1995, Davimos said, or fight the winner of Bowe-Lewis. Or, he 
added, half seriously, "I think Evander wants to fight us again." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, meanwhile, badly in need of legitimacy in the United States, is 
gambling that he can beat Bowe and get instant respectability -- and possibly 
recognition as the true heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Duva said he disagrees with that logic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Moorer is the heavyweight champion of the world," Duva said. "He beat 
the man who beat the man who beat the man. He's the one who won it in the ring. 
In the public's perception, Michael Moorer is the heavyweight champion of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask me who the public thinks is the best heavyweight in the world: He's 
sitting in prison in Indiana." Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: Jeremy Williams vs. Bert Cooper, heavyweights; Johnny Tapia vs. Rafael 
Granillo, flyweights. Grand Olympic Auditorium, 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: Marco Antonio Barrera vs. Mike Espinoza, bantamweights; Shibata Flores 
vs. Roland Herrera, welterweights; Chico Castillo vs. Angel Aldama, 
featherweights. Forum, 7 p.m.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; GRANDDADDY OF AN OPENER AT ROSE BOWL; 
SHOWCASE: ROMANIA-COLOMBIA MATCHUP FIRST OF EIGHT WORLD CUP GAMES AT PASADENA 
VENUE.

 By Gheorghe, are you ready for some futbol?  
</P>
<P>
 Today at 4:30 p.m. at the Rose Bowl, two of the finest athletic teams on the 
planet meet in a game that figures to produce 36 fewer points than Wisconsin 
and UCLA managed on the same field 5 1/2 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin won that game, 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia should win this one, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it could be Romania, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 One or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the World Cup arrives in Pasadena, bringing with it the world's 
grandest sporting spectacle, the quadrennial monthlong soccer festival that, in 
terms of global import, will dwarf every other event ever held in the Arroyo 
Seco, from the Rose Bowl to the Super Bowl to the 1984 Summer Olympic soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 What possibly could be bigger than the Granddaddy of Them All? 
</P>
<P>
 How about the Gran Abuelo of Them All -- the great-grandfather of all athletic 
competitions, guaranteed to captivate the undivided attention of 23 countries 
worldwide -- the United States is also entered -- with a projected cumulative 
television audience of 32 billion? 
</P>
<P>
 Archie Griffin swept right end here. So did Ernie Nevers. Ron VanderKelen, 
Frankie Albert and Jim Plunkett once filled the sky above with spirals. Some of 
the greatest names in the history of college football have staked their claim 
inside this arena, but this afternoon, the marquee gives way to stars of a 
different inflection. 
</P>
<P>
 The big names at the Rose Bowl today: 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's Gheorghe Hagi, "the Maradona of the Carpathians." 
</P>
<P>
 And Colombia's Carlos Valderrama, "the Mad Hairdo of Santa Marta." 
</P>
<P>
 The Romania-Colombia match is the first of eight World Cup games scheduled for 
the Rose Bowl, leading to the July 17 final. Sunday, Sweden and Cameroon will 
play, followed by the United States' last two matches in Group A competition -- 
against Colombia on Wednesday and Romania on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Those games should determine whether the United States advances to the second 
round for the first time since the inaugural World Cup in 1930. That will 
largely determine whether Americans finally catch soccer fever in 1994 -- or, 
as in the sport itself, refuse to touch it with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance and Miracle On Bermuda will transfix the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Go three-and-out, however, and Alan Rothenberg's Great American Soccer 
Campaign ("Everybody Plays . . . Will Somebody Please Watch?") will be belly up 
before July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Rose Bowl stands ready to witness either the greatest breakthrough 
in U.S. soccer or its greatest heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 After group play is finished, the Rose Bowl will be the site of four games in 
the single-elimination "knockout" -- one game in the round of 16, one 
semifinal, the third-place game and the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, expected to draw a television audience of 2 billion, is the 
glittering prize of any World Cup, and Pasadena won it primarily on its track 
record. The Rose Bowl's large playing surface, wider than in most multipurpose 
stadiums, and its mammoth seating capacity make it the preeminent soccer 
facility in the country, with the turnstile figures to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the Rose Bowl held the largest Stateside soccer crowd ever -- 101,799 
for the Olympic final between France and Brazil -- and this month, 91,123 
watched the United States beat Mexico, 1-0, in a World Cup tuneup. Although the 
audience was overwhelmingly pro-Mexico -- for one day, it was the Verde, Blanco 
y Rojo Bowl -- the crowd was the largest to watch a U.S. national soccer team 
play inside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For the World Cup, the Rose Bowl will seat roughly 92,000, with about 4,000 
seats removed in the corners to allow for a wider field. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the reputation of international soccer fans, the stadium has been 
accordingly refortified, giving the place the distinct feel of a military 
compound festooned in brightly colored banners. 
</P>
<P>
 An extra 10-foot-tall chain-link fence now traverses the stadium's original 
fence, creating an extra security wall. Temporary barriers have been installed 
just outside the press box elevator entrance. New tunnels have been constructed 
to ease evacuation in the case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Security has also been stepped up, with an intensive on-site force drawing 
from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Los Angeles Police 
Department, the FBI and 40 other local, state and federal agencies. Spectators 
have been advised that pat-down searches and bag inspections will be conducted 
at all perimeter gates. All that is missing are signs reading, "Enter at Your 
Own Frisk." 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetically, this will not rank as the Rose Bowl's finest moment, not with 
the blockades and the barbed-wire coils. But such is the price one pays when it 
is permitted to punch the World Cup's ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time it arrives Wednesday, the U.S. team will wish it were half so 
well-defended. Today's Game 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT: Colombia plays Romania in a World Cup Group A game. 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN: 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 TV: ESPN, Univision.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BOLIVIA GROPES FOR ANSWERS, FINDS ONLY 
EXCUSES; AFTERMATH: DESPITE SOLID PLAY AGAINST GERMANY -- MOSTLY MINUS A 
CONTRITE ETCHEVERRY -- IT WEAKLY BLAMES ELEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forgive the Bolivian World Cup team if it believes circumstances have 
conspired against it. Losing, as well as anything, makes the mind seek creative 
explanations for failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin with the fact that soccer's minnow nation found itself in the opening 
game of the World Cup on Friday against defending champion Germany, the 
preeminent power in the sport, and add that the game was played in a city that 
boasts a substantial population of German descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the matter of Germany's goal -- which alone was enough to 
disappoint the Bolivians, inasmuch as they offered no answer to it -- during 
the game. Afterward, they contended that Thomas Haessler was offside when he 
trapped the ball and deflected it off his chest to Juergen Klinsmann, who 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the banishment of the team's most inspirational player, Marco 
Antonio Etcheverry, who was sent off for a hard tackle only three minutes after 
he entered the game late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the elements that should have equally affected both teams but that 
the Bolivians came to see as being directed at them: nearly unbearable heat and 
humidity at the field level and the field itself, which was watered at halftime 
and rendered treacherously slippery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolivians' frustrations were naturally exacerbated by how titillatingly 
close they came to pulling off what would have been one of the great upsets in 
World Cup history -- an event the tiny Andean nation has been a part of only 
three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Blurted the exasperated Bolivian team press officer, Juan Francisco Roque: "I 
thought we should have won. It's hard when you have to withstand a temperature 
of (87 degrees) and a humidity of 100%, when you have a referee who -- well, 
let's say his performance was average. All the things that we could control, we 
controlled. If the referee makes decisions only he understands. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride often speaks out of turn. If Bolivia had any goal Friday, it was to show 
the world that its surprising qualification -- which had been dismissed as a 
fluke because of the team's advantage of playing at high altitude -- had been 
well and truly earned. Reality intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The respect for Germany is always there," Bolivian midfielder Milton Melgar 
said. "What we were sure of at the start was that we knew how to play our game 
and what we had worked on. But we were unable to summon the strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The team had managed to play Germany closely and received a spark when 
Etcheverry was substituted into the game in the 80th minute. "El Diablo," as 
the striker is known, suffered a serious knee injury in November of 1993 and 
had not played for the national team until Friday's brief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had decided to wait for the other team to be a little tired before putting 
him in," Xavier Azkargorta, the Bolivian coach, said. "What we didn't count on 
was having him on the field for such a short time." 
</P>
<P>
 Etcheverry was humble and apologetic after the game, facing the media under 
extremely difficult circumstances. His first order of business was to apologize 
for his red card, received for kicking Lothar Matthaeus in the shin. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all I want to say to Bolivia that I am sorry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is I'm sorry. I can't say whether I did it or not. I think it 
will be very clear (on television replays) that I did it. But for me, the most 
important thing . . . is to apologize to the public because they were waiting 
for a good show and today I failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked several times if he kicked Matthaeus, Etcheverry said: "You can see it 
in the replay. If I did kick him, it was part of the game. I believe a referee 
can make mistakes, as all of us do. They are only human. . . . My desire to 
play was great. I've been waiting seven months to play one game." 
</P>
<P>
 And now he won't play in Bolivia's next game, which, the team hopes, will not 
contain as many unfair elements.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COMMENTARY; REFEREE SETS TONE -- AND IT'S 
NOT A HIGH NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, the tone has been set for officiating in the World Cup, and it's not a 
pretty picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Brizio Carter, a 36-year-old lawyer from Mexico had the honor to be 
assigned to referee the Germany-Bolivia match at Soldier Field Friday, but he 
turned in a feeble performance that could have an impact on the rest of the 
monthlong tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't all Carter's fault. He was under strict instructions from FIFA, 
world soccer's governing body, to give the benefit of all doubt to the 
offensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A German goal that had Bolivia's coach, Xavier Azkargorta, screaming 
offside. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The expulsion of Bolivia's star player, Marco Etcheverry, for a foul that 
goes unpunished nine times out of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six yellow cards, four of them against the Bolivians, which further 
jeopardizes their chances of reaching the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad afternoon's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The referee for the opening game always is chosen with care because he sets 
the tone for the tournament and more or less acts as a guide for the other 
referees to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has a good reputation, and if it turns out that FIFA praises his 
performance -- there was no immediate reaction Friday -- it means this World 
Cup will surpass even Italia '90 in its distribution of yellow and red cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the referee was a bit too strict," Eddie Thompson, Australia's 
national team coach, said after the game. "I think one or two of the bookings 
(yellow cards) were deserved, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and players were warned before the tournament that referees would do 
all they can to protect skilled players from the more unkind attention of 
defenders. Tackles from behind, for instance, are supposed to result in an 
automatic red card. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who is working at the World Cup for FIFA's technical committee, said 
consistency of decisions is the key to controlling games. If players know 
exactly what will be tolerated, they can adjust their game accordingly. But if 
referees interpret the rules in different ways, chaos results. "As long as (the 
World Cup referees) all keep doing the same," he said, "I won't complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia might be doing a little complaining, though. Etcheverry and Erwin 
Sanchez are its most skilled players, the key to its World Cup hopes. But 
Sanchez was felled time and again by the German defenders and at one point was 
carried off on a stretcher, only to return moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Etcheverry's expulsion, it came because he lifted his leg as if to kick 
German captain Lothar Matthaeus after the two had tussled for the ball. 
Etcheverry all but admitted kicking Matthaeus. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is I'm sorry," he said. "I can't say whether I did it or not. I 
think it will be very clear (on television replays) that I did it. But for me 
the most important thing to me is to apologize to the public because they were 
waiting for a good show and today I failed." 
</P>
<P>
 As a game, the Germany-Bolivia opener seldom reached great heights. There were 
incidents that made it interesting, but too little skill or drama to make it 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat was possibly to blame, but opening games have a patchwork history. 
Some have been tremendous, others simply tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 In the very first World Cup game, for instance, Mexico lost to France, 4-1, at 
Montevideo, Uruguay. France's Lucien Laurent scored the first World Cup goal, 
but teammate Alex Villaplane would go into the history books for an altogether 
less honorable reason. Years later, he was executed by a firing squad for 
collaborating with the Germans in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States once took part in an opener, although the result is one that 
Americans would rather ignore. A 7-1 defeat by Italy in Rome in 1934 in front 
of Benito Mussolini is perhaps best forgotten. Aldo (Buff) Donelli, who later 
made his name as Columbia's football coach, scored the lone U.S. goal. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been memorable moments from other opening games too. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, the Swiss team refused to give the Nazi salute during the German 
national anthem at the opening game in Paris. In 1950, Brazil beat Mexico, 4-0, 
in the World Cup debut of Antonio Carbajal, the Mexican goalkeeper who would 
become the only player to compete in five World Cup tournaments. Carbajal was 
also in the nets for Mexico in the opening game of the 1958 tournament in 
Sweden. His luck was no better as Mexico lost to Sweden, 3-0, at Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 There was once a stretch of two decades when no goal was scored in the opening 
game. The World Cup openers of 1966 in England, 1970 in Mexico, 1974 in West 
Germany and 1978 in Argentina all ended 0-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year dry spell ended with an upset when Belgium defeated Argentina, 
1-0, at Barcelona, Spain, in 1982 in Diego Maradona's World Cup debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Argentina was again the defending champion and again lost the 
opener, this time to Cameroon at Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 That opener saw two Cameroon players red-carded, and yet the African team 
still reached the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is any consolation to the Bolivians, perhaps they will be as fortunate 
in this tournament.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SOUTH KOREANS WEAR DOWN SPAIN FOR A TIE; 
GROUP C: AFTER SPANISH CAPTAIN NADAL IS EJECTED IN FIRST HALF, KOREANS SCORE 
TWO GOALS IN FINAL FIVE MINUTES. 
</P>

<P>
 So much for boring soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game filled with controversy, intrigue and a dramatic comeback, South 
Korea did not wait long to stun the soccer world on a steamy Friday evening in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with a man advantage from the 26th minute, underrated Korea turned a 
seemingly devastating defeat into a surprising draw, tying Spain, 2-2, before 
56,247 at the Cotton Bowl on the first day of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In a most improbable first-round game, Spain once again enhanced its 
unenviable reputation as a Cup underachiever. It was South Korea's second draw 
in nine Cup matches, the first since it tied Bulgaria in 1986. The Koreans have 
never won in this tournament, but by earning a point in Group C on Friday, they 
have a good chance of advancing to the second round for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, meanwhile, expecting to cruise into the second round, needs to regroup 
if it plans to earn any respect during the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's demise came about slowly and painfully with temperatures in the 90s, 
melting the undermanned team in the closing minutes as it gasped for relief. 
Spain's fatigued and weakened defenders gave up two goals when their legs could 
no longer keep up with the pressing Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 Seo Jung-won, a veteran of the 1990 World Cup and '92 Barcelona Games, tied 
the score in extra time after Hong Myung-bo beat a Spanish defender and passed 
to his unmarked teammate inside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the pass was coming, I was calm," Seo said. "I was watching the goalie 
coming out and my control was good. I was in perfect position." 
</P>
<P>
 Hong scored minutes earlier on a free kick that deflected off the feet of 
Spanish defenders in front of the goal. The rebounding ball caught goalkeeper 
Santiago Canizares by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it did not reap any benefits for a long time, Korea's resurrection 
began in the 26th minute after a controversial call by referee Peter Mikkelsen 
of Denmark. Miguel Nadal was ejected after stopping a scoring threat by Ko 
Jeoung-woon just outside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadal, Spain's captain and perhaps most versatile midfielder, made a hard 
sliding tackle, but it was questionable whether it was a professional foul, a 
penalty committed deliberately to stop a striker from getting a clear run on 
the goal. Such a foul results in immediate ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The red card slowed down the pace of the game and strategies had to be 
changed," said Juan Goikoetxea, a Spanish midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nadal's absence, Spain lost its presence for the rest of the first half. 
But spectacular goals in the 51st and 56th minutes of the second half renewed 
Spain's verve despite playing a man short throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 The first goal came from forward Julio Salinas and some fancy footwork from 
Spain's midfielders. Jose Luis Caminero, a second-half substitute, set up the 
goal by beating the Korean defense inside the penalty area. He sent a nice pass 
to Goikoetxea, whose crossing pass went to a sliding Salinas in front of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by that score, Spain went on the offensive and pressured the Koreans. 
Finally, Salinas broke free and tried a nice shot that was saved by goalkeeper 
Choi In-young. But Salinas got the ball back and shot again. It was blocked, 
but Caminero got the rebound and dribbled to his right. He tried two hard 
blasts that hit defenders, then crossed it to Goikoetxea after controlling the 
second rebound. Goikoetxea took the high ball and headed it in behind the 
outstretched arms of Choi. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Javier Clemente figured the game was in hand and replaced Salinas seven 
minutes later with Felipe, a younger player whose expertise is defense. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sound move until Fernando Hierro suffered a slight leg injury in the 
76th minute and sat down for five minutes before returning. Once dormant Korea 
suddenly came to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 15 minutes, with Fernando injured, the team just lost its 
strength," Clemente said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough to give Korea a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured we were down two goals, let's go out and attack," Seo said. "What 
have we got to lose?" 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente said his team was emotionally drained from the experience. Spain uses 
but one forward in its defense-minded format and usually has little trouble 
holding big leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're demoralized because we had it won," he said. "They are a bit down, a 
bit stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried hard but we couldn't do it and just sank at the end. We had a tough 
time. We had the match wrapped up and at the end, when we had it in our hands, 
it got away." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente said losing Nadal changed the color of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing with 10 men is very tough," he said. "At the end we were tremendously 
tired. We couldn't keep the Koreans out because we simply couldn't bear the 
pressure any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they will have to endure the pressure of facing an angry nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what soccer is all about.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; CROWD AT COTTON BOWL ORDERLY, IF NOT A 
SELLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 OK, so it wasn't Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour before first boot, outside Gate 2 at the Cotton Bowl, 18-year-old 
Tommy Ray held up a ticket for Friday's World Cup first-round game between 
Spain and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Charlie Derrisaw's fault. Three weeks ago Ray and a buddy, Cody Moore, 
purchased three tickets for $30 each. All had planned to make the five-hour 
drive up from Galveston; three unabashed soccer geeks with Texas drawls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Derrisaw bailed out at the last minute, some lame excuse about a make-up 
exam in order to graduate high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid $30, we want $20, but we'll take $10," Moore said of the fluid state 
of ticket negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not unexpectedly, Dallas came up short in the attendance game. Friday's crowd 
of 56,247 was far short of Cotton Bowl capacity, 63,998. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was evident by game's end that Charlie Derrisaw had missed a good time, 
as 2-2 ties go. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst fears of organizers and local police were not realized. The 
eight-foot high, chain-linked fence that had been erected -- then partially 
disassembled -- to protect the players from would-be hooligans, was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were no immediate security figures, Sgt. William Darr of the 
Dallas Police Department reported the number of incidents was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very smooth as far as I know," he said. "And this is how I anticipate 
the rest of the games will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine World Cup venues, Dallas has been the most beleaguered. Not only 
have first-round ticket sales lagged, there was controversy over whether Dallas 
police had overreacted in erecting the security fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It proved a lot," Chalese Stachowiak, Dallas venue press officer, said. "It 
showed the hospitality of the Dallas people, especially the ethnic crowds. 
There was a lot of security, a lot of eager eyes, but no massive show of force. 
There were no incidents. You did not see people on the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Stachowiak hopes that Friday's game will convince authorities to remove the 
remaining portion of fence on the field's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Dallas police will meet soon to discuss the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing approaching an "incident" occurred during the opening ceremony 
when a fireworks sparkler with a mind of its own grazed the frilly suit of a 
dancing cowgirl. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was on the field. The game became entertainment at the point 
Spain's Miguel Nadal received a red-card ejection in the 26th minute, forcing 
the heavily favored Spaniards to play a man short for the remainder of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The strain finally took hold, as Korea rallied for two goals in the final six 
minutes to salvage a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans for both sides were vocal but not raucous. 
</P>
<P>
 "What pleased me most was that they were not cheering at each other, not 
provoking," Andreas Herren, a FIFA official, said. "They were just having a 
good time. It proved to the Dallas police that these are family people, 
friendly people. They were not intent on rioting." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Castillo had his doubts. The 40-year-old computer designer and Dallas 
resident was born in Peru. His soccer roots reach deep. He was expecting the 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at the organization," Castillo said. "The opening ceremonies 
were wonderful, the security wonderful. We came here to enjoy, not to see 
things go bad." 
</P>
<P>
 No word whether the Galveston boys ever sold their ticket. But, no doubt, 
Tommy Ray and Cody Moore got their money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 They conceded it's not easy being a soccer fan in Texas, where another kind of 
football rules. The 17-year-old Moore, a recent high school graduate, said some 
teased him for playing in a league in Alvin, hometown of baseball great Nolan 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore plays on as he collects bits of information on his World Cup idols 
from a the local Spanish television station. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray is among Moore's few soccer converts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a wimpy sport at first," Ray said. "Then I played it."

 Firsts:

<P>
 -- First yellow card of World Cup -- Juergen Kohler, German defender, for a 
rough tackle in the seventh minute. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First legitimate scoring opportunity -- Germany's Karlheinz Riedle, who 
dribbled into the box in the eighth minute only to be stopped by Trucco. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First shot -- Erwin Sanchez, Bolivian forward, on a free kick in the ninth 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First offside -- Germany in the 14th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First five corner kicks -- Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First feigned injury -- Bolivia's Luis Cristaldo, who clutched a knee as if 
he had been shot in the 16th minute. Referee Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico 
immediately motioned for him to stand, even though Cristaldo was writhing on 
the ground, seemingly in pain. Cristaldo sprinted away. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First indication that fans thought they might be at Wrigley Field -- In the 
first 21 minutes two fans failed to quickly return balls kicked into the 
stands, believing they were theirs to keep. Unlike baseball, soccer fans are 
supposed to throw balls back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First wave -- 65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First legitimate injury -- 26th minute, Trucco, sandwiched by German 
forwards while catching a corner kick. He stayed in the game. EMILIO

<P>
 From Bonn, Germany's General Anzeiger newspaper, Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 "A D-Day of Football?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That the world championship went to the United States is nothing but an 
attempt to eliminate that big white spot on the map of the FIFA. . . . It's a 
fact that there are 250 million potential customers for soccer shoes, T-shirts, 
balls, trinkets and more.A gigantic market to be developed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The world championship beginning today offers the last chance to make King 
Soccer acceptable in the USA. If this goes by, the industry might not be 
mobilized again. But so far the organizers still dream that their world 
championship will be the detonator. Should it be so, then Lothar Matthaeus, 
Andreas Moeller & Co. will possibly return in 50 years as those who freed the 
country from the dictatorship of American football and baseball. And maybe then 
they will sit in Soldier Field in Chicago, where today the opening match takes 
place, and dream of June 17, 1994 -- the D-Day of Soccer."

<P>
 The reaction from the Spanish-speaking media in the wake of Bolivia's 1-0 
defeat by Germany in the World Cup opener varied from boosterism to pride: 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcaster Javier Echavarria of the Bolivian Radio Group, angered by the 
apparent lack of an offside call on Germany's goal, said: "The Bolivian people 
voiced their unhappiness about the officiating of the game, but they were not 
going to file a protest about the referee (Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico) 
because it would establish a wrong precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter Arteaga Meneces of the Bolivian newspaper Miulpima Hora (The Ultimate 
Hour) shared that view: "The result was unjust because the game should have 
ended in a tie.The goal was offside. I was hoping for more from Germany. 
Everybody thought they'd squash Bolivia." 
</P>
<P>
 But reporter Pedro Carcuro from the Chilean CHIT news agency was more 
restrained. "Bolivia was dignified," he said. "It was an historic 
accomplishment. Bolivia did so well, the game should have ended in a tie." 
</P>
<P>
 Carcuro was saddened by the ejection of veteran Bolivian star Marco 
Etcheverry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was stupidity for El Diablo (Etcheverry) that after seven minutes in the 
game and two transitional plays, he was thrown out. He was so eager to play 
that he transformed his great opportunity in a negative way." MARTHA 
VARGAS-SEAGLE

 Before the World Cup first-round game between Spain and South Korea, Dallas

<P>
 In two satellite-dish sized frying pans, Galbris and a team of piano movers 
carefully blended the ingredients of the traditional Spanish dish: 600 pounds 
of rice, 18,000 jumbo shrimp, 60 pounds of squid, 660 pounds of chicken, 30 
pounds of green beans, 30 pounds of bell peppers, 100 pounds of tomatoes and 16 
ounces of saffron. 
</P>
<P>
 And just a pinch of salt. Twenty pounds, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, for Galbris, this was a rather intimate gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the chef made paella for 100,000, which earned him a place in the 
Guinness Book of World Records. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 The decision to water the field at halftime did not meet with the approval of 
Bolivian players. 
</P>
<P>
 Players on both teams slipped and fell during the second half, and goalkeeper 
Carlos Leonel Trucco blamed poor footing for his slip on the game-winning goal 
by Juergen Klinsmann on a pass from Thomas Haessler. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an excuse. A lot of players fell down," Trucco said. "When I go 
to that ball I want to brake because I know that when he (Haessler) sees me in 
the middle, he is going to hesitate. . . . When I went to stop I pulled out a 
meter of grass from the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The slip left Klinsmann clear to shoot at an open side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Venue press chief Jim Froslid said the halftime sprinkling was part of "normal 
field maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what factors were considered before the water was sprayed on the field, 
Froslid said, "The weather and the fact that the field went through a little 
more pain than we had wanted with thousands of people on it during opening 
ceremonies." EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

 In Colombia, where coverage of its national team in the World Cup has 
practically displaced news of this Sunday's presidential election, newspapers 
are devoting daily special sections to the tournament, as well as front-page 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 El Tiempo, a leading Bogota daily, carried commentary Friday complaining about 
U.S. ignorance of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local population is not only not interested in the theme, it's more than 
that: They don't have the faintest idea about what soccer is. They think it is 
something ridiculous," columnist Jorge Barraza wrote from Chicago. "To give you 
a graphic example: Maradona could walk the streets here without the usual 
accostment, without anyone bothering him. Everyone here says the same thing: 
'Soccer? Oh, yes, yes, soccer! Maradona? No, I don't. . . .' Not having even 
heard of the name of Maradona is the best proof of the definitive ignorance on 
the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 On El Tiempo's editorial pages, columnist D'Artagnan wrote Friday: "Today the 
world championship of soccer begins, and never have a country's expectations 
turned so enthusiastically and massively on the fate of its National Selection 
(team). Colombia, it is true, has traditionally been a fan of soccer, but never 
has a sensation of complete dependence been felt as it is now, in which 
practically nothing else matters, only what our team does in the World Cup. Not 
politics -- two days from decisive presidential elections -- nor the tragedies 
(such as the avalanche last week that killed hundreds) that plague us, nor the 
economic indicators, nor the massacres. Nothing."

 From Thursday editions of the Calcutta daily, the Telegraph, under the 
headline: "The World Cup is being hosted by a nation whose culture can never 
appreciate football's boundless charms -- Don't Play It Again, Sam." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the declared aims of holding the football World Cup in the United 
States will not be accomplished.After the hoopla and the announcement of the 
final victors are over, world football will depart the shores of the U.S., 
leaving behind only ripples which, instead of ever widening, will rapidly 
dwindle to a calm. The decision to award the World Cup of 1994 to the U.S. was 
a disgraceful one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Football will not become popular because the idea that it is not above all 
important to win but to play the game, itself an expression of the primary 
value of collective endeavor and what it teaches, is utterly alien to the 
American ethos. And naturally, the crass commercialization of sports in the 
crassest capitalist country of all will also be a stumbling block. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something to be said, after all, if the U.S. remains impervious to 
the boundless charms of football at its most diverse and best. It will remind 
the rest of the world that we are, thankfully, still very different from the 
U.S. in our sporting sensibilities and values."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BAVASI DISPUTES DAVIS' COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi hardly was ebullient reading Chili Davis' 
comments in the morning newspaper Friday, but he has no plans to discuss them 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Thursday night that the Angels were using this year as another 
rebuilding season and were trying to save money instead of trying to field a 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can say what they want," Davis said, "but what we're doing right now 
is rebuilding and trying to save money." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, however, contends that the Angels are as committed to winning as any 
team in baseball, and if he deems it necessary, will make moves to benefit the 
team down the pennant stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has his own responses to the things we did," Bavasi said, "and I don't 
begrudge him that. I defend his right to say those things and feel that way. 
It's a frustrating time, he's having a great year, and we're not winning, I can 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can be a contender now. And if contending is being in first place, 
we're just 3 1/2 games out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels attempted to acquire left-handed reliever Mitch Williams, who 
recently was released by the Houston Astros, but were told that Williams will 
not pitch for the rest of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had interest if he was interesting in pitching this year," Bavasi said, 
"but we were told that is not the case." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Damion Easley was activated from the 15-day disabled list before Friday's game 
and immediately had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no glove. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought that he would not be moved from third base to second base until 
Eduardo Perez returned from triple-A Vancouver, but Manager Marcel Lachemann 
informed him that he would be permanently playing second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even bring a second baseman's glove," Easley said. "I thought it 
would be three weeks to a month before this happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like the start of a new season for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Easley, who borrowed Harold Reynolds' glove, went two for four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels made room for Easley by optioning infielder Rod Correia to 
Vancouver. BOB NIGHTENGALE

WORKER AT COLISEUM SAYS IT WILL BE READY FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coliseum will definitely be ready to hold football games by Sept. 1, 
according to a construction supervisor who has worked at the site since March. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Sutton, a carpenter superintendent for Tutor-Saliba, said this week 
that despite several setbacks in the last four months, work is on schedule to 
be completed before USC and the Raiders begin playing their home games there in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is scheduled to play host to Washington on Sept. 3, and the Raiders are 
scheduled to play their first home game against the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when it goes through your mind that you might not make it, 
especially when you looked around and saw so much work to be done," Sutton 
said. "But over the last couple of weeks, things have picked up and changed a 
little bit. The Raiders can go ahead and start selling tickets because we're 
going to be ready. We have enough guys to get it done now." 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 500 workers on two shifts, heavy construction is being done for 21 
hours a day. A major breakthrough is expected to come as soon as next week, 
when outside drilling is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're already starting to backfill around the outside," Sutton 
said. "Once drilling is completed, a lot of work will open up and we'll be able 
to go as fast as we want to. Two months is a long time to get a lot of work 
done when you're working around the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem in repairing the Coliseum has been the original underestimate 
of the work needed after the Northridge earthquake in January. Sutton said that 
follow-up inspections by engineers discovered more damage and forced crews to 
redo some of their previous work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came through and noticed a lot of stuff that they didn't see at first," 
Sutton said. "They made us make some corrections and move some things out. But 
one thing is for sure, and that is once we're done, the stadium will be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coliseum may be ready for football in September, work will 
continue during the week between weekend games, mainly on inside bathrooms and 
possibly the press box.

PALMER'S FINAL OPEN LEAVES HIM IN TEARS; GOLF: CROWD GIVES ARNIE A TWO-MINUTE 
OVATION AFTER HE IS ASSURED OF MISSING CUT WITH SECOND-ROUND 81. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Arnold Palmer could always shoot, and when he couldn't shoot any longer he 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't help himself. Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the fatigue, 
maybe it was the two-minute standing ovation from the crowd, which strained 
against the ropes and filled the grandstands at the 18th green to watch the 
64-year-old golfer walk up the fairway on the last hole of his last U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter so much that Palmer bogeyed No. 18 to close out the second -- 
and his final -- round in his 32nd U.S. Open with an 81. 
</P>
<P>
 What mattered to the fans at Oakmont Country Club was how they felt about 
Palmer and that they would never again see him in a U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who missed the cut for the final two rounds with his 36-hole total of 
158, had trouble composing himself. He broke down in a television interview at 
the end of his round and when he walked into the interview tent, his face was 
red and his eyes were puffy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean it is . . . you know . . . it is 40 years . . . of fun . . . work . . 
. enjoyment . . . ," Palmer said between long pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he shook his head. He buried his head in a towel and he cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked what has been the most fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh . . . I think . . . as I said many times recently . . . the whole 
experience," Palmer said, his voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose . . . the most important thing is the fact . . . that it has been . 
. . as good . . . as it has been to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said he had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked away in sort of the same way he left the 18th green, with a wave of 
his arm and tears in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 A little earlier, on the way down the 17th fairway, Palmer gave cheering fans 
a thumbs-up sign. One spectator yelled, "You're still the man!" Palmer smiled 
broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 He doffed his cap as he reached the 18th green when the noise from the people 
in the stands grew louder with each step. Palmer bowed slightly from the waist 
to more applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who had three-putted No. 14, No. 15, No. 16 and No. 17, finished with 
his fifth consecutive three-putt green. He shook the hands of playing partners 
Rocco Mediate and John Mahaffey, threw his arm around Mediate and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediate, who idolized Palmer as a child growing up in Greensburg, near 
Pittsburgh, felt fortunate to be playing in the same group with his hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "That ovation chilled me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times can you say you played with him (on his last U.S. Open 
round)?" Mediate said. "Only John and I can say that we did. I'll remember it 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room later, Palmer spoke to a handful of reporters. He said he 
nearly broke into tears at the reaction of the crowd on the 18th green. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably did more choking coming up the last fairway than I have the last 
40 years," he said.

 Fortunately for senior Carlos Velazco, his career in a Sylmar High baseball 
uniform ends today, rather than June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco will put on the Spartan pin-stripes for the final time today at 3:30 
p.m., when he pitches for the East team in the 18th annual Bernie Milligan high 
school all-star baseball game at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 He will probably walk off the mound today in better shape than June 1, the day 
he gave up 10 runs in 3 2/3 innings in the Spartans' 17-4 playoff loss to 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella pulled Velazco after five consecutive batters 
reached base in the fourth inning that day. It was only the second time in 
Velazco's two-year career at Sylmar that he was replaced in the middle of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco, 22-4 in two seasons, shook his head and shrugged his shoulders this 
week when asked to explain what went wrong with one of the area's most dominant 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple days after that I had all these thoughts in my head," 
Velazco said. "I thought, 'Maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was.' Maybe I 
was losing it. But then I got to thinking, that's just baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to happen to you no matter who you are or how good you are." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 earned runs Velazco allowed against Kennedy were as many as he yielded 
his entire junior season, when he was 11-1 with an 0.95 earned-run average. He 
finished his senior year with an 11-3 record and 1.80 ERA, although it was 1.09 
before the Kennedy game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he just might be the best pitcher I've coached, and I've coached some 
good ones," said Donatella, who recently completed his sixth season at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think Donatella didn't even remember Velazco after they were introduced 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco attended Hamilton High in West Los Angeles during his sophomore year, 
but his family then decided to move to Sylmar. A mutual friend of Velazco and 
Donatella introduced the two when he heard Velazco would be enrolling at 
Sylmar. They met at a Dodger game in the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Velazco did not show up at Sylmar in the fall of 1992 because of moving 
delays. When he did arrive, midway through the first semester, Velazco 
reintroduced himself to Donatella. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he remembered me from Dodger Stadium," Velazco said, "and he 
said, 'No. Not really.' So I kind of reminded him." 
</P>
<P>
 When Velazco first pitched for the Spartans, he was surprised to see the 
difference between high school baseball in the Valley and "over the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was just Hamilton or the whole city," Velazco said, "but 
we didn't take it real seriously down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco, who is nearly 6-feet tall and weighs a wispy 155 pounds, also said he 
could not throw his fastball past Valley hitters the way he had as a sophomore 
at Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up here, I wasn't (striking out) a lot of guys and I was wondering 'What's 
going on?' " Velazco said. "But later in the season, I realized I wasn't a 
strikeout guy, so I just worked hitting spots and letting them hit the ball, 
and that seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm feeling it, I hit spots really good. I can throw it wherever I want. 
I'm not like (El Camino Real's) Randy Wolf or (Monroe's) Joel Zamudio, who just 
overpower guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco will never be confused with those players, both of whom were selected 
in the major league draft earlier this month. Despite his statistics, Velazco 
was passed over in the draft because of his size and his modest 80 m.p.h. 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Most colleges also passed on Velazco until midway through the season when Cal 
State Northridge Coach Bill Kernen became interested. Velazco impressed Kernen 
with his intensity and signed with the Matadors earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems like my kind of coach and I think I'm his kind of player," Velazco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco is not afraid to occasionally knock down batters with a high fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some guys who are just chatter, chatter, chatter and you've got to 
do that," Velazco said. "I realize this is just high school, but this is where 
you start getting ready for college. I haven't (intentionally knocked down 
batters) too many times, just once or twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco also let his whiskers -- "beard" does not describe it -- grow so he 
could look more menacing at the plate this season. Maybe it worked. He drove in 
30 runs and hit .372 in his first season as a regular in the lineup. He also 
hit his first home run at any level. 
</P>
<P>
 " Everyone hits a home run in Little League, except me," said Velazco, who 
fiddled with a bat throughout a 30-minute interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Velazco, hitting doesn't matter. He probably will never step in the 
batter's box at Northridge. Kernen will be happy if Velazco can just pitch the 
way he did during his two years at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of June 1.

WOLF AND PARQUE WILL BE PITCHING UNDER THE GUN IN ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For left-handers Randy Wolf and Jim Parque, the added significance of this 
year's Bernie Milligan high school all-star baseball game might be found 
somewhere behind home plate, carrying a radar gun. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Terry Reynolds, the Dodgers' scouting director, who is expected 
to watch El Camino Real's Wolf and Crescenta Valley's Parque, the starting 
pitchers at the 18th annual game that starts today at 3:30 p.m. at Cal State 
Northridge. Both pitchers were selected by the Dodgers in the draft earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really (nervous)," Parque said. "I'll just go out there and do my 
job. Even if I screw up, he'll see that I can do something." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no shame for Parque (12-3, 0.49 earned-run average this season) 
or Wolf (12-3, 1.19) if they are less than perfect today. Parque is a member of 
East team, Wolf the West. They will face lineups drawn from the top seniors 
from Glendale to the Antelope Valley to Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The East team includes 10 players who batted .400 or better, led by Burbank's 
Brian Sindle (.540) and Hoover's Ron Pirayoff (.500). 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the team are Notre Dame's Justin Bunch (.479), Antelope Valley's Chris 
Tapia (.467, 43 runs batted in), Palmdale's Jerome Payton (.462, 37 stolen 
bases), Sylmar's Art Diaz (.447), Highland's Casey Cheshier (.438), Saugus' 
Danny Cato (.436), Poly's Sam Vizcarra (.425) and Montclair Prep's Matt Muler 
(.417). 
</P>
<P>
 The West's top hitters are Chatsworth shortstop Bryan LaCour (.481, 41 RBIs) 
and Simi Valley third baseman Ryan Hankins (.483, nine home runs). 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas' Josh Morton (.475), Reseda's Carlos Nunez (.463, seven home runs), 
Royal's Joel Mellinger (.451), and Moorpark's Jason Adamson (.435) and Rick 
Collier (.407) also play for the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Parque, the East's pitching staff includes Palmdale's David Glick 
(11-3, 1.38), Notre Dame's Rich Igou (11-2, 1.43) and Sylmar's Carlos Velazco 
(11-3, 1.80). 
</P>
<P>
 Other West pitchers includes Wolf, Newbury Park's Ray Clinton (10-3, 1.41), 
Chatsworth's Jim DeBiase (10-1, 2.44) and L.A. Baptist's Matt Hernandez (9-2, 
1.47). 
</P>
<P>
 The East team will be coached by Notre Dame's Tom Dill and Poly's Chuck 
Schwal, and the West by Chatsworth's Tom Meusborn and L.A. Baptist's Mark 
Bates.

BERGANIO MAKES GOOD ON WORD AND MAKES CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Berganio Jr. was right. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing with two bogeys down the stretch of the first round of the 
U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pa., he virtually guaranteed that 
he'd play better in the second round and pass some more prominent names. 
</P>
<P>
 Brash? Bingo. Accurate? Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio delivered Friday by firing a one-over-par 72, besting his first-round 
score by a shot, and assured himself of making the 36-hole cut on the demanding 
6,946-yard course. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio is tied with six players at 145, a group that includes Ben Crenshaw 
and Phil Mickelson. Colin Montgomerie of Scotland is the leader at 136. 
</P>
<P>
 While Berganio shaved a stroke from the first round, the details couldn't have 
been more different. On Thursday, Berganio said he played exceptionally well. 
On Friday, he scrambled on nearly every hole. Berganio used 26 putts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up and down from everywhere," Berganio said. "I hit it so (badly)." 
</P>
<P>
 On a tight, punitive course, Berganio was practically amazed that he could 
score so well and play so poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hitting long bunker shots to four feet, two feet," he said. "I got up 
and down from rough that was like hay." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Pate, who lives in Agoura Hills and played at UCLA, shot a 66 that left 
him at 140. Duffy Waldorf, who lives in Valencia and also played at UCLA, shot 
68 and is at 142. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Pavin, an Oxnard native and another former Bruin, shot 73 and is in 
danger of missing the cut at 151. Because of lighting storms in the area, 18 
players did not finish the round. The cut will not be announced until the round 
is finished early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, playing in his second Open and first as a professional, leads Fuzzy 
Zoeller and Davis Love III (146) among others.

WHERE THEY ARE NOW: RANDY SHIELDS; FORMER PUGILIST HOPES TO SCORE KNOCKOUT WITH 
MOVIE SCRIPT; BOXING: HE PUNCHES A KEYBOARD INSTEAD OF OPPONENTS TRYING FOR HIS 
BIG BREAK IN HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a scene straight out of a movie, but much more violent than the ones 
Randy Shields likes to write. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no cameras rolling, no director giving instructions, no actors in a 
make-believe world. This was real-life drama, with loaded guns and two hardened 
criminals looking for an excuse to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shields, 38, a screenwriter and former top-flight boxer who grew up and 
still lives in North Hollywood, could see the ending was not going to play well 
in Peoria. Or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened on a late summer night two years ago at a small restaurant on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard called Four 'N 20 Pie Shop. But for Shields, the images 
remain so vivid in his mind, it might as well have been yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting right here," Shields said the other day, as he recounted the 
terrifying event. "I was writing a scene for a screenplay when they came in and 
fired four shots into the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Two gunmen busted into the restaurant around midnight on Sept. 18, 1992, and 
demanded all the cash in the register. As they entered and blew out part of the 
ceiling with a shotgun blast, Shields dropped to the floor and crawled toward 
the back of the restaurant. One of the men saw Shields and fired a shot into 
the back of his left leg, but Shields escaped into a darkened back room. 
</P>
<P>
 When an employee, and then a customer, couldn't open the register as ordered, 
one of the gunmen threatened to kill someone. That's when Shields, who 
sometimes works as a bodyguard and has a license to carry a concealed weapon, 
realized he had to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled my gun and went out," Shields said. "I started shooting at them and 
they ran out, but I hit both of them. I hit one guy in the chest and the back, 
and I hit the other guy in the back. They made it home and called 911 and said 
they had been involved in a drive-by (shooting), but their stories didn't fool 
the police. They also had pretty long rap sheets." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, and the driver of the getaway car, are doing 18 years in prison. 
Shields, who possibly saved some lives that night, is still hanging out at his 
favorite eatery and churning out the stories he hopes to see on the big screen, 
usually from the table where not long ago he saw a Hollywood plot unfold before 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unleashing his imagination into story lines that would hold an audience 
captive is what makes Shields tick nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of his scripts has gone beyond the word processor, Shields 
spends hours -- often late into the night -- either at home or at the Four 'N 
20 polishing his work. And he says he could be close to a breakthrough with one 
of his stories if the pieces fall into place in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shields says he has a financial backer who will put up around $13 million to 
produce his latest finished project, a movie titled "Bagdad" that deals with 
the plight of a homeless man who, by chance, encounters the two grown sons he 
abandoned years before. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch, however, is that Charlie Sheen must agree to play the role of one 
of the sons for the money to come through, Shields said. Martin Sheen, father 
of Charlie and actor Emilio Estevez, is interested in playing the role of the 
dad, Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie's publicist has the script and (Charlie) is considering it," Shields 
said. "The writers have a Catch-22. You need the actors to sell the work but 
the actors are afraid to put their names on something that won't sell because 
they don't want the stigma. Hopefully, this one will work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the scripts he has written, Shields said, have nothing to do with 
boxing. He wants to be recognized as someone who has more to offer than his 
connection to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have several boxing stories but whether I do anything with them, I don't 
know," Shields said. "It has a lot to do with me wanting to establish myself as 
a writer first, rather than people thinking of me as a dumb ex-boxer who can 
only write about boxing." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shields admits that boxing has helped him make contacts in the film 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, I can break down a lot of doors because of boxing," Shields said. 
"But for (producers) to take me seriously as a writer is a tough sale." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before trying his luck at writing films, Shields was a leading protagonist in 
a genre in which showmanship, sport and brutality blend to entertain the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster in the late 1960s and early '70s, Shields established himself 
as a promising fighter, one who could throw damaging blows and also take a 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a world-class talent, it shows even at 14 or 15 years old," said 
Joe Goossen, the veteran Valley-based trainer who has known Shields since each 
was a teen-ager. "Randy was definitely beating up pros in the gym when he was 
that age. He was one of the cleanest-living fighters I've ever been around. He 
didn't smoke or drink, and he never missed a training session." 
</P>
<P>
 With his father, Sonny, a former boxer and longtime stuntman as his manager 
and trainer, Shields cruised through a 92-bout amateur career with 67 knockouts 
among his 88 victories. He won the 1973 national Amateur Athletic Union junior 
welterweight title with a convincing decision over Sugar Ray Leonard and 
competed internationally with the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, Shields turned professional and began a career that would pit 
him against some of the best fighters of his era -- and in some cases, of all 
time. But Shields' career also was marred by illness and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In his pro debut at the old Olympic Auditorium in 1974, for example, Shields 
jumped into the ring against journeyman Victor Abraham despite a 102-degree 
fever. He won a six-round decision but was knocked down for the only time in 
his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this cold and I couldn't breathe," Shields recalled, "so I went back 
for a breather and put my guard down. He caught me with a right hand." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Shields was trying to balance boxing with schoolwork at Valley 
College. But he had to give up the books because he was constantly training and 
fighting. In his first pro year, Shields fought 21 times. He devoted his spare 
time to writing poetry and short stories, and was already delving into 
screenwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1978, Shields and Leonard were crossing paths again, this time with money 
at stake. Leonard, on his way to becoming a legend, beat Shields in 10 rounds 
in Baltimore in what Shields considers one of his most memorable and difficult 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fights with Leonard were the toughest, both as an amateur and a pro," 
Shields said. "The hardest I've ever been hit was by Leonard. Didn't do 
anything to me, but he had this sharp, stinging punch that really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss to Leonard, Shields ascended the rankings. In 1979 he got a 
shot at the World Boxing Assn. welterweight title against Jose (Pipino) Cuevas, 
the hard-hitting Mexican champion who was considered virtually unbeatable. 
Shields lost a narrow and controversial decision to Cuevas in Chicago, and was 
preparing for a rematch when he faced Mauricio Aldana in a tuneup bout at the 
Sports Arena. He nearly didn't make it home in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
 After beating Aldana, fans chanting Cuevas' name turned on Shields when he 
left the ring. "The crowd started pummeling me," Shields said. "They threw a 
metal chair from the balcony and opened a gash on top of my head. Then someone 
slapped me on the right ear and perforated the ear drum." 
</P>
<P>
 Shields recovered, but not in time to fight Cuevas, who lost the WBA title to 
Thomas Hearns in 1980. Shields challenged Hearns a year later and fought 
essentially one-handed after he suffered a torn rotator cuff in his left 
shoulder while training a few days before the bout. Shields worked through the 
agonizing pain and was ahead on all three judges' scorecards until cuts over 
his eyes gave Hearns a TKO victory in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could squeeze by, but I could hardly move my arm," Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoulder, in fact, never quite healed and Shields, tired of living on 
painkillers, retired in 1983 with a 41-9-1 record. He attempted a comeback in 
September, 1990, and suffered a broken jaw in a 10-round junior middleweight 
victory over Stewart Baynes at the Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 That convinced him to quit for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Shields remains connected with the sport by training two amateur boxers he 
says will soon turn pro. He also does security work, but his real passion is 
the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love writing," Shields said. "I've had some job offers but this is what I 
want to do."

CLINE REPLACES WILLARD AS BASEBALL COACH AT CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Cline, a former standout athlete at Camarillo High, was named the 
Scorpions' new baseball coach on Friday, replacing Jack Willard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline, 27, a varsity assistant last year, will take over a 12-12 team that 
finished fifth in the Marmonte League with a 7-7 record under Willard, who 
resigned after five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really looking forward to it," Cline said. "When Jack resigned to spend 
more time with his family, I was hoping I could get the job. It's nice to be 
able to come back to your alma mater. I hope I can help this become a pretty 
good program." 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school senior in 1985, Cline played shortstop for a Scorpion team 
that finished second in the Southern Section major division. He also played 
quarterback for the football team that won the '84 Southern Section Coastal 
Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Camarillo, Cline was a four-year starter at third base 
for UCLA, where he roomed with Dodger first baseman Eric Karros for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline was drafted following his junior and senior years, but did not sign 
because of knee problems. Cline had surgery on his right knee three times 
during his career at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline became a graduate assistant for the UCLA baseball team in 1990, while he 
earned his teaching credential at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Cline assisted Willard with the Camarillo baseball team. After 
getting a teaching job at Thousand Oaks High in the fall of 1991, he assisted 
Lancer baseball Coach Jim Hansen during the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline was hired as a math and economics teacher at Camarillo in the fall of 
1992, and he coached the junior varsity football and baseball teams. He coached 
the junior varsity football team again last season.

 Hart High football fans can get a preview glimpse of their new quarterback 
today when Steve McKeon, a 5-foot-7, 150-pound junior, makes his varsity debut 
in a seven-man passing league game at the Watts Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The game may not mean a lot but as the team's quarterback, McKeon will be 
under pressure to live up to the school's ongoing tradition of producing great 
players at that position.  
</P>
<P>
 For nine consecutive years Hart has produced a quarterback who has earned 
All-Southern Section honors. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon follows Mike Kocicka, who last season ranked third in the area in 
passing (2,966 yards and 32 touchdowns) and was named to the All-Southern 
Section team. He will play at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, the Indians' sophomore quarterback last season, beat out senior Eric 
Negre for the starting varsity position, replacing Kocicka. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to have a different style than Kocicka," Hart Coach Mike 
Herrington said. "He's real quick and he has a good arm, but not a great one." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-3 and 200 pounds, Kocicka was a dominating force in the pocket and an 
explosive passer. That won't be the case with McKeon, Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not going to be a pro-style quarterback, but he's going to win games 
for us," Herrington said. "One of the big things about him is that he has great 
mobility." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians have a first-round bye in the 48-team tournament and will meet the 
winner of this morning's Bell-Chatsworth game at 3 p.m. at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events in the Watts Summer Games -- developed by the Los Angeles Chamber 
of Commerce after the 1965 Watts Riots -- are scheduled throughout the 
Southland, including sites at USC, Inglewood High and Fairfax High. The games 
are reportedly the nation's largest high school athletic competition, featuring 
more than 12,000 athletes from throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 They will compete in 15 sports over two weekends. Basketball, baseball, 
softball, soccer, water polo and track are some of the main attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball is the biggest event, with 128 boys' teams and 64 girls' teams. 
Boys' teams include Marmonte League co-champion Agoura, West Valley League 
champion Cleveland, Canyon, the Foothill League's second-place team, and Buena, 
the Channel League runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Area girls' teams include Kennedy, Notre Dame, Taft and Crescenta Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's boys' games will be played at Dorsey and Inglewood highs, and 
the girls will play at Crenshaw and Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Kennedy and Burroughs join Hart as football 
representatives from the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-team baseball tournament features three area teams, including Mission 
League champion Notre Dame. The Knights reached the semifinals of the Southern 
Section Division I playoffs and finished with a 21-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame will play Tustin today at 1 p.m. at Bell High. Kennedy (17-11), the 
North Valley League's second-place team, will meet Etiwanda today at Compton 
College at 3 p.m. Grant (12-12) will play Brea-Olinda at 3 p.m. at West L.A. 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, Kennedy and Canyon are the only area softball teams competing.  
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar lost in the semifinals of the City 4-A championships and Canyon lost in 
the semifinals of the Southern Section Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham will participate in track and Crespi is entered in water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 Physically challenged athletes will participate in the games for the third 
consecutive year. They will be integrated with the rest of the athletes and 
will compete in the same events.

RANCHO CUCAMONGA'S FLANNERY APPROACHES JOB WITH A PASSION; BASEBALL: HE WILL DO 
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TO HELP HIS QUAKES BE SUCCESSFUL. 
</P>

<P>
 Tim Flannery learned early in his managerial career how best to motivate a 
team. Of course, this technique takes a unique set of circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
 First, you have to get yourself ejected from the game during a bench-clearing 
brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, your team has to rally from a seven-run deficit to tie the score going 
into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while listening to the game on the radio in your office, the team mascot 
must wander into the clubhouse for a drink of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'You're done for tonight,' and I put on the costume," Flannery 
said. "Then I went out and sat on the bench in the dugout. I didn't say a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got some runners on base in the ninth, but we got out of it. I did a 
dance to 'Louie, Louie' in between innings and went back to the dugout and 
started high-fiving guys and yelling, 'C'mon, let's go.' They recognized my 
voice and went crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we scored and won." 
</P>
<P>
 Flannery was a rookie manager last season with the Spokane Indians, the San 
Diego Padres' short-season Class A affiliate, when he made his debut as an 
entertainer. This year, he's managing the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and getting 
along just fine without the dinosaur costume. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quakes are 41-25 and in second place in the Class-A California League, and 
they are winning by playing "Timmy Ball" -- the kind of play Pete Rose would 
love, a style that made Flannery one of the most popular players in Padre 
history despite a .257 career batting average, a style that made him a coach's 
favorite at every level from Anaheim High to Chapman College to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was playing, I took the attitude, 'If I die out there tonight, so be 
it,' " Flannery said. "They said I hustled, or was smart, or got the most out 
of my abilities. But that passion took me to a level where I was able to play 
with big league ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion isn't just the key to baseball. Lack of passion is why marriages 
fail. Passion is the reason Bruce Springsteen can play the same song every 
night in every town, but you would never know it. And if a kid doesn't have 
passion at this level, how is he going to put up with 20-hour bus rides or 
someone telling him he'll never play in the big leagues? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have it here," he says, pointing at his chest, "you can make it. And 
if you really want to make it, I'll take you by the hand and teach you 
everything I can about how to get there and how to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Thompson, a first baseman who played at Laguna Hills High School and 
Saddleback College, was introduced to professional baseball by Flannery last 
season at Spokane. Now, he's leading the California League with a .364 batting 
average and 60 runs batted in, and is leading the Quakes in home runs (13). 
</P>
<P>
 "I love his hard-nosed style, the get-'em-on-and-get-'em-over approach," 
Thompson said. "He taught me how to play pro ball. I got really lucky and now 
I'm playing for him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a guy who didn't have as much talent as plenty of guys who never made 
it to the big leagues, but he made it and stuck there all those years because 
he was smart and had the drive. He teaches you how to win, not just the way to 
play, but the little subtleties of how to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be a fool not to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Flannery is the fourth Class A manager that catcher Sean Mulligan has played 
for and he's no fool. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real leader who the players respect," Mulligan said. "I've played for 
teams that lacked leadership, but this is the way the game should be taught." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the message sometimes is scrambled during the communication process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are frustrations," Flannery said, laughing. "Not everyone understands 
they must be motivated and you have to handle every player differently. Some 
need a kick in the butt. Some need a hug. And I'm learning that everyone hears 
differently, or listens differently." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take Flannery long to develop a credo for managing Class A ball and 
maintaining sanity: Take nothing for granted.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tell the guys that when you're on third with less than two outs, you tag up 
on any ball hit in the air. Sometimes an infielder will make a great diving 
catch, but if he falls hard or ends up on his belly, you can score. And we've 
scored a lot that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the other night, a little jam shot was hit to second and I yelled, 'Tag 
up.' He tagged up and then just went home. He was out by 10 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, Flannery will remember to say it's OK to stay put after tagging up 
if you're going to be out by 10 feet. And the player probably will have learned 
from his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids really relate to him," said pitching coach Dean Treanor. "I've had 
phone calls from players who have moved up and really miss what Tim brings to 
the clubhouse. He is able to stress learning the game in a positive, upbeat way 
that is especially important at this level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to make sure he stays away from the hitters. We don't want them 
to emulate that weenie swing of his." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flannery retired in 1989 after 11 seasons and 972 games in a Padre uniform. In 
1984, his RBI single was a key hit in Game 4 of the National League 
Championship Series and his hard grounder that skipped past Leon Durham ignited 
a four-run seventh inning the next day as the Padres clinched a spot in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 His lone World Series appearance was a pinch-hit single in Game 4. He hit .281 
in 1985 and .280 in '86 and still holds the club record for second baseman with 
a .993 fielding percentage that season. But an ankle injury in 1987 marked the 
beginning of the end. Hobbled and unable to maintain his usual level of hustle, 
Flannery finally retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had lost a step I couldn't afford to lose and I was in pain," he said. "I 
knew I didn't want to be there anymore, so I couldn't compete anymore. It was a 
very easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 He took a job as a television reporter for San Diego's CBS affiliate and, as 
if he were heading into second trying to stretch a single into a double, he 
dived in head-first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched one baseball game a year for two years," he said. "I didn't do any 
sports-related stories and I was learning the business. It's a very competitive 
arena and I enjoyed it, but I couldn't see myself doing it the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Flannery had lunch with Padre President Dick Freeman and wondered aloud if 
there was a place for him in the organization as an instructor. A few months 
later, his boss at the station called him into his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they wouldn't be able to renew my contract when it expired in six 
months," Flannery said. "I smiled and said, 'Thanks.' And then I quit." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Donna, whom he had met when she was a sophomore at Savanna High, 
made him stay with the television station two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted me to get enough money to make another car payment," he says. 
"Then I called the Padres and went to the instructional league. The third day 
there, I had decided this is what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Flannery says he was "a foot soldier" who never had a million-dollar contract. 
These days, he makes about the same as a first-year teacher. And as soon as 
school is out, Donna and son, Daniel, and daughters, Virginia and Kelly, will 
drive up from their home in Leucadia to live in an unfurnished, one-bedroom 
apartment near the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got mattresses on the floor," he says, smiling. "We'll be camping out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly the lap of luxury, but don't tell Flannery he's not a wealthy 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a player, I had physical limitations," he said. "Now, as a 
manager, I have no physical limitations. I can steal bases through these 
healthy, young bodies. Just put on the steal sign and watch them go. I get just 
as excited as if I did it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his relative experience, Flannery's name has come up as a replacement 
for Padre Manager Jim Riggleman. The Padres are already 16 games under .500 and 
9 games behind in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 If offered the job, he would say "Aye, aye, I guess," but he won't be 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about it," he said. "There's no way to say anything 
without getting in trouble. I don't know where the rumor started, probably by 
some elevator operator in San Diego. Well, I'm flattered, but I don't want to 
say any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he is happy -- no, make that ecstatic -- where he is. The Quakes are 
drawing an average of 5,700 fans to the Epicenter, a beautiful 6,100-seat 
facility that opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that I'm here today doing what I love to do," he said. "This is 
something I preach all the time. Everybody is so worried about the final 
destination, in this case the big leagues, that they forget about the joy of 
the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like when I was a player. I don't have that need to get to the big 
leagues. I want to teach these young men. These kids have dreams. They're alive 
and I feed off that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it more than I loved playing."

GAYHART LEADS FROM START TO FINISH FOR FIRST VICTORY

<P>
 Malibu's Adail Gayhart went wire-to-wire in winning the 20-lap Street Stock 
feature Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory of the season for Gayhart, who came into the race 
seventh in the points standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Paul Moore of Oak View, the series leader, spent most of 
the race running 10 lengths behind Gayhart in second place, before mounting a 
late challenge on lap 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore's challenge fell short, as Ventura's Randy McGraw, a two-time 
winner, slipped around Moore in Turn 2 on the last lap and held on for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bartels of Marina del Rey, who ran second for the first five laps and 
helped Moore pressure Gayhart for most of the race, finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria's Ryan Cole added to his points lead in the IMCA Modified class by 
winning his fourth 15-lap Main event victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Doug Thornton finished second despite a first-lap collision with 
Santa Maria's Bill Lauer that spun Thornton in turn one, bringing on a caution 
flag and forcing Thornton to start from the back of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Gary Howard won the 15-lap IMCA Sprint Main. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Dunson of Ventura won his fourth 15-lap Mini Stock Main Event.

UNBEATEN BULLFROGS START SLOWLY, THEN LEAP TO 11-6 VICTORY; ROLLER HOCKEY: 
AFTER FALLING BEHIND BY ONE GOAL IN FIRST QUARTER, ANAHEIM DOMINATES 
SACRAMENTO. 
</P>

<P>
 There wasn't much suspense in the Bullfrogs' 11-6 victory over the Sacramento 
River Rats Friday night at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bullfrogs erased a one-goal deficit in the first quarter, Victor 
Gervais led the onslaught, scoring five goals to help the Bullfrogs cruise past 
Sacramento in a Roller Hockey International game before an announced crowd of 
8,126. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cook and Brad McCaughey each had one goal and three assists for the 
Bullfrogs (3-0), the defending RHI champions, who received only a minor 
challenge from a team seeking its first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bullfrogs scored a season-high 11 goals, Coach Grant Sonier 
wasn't pleased with his team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I was very unimpressed," Sonier said. "I was very disappointed in 
the team's discipline; people doing jobs they're not designated to do. I'm 
happy to be 3-0, but I question if we will win if we play like we played 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Bullfrogs were too much for the River Rats (0-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento is experiencing growing pains in its first season, allowing an 
average of 10 goals per game. The team signed seven new players for Friday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Hyrtsak, who was an all-star with the RHI Connecticut Coasters last 
season, joined the team late and missed the first two games. But he still leads 
the team in scoring. Hyrtsak had a goal and an assist Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent addition, former San Jose SharkLink Gaetz, also caused a stir 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaetz, a 6-foot-1, 210-pound defenseman who led the Sharks in penalty minutes 
in the 1991-92 season, tangled with Bullfrog defenseman Yuri Krivokhija and 
McCaughey during one sequence in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs played the second half short-handed because forward Jim Brown, 
who had two goals, received a game-misconduct penalty midway through the third 
period. Goalie Rob Laurie, who had 37 saves, stopped Todd Forsyth on the 
ensuing penalty shot to preserve the lead at 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 With 58 seconds remaining in the third quarter, Darren Perkins received a 
10-minute misconduct penalty, and although the River Rats drew within 7-5 on a 
goal by Damien Steirt early in the fourth quarter, Gervais scored twice and 
Cook scored another goal in a 2 1/2-minute span to make it 10-5 with 5:13 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The River Rats grabbed the Bullfrogs' attention early in the first quarter, 
scoring two goals in a 14-second span to take a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento converted two consecutive two-on-one situations, tying the score, 
1-1, when Forsyth scored off a perfect feed from Hyrtsak with 8 minutes 20 
seconds remaining in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen seconds later, Rob McCaig and Darren Houghton broke in and slid the 
puck under Laurie for a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead lasted for five minutes before the Bullfrogs responded with five 
consecutive goals, including two short-handed scores. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Roller hockey made its debut at the Forum in Montreal, and a crowd of 10,074 
watched the Roadrunners defeat visiting New Jersey, 7-5. New Jersey drew a 
crowd of 12,583 for its home opener. Average attendance for the league's first 
30 games is 4,272. . . . The Bullfrogs play host to Oakland on Sunday at The 
Pond of Anaheim, a rematch of last season's RHI championship series. . . . 
Forward Bobby McKillop, who sprained his knee in practice last week, could be 
cleared to skate Monday and return to action Thursday when the Bullfrogs play 
host to San Jose. . . . All Bullfrog games will be broadcast on KORG-AM 1190.

<P>
 Shannon Jones has completed her senior softball season for Cal State 
Northridge, but her college athletic career might not be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, an All-American third baseman, said Friday that she is considering 
trying out for the Northridge basketball team.She would have one season of NCAA 
Division I eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is 5-foot-10, last played competitive basketball at Mira Loma High 
in Sacramento, where she was an All-City forward. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge, she played on a championship intramural basketball team along 
with two other Northridge softball players. 
</P>
<P>
 A business major who is roughly a year short of earning her degree, Jones will 
consider all options before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing basketball would make it tougher on me academically, but I would also 
like to enjoy my final year athletically," Jones said. MIKE HISERMAN

NORTHRIDGE'S KERNEN HOPES TO RELIVE THE PAST; BASEBALL: COACH RENEWS HIS QUEST 
FOR PLAYERS WITH DEDICATION AND A STRONG WORK ETHIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the risk of sounding like a dinosaur -- or worse, a man with no sense of 
humor -- Coach Bill Kernen believes he has discovered a direct correlation 
between last season's Cal State Northridge baseball team and the decline of 
America's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, about the time Northridge completed a 25-30 campaign -- its 
worst in Kernen's six seasons -- the coach recalled watching a television news 
segment about a college student who, during a press conference, asked President 
Clinton what style of undergarments he wears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the '60s, supposedly one of the most lenient, 
let-it-all-hang-out, out-of-society generations in the history of human 
history," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have never, even remotely, crossed anybody's mind to stand up at a 
university press conference and ask (John F. Kennedy) what kind of underwear he 
wears. Not even the biggest pothead. That would have never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, according to Kernen, "He answered her!" 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it: Kids -- even Presidents -- ain't what they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen has been a baseball coach for 17 years, always working with young 
adults. He has seen changes, and not many have been for the better, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids today are weaker," Kernen said. "They're less dedicated with what 
they want to do. They're less responsible. And you know what? Some of that is 
not their fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody takes responsibility for anything anymore, not even murder. This 
three-strikes-and-you're-out thing -- the new tough law. You have to be 
convicted of three major felonies before they finally take you out of society. 
. . . That's what kind of message they're getting, the kind of 
non-responsibility environment they're growing up in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the little things you ask them to do for a baseball program and it's 
like, 'You've gotta be kidding me! You want me to do what? ' 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what this sounds like, but it's the truth. The kind of guys I'm 
looking for are getting fewer and far between." 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, Kernen in recent years has failed to recruit enough 
players willing to meet his often daunting standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in March, he went so far as to bench most of his starters, bar his 
players from their locker room and take away their uniforms because he said the 
Matadors' poor attitude and lackadaisical work habits were denigrating the 
accomplishments of previous Northridge teams. 
</P>
<P>
 March Madness, indeed. In some circles, Kernen's rampage already is legend. 
Out on the recruiting trail, however, the coach reports no backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everyone can't play for me," Kernen said. "This place is not for the 
weak, meek or uncommitted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Kernen's third year and Northridge's first season of NCAA Division I 
competition, the Matadors fell three outs short of earning a trip to the 
College World Series in Omaha. Kernen refers to that team, which included 
juniors Craig Clayton, Scott Sharts, Greg Shockey and Ken Kendrena, as the 
"only legitimate team" he has coached at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were one of the best eight teams (in the nation) that year," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the coach defines "legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge earned regional playoff invitations the following two years, too, 
but hasn't again made it close enough to earning a trip to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Key injuries to pitchers have hurt the Matadors the past three seasons. Then 
there was the 1994 debacle, which might have been avoided, Kernen said, had he 
exercised better judgment while recruiting the past few years. "I make some 
mistakes with a couple of guys and all hell breaks loose," he said. "That's why 
I have to make sure that doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen, who has a record of 212-125-3 at Northridge, accepts blame for 
detouring from his normally taxing recruiting routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while there I might have gotten caught up in thinking that the 
(coaching) system was going to work no matter who the players were," Kernen 
said. "There were a couple of guys in this program this year who I never saw 
play (before signing them). That's not an intelligent approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen signed nothing but high school seniors -- no junior college players or 
transfers -- in 1989, his first year, and the core of that recruiting class was 
the nucleus of his best teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen got his first taste of a winning team when he helped direct Cal State 
Fullerton to the NCAA Division I title in 1979 as an assistant to Augie 
Garrido. He began his coaching career at San Gorgonio High School in 1974, 
staying until 1976, when he became an assistant at Orange Coast College. In 
1977, he joined the Titans' staff and followed Garrido to Illinois in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can Kernen do it again? If not, it won't be for lack of effort. Two weeks ago, 
Kernen rose at 5 a.m., caught an early flight to Oakland, rented a car, drove 
to California's Berkeley campus and attended a daylong tryout for a high school 
all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, he caught another plane home. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in the tryout, scouts and dozens of college coaches huddled 
over lunch; the players rested or went to lunch with their parents. Kernen, 
meanwhile, hung around the field, and spotted a young man headed for the Cal 
batting cages. Kernen followed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cages had a self-feeding machine. The player opened his baseball 
bag, pulled out a sack lunch, turned on the machine, and hit for an extra 
half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting rules prohibited Kernen from talking to the player at the tryout. 
So he just stood there and watched, nibbling on his own sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 At a similar tryout last season, Kernen spotted Eric Gillespie, a freshman 
catcher who led Northridge in hitting last season with a .342 batting average. 
When he first took over the Matadors, Kernen routinely attended Connie Mack and 
American Legion games, as well as the usual circuit of all-star games and 
tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw Shockey and Mike Solar, another former Northridge standout, playing in 
a summer league game at Long Beach's Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen prefers to see prospects play several times in as many different 
situations as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, he positions himself as closely and as inconspicuously as possible to 
the dugout, so he can hear what is being said and gather as much information 
about the player's temperament as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled seeing a tall and talented high school pitcher dominate a high 
school game this season, then get ripped at an all-star tryout a few weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen eliminated that guy, not because he got hit hard, but because he argued 
with the umpire and later with his teammates. Another pitching prospect blew a 
2-0 lead when he committed a throwing error after fielding a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen watched that player come back to the dugout, go off into a corner, and 
quietly attempt to retain his composure. 
</P>
<P>
 That player, though physically less talented, has been offered a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to see how fast they can run, how far they can throw a ball, how 
hard they can throw, how big they are -- anybody can do that in a short period 
of time," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always recruited character and personality more than talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen is altering his system, but he still believes in it. With the right 
young men, he said, his training methods work. 
</P>
<P>
 The best example of that? Not the 1991 season, he said, but 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I told (the players) in the final team meeting," Kernen said. "As 
bad as all this stuff was, we still played about .500 and were in the (Western 
Athletic Conference West Division) race all the way to the end. That's how 
strong this stuff is." 
</P>
<P>
 That understood, Kernen said, he won't stand for a repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have another year like this year, I'll be gone," he said, "because that 
will mean either one of two things: Either I'm not doing an effective job 
anymore, or what I want to get accomplished can't be done here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding won't be easy at a time when much of the Northridge campus still is 
in shambles from the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, Robinson had a player on the Loyola Marymount campus making an 
official recruiting visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that Kernen had been talking to the same player, Robinson took the young 
man into a large green, boxcar-like shed where the Loyola baseball team stores 
its equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around," Robinson told the befuddled player. "This is pretty much the 
way the English Department looks over at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really. Maybe there are some windows and a few lights, but basically it's the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough said. Robinson expects the player to sign a letter of intent with 
Loyola next week.

 Jim Reach knew France wasn't a baseball hotbed, but he still couldn't believe 
what he was seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were driving on a bumpy dirt road, winding through trees and fields, and 
we kept wondering, 'Where the hell could this baseball field be?' " said Reach, 
the former baseball coach at Rancho Santiago College and Savanna High. 
</P>
<P>
 Reach and his partner Pat Doyle soon arrived at their destination in a 
countryside near Mantes La Jolie, about 40 miles west of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally saw a forested area, and beyond the trees, coming out of the 
middle of nowhere was a baseball field, just like the one in the movie 'Field 
of Dreams.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball diamond was in the middle of a field, but it was not a corn 
field. The pitcher's rubber was made of plywood, and a nearby batting cage was 
surrounded by a small forest, Reach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who built it was this older Frenchman who played like a little 
leaguer," Reach said. "He couldn't play the game of baseball that well, but he 
loved it. This guy was a fanatic and he couldn't get enough of it." 
</P>
<P>
 For eight weeks in France last summer, Reach and Doyle -- the baseball coach 
at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton -- were ambassador/coaches for Major 
League Baseball International. The pair taught baseball fundamentals to people 
of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked with everyone from the French national team, which hopes to 
qualify for the Olympics in Atlanta, to 30-year-olds trying baseball for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a marvelous experience," Reach said. "I can't wait to get back there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, one of Reach's former players will return to France. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills Coach Bob Canary, and San Clemente Coach Paul Prinz, will travel to 
France for the third consecutive summer to teach baseball to kids ages 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a grass-roots program," said Canary, who played for Reach in 1968 and 
helped Savanna win the Southern Section Major Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is not real popular in France, and the kids who like baseball don't 
have much opportunity to learn about the game. This is one of the few chances 
they have to learn from qualified coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is based in Lablachere, a small, rural village in southern France. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a couple of hours north of Marseilles," Canary said. "Only 400-500 
people live there, although it comes alive in the summer because of the 
tourists. But baseball is completely foreign in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Andree Penney, an Irvine resident who was born and raised in France, started 
the camp in 1992. She owns a large house in Lablachere, where the campers will 
stay from July 20-Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to bring over American kids and use baseball as medium to 
integrate them with the French kids," Canary said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Canary and Prinz do not speak French, baseball served as an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports is something where language isn't much of a barrier," Canary said.  
</P>
<P>
 But there were other obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no facilities whatsoever," Canary said. "Most games are played on 
soccer fields, so there are no backstops. Paul and I would laugh sometimes 
because the fields were so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we saw some fields like that in the U.S., we'd turn around and go home. 
But after awhile over there, you don't worry about it. The kids don't know the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 And the kids keep Canary coming back for more. "It's amazing how stimulated 
these kids are," Canary said. "That's one of the great attractions of going 
there. It's just baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Canary's Dana Hills team was ranked No. 1 in the county in one 
preseason poll, but the Dolphins missed the playoffs when they lost to Mission 
Viejo, 6-4, on the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, here we get caught up in the competitiveness of winning and 
losing," Canary said. "But you go there and feel liberated just to coach 
baseball at an elementary level, working with kids who are out there for the 
pure enjoyment of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's like being a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were other benefits for Canary besides the baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a well-rounded camp," he said. "We take the kids on a canoe trip, 
hiking, horseback riding . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every meal we had was a French feast," Canary said. "I probably never ate 
better in my life. And of course, Paul and I figured since we were in France, 
we have to sample the wine." 
</P>
<P>
 On their first trip, Canary and Prinz also went to the Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is growing in Europe," Reach said. "The French would love to bring 
major league baseball players over for an exhibition, but I've already told 
them there's no way a major leaguer would risk his career playing on some of 
these fields here." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the major leagues already have reached France. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Reach, Major League Baseball memorabilia is very popular in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything with the Mets or Dodgers logo, a baseball cap, a jersey, it's a 
fashion statement there," Reach said. "A major league baseball cap that would 
be $16-18 in the U.S. is $60-70 in France. The same goes for T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "French people don't even know who Darryl Strawberry or Roger Clemens are, but 
they don't care. It's a multimillion-dollar industry." 
</P>
<P>
 For Reach, the exchange of cultures was just as important as the exchange of 
baseball knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something I always will remember was when I went to Normandy," Reach said. "I 
had goose bumps. It was so beautiful, serene and peaceful now, it was just 
unbelievable thinking about what had happened there. It was a tremendous 
education."
