 BAD DAY: So what if today is Friday the 13th! After all, do people really take 
all that bad luck stuff seriously? You bet they do. . . . Just ask Henry De 
Miranda, owner of the Aquarius Bookstore in Chatsworth, which specializes in 
Tarot card readings and astrology. "People won't schedule appointments for this 
day," he said. "Most people think there are just better days than Friday the 
13th." 
</P>
<P>
 DILEMMA: The sexual harassment suit against President Clinton has, of course, 
become a hot topic for tabloid talk shows such as "Maury Povich"(E1). . . . The 
issue has also caused plenty of discussion among feminists. . . . "A lot of 
women favored Clinton because he had a better stance on women's issues," said 
Tricia Oeser, NOW coordinator in the Valley, "but if this is true, this will be 
a tremendous letdown." 
</P>
<P>
 PATIENCE: If you demand instant results, the Desert Tortoise Natural Area 
outside California City is not the place for you. Rather, it's better suited to 
patient visitors willing to look for hours with the chance of not finding 
tortoises. . . . Naturalist Chuck Boland (above) has a stuffed tortoise on the 
grounds that he can show to visitors. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 SECOND TRY: In baseball, there's always the next game. And for the all-woman 
Colorado Silver Bullets, that couldn't come soon enough. They lost 19-0 in 
their opening contest, but they'll get another opportunity today in Mesa, Ariz. 
. . . "We need to work on our fundamentals," said ex-Cal State Northridge 
softball star Missy Cress. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG WEEKEND: Meanwhile, Missy's former team hasn't missed a beat without her. 
In fact, the third-ranked Matadors trail first-place Fresno State and Utah by 
just one game heading into the final weekend of the season. . . . Plenty is at 
stake, as well, for the school's baseball team, which, despite a season of 
disappointments and distractions, has a chance for a division title (C10).

 NO JOKE: The people now running the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library aren't 
usually thought of as a bunch of jokesters. . . . But on Tuesday they host a 
conference to answer the question: "Do conservatives have a sense of humor?" 
The lineup includes the satirical songsters "The Capitol Steps," political 
humorist P.J. O'Rourke and, no kidding, Dan Quayle. The former veep, who fed 
stand-up comics years of material just by misspelling potato , will be there to 
flog his book, "Standing Firm." Tickets are $45.

 STAND & DELIVER: Attacks on "zoot-suiters" continue to inflame the passions of 
Alice McGrath. . . . The social justice crusader is best known for her part in 
the successful campaign to free the zoot-suit clad Latinos convicted in the 
infamous Sleepy Lagoon murder case in 1942. On Thursday, she left her Ventura 
home to support a teacher suspended for trying to show the movie "Zoot Suit" to 
11th-graders in San Diego County. "If we deny schoolchildren information about 
injustices," McGrath said, "they will not become informed and responsible 
citizens."

 UP IN ARMS: As Congress inches toward banning semiautomatic weapons, gun 
lovers are dashing to their favorite gun shops. Store owners from Oxnard to 
Simi Valley report a run on guns that exceeds the frantic sales after the Los 
Angeles riots (B1). . . . Their customers are going bananas over rapid-fire 
guns and ammo. "I sold 50 high-capacity handguns in one day," said Fillmore 
shopkeeper Gary Creagle. "I think Bill and Hillary have got to be working for 
the firearms industry."

 REGIONAL LEADER: Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn has garnered another 
title: He is the new president of the California Assn. of Council Governments. 
Recently elected to the post by local leaders across the state, Flynn wants to 
halt parochial fights in Sacramento and push regional solutions on issues from 
cleaning up air pollution to making water available to thirsty areas. Said he: 
"I consider myself a regional leader."

BRITISH LABOR PARTY LEADER JOHN SMITH DIES AT 55 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opposition leader John Smith died from a heart attack Thursday, creating a 
crisis for the Labor Party just as it was looking strong enough to regain 
control of the government after 15 years on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's death at age 55 came as Labor was hoping to exploit weaknesses in John 
Major's Conservative Party, which has governed Britain since the election of 
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament was stunned. Speaker of the House Betty Boothroyd faced a crowded, 
silent House of Commons to announce Smith's death in a shaking voice. All 
business was canceled so lawmakers could hold an afternoon tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had recovered from a near-fatal heart attack in 1988, was at his 
London home Thursday when he was stricken again. He was taken to nearby St. 
Bartholomew's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Party was left wondering "how we move forward in the light of this 
tragedy," spokesman Dave Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 No Labor leader stood out as a clear favorite to succeed Smith, probably 
ensuring a fight over the party's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 A robust and eloquent Scot with a witty and combative parliamentary style, 
Smith had led the party to its highest standing against the Conservatives in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a moving tribute to Smith in the Commons on Thursday afternoon, Major said 
his opponent could "shape and move the will of the House" with his formidable 
debating style. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith took over the party leadership from Neil Kinnock in 1992 after Labor's 
fourth consecutive general election loss to the Conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many Labor politicians with strong socialist views, Smith was from the 
right wing of his party. He was seen as a force that could draw his party 
further toward the center and make it more palatable to British voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith grew up in western Scotland, the son of a village school headmaster. He 
joined the Labor Party at age 14, trained as a lawyer at Glasgow University and 
was elected to Parliament in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and three daughters.

ERIK ERIKSON, 91; PIONEERING PSYCHOANALYST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erik Erikson, a psychoanalyst who extended Freudian theory into adolescence 
and adulthood and coined the phrase "identity crisis," died Thursday. He was 
91. 
</P>
<P>
 Erikson died at the Rosewood Manor Nursing Home, said Diana Eck, a Harvard 
professor and friend. 
</P>
<P>
 His book "Gandhi's Truth" won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 In it and other books, such as "Young Man Luther" in 1958, Erikson encouraged 
the psychoanalytic study of historical figures. He also wrote biographies of 
Jesus, Albert Einstein, William James and Charles Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
 With the books on Gandhi and Luther alone, one reviewer noted, "Erikson has 
single-handedly rescued psychoanalytic biography from neglect and disrepute." 
</P>
<P>
 His work helped popularize psychoanalysis and he has been called "the most 
widely known and read psychoanalyst in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Erikson, who broke major ground in the study of human development, emphasized 
social relationships rather than sexual needs as the key to growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "As they used to say of Gandhi, he was a mahatma, a great soul," said Eck, 
"very wise, a very wide-ranging humanist and someone who really illuminated the 
stages of the life cycle from birth to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Born to Danish parents on June 15, 1902, in Frankfurt, Germany, Erikson 
graduated from the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute and studied under Anna 
Freud. He immigrated to the United States in 1933 and became a naturalized 
citizen in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 A professor emeritus at Harvard University, where he retired in 1970, Erikson 
had also taught and practiced at Yale, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, San 
Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan., 
the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Mass., Western Psychiatric Institute in 
Pittsburgh, MIT and the University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other books were "Childhood and Society" in 1950, "Identity and the 
Life Cycle" in 1959, "Identity: Youth and Crisis" in 1968, "Toys and Reasons: 
Stages in the Ritualizations of Experience" in 1976, and a collection of his 
papers, "A Way of Looking at Things: Selected Papers from 1930 to 1980" in 
1987.

 An erogenous state (on the East Coast): Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex 
therapist, was as funny as ever during a recent talk before the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons. But, observed Joseph Feinstein of Sherman Oaks, some 
unintentional humor could also be found in the printed version of her speech 
that flashed on the four large screens in the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, host of the "Teen Talk" television show, reports that the word 
vibrator appeared on the screen as "va brighter." Semen was "see men." And a 
part of the female anatomy was spelled "virginia."

 Tu tu cool: When the Chiat-Day ad agency printed up flyers for a 10-K run in 
Venice last year, it described the starting point as the corner of "Rose and 
Main, where the transvestite ballerina clown also kicks up his/her heels."

<P>
 Sure, Jonathan Borofsky's "Ballerina Clown" is a local landmark. But, believe 
it or not, some critics have declined to take the sculpture seriously.

 Now, Sunset magazine has put any doubts about its greatness to rest by 
including the big guy/gal in an article on L.A.'s "world-class art." Obviously, 
the magazine's judges were touched, as we always are, by the figure's 
beseeching gesture, the winsome expression, the red nose, the blue brassiere. .

 LBJ -- the Southern California year: While Richard Nixon's local links are 
well-known, Lyndon B. Johnson also worked here -- as a law clerk in San 
Bernardino in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 And, judging from Robert Caro's biography, Johnson qualifies as a prototype of 
the L.A. driver. Once, racing to make an important appointment, Johnson was 
caught in Labor Day traffic between L.A. and San Berdoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was a two-lane road, Caro writes, LBJ "had to get cars in his lane to 
pull off to the side . . . if he wanted to pass them. And the horn on (the) car 
didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 A fellow clerk recalls how Johnson would "pull right up behind some car and 
bang the side of his door, just smash it -- hard -- with his open palm so it 
sounded like a crash, almost, over and over until they'd pull over. . . ."

 So, the Los Angeles Rams are holding "Select-a-Seat-Day" on Sunday at Anaheim

SANTA CLARITA CONSIDERS SMOKING BAN; LEGISLATION: PROPOSAL WOULD PROHIBIT 
LIGHTING UP AT MOST WORKPLACES BUT NOT AT RESTAURANTS AND BARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smoking would be banned at most workplaces but could continue at restaurants 
and bars as long as the establishment's policy is posted for customers, under a 
newly crafted city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Council members worked out provisions for a new tobacco 
control ordinance Tuesday night and will vote on it at their May 24 session. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance also bans cigarette vending machines, but allows 
smoking in small businesses operated away from the public and ventilated 
separately from other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed smoking ban is less restrictive than what the council approved in 
December but stubbed out before the law took effect. The earlier version banned 
smoking in all enclosed public areas, except bars that derive only one-fourth 
of their income from food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think we have the ability to enforce something that strict," 
said Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban supporters say people's health is at stake, while opponents say it's a 
question of personal freedoms and that merchants should be able to set their 
own smoking policies.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members have been flooded with data, statistics and arguments from 
advocates on both sides since the issue was raised late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said it was hard to sift through conflicting claims, and 
others said they believed the issue was being driven by activists who neither 
live nor work in the Santa Clarita area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a significant amount of people have lied about this," said Councilman 
Carl Boyer. "I don't think 95% of the people in the valley give a hoot, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Clyde Smyth called the modified ordinance a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know (about this). I have no idea in the world with the mishmash of 
statistics I have seen," Smyth said. "I haven't done anything to help my 
friends that are bartenders or waitresses, but I think (this ordinance) is 
something I can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson opposed the ordinance as written, calling smoking a 
"life-and-death" issue and urging stronger restrictions. He said nonsmoking 
restaurants wouldn't suffer because customers go for good food and service and 
not for their smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the ordinance will take effect in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's draft ordinance came one day after the Philip Morris tobacco 
company announced it had enough signatures to create a California ballot 
measure abolishing local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders were concerned that a stronger ban might trigger costs for Santa 
Clarita businesses, only to then be repealed.

 * The World Cup will bring the eyes of the world upon Los Angeles this summer, 
with an estimated television viewing audience of over 2 billion people for the 
final game. Police Commissioner Enrique Hernandez complains ("Reimbursement for 
World Cup Security Urged," May 4) that the city will have to foot the security 
bill for the estimated 280,000 visitors who will be attending the World Cup. In 
light of the fact that these visitors will be spending millions of dollars in 
our city and that the city will get an unmeasurable amount of free tourism 
advertising, Hernandez's request is shortsighted and petty.

WRONG PLACE FOR THIS EXHIBITION; ANTI-RAPE SCULPTURE IN SANTA MONICA IS TOO 
PUBLIC A DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America in 1994 is a society where many parents feel anxious about letting go 
of their child's hand in a public place. Children don't know, at first, quite 
what dangers their parents are on guard against, but they guess that these must 
be pretty bad. And a hint about one kind of danger comes as early as preschool 
with their first warnings about inappropriate touch. 
</P>
<P>
 From these warnings, be the tone ever so calm, little boys and girls quite 
properly conclude that bad people are at loose who do hurtful things to other 
people's genitals. Parents may spare their children the gory details, but the 
minimum necessary is more than enough to leave a fearful question in a young 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Comes now Peg Yorkin to provide what parents leave out: in a ground-level 
display window at Wilshire Boulevard and 15th Street in Santa Monica, just a 
block from the Lincoln Middle School playground, a heart-stopping, 
stomach-turning sculpture of pornographic torture/murder. Featured are two 
muscular, naked men, their eye sockets empty, their mouths gaping open in 
death, hanging hideously by their genitals above a disheveled woman. 
</P>
<P>
 An adult will guess that the woman has been raped, but what does this 
installation say to children who do not know what rape is? One mother phoned 
the school to report that her children were "terrified" at the sight: "It was 
just extremely traumatic." The staff member who took the call asks: "Can't we 
allow children five minutes of innocence?" 
</P>
<P>
 We share those concerns. Santa Monica has many art galleries. Had sculptor 
Edward Massey and Yorkin, his angel, shown this work in one of them, no one 
would object. Though to some viewers the woman in this installation seems an 
artistic afterthought, others -- among them some in the huge number of rape 
victims -- have found it cathartic. Surely no one can deny that violence 
against women is a serious social problem. Sadly, however, placed where it is, 
this would-be defense of women has become an upsetting sight for many children.

EQUALITY WATCH; PRICEY PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman in California pays an average of $1.71 more to have her shirt 
laundered than a man. Her basic haircut might cost an average of $5 more.Women 
typically pay more than men for a car. 
</P>
<P>
 He pays. She pays more. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender bias in the pricing of goods and services is one of those inequities 
that stubbornly persists in California and as well as in other parts of the 
country. Women have long grumbled about price discrimination. Various surveys, 
most recently one conducted last month by the Assembly Office of Research, have 
found that women often pay than men more for laundry, dry cleaning, haircuts, 
alterations and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) has introduced AB 2418, known as 
the Equal Pricing Act, to make it illegal to charge different prices to men and 
women for the same goods and services. Prices would not be set or controlled. 
Existing California law prohibits businesses from discriminating against a 
person based on gender. The Assembly Ways and Means Committee will hear the 
bill on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the bill is not needed because of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, 
which among other things already prohibits arbitrary discrimination by 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but the Legislative Counsel of California cites only one case in 
which the Unruh act was used to disallow gender price discrimination -- in the 
narrow context of special discounts for "ladies night" at a bar and "ladies 
day" at a car wash. A law expressly banning gender-biased pricing merits 
serious consideration in Sacramento.

COMMON SENSE ON DISASTERS; COMPANY'S TROUBLES UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR NEW 
APPROACH TO INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Auto insurance used to be the sexy insurance topic (if that phrase isn't an 
oxymoron) in California. Complaining about the thousands of dollars you shell 
out each year for two cars and a teen-age driver could always attract 
empathetic nods. Homeowners insurance, including earthquake coverage, was just 
there, the reliable old brown shoes of the insurance game. Until Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Then everyone dragged out their policy; the minority who actually had 
earthquake insurance found some comfort, though the 10%-of-value deductible was 
a five-figure hurdle. A state-run program that might have covered some of the 
losses was canceled last year for fear of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) is sponsoring a commendable but far more 
modest statewide earthquake repair fund; of course that's no immediate help to 
customers of 20th Century Insurance Group, which has asked permission to triple 
its rates for quake coverage. The math of 20th Century is hard to fault: Its 
earthquake coverage is concentrated in the San Fernando Valley and the company 
is facing quake claims approaching $600 million. If the state insurance 
commission grants the request, other companies surely will follow suit and 
fewer people will be covered in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 So -- we've said it before -- the only thing that makes sense in the long run 
is a national disaster coverage scheme, covering not just quakes but tornadoes, 
hurricanes, volcanic eruptions -- getting insurers to cover all in standard 
homeowner policies. Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose) and Sen. Daniel K. 
Inouye (D-Hawaii) are sponsors of just such a proposal, now before the House 
water resources and environment subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers would benefit from the vast increase in risk-sharing and no 
insurance company would again find itself in the position of 20th Century. 
Perhaps the capable head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Lee 
Witt, could help persuade Congress to pass the bill. Witt, who would like some 
revisions, could see to the fine-tuning while he jawboned this bill into 
reality before the next (check one) (hurricane) (earthquake) (volcanic 
eruption) hits.

BEING FAIR WITH A BESET BILL CLINTON; ISSUE OF HIS HUGE LEGAL BILLS SHOULD BE 
ADDRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton is facing a personal challenge that historians think may be 
unique in the annals of the presidency. He is being sued for alleged wrongdoing 
that occurred before he was elected President. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it is proven otherwise, Clinton of course remains innocent of the 
allegations lodged against him, and for one reason or another the case may in 
fact never come to trial. But meanwhile Clinton has been compelled to hire an 
expensive Washington lawyer, Robert S. Bennett. How much Bennett is charging 
his client is privileged, but assuming he's selling his services at the usual 
rate Clinton could easily be running up hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
fees and costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition Clinton is paying another private lawyer to look out for his 
interests in the Whitewater investigation. All told, it's possible that he 
could eventually be responsible for legal fees that will exceed the $800,000 he 
will be paid over four years as President. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has ruled that a President can't be sued for official acts 
carried out while he is in office. What's uncertain -- legal experts disagree 
-- is whether a President can be sued over events that took place before he 
entered the White House. Bennett is expected to argue that a President has the 
right not to be distracted from his official duties by such suits. But some 
would see that contention as coming very close to claiming that whoever becomes 
President is, once safely in office, above the law. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the time to consider the merits of the allegations made by Paula 
Corbin Jones, who says that three years ago then-Gov. Clinton made a sexual 
proposal to her in a Little Rock hotel room that caused her emotional distress 
and violated her civil rights; her lawsuit demands $700,000. The immediate 
issue, given what has occurred, is Clinton's right not to be driven to 
financial ruin while defending himself against these allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question, we think, that Clinton is entitled to accept donations to 
help pay his legal fees. Contributors to such a legal defense fund should be 
asked to remain anonymous. Public disclosure should be made only after his 
presidency ends. The fund ought to be administered by independent accountants, 
with rigorous safeguards set up to insulate the President and, no less 
important, the whole of his Administration from any knowledge of who gave what, 
and so from any suspicion that contributors might be rewarded with political 
favors. This won't necessarily be easy. But it can be done, and as a matter of 
fairness and of right it should be done.

TRUCKING DEREGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Harry Bernstein's Column Left of April 10, about the replacement of striking 
workers, and the one on May 1, "Truckers Feel the Burn of Deregulation," are 
right on the money. Every working American in this country owes the Teamster 
strikers a debt of gratitude for this last strike. At least for the next four 
years. The middle-class American and the American dream are just about gone 
with the deregulation of all industries (trucking, airlines, telephone, etc.). 
Corporations and foreign countries have been the benefactors of deregulation 
and corporate greed. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what it will take to wake up the American people, but at some 
point we'd all better think about what the American dream will mean to our 
children and grandchildren. Not everyone can have a college education. If the 
working people don't stand together, it will be a very long haul for the 
middle-class Americans.

<P>
 * My husband is a cross-country trucker. Over the past 15 years he has worked 
for several companies. The unwritten agreement in trucking is that the driver 
will work unlimited hours driving, and hundreds of unpaid hours counting and 
unloading freight. 
</P>
<P>
 When the average person accepts a job, he or she knows that certain rules will 
be there to protect them. Extra pay over eight hours, regular breaks and 
mealtimes, the availability of restrooms.  
</P>
<P>
 When you drive a truck these protections disappear. You are expected to drive 
day and night and work unloading when you get there. You hope for an hour of 
sleep before the next dispatch. If you turn down a load, due to fatigue, you 
may sit one or more days waiting for another trip, without pay. And in many 
cities it is illegal to park and rest. Drivers sometimes go 100 miles or more 
looking for a place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse drivers are paid according to the archaic "Household 
Movers Guide," which pays miles from post office to post office instead of 
miles actually driven, allowing companies to cheat drivers out of thousands of 
miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant threat held over the driver's head is replacement with even more 
desperate, cheaper labor, one of the reasons NAFTA was protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Most employers won't do anything the law doesn't require them to do. They will 
continue to exploit and abuse drivers as long as they are allowed to. Right now 
the law ends at the trucking industry's door. All that drivers want are the 
same protections you enjoy when you go to work. When will they get them?

$4.5-MILLION AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * When the Los Angeles City Council awarded a teen-age girl who was molested 
by a police officer $4.5 million (April 30), it sent a clear message to the 
LAPD how very wrong this behavior is, and that's good. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the money isn't going to come from funds raised at the annual 
policeman's ball.It will come from the taxpayers of L.A. in the form of higher 
taxes or less service. Probably both. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to look at the mind-bogglingly generous amounts of money city 
councils and juries award these days and keep in mind who really pays these 
bills! No amount of money can make up for what any victim suffers, but if the 
perpetrator isn't paying the damages, then the notion of punishment harks back 
to the days of whipping boys -- the angry get to feel good, the guilty are 
warned, and the real punishment is passed along to the innocent.

COMMUNITY POLICING OR VIGILANTISM?; CRIME: REGULATIONS WOULD HELP PEOPLE AND 
POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES R. LASLEY, James R. Lasley, a former adviser to the LAPD's Office of 
Operations and Personnel, is associate professor of justice studies at Arizona 
State University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community policing in Los Angeles is beginning to take a strange twist. 
Citizens are not only helping cops but also becoming cops: enforcing their own 
laws, deciding who enters their neighborhoods and solving their own crimes. 
This bears a striking similarity to vigilante movements of the mid-1700s. 
</P>
<P>
 The main characteristics of a vigilante movement are regular organization and 
existence for a definite (though possibly short) period of time. There are an 
estimated 65 such organizations in Los Angeles, with memberships ranging from 
25 to 500. These groups outnumber the LAPD and Sheriff's Department by 5 to 1. 
Some wear uniforms, drive patrol cars and even carry weapons. The right of 
citizens to act as police is rarely questioned by courts and can be practiced 
by anybody. Unlike paid guard services, so-called citizen police are 
unregulated, unlicensed and untrained -- yet under civilian laws, can make 
arrests, detain suspects and use deadly force to protect themselves or others.  
</P>
<P>
 Another characteristic of vigilante movements is that they are usually formed 
by community leaders, thus making them respectable. Two presidents (Andrew 
Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt), eight governors and four U.S. senators have 
either been vigilantes or expressed strong support for vigilante movements.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, this is perhaps the most disturbing parallel, because most 
citizen groups acting as police are doing so under the control of community 
leaders within specific racial and ethnic boundaries. Korean merchants are 
patrolling after hours in Koreatown, as are members of the Jewish Orthodox 
community in the Beverly-Fairfax district. Although crime prevention is the 
primary intent, community isolationism in any form eventually breeds racism and 
ethnocentricity. 
</P>
<P>
 History tells us that vigilante movements became strong during the 1700s 
because of ineffective or nonexistent law enforcement and an uneven judicial 
system. Better than 90% of Los Angeles' "community" police forces were founded 
and created during or immediately after the 1992 riots. Within many of the 
communities where citizen patrols now exist, crime victims typically call for 
assistance from the citizen police before they call 911. This is because, in 
many cases, citizen patrols respond faster and are perceived as more 
sympathetic and courteous. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to vigilantism, we know the warning signs and should treat the 
symptoms. But what is the cure?  
</P>
<P>
 * The first option is to address the cause: to restore faith in "the system." 
Vigilante groups in the 1700s gradually faded away with the establishment of 
strong federal and state law-enforcement agencies and a court system that was 
perceived as fair. Lawmakers must develop guidelines, before the current 
situation get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * The more viable option is for police to recognize and regulate the 
citizen-police organizations. Besides curbing the prospect of full-blown 
vigilantism, there could be an exchange of ideas, insights and talents from a 
partnership. While police forces are downsizing, the citizen-police movement in 
Los Angeles is expanding -- without form, direction, supervision or even 
cultural sensitivity. Without effective planning by police and community 
leaders, we can only hope that our city's version of "community policing" is 
not masking the early stages of a contemporary vigilante movement.

UNDERSTANDING EARTHQUAKES MAKES FOR MESSY SCIENCE; NATURE: PAY ATTENTION TO 
WHAT THE EXPERTS KNOW AND TRY NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THEY DON'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HOUGH, Susan Hough is a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many people, direct exposure to scientific inquiry comes primarily from 
classes taken in junior or senior high school. In those classes, the process of 
science appears straightforward enough: You listen to the teacher, understand 
what is being taught and, if you do your homework, arrive at the same answer as 
everybody else, the answer in the back of the teacher's book. If you do an 
experiment right, you get the same results as everybody else. There is none of 
the subjectivity that a social-studies teacher might appear to use when she or 
he appraises your logic in an essay. Physical science is objective stuff: black 
or white, right or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that it isn't. At the front lines of scientific research, results often 
are subject to interpretation, especially in fields that are inherently 
observational. In particular, earthquake studies -- including seismology, 
geology and tectonophysics -- rarely dwell in unequivocal results. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, after centuries of endeavor, it is impressive to take stock of 
how much is understood about earthquake processes. We know that the Earth's 
crust is broken into plates; we know how they move relative to each other and 
at what rates. We can reconstruct the position of the plates going back 
hundreds of millions of years; we understand how the San Andreas fault came 
into existence; we can predict how the fault (and California) will look 
millions of years in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 We have a record of earthquakes on the southern San Andreas fault going back 
thousands of years and can estimate an average repeat time for certain segments 
of the fault. We understand that the Los Angeles Basin is being broadly 
compressed from north to south due to the bend in the San Andreas, and that the 
compression is causing the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains to be pushed 
upward on systems of faults at their bases. We have mapped some of those faults 
and inferred the existence of others using sophisticated seismic techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the questioning goes, why can't we predict earthquakes? One part of 
the answer lies in the nature of dynamic natural processes; the earthquake 
cycle is characterized by an inherent element of chaos that tends to confound 
attempts at prediction. Earthquake processes also play out, for the most part, 
tens of miles below the Earth's surface, away from easy observation, and they 
play out over geologic time. Within the context of our broad understanding of 
plate tectonics, it is not significant whether the next great San Andreas 
earthquake occurs tomorrow or 50 years from now. That is not true, of course, 
from a societal viewpoint.  
</P>
<P>
 After significant earthquakes in Southern California, there is renewed public 
interest in understanding exactly what happened and possible implications for 
the future. So the curtain hiding the wizard is thrown open, revealing to the 
world what may appear to be chaos and disarray. Seismologists don't seem able 
to agree on a magnitude, much less identify a fault, much less predict the next 
quake.  
</P>
<P>
 What is revealed is the scientific process, in all of its rarely unequivocal 
glory. Some of the apparent contradictions stem from complexities in science 
that are understood, but not always easily communicated. There are, for 
example, several different magnitude scales, of which the Richter (or, more 
precisely, the Gutenberg-Richter) is perhaps the most antiquated. Depending on 
the details of earthquake rupture, any given event can have different magnitude 
estimates, depending on which scale is used. Also, any magnitude estimate 
contains an inherent level of uncertainty; estimates often will be revised as 
additional data are analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 But other confusions, such as the identification of a fault responsible for 
the Northridge earthquake, result from the inherently messy nature of the 
scientific process. This earthquake, like scores before it, occurred on a 
previously unidentified fault. It is important to note that, in a broad sense, 
there is no real element of surprise within the scientific community: The 
earthquake fits into our understanding of the tectonics of the Los Angeles 
area, and we know that there are many buried faults that have not yet been 
identified. Yet it is important to understand that the details of the 
Northridge earthquake, and the process of sorting out those details, will 
almost inevitably involve diverse interpretations and preliminary results that 
prove to be wrong. That, in the end, is a reasonable microcosm for the 
scientific process in general: Theories are proposed and tested; some are 
discarded and some stand the test of rigorous inquiry. Usually, however, the 
process does not play out live on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Earth scientists take seriously their responsibility to provide answers 
in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake. We do our best to answer questions 
and to relate what we know. What we ask of the public is this: to accept the 
hard truth that sometimes the scientific community just does not have the 
answers; to read and listen carefully to what information is presented; to 
understand that we aren't in a high-school chemistry class back in Kansas, but 
rather, someplace that isn't always black and white.

CASHING OUT EMPLOYER-PAID PARKING; COMMUTING: GIVE SUBSIDY EQUIVALENTS TO 
EMPLOYEES WHO POOL OR USE PUBLIC TRANSIT AND REDUCE TRAFFIC AND POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD C. SHOUP, Donald C. Shoup is a professor in the Graduate School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the struggle to restore freeways and get commuters back on schedule after 
January's devastating quake, one aspect of the problem has received little 
attention: parking subsidies that many firms generously grant to employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Employer-paid parking is an invitation to drive to work alone. For example, in 
downtown Los Angeles the average commuter parking subsidy is almost 50% more 
than the total cost of gasoline for the average commute trip. If employers 
offered free gasoline for all employees who drive to work, everyone would 
recognize this as an environmental outrage -- yet employer-paid parking is a 
much stronger incentive to drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 A law enacted last year in California to deal with the added traffic 
congestion and air pollution caused by employer-paid parking should give many 
commuters a sensible new choice -- the option to take cash in lieu of free 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires employers who subsidize parking to offer employees the option 
of taking the market value of the subsidy in cash if they don't take the 
parking space. An employer who offers to pay for an employee's parking must now 
also offer to pay the same amount if the employee does not take the parking.  
</P>
<P>
 The law requires the cash option only if the employer pays out-of-pocket cash 
to a third party to lease spaces for employee parking. The employer's avoided 
parking subsidy directly funds the employee's cash allowance, so there is no 
net cost increase for the employer when an employee forgoes parking and takes 
cash (firms with fewer than 50 employees are exempt). 
</P>
<P>
 The cash option would most strongly tempt commuters to ride-share to work 
sites where parking prices are highest. Because parking is usually most 
expensive in the most congested areas, the cash option automatically targets 
its strongest incentive to ride-share exactly where this incentive is most 
needed. And because a commuter can always use the cash to pay for 
non-transportation expenses, the offer of cash in lieu of parking also rewards 
the most environmentally benign forms of commuting -- walking, cycling and mass 
transit -- as alternatives to driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The new legislation helps in rebuilding Los Angeles after the earthquake in 
another important way. The law requires cities to reduce their minimum parking 
requirements for developments that offer a parking cash-out program. Using this 
provision, developers can reduce both the cost of providing the required 
parking and the resulting traffic impact on the surrounding communities.  
</P>
<P>
 Offering commuters cash in lieu of parking subsidies will reduce traffic 
congestion, improve air quality, conserve gasoline and increase employees' 
welfare without increasing employers' costs. No other transportation program 
can promise so many benefits for so little cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, subsidize people, not parking.

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH CARE; IT ISN'T REFORM IF WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT; HAND 
OVER THE DRAWING BOARD TO CITIZENS AND IT'S A SAFE BET THEY'LL COME UP WITH 
SOMETHING LIKE A SIMPLE SINGLE-PAYER PLAN.

<P>
 While our elected representatives tangle themselves in the health-care debate, 
I go on paying $182 a month for $1,500-deductible health insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 While my insurance company hires more lobbyists, it doesn't return my phone 
calls.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Congress tries to devise a plan that will make the Republicans look 
bad and the Democrats good, or vice versa, the average per-person health 
expenditure in the United States is $2,868 a year. In Canada it is $1,915, in 
Germany $1,659, in Japan $1,267, in the Netherlands $1,360. Those countries all 
have infant-mortality rates one-third lower than ours, and life expectancies 
two years higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that our elected representatives have gotten stuck. Liberals 
don't know whether to go along with the Clinton half-loaf or to hold out for 
something that would actually be fair. Conservatives are pushing a dozen 
alternative ways of ensuring that the rich keep getting better health care than 
anyone else. Coalitions are forming and unforming so fast that nobody can be 
sure what, if anything, will pass.  
</P>
<P>
 The stuckness means that ordinary citizens -- most of whom dropped out of the 
discussion when it descended into an incomprehensible babble about 
utilization-management protocols -- have a chance once again to be heard.  
</P>
<P>
 So what should we say?  
</P>
<P>
 Suppose that the President and Congress decided not only to go back to the 
drawing board, but to hand the drawing board to us. Suppose they appointed a 
panel of citizens (of various ages, all with recent experience of the current 
health system) and nurses and doctors (with various specialties but weighted 
toward general practice). You and I are appointees, of course. They say to us, 
"We're going to lock you up and send in whatever food and facts you request. 
Don't come out till you've designed a health-care system you like."  
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that ideologists of the left and the right are kept out of this group 
(that wouldn't exclude either you or me, right?), my guess is that we would 
finish our job in about a week. Here are some of the things I bet we would 
agree on:  
</P>
<P>
 * The system must be very, very simple. The average fifth-grader should be 
able to understand it.  
</P>
<P>
 * The system must be available to everyone equally. When it comes to health, 
Americans should not be divided into economic classes. A Social Security or 
green card should be the badge of admission to any health practitioner.  
</P>
<P>
 * Every patient should have the right to choose his or her practitioner and 
free and easy access to the information necessary to make a good choice. Health 
care should have nothing to do with jobs. That complicates the life of the 
business community, it creates paperwork every time anyone changes employment 
and it requires a separate system for the young, the old and the unemployed. 
The decision to hire or be hired should be based on economic considerations, 
not health-care considerations.  
</P>
<P>
 * There should not be different health-care systems in different states -- 
again to minimize paperwork, and so health care doesn't enter into decisions 
about where to live.  
</P>
<P>
 * Doctors and nurses should not be seen as industrial raw material whose 
"productivity" is to be maximized. They shouldn't be judged by their ability to 
generate revenue. They should have schedules that permit them to lead normal 
lives and to have caring, as opposed to economic, relationships with their 
patients.  
</P>
<P>
 * The system should reward both patients and practitioners for good health 
practices and preventive maintenance.  
</P>
<P>
 * The teeth, the eyesight and the mind should be considered parts of the human 
body and their care should be covered.  
</P>
<P>
 * It makes no difference whether health-care costs are paid to the government 
and called taxes or paid to insurance companies and called premiums. What is 
important is that the money go to health care, not to bureaucracy, advertising, 
lobbying, litigating, stockholders, lush corporate offices or exorbitant 
executive salaries. That means health care should not be a profit-making 
enterprise. It should be government-run, but firmly separated from the 
corruption of politics, operated transparently and overseen by a watchdog board 
of citizens. * Doctors and their patients should have the right to decide what 
procedures are appropriate when and for whom. But with that right comes the 
responsibility for everyone to be informed about healthy living, the effects of 
addictive substances, sexually transmitted diseases, how to control fertility, 
living wills, organ donation. Surely there are ways to transmit this 
information clearly, compellingly and without preaching.  
</P>
<P>
 You'd want to add to this list or modify it, but I bet it wouldn't take us 
long to get it right. Then we'd look around for examples of health systems that 
satisfy our criteria. We'd find them in Canada, Germany, Japan, the 
Netherlands. They're called "single-payer" systems. The single payer is the 
government. We'd study those systems, adopt what's best in them, correct what's 
worst and come out with the best health-care plan in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 So why wait for them to ask? In Washington, they're stuck. Sound off. Loudly. 
Often. No other decision our government makes this decade is going to affect 
you and me more than this one.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; KEEP OLDER PEOPLE IN CIRCULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been a lot of justifiable complaining about local implementation of 
federal mandates that aren't backed with dollars. In Orange County, the problem 
has resulted in serious tension, pitting two deserving and needy groups in the 
search for transportation services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many elderly and handicapped people at a hearing of the Orange County 
Transportation Authority listened as speakers expressed their outrage over the 
competition for federal dollars. Now most of the county's popular Dial-a-Ride 
program, which provides door-to-door transportation on an individual basis for 
about 300,000 senior citizens every year, is in jeopardy. That program enables 
them to go to the grocery store, the bank or the doctor without having to beg 
others for a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the problem is that the Americans With Disabilities Act, 
approved in 1990 by Congress, requires local transportation agencies to 
facilitate the use of mass transit for the disabled. It's a worthy cause to be 
sure, but the mandate came without any funding. So OCTA says it is now 
compelled to phase out most of its popular Dial-a-Ride program by Sept. 11 in 
order to fund the program for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 This robbing of Peter to pay Paul pits worthy groups and creates unnecessary 
bad feeling. The Dial-a-Ride service in some cases may be the only thing 
separating isolation and circulation in the larger world. Rather than 
disenfranchise an entire group by September, the board would be wise to heed 
some senior citizens' request to delay phasing out the program. The agency, 
citing the increasing demand for service for disabled riders, is pushing to 
comply with the federal requirement by next January even though it does not 
have to until 1997.  
</P>
<P>
 Use the extra time to see whether alternatives can't be found, instead of 
ending one program to save another. Bringing services to the homebound, in an 
area as spread out as Orange County, is expensive. Here is one good example for 
Washington of the unintended consequences that result from having an unfunded 
government mandate.

THEY'RE STRAIGHT-EDGE, CLEAN AND PROUD OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wanted to compliment The Times in its handling of the straight-edge article 
("They're Clean-Cut -- But With an Edge,' April 7). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm 16 years old, attend Dana Hills High School and am very proud of being 
straight-edge. In a world where drinking is more acceptable, almost expected, 
among teen-agers, straight-edge sounds like a freak cult. Almost every day I 
have to try and define straight-edge to someone, or try to explain that just 
because someone doesn't do drugs, it doesn't mean you're straight-edge. Many 
don't understand the straight-edge lifestyle. I was happy that the newspaper 
can help get the word out without making us out to be snotty little kids. 
</P>
<P>
 I also want people to see that straight-edge and hard-core isn't just a 
Southern California thing. Much of the best hard-core comes out of New York, 
but there are bands from almost every area of the U.S., from Cleveland to 
Seattle to Atlanta. Straight-edge has a very strong sense of unity and 
brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Many could call us a modern cult with a good message, which is fine as long as 
everyone understands what we stand for. Now more people do understand, thanks 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE BURTON, Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I commend you on article about straight-edge. I have been straight-edge for 4 
1/2 years (I fell for six months during my senior year in high school '93.) I 
am 19 years old and poison-free. 
</P>
<P>
 I was impressed with the article's depth. Many publications, such as Seventeen 
magazine, have covered the straight-edge scene but in superficial ways (i.e. 
clothing trends, cute band members, etc.). I was also impressed that you spoke 
to Ray Cappo. He is one of the only surviving (still straight-edge) leaders of 
the scene. Despite his religious biases, Ray still is very respected in the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as in any culture, or subculture, people are beginning to lose 
sight of what straight-edge means. It isn't about carrying a baseball bat and 
oppressing everyone who disagrees with you. It's not a religion; it is a 
personal commitment, and those who preach conversion through force are lost. 
Straight-edge is about caring. Caring what happens to your body, your mind and 
the lives of all beings around you. 
</P>
<P>
 We all live in a society, therefore every action creates a ripple effect, and 
this ripple effect touches everyone in the society. When a person lights a 
cigarette, gets drunk, takes drugs, engages in promiscuous sex, eats meat, they 
damage themselves. They also create the ripple effect that transfers the damage 
onto all creatures who are innocent of these ills. 
</P>
<P>
 When a person drinks, their lack of control places their life in the hands of 
alcohol. The person also places the lives around him at the mercy of his 
alcohol-blinded behavior. When a person smokes, they force the people around 
them to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 When a person engages in promiscuous sex, they are inevitably harming those 
around them whether it be directly or indirectly. AIDS, unwanted pregnancy and 
destroyed trust are just a few of these damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-destructive behavior does not exist. It is always societal destruction. 
That means you, me, your parents, your dog, everyone. "Fun" is sought at 
everyone's expense. We are straight-edge because we want our ripple effects to 
be positive, not destructive.

MOVIE REVIEW; A WARM AND FUZZY SPIKE LEE; THE CINEMATIC POLEMICIST STROLLS DOWN 
MEMORY LANE IN 'CROOKLYN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not everyone can tell a story, and even good storytellers can't tell all 
stories equally well. And the most personal stories are often the hardest to 
convey to an audience that lacks the teller's intimate connection to the 
material. And so it is with writer-director Spike Lee's latest film, 
"Crooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially Lee, who co-wrote "Crooklyn" with his sister Joie and his brother 
Cinque, will say only that the writers "drew some of their inspiration from 
their own lives." But interviews have indicated that this 1970s story of four 
brothers and a sister growing up in the Ft. Greene section of Brooklyn has more 
than a glancing resemblance to the details of the Lee family's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a director like Spike Lee, an adept cinematic polemicist whose best work, 
from "Do the Right Thing" to "Malcolm X," has never strayed far from film's 
hardest edges, this turn to the fuzzy, non-controversial areas of warm memory 
and nostalgia is a noticeable departure. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is something refreshing about seeing a studio film involved with a 
group like the Carmichaels, a feisty African American family with concerned and 
loving parents trying to do the best for their rambunctious kids. And having 
strong actors like Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo playing teacher Carolyn 
Carmichael and her jazz musician husband, Woody, can only add power to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 But though this is a situation with potential, not to mention one that the 
director has a personal stake in, it does not play to Lee's strengths. Partly 
as a result, "Crooklyn" has turned out not particularly involving, an 
undernourished, aimless film that despite occasional moments of emotional 
connection never gets up a noticeable head of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, "Crooklyn" does without much of a plot line. Set almost 
exclusively on the Brooklyn block where the Carmichaels have a brownstone, it 
is an episodic piece of work, with an unfocused script that adds incident to 
incident without much connective tissue to tie all of it together. 
</P>
<P>
 That block looks to have been a lively and multicultural one, with Italians 
and Latinos as well as black people getting on one another's nerves, a chaotic 
place but one with a heart. The setting is in its own way an age of innocence, 
when shoplifting was the worst crime and glue-sniffers (one of whom is played 
by Lee himself) the most dangerous characters. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Lee siblings' script places in this background are situations of the 
"remember when" variety, like "Remember when the electricity got turned off?" 
or "Remember when Mom woke us up at 4 a.m. to do the dishes?" While some 
incidents, like the time oldest son Clinton (Carlton Williams) goes to an NBA 
championship game instead of his father's concert, are admittedly based on real 
incidents, they lack the consistently empathetic touch that would provide the 
emotional weight and meaning for an audience these situations have for the 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most noticeable in this respect is the interlude when daughter Troy (Zelda 
Harris) goes to visit a stuffy aunt in Maryland, a situation similar to the one 
at the center of "The Inkwell." The entire sequence is filmed with a distorting 
anamorphic lens, theoretically to emphasize how off-kilter the visit looked to 
Troy. What it feels like is a concerted attack on the aunt's bourgeois 
sensibility that plays more merciless and hostile than perhaps Lee intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Crooklyn" is most successful and most involving is in the drawing of 
individual characters. Woodard is luminous as always as the mother who worries 
that her family is getting out of control, and Lindo is her match as the father 
determined to march to no one's music but his own. Also a pleasure is young 
Zelda Harris, who brings a fiery spirit to the role of Troy. With characters 
this alive, it's a pity that no one was able to build a more convincing film 
around them, instead of leaving everyone more or less out there on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 MPAA rating: PG-13 for "drug content." Times guidelines: It includes much 
coarse language and scenes of glue sniffing.

 Baby Due: Country star Wynonna Judd is expecting her first child on New Year's 
Day. Judd, 30, is not planning to marry the baby's father, 39-year-old 
Nashville businessman Arch Kelley III, whom she has been dating since August. 
"I celebrate this," she said, noting that the pregnancy was not planned. 
"Abortion is not an option for me. . . . I want to take care of this child." So 
Judd said she will cancel all concert dates after Labor Day. She will return to 
work in June to record an MCA album and will resume touring after the album's 
release.

 * Tupac's Legal File: Atlanta police officer Scott Whitwell, who suffered a 
shotgun blast to the buttocks in an Atlanta altercation that involved rapper 
Tupac Shakur, has sued the singer for $10 million. "The facts will show that 
our client, who was unarmed . . . was running for (his life) when Tupac Shakur 
opened fire," Whitwell's attorney said. The incident prompted criminal 
aggravated assault charges against both Shakur and Scott Whitwell's brother, 
Mark, who is also a police officer. Shakur's attorney declined comment Thursday 
saying he had not seen a copy of the civil lawsuit. Shakur has several other 
court cases pending, and on Tuesday began serving a 15-day jail sentence for an 
L.A. assault conviction.

 CBS Denies Menendez Plea: CBS cited First Amendment rights in turning down a 
written plea this week from Lyle and Erik Menendez's attorneys not to air a May 
22 and 24 miniseries about the brothers in Los Angeles while their criminal 
trial is still pending. The attorneys, who unsuccessfully sought an injunction 
to stop Fox's Menendez movie, say they won't take the matter to court this 
time, although they believe that "Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills" takes a 
pro-prosecution point of view and will make it impossible for them to select an 
unbiased jury when the brothers are retried for the murders of their wealthy 
parents next year. CBS maintains that its miniseries is objective. . . . 
Meanwhile, KFI-AM (640) talk-show hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou are 
holding a yard sale Saturday to raise money for the District Attorney's 
prosecution of the Menendez brothers. It takes place from 9 a.m. to noon at 
Insight Shooting Range in Artesia. STAGE

 As If We Never Said Hello: Forget about seeing Glenn Close singing "As If We 
Never Said Goodbye," from "Sunset Boulevard," on the Tony Awards telecast June 
12. The "Sunset" producers have decided "to preserve the uniqueness of their 
Broadway premiere in November," by not giving away a taste of the show for free 
in June. Close will still present a Tony live from the Shubert stage, before 
donning her Norma Desmond costume to begin that evening's performance of 
"Sunset." A live number from "Show Boat" in Toronto will replace the "Sunset" 
number.

 * The Word on 'Grease': Most of the reviews of the Broadway bow of the Tommy 
Tune-supervised revival of "Grease" weren't encouraging. Ben Brantley of the 
New York Times thought its "rudimentary story line, characterizations and 
affectionate spoof songs are nearly lost amid the clumsy spectacle and 
high-decibel orchestrations." Linda Winer-Bernheimer of Newsday called it "a 
charmless assault." David Patrick Stearns of USA Today said it was like "a hot, 
candy-colored Thunderbird that keeps stalling at stoplights." ART

 Klimt Highlights Auction: A tense two-way bidding war at Sotheby's auction 
house in New York Wednesday more than doubled the previous sale record for 
Austrian Expressionist Gustav Klimt, helping to raise the gloomy mood that had 
set in following a disastrous sale at rival auction house Christie's the night 
before. Klimt's 1917-18 portrait "Lady With a Fan" sold for $11.6 million, far 
above Sotheby's pre-sale estimate. The previous record for a Klimt, $5.5 
million, was set in 1987. Overall, Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern 
works was still lackluster, however. Only 50 of the 69 lots sold. QUICK TAKES

Gabrielle Carteris gave birth Wednesday night to a daughter, Kelsey Rose, at a 
Los Angeles hospital. Carteris' "90210" character, Andrea, gives birth on the 
Fox show's May 25 season finale. . . . Gene Kelly, 81, was released from a San

THEATER REVIEW; LEACHMAN SHOWS OFF ARTISTRY AS GRANDMA MOSES IN 'JOY RIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For those who recall Grandma Moses as an overexposed pop figure who bordered 
on the kitschy, "Joy Ride," at the Westwood Playhouse, is a chance to 
re-evaluate and reassess. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Moses was a media phenomenon.Naturally, her work has been exploited in a 
variety of commercial venues, including Hallmark cards. Granted, she was 
drubbed for decades by the critical Establishment, which once dismissed her as 
a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Moses was an American original -- never trite, but iconic. Cloris 
Leachman has been involved with Stephen Pouliot's biographical drama since 
1989. Slight but serviceable, the play is an unabashed showcase for her 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Leachman plays Moses at various stages of her life from girlhood to the 
century mark. She is charming throughout, but as the elderly Moses, she's 
transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Richard Nelson plays the various men in Moses' life, from father to 
husband to mentor. Engaging and versatile, he more than holds his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The production elements are uniformly excellent, providing the perfect frame 
for this portrait of the artist as an old woman. But any way you paint it, the 
evening is Leachman's. 
</P>

'TRADING MOM': A DELIGHTFUL DEBUT FILLED WITH LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When writer-director Tia Brelis was growing up she was beguiled by a story her 
mother Nancy told her over and over called "The Mommy Market." Subsequently, 
her mother published it as a novel; no wonder Brelis chose to adapt it as her 
debut feature under the title "Trading Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a charmer, about three children (Anna Chlumsky, Aaron Michael Metchik and 
Asher Metchik), fed up with their harried single mother (Sissy Spacek) and 
dreaming of trading her in for a more amenable model. When they confide their 
feelings to a neighbor lady (Maureen Stapleton), devoted to caring for her vast 
and beautiful untrammeled garden, she astounds them by revealing that via some 
hocus-pocus they can make their mother disappear but at the cost of erasing all 
memories of her. She then tells them of a bazaar, the Mommy Market, where they 
can pick out a new mother. The droll, captivating Stapleton is of course 
actually giving them a chance to learn to appreciate their mother as they never 
have before. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmed in and around Richmond, Va., "Trading Mom" has a lovely, shimmering 
look to it, and it affords Spacek a comical tour de force as all three mothers 
the kids try out. They are a rich, glamorous Frenchwoman who is interested only 
in the children's appearances; a hearty, outdoorsy Britisher who can cook the 
pancakes the kids crave as daily fare but who takes their sports activities so 
seriously she's only interested in their winning; and finally the deceptively 
sweet Russian circus juggler who takes her show-must-go-on belief all too 
literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Brelis brings to her film an appropriately lyrical quality to the telling of 
her mother's fairy tale, and elicits enchanting portrayals from her cast. 
"Trading Mom" is largely given over to fantasy, but the magic spell it casts is 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for some barnyard humor. Times guidelines: It is truly a 
family film, appropriate for all ages. 'Trading Mom'

TENSE 'HAWK' A TRIUMPH FOR MIRREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More likely than not, the international acclaim accorded Helen Mirren for her 
portrayal of a hard-edged London police detective in the "Prime Suspect" 
miniseries on PBS has triggered the American theatrical release of the 1992 BBC 
production "The Hawk." It's a gratifying psychological thriller with a glorious 
Mirren as a blue-collar Manchester housewife who begins to suspect her husband 
may in fact be the elusive serial killer who has been terrifying the area by 
savage, apparently random killings of wives and mothers not unlike Mirren's own 
Annie Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ransley's adaptation of his novel not only keeps you guessing -- every 
time you think the plot's telegraphing itself you're left confounded -- but 
also enables director David Hayman to come through with a film that's 
exceptionally fluid and visual for a British production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hawk," which takes its title from its serial killer's grisly signature of 
putting out his victims' eyes, is also a deft, shrewd observation of a woman 
too modest to be fully aware of her innate superiority to her crass husband 
(George Costigan), her nosy mother-in-law (Rosemary Leach) and insinuating 
brother-in-law (Owen Teale). Self-reliant, hard-working and forthright, Annie 
is a firm believer in knowing one's place and in being a conscientious wife and 
mother -- she has two children. She may be at a loss as to say whether she and 
her husband are truly in love but is quick to assert that they are happily 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 The instant, however, that Mirren starts allowing herself even to consider the 
possibility that her husband may be a serial killer she is confronted with an 
overwhelming sense of self-doubt. How can she even begin to think of trusting 
her instincts when it has not been that long since she experienced postpartum 
depression in the wake of the birth of her last child severe enough to require 
institutionalization? She finds escalating fear and uncertainty in a mounting 
war with her natural assertiveness and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirren plays the likable, intelligent but beleaguered Annie with absolute 
conviction and sympathy while "The Hawk" gradually increases its suspense until 
it has you on the edge of your seat before you realize it. Hayman wisely 
resists pretension at every turn; that "The Hawk" is so resolutely a genre film 
through and through serves only to enable it to deliver all the better its 
traditional-style thrills and chills. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for language and terror. Times guidelines: It contains adult 
themes; although not graphic in its violence, the film is too intense for 
children.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'WIDOW'S PEAK' AN ENGAGING AND LITERATE COMEDIC PIFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Widow's Peak" is a lilting little whodunit trussed up as a domestic comedy. 
Set in the village of Kilshannon, Ireland, in the early 1920s, it's an actors' 
holiday of a movie. The lead female performers -- Mia Farrow, Joan Plowright, 
Natasha Richardson -- make it something of a holiday for us, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Widow's Peak of the title is a high bluff overlooking Kilshannon that is 
home to a community of well-to-do widows who spend much of their time gossiping 
and snooping into one another's business. Mrs. Doyle-Counihan (Plowright), who 
wields a mean telescope for her spy-mastering, is the peak's unofficial 
matriarch. Twice-widowed, she has a prim imperiousness; the peak is her eminent 
domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Godfrey (Adrian Dunbar) is a gangly twit who attempts to lead a double 
life. Around his mother he's a lap dog but in the presence of the village's 
mysterious new war widow, Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson), he tries to be a 
smoothie. (She sees right through him -- no great achievement.) Then there's 
Miss O'Hare (Mia Farrow), also something of a mystery, who is the only 
non-widow allowed to live on Widow's Peak. (Godfrey is the only man allowed.) 
She's a fragile waif with a not-so-fragile disposition. Her instant dislike of 
Edwina becomes a free-for-all spat that turns the village inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish playwright Hugh Leonard ("Da") and director John Irvin let these actors 
exult in their roles without allowing the film to devolve into broad 
blarneyisms. It's all a bit too composed and patterned, and the plot twists 
aren't particularly twisty. But the scenery and costumes have been chosen with 
great care and intelligence; it may be a "Masterpiece Theatre" piffle but it's 
a well-done piffle. It doesn't overvalue its literacy or good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been easy for Plowright to play Mrs. Doyle-Counihan as a ramrod 
but there are many more shadings in the performance. Doyle-Counihan is careful 
to sit apart from the villagers at public gatherings, but she's not a snob 
exactly -- she's just devoted to protocol. There's a wonderful moment when 
she's watching a Cecil B. DeMille biblical movie and whispers excitedly to Miss 
O'Hare that she's heard that "we see God in the second half." This no-nonsense 
woman who has outlasted two husbands still has the capacity for wonder, at 
least when the lights are down. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrow is remarkably good in a difficult role. In her own way, Miss O'Hare is 
as tough as Doyle-Counihan but she always looks like she's about to fade away. 
Farrow shows a mettle here that she didn't always have an opportunity to 
demonstrate in her many Woody Allen movies, where she was often cast as a 
simpering rag doll. Richardson brings her out -- she's not just a co-performer, 
she's an opponent. Richardson is such a different kind of performer -- savvy 
and sharp where Farrow is nervy and neurasthenic -- that their battles resemble 
a competition between performing styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody wins. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild language and theme. Times guidelines: It includes 
a boat capsizing and a murder trial .

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MILLION': NOT ALWAYS A PAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Rodriguez, the comic actor and stand-up artist, is a funny man on TV and 
the stage. In "A Million to Juan," he's trying to be touching . Very loosely 
based on Mark Twain's story "The Million Pound Bank-Note," it's not 
particularly funny and it's touching in the get-out-your-handkerchiefs mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who also makes his directorial debut, doesn't yet know how to make 
a movie move. Clunkiness has its charms but not for this long. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan (Rodriguez) is an undocumented Mexican immigrant living with his 
10-year-old son (Jonathan Hernandez) and his cousins (Tony Plana, Bert Rosario) 
in a slummy East L.A. apartment. He's the king of part-time jobs, but his dream 
of owning his own restaurant, which would net him his green card, seems 
illusory until a mysterious man in a stretch limo hands him a check for a 
million dollars. The catch is, the check must be returned in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan and his cousins quickly horde goodies on credit: Versace duds, a 
Mercedes. It's unclear how they are managing to raid Beverly Hills without 
dropping a dime -- even millionaires aren't royalty anymore on Rodeo Drive -- 
but we accept the conceit. If we didn't, the movie would collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and his writers, Francisca Matos and Robert Grasmere, want to make a 
social statement, but it's not clear what it is. Are we supposed to share the 
glee of Juan and his cousins as they turn the tables on the Beverly Hills 
snoots by beating them at their own game? Although the film winds up being a 
money-can't-buy-you-happiness job, the happiness is all too evident on the 
screen. Rodriguez celebrates the values he knocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-name actors like Edward James Olmos, Ruben Blades and Cheech Marin show up 
for cameos that seem more like favors owed or returned. As the INS caseworker 
who falls in love with Juan, Polly Draper has a lush sweetness that makes her 
scenes with Rodriguez ingratiatingly cozy. They make a nice couple. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for very mild language. Times guidelines: It includes a 
young person's death and a few racist slurs. 'A Million to Juan'

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MORE IS LESS AT MUM'S IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mum's, which has graced the now-trendy stretch of Pine Avenue in Long Beach 
for almost six years, is one hot spot on a Saturday night. There are large 
tables of friends out for a night on the town, women in backless black dresses, 
men in silk. A father and his 16-year-old daughter split a huge wedge of 
chocolate cake; a university professor and his wife quietly share a bottle of 
good wine. Behind us, a table of middle-aged couples are having a group 
laughing fit. 
</P>
<P>
 A party spirit prevails, even in the women's restroom, where there's a lively 
debate in progress on the virtues of face-powdering after the age of 40: "It 
gets in the folds," one woman laughs. "Stick to the nose, there are no wrinkles 
there," says another. Back in the restaurant, a jazz combo is just starting up 
for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are pale green, the carpet celadon, the booths aubergine and 
elevated over the restaurant floor, with a view of the busy open kitchen, a sea 
of tables, Gargantuan tropical flower arrangements. Some are equipped with a 
telephone -- local calls only. 
</P>
<P>
 Early one evening, when things are quiet and our waitress is far across the 
room and we can't get her to look at us, I can't resist the temptation. I call 
the restaurant. A cheery young man answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi," I say. "Sorry to disturb you, but I'm in the second booth here in the 
restaurant and we need either our waitress or some horseradish for our prime 
rib." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs. "Sure," he says. "No problem. Horseradish coming your way." 
</P>
<P>
 And shortly, it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mum's is a bastion of California cuisine with the requisite designer pizzas, 
pastas and highly built entrees bearing various influences from Asian, Italian, 
Southwestern, French and American cuisines. The food tends to be overwrought. 
The special soup, described as tomato-artichoke chicken soup, is in fact a 
cream-based puree that's delicious, if far richer than we expect, and only 
lukewarm. A spinach salad has far too much coarse mustard dressing; the house 
salad has a heavy and rich raspberry vinaigrette.  
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen's philosophy apparently is More Is More. Everything that can be 
amped up, enriched, dressed or sauced is. Sometimes this works: Crab cakes are 
plump and good-tasting with a smooth red-pepper mayonnaise and a fresh corn 
salad. But nicely seasoned, inescapably greasy beef-filled spring rolls sit in 
a large sticky red lake of plum sauce next to a heavily dressed Asian-style 
cabbage salad and a tomato cut like a little basket.  
</P>
<P>
 A pizza with Louisiana hot links, peppers, cheese and red onions seems 
wonderfully plain and straightforward next to most of the food we encounter. 
The Southwest pizza -- with black bean sauce, guacamole, sour cream, chiles, 
cheese and chicken -- tastes like an odd, slightly dry burrito. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the kitchen's penchant for gilding lilies, I'm not surprised to find the 
pesto on my capellini with grilled shrimp enriched with cream, but I do wish 
the kitchen had spared the cream and used fresher, tastier shrimp. Thai chicken 
linguine with chicken and a thick ginger sauce is no-nonsense spicy and, again, 
quite rich. The ravioli stuffing of veal and chestnuts tastes very much like 
grainy hamburger, even when paired with a rich porcini cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The night's fresh fish special, a piece of yellowtail, was small, uninspired 
and unfortunately overwhelmed by a Gorgonzola cream sauce that had seeped over 
from the accompanying penne. Salmon in a potato crust looks like a toasty 
turnover in a bright green lake of pesto cream sauce: It tastes great, but the 
colors are disconcerting.  
</P>
<P>
 Prime rib is actually a grilled-to-order steak cut from the prime rib; it's a 
huge, fairly wonderful piece of meat served with buttery basil mashed potatoes. 
Jumbo scallops, as if not enough on their own, are wrapped in sole and served 
with tasty lobster ravioli under a mound of deep-fried shreds of parsnips, 
carrots and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 From appetizers to desserts, I found myself wanting less -- less fuss, less 
frills, less construction. I'd trade the excess for lovelier, top-quality 
ingredients. Forget the creme anglais and strawberry coulis -- give me a 
fresher, moister slice of carrot cake. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DEMONS 2' A SMART, SEXY HORROR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Night of the Demons 2" is a smart, amusing horror picture boasting a capable 
cast composed primarily of promising and attractive young actors and first-rate 
special effects. If you saw the 1988 original, you may recall that a young 
woman named Angela and her friends suffered a terrible fate while spending 
Halloween night in a derelict old house. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't keep a demon down when box office dictates an eventual sequel, so 
Angela (once again Amelia Kinkade), who became possessed by a supernatural 
force of evil, is back with a vengeance. She's out to claim her younger sister 
(Merle Kennedy), a shy misfit at a posh Catholic prep school; she'll make her 
move at the same old house, again on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, writer Joe Augustyn (with an assist on the story from James 
Penzi) hasn't come up with a mere repeat of the original, which was basically a 
rudimentary though certainly effective traditional tale of young people getting 
more than they bargained for when they break into a spooky abandoned residence. 
Most of the action in "Demons 2" takes place at the school, although of course 
we return to the scary Hull House -- in reality the once-meticulously 
maintained turn-of-the-century Bishop residence on West Adams at Menlo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The film begins as a teen comedy, sexy and rambunctious, with the students 
forever defying the strict, puritanical but caring Sister Gloria (Jennifer 
Rhodes). However, it deftly evolves into a full-scale struggle between the 
forces of good and evil, with Sister Gloria emerging as a veritable ninja nun, 
as formidable in spirit as in dueling with the devil's emissary.  
</P>
<P>
 A sharp, versatile actress, Rhodes dominates a large ensemble cast under the 
swift, stylish direction of Brian Trenchard-Smith. Although modestly budgeted, 
the darkly gleaming "Night of the Demons" looks as good as its young actors, 
boasting superior production design, camerawork and makeup effects created by 
Steve Johnson, who between the two "Demon" films picked up an Oscar for his 
work on "The Abyss." 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for horror violence and gore, sexuality, nudity and language 
. Times guidelines: Its horror sequences are standard for the genre, but scenes 
of nudity and sexual implications are considerable.

THEATER BEAT: STRIKING 'LETTERS TO A STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Totalitarianism is never subtle, and neither is Elizabeth Wong's cartoonish 
but ultimately moving new drama "Letters to a Student Revolutionary" at East 
West Players. Wong's broad black-and-white brush strokes sometimes threaten to 
obliterate the substance of her drama, but the overall effect is striking. 
</P>
<P>
 Set between 1979 and 1989 -- the span between China's unprecedented opening of 
its markets to foreign trade and the Tian An Men Square massacre -- the play 
concerns the friendship between the American Bibi (Jennifer Fujii) and her 
Chinese counterpart Karen (Vicky Chow), who meet by chance in Beijing, where 
Bibi is vacationing, and begin a decade-long correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in near feudal circumstances, Karen (who has secretly adopted an 
American name in her eagerness to emulate all things Western) views Bibi as a 
thrilling emissary from "paradise." She pleads with Bibi to become her American 
sponsor so that she can emigrate to the United States. Bibi, the perky, 
privileged offspring of Chinese American parents, initially views Karen as a 
pest who is merely trying to use her as a ticket out of China. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as the young women's epistolary intimacy increases, Bibi finds an 
unexpectedly kindred spirit in her Chinese pen pal. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bibi drifts from job to job and man to man, unable to find a purpose in her 
life beyond shopping at the mall, her much-vaunted liberty becomes dust and 
ashes in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, while Bibi is adrift in a materialistic abyss, Karen grows ever 
more purposeful. Buoyed up by her country's shift toward democracy, Karen 
marries an academic and becomes active in the student radical movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen's wistful, courageous gropings toward freedom culminate disastrously in 
Tian An Men Square, while a stunned world looks on. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it occasionally treads the low road to melodrama, Wong's play, ably 
directed by Szu Wang Wakeman, is genuinely cathartic. For those who might be 
misled by the title, which suggests a dry, dusty university lecture, it is also 
surprisingly upbeat and funny, in effective contrast to the drama's grim 
denouement. 
</P>
<P>
 An energetic and polished cast -- which includes Newton Kaneshiro, Art Desuyo, 
Rex Lee and Janet J. Song -- manages the formidable feat of re-creating the 
Tian An Men Square massacre. Aided by Debra Garcia Lockwood's evocative 
lighting, the performers convincingly convey the panic, violence and dashed 
expectations of that terrible event.

Mixed 'Success' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Secret of Success" at the Cast, actor-playwright-director Robert 
Glaudini demonstrates that he is jack of all trades, master of one. Glaudini's 
acting skills outpace his talents as playwright and director, at least in this 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 As the smarmy former private eye T. Claude Brown, Glaudini creates an 
appealingly oddball character whose smarm is balanced by his charm.  
</P>
<P>
 Glaudini's writing is another matter. An uneasy hybrid of realism and farce, 
the play is further hindered by a lame McGuffin device that wouldn't pass 
muster in an episodic television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Directorially, Glaudini fares somewhat better, drawing quirkily compelling 
performances out of his cast. Shawna Casey is particularly effective as the 
strung-out hooker Celine, a street angel dancing on the head of a heroin 
needle. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Glaudini does little to smooth over the conflicting styles of his own 
work, sacrificing discipline for a performer-oriented showcase that smacks of 
an acting class improv.

MUSIC REVIEW; EAR UNIT ENDS ITS SEASON WITH THEATRICS AND A TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California EAR Unit, bless its syncopated heart, refuses to divulge what 
-- if anything -- the EAR acronym means. In a similar way, the ensemble refuses 
to abide by a definable musical mandate, focusing on contemporary music in its 
myriad forms. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was fitting that, for its season closer at the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art on Wednesday, the Unit displayed a self-typifying brand of eclecticism. 
Elements of dadaistic theater, jazz flavoring, prop/process music and varying 
degrees of tonality all fit neatly into the fabric of a madcap evening. 
</P>
<P>
 As a dazzling centerpiece, we had "typOpera," as ambitious and fun-loving a 
work as any the Unit has performed this year. Inspired by the surreal collage 
pioneer Kurt Schwitters, the piece was conceived by committee, headed by Eve 
Beglarian, with Unit members James Rohrig and Arthur Jarvinen, and with 
contributions by the rest of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentally absurd, yet also exacting, this is an 
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink work, replete with projections, a cheerleader 
routine, Firesign Theater-like antics, collapsed cliches and a general 
associative jumble accenting irreverence. Much of the text, such as it is, 
consists of dissected, nonsense linguistics, organized into infectious musical 
motives that split the difference between camp and art. 
</P>
<P>
 A little well-executed, non-linear malarkey is always good for what ails you. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the program, Bernardo Feldman's evocative "Creatures of Habit" basks 
in a Cage-ian sparseness, as well as a tender wistfulness -- viewed through a 
fog. John White's process-minded "Pieces From the 'Scratch Orchestra' " 
elicited an unexpected sublimity from such offbeat sources as bottles and Jew's 
Harps. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted jazz saxophonist-composer Oliver Lake's rough-hewn chamber jazz piece 
"Flirtation Blues" duly flirts with blues and jazz vernaculars. Lake spreads 
stylistic tentacles in Europe, New York and some rural folk tradition of 
uncertain origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the EAR Unit continues to chart its course from an unusually 
diverse, cut-up road map. JOSEF WOODARD

THEATER BEAT: 'SACRIFICIAL DANCE' TAKES ON SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sacrificial Dance" at the Court Theatre is a temper tantrum thinly disguised 
as a drama, twisting that paradigm of rational inquiry -- the courtroom drama 
-- into a highly stylized and increasingly ludicrous tirade against "The 
System." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Donna McGee's exploration of society's inadequate response to child 
sexual abuse centers on a teen-age girl (Lori Horowitz) on trial for shooting 
her tyrannical father (Bill McKinney). 
</P>
<P>
 The surreal trial mixes elements of Kafka, Perry Mason and Greek tragedy with 
masked jurors doubling as witnesses to re-create the events that led to the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite McGee's serious intentions, the play founders on its heavy-handed 
symbolism. The father is not just bad, he's evil incarnate, the girl a purebred 
martyr. And the eventual ruling by the masked judge (Matthew Knox) is a 
senseless punishment that violates the play's own legal context. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney and Horowitz bring commendable intensity to their stereotyped roles, 
as does Nathan LeGrand as the redneck in a tangential racism subplot. 
</P>
<P>
 But dramatic coherence doesn't stand a chance here. The ultimate dreamlike 
merging of the evil father and the judge into a single figure of 
undifferentiated wrath is the final proof we're hopelessly mired in archetypal 
muck. 
</P>

ART REVIEW; GEOMETRIC ABSTRACTIONS FROM SALLY GALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At G. Ray Hawkins, Sally Gall's black-and-white landscape photographs work 
against type. Here, place is rendered all but irrelevant. Instead of 
heightening the beauty of the lagoons of Bali, the vertiginousness of the 
cliffs of Etretat or the moodiness of the coast of Scotland, Gall transforms 
these sites into components of her own conceptual schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 For a die-hard romanticist, Gall is unusually enamored of geometric 
abstraction. And so, a patch of water in a grassy field in Harris becomes an 
inverted triangle of white against black; a pair of mountaintops in Glen Coe is 
transmuted into a cycle of endless regression; and the famous cliffs at 
Etretat, seen from above, carve out a near-perfect ellipse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall is also interested in the kind of trompe l'oeil effects generated by 
reflections in water. In one astonishing scene at Bukit Jata, a mirror image of 
clouds in a lagoon is so uncanny one cannot be sure the photograph isn't upside 
down. Trees reflected in the water in Bayou make up another optical illusion; 
it is impossible to determine where the sinewy trunks end and the wavering 
reflections begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Gall's favorite visual conceit, however, is freezing fluid or 
ephemeral forms -- a river as sleek and unruffled as a pane of glass; a 
waterfall as solid as the rocky mass behind it; a line of surf stitched as 
tightly as a seam. Transforming the dynamic into the static is, of course, 
photography's mandate; Gall takes this generic truth and transforms it, in 
turn, into poetry. Admittedly, the work is undercut by Gall's rather formulaic 
approach to conceptualism -- and thereby, to beauty. It is, however, her 
insistence upon the poetic that redeems it.

THEATER REVIEW; LONG BEACH 'SOUTH PACIFIC' DOWNPLAYS SENTIMENTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to musicals, everything old is new again. "Carousel," "Show 
Boat" and "Damn Yankees" are only three of the many Broadway chestnuts 
radically rethought, refurbished and remounted in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to "South Pacific," that old Rodgers & Hammerstein coconut 
keeps bouncing along in revival like a cockeyed optimist. No double-barreled 
reconsiderations. No major rewrites. Not even significant retouching. 
</P>
<P>
 You can always count on some producer to put it up in its more-or-less 
pristine form, as though a season without World War II Seabees and Navy nurses 
on a Polynesian island would constitute theatrical deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the Long Beach Civic Light Opera has come to our aid with an 
ambitious, full-bodied revival starring Sandy Duncan as Nellie Forbush, a 
provincial young ensign from Little Rock, Ark., who can't help falling in love 
with the island's wealthy Frenchman, Emile de Becque, a worldly plantation 
owner played by Michael Nouri. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, which opened Wednesday at the Terrace Theatre, relies less on 
the dramatic pull of their May-December romance than on the nostalgic charms of 
a romantic score filled with substance as well as feeling. It not only captures 
a time more innocent than our own but appeals to our common humanity across the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Broadway musicals can match the songs of "South Pacific" for their 
beguiling tunes and meaningful lyrics. Whether addressing such varied subjects 
as love at first sight ("Some Enchanted Evening"), race prejudice ("You've Got 
to Be Carefully Taught") or lost possibilities ("This Nearly Was Mine"), they 
speak a rare yet simple language. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan gives a lively, first-rate performance. She exudes sincerity. Her 
singing is stylish, her dancing limber and polished. Nouri more than holds his 
own. His bearish presence both as an actor and singer makes a warm match for 
her gamin-like personality. He anchors Duncan with tender strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that director Robert Iscove allows the show to get preachy or wear its 
melodious heart on its sleeve. At least not too visibly. He goes for comic 
energy at every turn, which dissipates the sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 He also injects an atmosphere of realism through Douglas D. Smith's 
kaleidoscopic screen projections. They are overlayed like a collage on a 
see-through scrim or on a solid backdrop and combined with live action to 
suggest the aura of the '40s. For all its innocence, we see a world at war. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has weak spots: stilted dialogue, wooden acting in secondary roles, a 
tendency to sag between musical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most glaring flaw is Mitchell Anderson's weak performance as Joe 
Cable, the Princeton-educated lieutenant who falls in love with the Tonkinese 
girl Liat.  
</P>
<P>
 The pathos of Cable's romance ought to lend the show added poignancy. His love 
for Liat is doomed, after all, because he feels hostage to white racism. 
</P>
<P>
 While the relationship between Cable and Liat is never easy to bring off 
without seeming contrived or patronizing, here it is wholly undeveloped and 
uninvolving. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Suzuki plays the Tonkinese peddler Bloody Mary with animation to spare in 
a crowd-pleasing role that is, as usual, more caricature than character. Steve 
Witting offers a serviceable Luther Billis, chief Seabee. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the show has the advantages of a male chorus with a big sound, an 
imaginative scenic design, rich lighting and a well-conducted orchestra.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'CARLITO'S' CATCHES 'THE FUGITIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Fugitive" was finally caught but, surprisingly, not by "Mrs. Doubtfire." 
The Al Pacino gangster movie "Carlito's Way" muscled its way past "The 
Fugitive," the long-running No. 1 rental, to the top, dropping "Fugitive" to 
No. 2. But to hear some retailers talk about the way renters are clamoring for 
"Mrs. Doubtfire," you'd think it was already No. 1. The Robin Williams comedy 
did jump from No. 38 to No. 5, a nifty climb for any other movie. For this 
blockbuster, though, anything less than No. 1 is a disappointment. "Malice," 
the thriller with Alec Baldwin, is doing strong business, jumping from No. 8 to 
No. 3, and could challenge for No. 1. The animated feature "Batman: Mask of the 
Phantasm" debuted at No. 23. There's not much renter interest so far in "Mr. 
Jones," the drama starring Richard Gere. It inched up just one notch, to No. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 * This drama, starring Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, was just in theaters for 
about a month late last year, grossing a paltry $9.1 million. But Ryan is big 
in the rental market, largely due to "Sleepless in Seattle," and she has 
another drama in theaters now--"When a Man Loves a Woman." So her rental-market 
popularity plus her high profile due to the current release may translate into 
rental business for "Flesh and Bone," which debuted at a modest No. 18.

'HABEAS': A GOOD MIX OF TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since each performance of Alan Bennett's "Habeas Corpus" at the Matrix Theatre 
features a different mix of actors drawn from the production's dual casts, 
there's no way to know in advance which of the alternates might appear in any 
given role. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, though. Any loss in predictability is more than offset by the 
opportunity to see first-rate performers who couldn't commit to stage work in a 
small house without the schedule flexibility that allows them to pursue other 
projects during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The implicit concession to the reality of live theater's back-seat status to 
film and television may rankle stage purists, but the benefits of Matrix 
producer Joe Stern's double-casting strategy were obvious in the impressive 
range of talent arrayed for the two performances reviewed last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the tight constraints of Bennett's energetic farce (which combines the 
sophisticated wit of "The Importance of Being Earnest" with the raunchy 
burlesque of "The Benny Hill Show"), the differences between casts are 
primarily in interpretive spin rather than quality of performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The widest variations are in Bennett's bastions of upper-middle-class 
hypocrisy, the philandering Dr. Wicksteed and his long-suffering wife, Muriel. 
As the not-so-good doctor who "couldn't heal a shoe," Charles Hallahan 
flounders hopelessly in his own romantic delusions, while Robert Foxworth is 
more the self-aware realist (though just as hilariously enslaved to his raging 
hormones). 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Knight plays Muriel as a clueless, bewildered matron -- the funniest 
moment in the production is her round-eyed astonishment (and delight) when 
she's mistakenly "adjusted" by a salesman (Andrew Robinson or Andrew Bloch) who 
thinks she's wearing his bust-enlargement product; in contrast, Jennifer 
Bassey's Muriel is sharper and feistier, but less endearingly befuddled. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the inevitable complications are their hypochondriac son 
(equally nerdy JD Cullum and Gregory Cooke) and the seductive gold digger 
(outrageous Kaitlin Hopkins or enigmatic Anna Gunn) who snares him; spinster 
Aunt Constance (Nancy Lenehan in both reviewed performances) and the lecherous 
priest (effete Alastair Duncan or aggressive Cotter Smith) who urges her to 
join him in "the forefront of Anglican sexuality"; rival doctor Sir Percy 
Shorter (wiry Hamilton Camp or aloof Charles Berendt); and the meddlesome 
commentator-maid (pushy, mischievous Paddi Edwards or twinkly, demented Marian 
Mercer).  
</P>
<P>
 Qualitative differences in performance are minimal, though Nan Martin is a 
more imperious presence than Audra Lindley as the Lady Bracknell-ish 
aristocratic snob, and Berendt brings more comic lunacy to his suicidal patient 
than does Brian Mallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit director Kristoffer Tabori for the continuity his precision staging 
brings to the various casts, and for frenetic pacing appropriate to Bennett's 
verbal acrobatics. He hasn't solved the problematic final 15 minutes, however, 
in which the play seems perpetually stuck on the verge of ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Successful production embellishments include colorful Hockneyesque painted 
backdrops (by Deborah Raymond and Dorian Vernacchio) in place of the scripted 
bare stage, and a score by Ross Levinson setting Bennett's occasional spoken 
poems to music. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Habeas Corpus" and the preceding Matrix production of "The Tavern" have 
been smart choices -- the kind of plot-driven comedies that can easily 
incorporate the performance variations inherent in the "plug-and-play" casting 
concept. Character-based dramas like "King Lear" or "Death of a Salesman," 
however, might pose a greater challenge. We'll just have to wait and see.

REVEALING THE MECHANISM OF 'BUY IT!' MESSAGE; ART: THE LINK BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHY 
AND THE CULTURE OF CONSUMPTION IS EXAMINED IN THE 'COMMODITY IMAGE' EXHIBIT IN 
LAGUNA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not so long ago, we were what we ate. Now, according to Willis Hartshorn, 
incoming director of the International Center of Photography in New York, we 
are what we buy. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't make us the most shallow people in the history of humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tendency today to be very negative about issues of consumption and 
consumerism," said Hartshorn, curator of "Commodity Image," an exhibition 
opening today at Laguna Art Museum. "There's a tendency to feel self-conscious, 
particularly among Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the act of consumption has defined us from the beginning of time," 
Hartshorn said. "It's a complicated relationship, and some of it may be 
unattractive, especially when it's a matter purely of fashion or style. But it 
is such a strong driving force, so central to how our world works, that I think 
we underappreciate its power and influence." 
</P>
<P>
 To sort out that complicated relationship, Hartshorn, 43, uses mostly recent 
photographs to look at our preoccupation with consumption; the role of 
photography in today's consumer lifestyle and how commercial photography 
influences our collective desires; how photographs themselves have become a 
commodity, and other far-flung aspects of the pas de deux of photographic art 
and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The touring exhibition, which opened in New York last year and traveled to 
Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art before reaching Laguna, is divided into 
eight sections such as "Celebrity, Sex and Glamour," "Work and Labor" and 
"Money." Art, advertising and social-documentary photographers include Cindy 
Sherman, Barbara Norfleet, Lee Friedlander and Stephen Meisel.  
</P>
<P>
 "Photography in the Art Market" traces Ansel Adams' "Moonrise, Hernandez, New 
Mexico" (circa 1941) through incarnations as a gelatin silver print, wall 
calendar and post card. Also displayed are a print of Adams' "Yosemite Valley, 
Winter" (1940) as it appeared on a Hills Bros. coffee can and contemporary 
photographic commentaries on Adams' work including Michael Bishop's 
"Aspirinrise" (1973) and Jim Stone's "Pricerise" (1981). 
</P>
<P>
 In other sections, Andrew Bush muses on the workings of the art market: A 
print of a $1 bill in an edition of one fetches $1,000, while the image of a 
$1,000 bill, printed in an edition of 1,000, fetches $1. The press kit for the 
Photo, Fragrance for Men cologne suggests that "The Lagerfeld Photo Man shoots 
and directs the scenes of his own life. Passion. Success. Energy . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hartshorn, photographs may be endlessly seducing us into buying 
things we don't need, but that doesn't mean we should think of photography as 
the devil's handmaiden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like so much else in our culture," he said. "You have to accept 
responsibility for understanding what is going on around you. We can no longer 
suggest that the way photographs operate is something we don't understand. We 
know where truth ends and where fantasy begins in an image. Or (at least) we 
know where we should become suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing where to be suspicious allows individuals to exercise freedom of 
choice and good judgment, which Hartshorn suggests is preferable to society 
trying to limit choices, ostensibly for the good of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like cigarettes," he said. "Clearly the only defense is not to get rid of 
these things, cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Funny that Hartshorn should bring up cigarettes: The exhibition and tour is 
being sponsored by Philip Morris Companies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting point," Hartshorn said. "Philip Morris was very conscious 
of the fact that the very questions raised in the show were questions that they 
faced on a daily basis. It is to their credit that they were willing to 
participate and support something that asked questions that struck very close 
to home." 
</P>
<P>
 For the public, the question that strikes closest to home is not which came 
first, the desire to smoke or the advertisement showing a smoking cowboy; not 
which came first, designer jeans or the image of a sultry model wearing those 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 But since we know so well how easily photographic representations are 
manipulated, the question becomes: Why do we so readily swallow the messages 
they convey -- and buy what we see? 
</P>
<P>
 "On one hand, we don't anymore," Hartshorn said. "As a culture, it's clear 
that we're suspicious. We no longer look at a photograph and say, 'That's 
reality, that's true.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We allow ourselves to suspend our disbelief in moments when it suits our 
emotional needs. When the image represents a product, we allow ourselves to 
believe its message (because doing so) provides a level of pleasure and 
reassurance, because it provides an element of fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of this may be giving the public a great deal more credit than is due. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that we all know this, (but that) there is enough information 
that we all should know this," Hartshorn said. "One thing the exhibition is 
saying is that you can ' t be passive." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hartshorn, it is possible to learn how to avoid being seduced by 
images' seductive power. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be able to look at how many directions (an image) is coming at 
you from," he said. "We must be able to (see the image as) independent.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want people to just be turned off, to think that all this is so 
terrible and manipulative," Hartshorn said. "I want people to step back and 
look at the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see how Madonna is functioning in our culture, how she has been able to 
use every medium available -- books, television, movies, magazines, recordings, 
absolutely everything -- to create herself and constantly re-create herself to 
somehow keep us interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those mechanisms are what this exhibition is about," he said. "Those are the 
mechanisms that continue to fascinate." 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; POLYGRAM'S MUSIC VIDEO STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Music videos have never sold as well as some optimists back in the mid-1980s 
predicted. They're only a small part of the home-entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, executives do cartwheels when a music video sells 100,000 copies. By 
comparison, a performer who only sells that many copies of an album is liable 
to wind up unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Video companies are always looking for ways to lure customers to buy music 
videos. One way is to offer music that's only available on video. 
</P>
<P>
 That's PolyGram's strategy with new videos by U2 and the Cranberries -- both 
out Tuesday, priced at $20. "This music is only available on video," said Paul 
Freehauf, the company's senior director of sellthrough marketing. "There will 
be no audio release of any of this music." 
</P>
<P>
 U2's "Zoo TV Live From Sydney" is a two-hour concert filmed in Australia. It 
doesn't feature any new music, but the Cranberries' video, "The Cranberries 
Live," does. 
</P>
<P>
 Freehauf explained that, in addition to eight songs from the group's hit debut 
album, the video features live versions of seven unreleased songs. Five of 
these tunes, he added, will appear on the group's second album, due this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with selling music videos is that many fans don't know they exist. 
So PolyGram is going to put CD containers advertising the video in the music 
section of various stores. "If fans come in looking for an album, they'll find 
out there's a music video in the video section," Freehauf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason music videos have never really caught on is that, played on 
standard TV speakers with a mono VCR, the music doesn't sound very good. 
PolyGram is urging fans to hook their stereo systems to their TVs. Special 
Interest Videos 
</P>
<P>
 The grim but outstanding two-hour documentary "When Ireland Starved" details 
the famine that killed millions last century, using sketches to illustrate the 
commentary. It helps to explain the Ireland-England feud. For $30 from Celtic 
Video, (212) 689-4853. . . . College basketball fans -- Arkansas supporters in 
particular -- will appreciate CBS Video's rush-released look at the school's 
recent triumph, "Hog Wild: The Official 1994 NCAA Championship Video." It 
includes a lot of footage not seen on TV. For $20, (800) 747-7999. 
</P>
<P>
 For Barry Manilow fans, a good-quality concert video, filmed a year ago in 
London's Wembley Arena, "The Greatest Hits . . . and Then Some" (BMG, $20). . . 
. An absolute must for dog-lovers, a three-tape, boxed set from A&E, narrated 
by Jack Perkins, about the history of the animal, showing how it came to be 
known as man's best friend. On New Video, at $60. . . . College-oriented high 
schoolers will find plenty of use for the first-rate, one-hour guide, "The 
Princeton Review: Everything You Need to Know About the New SAT and the College 
Admissions Process." From A*Vision Entertainment, at $20, (212) 275-2900.

 New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Addams Family Values" (Paramount). Starring Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia and 
Christina Ricci, this is a sequel to the hit "Addams Family" movie based on the 
old TV series, where sick jokes and poor taste are all in good fun. Despite a 
lame villainess (Joan Cusack), the sequel is much funnier than the first one -- 
which, however, wasn't that funny.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Three Musketeers" (Disney). A lively Brat Pack version of Alexandre 
Dumas' great swashbuckling buddy tale, with Chris O'Donnell as D'Artangnan and 
Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen and Oliver Platt as the Musketeers. Breezy 
fun, geared to the younger crowd, with lots of pageantry and sword fights. But 
nowhere near as entertaining as director Richard Lester's 1975 "The Four 
Musketeers" -- the best of the umpteen film versions of this story. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Warner's "On Deadly Ground," starring Steven Seagal, is due 
July 20.

TV REVIEWS; GOSSETT STARS AS SLEUTHING RESTAURATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does the world really need another slick P.I. series? Not hardly, but if it's 
going to get one anyway, Louis Gossett Jr. might as well step in to take the 
slack. He stars tonight in "Ray Alexander: A Taste for Justice," the first of a 
series of two-hour mystery movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery's just mediocre; Gossett's a sleuth and a gentleman, and a 
commanding reason to keep watching. 
</P>
<P>
 His Ray is a devoted restaurateur who still does private investigation gigs on 
the side to keep his hole-in-the-wall in business. When his usual contractor -- 
a high-powered attorney played with a good, crusty gumption by James Coburn -- 
calls him in to meet an unjustly accused client, both are first asked to try 
Ray's very tentative new crab cakes recipe, as assorted cops, love interests 
and suspects will be asked to try them.  
</P>
<P>
 In dire -- but not too dire -- need of exoneration is a pretty young widow 
who's been rather expertly framed for the hit-and-run murder of her 
psychiatrist husband.  
</P>
<P>
 The climactic twist is pretty well visible from the next state. The villains 
and helpmates are serviceable at best. A car chase performed by a driver in a 
chokehold stretches credulity past the most generous limits. And the San 
Francisco setting uses almost as many L.A. locations as establishing shots of 
the Transamerica Building. 
</P>
<P>
 So why tune in? For the delicious crab cakes? 
</P>
<P>
 No, for the hope that Gossett gets to make good on the charisma set in place 
here, as a reassuringly smart, tough, funny (but not terminally quip-happy) 
fellow you'd want to pass time with in a bar and have gun-totingly handy in the 
proverbial pinch. (To add that TV's a little short on recurring African 
American role-model types probably isn't superfluous.) When he brings in 
another Ray, Charles, to sing "Hallelujah, I Love Her So" for the finale, he 
shamelessly cements our trust. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ray Alexander: A Taste for Justice" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 
36 and 39).

TV REVIEWS; 'NEW TO AMERICA' SERIES ON IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few social comic-tragedies match the spectacle of American children of 
immigrants bashing new immigrants. It's difficult to tell what's worse -- their 
racism or their myopia. But in the case of Taggart Siegel and Kati Johnson's 
1988 documentary opening "New to America," a nine-part series of independent 
films and videos on U.S. immigrants, the situation is even more sensitized 
than, say, the clash between Californians and undocumented Latin American 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Collar and Buddha" observes what happens when Laotian refugees, having 
fled Communist oppression in their homeland devastated by the Vietnam War, try 
to make new lives for themselves in economically depressed Rockford, Ill. Two 
very fragile and very different social elements suddenly find they have to live 
together: the tiny Laotian community, some of them "boat people," mostly 
centered around the only local Buddhist temple; and long-term Rockford 
residents, mostly white and Christian, some Vietnam veterans, many out of work 
and bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees, highly motivated to survive and prosper after their near-brushes 
with death, prove to be good employees and diligent workers. As series host 
Edward James Olmos perhaps needlessly points out in his epilogue, those 
Rockfordians who work alongside the refugees not only have no complaints about 
them, but also praise their skills and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Siegel and Johnson's view, it's those who don't work with them, or feel 
that the Laotians have somehow "taken away" good jobs, who have the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Some crucial background analysis comes too late in this sloppily constructed 
video, especially mental health expert William Liu's comments on the enormous 
differences between immigrants -- who may plan their move for many years in 
advance -- and refugees, who may have less than two hours to pack and flee. 
</P>
<P>
 To the natives who tell these refugees to go back home, a young Laotian man, 
who works in a furniture factory during the week and paints during the weekend, 
tersely responds: "We've got nowhere to run." 
</P>
<P>
 * "New to America" airs Fridays at 10 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28.

 HELP WANTED: For 15 months the rubble from a massive landslide has blocked 
Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point, drawing the ire of local businesses and 
detoured motorists. But surprisingly, the construction community hasn't shown 
much interest in landing the $3-million restoration job. . . . "We've had no 
calls, zero, from anyone interested in the entire project," says city official 
Andy Anderson. After much federal red tape, the city will soon seek bids on 
clearing the road.

 HER LIGHTER SIDE: Louise Fletcher is best known for her Academy Award-winning 
role as mean-spirited Nurse Ratched in 1975's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's

often collected while on location. . . . Fletcher's first show will be at the 
three-day Capistrano Antique & Garden Show, which opens today in San Juan 
Capistrano. "Most of what I buy are 18th- or 19th-Century decorative pieces," 
she says. "I just like things that are pretty."

 STILL COOKIN': Newport Beach millionaire John Crean's and his kitchen partner

with the demise of ABC's "Home Show." But they're still cooking on local cable 
channels. They've also been talking with ABC's "Mike & Maty" and some other 
shows. . . . "The Food Channel told us they were looking for serious cooking 
shows," complains Venezia. Crean is unperturbed by the show's wavering 
fortunes: "I just show up and cook."

VICTIMS EMERGE AS KEY FORCE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Ralph Hubbard visited a prison, he sat alone in the parking lot 
for half an hour, his stomach churning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard, 62, a tough former cop, certainly knew criminals. But now he was 
facing them in a searing new role. When his only son was shot to death after a 
senseless argument over a videotape, he joined the swelling army of Americans 
who know helplessness, frustration and rage as victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 After the murder, he punched a hole in a wall. He wept almost every day for 
eight months, alone, too proud to show his tears, on the top floor of his home 
in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Hubbard's anguish turned to action. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a board member of Parents of Murdered Children of New York State, 
and that role brought him to Rikers Island, the world's largest detention 
center, with 14,800 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never just stand and forgive the person," he told a prisoner who 
asked about his son's killer. "I wanted to get my gun and go out and find him 
and blow him away. But I had responsibilities. . . . I did not push that one 
button that would have made me go over the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard's meeting with the prisoners in the Rikers library -- a recounting of 
his tragedy designed to confront criminals with the carnage they cause -- is 
just one example of the activism of the crime victims movement in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Hubbard ventured where victims did not go a few years ago, advocates 
for victims can now be found in courts, prosecutors' offices, churches, 
hospitals, mental health facilities and social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In two decades the movement has grown to more than 9,000 organizations with 
millions of members, ranging from Mothers Against Drunk Driving to the Family 
Violence Prevention Fund to Concerns of Police Survivors, which helps relatives 
of slain officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, victims-rights advocates have become a prime mover in making 
crime the nation's No. 1 concern. They are the centerpiece of media focus on 
the effects of crime. They are the most numerous voices for stiffer penalties. 
They are demanding -- and increasingly getting -- action from police, 
prosecutors, parole boards and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime victims have one horrible badge -- credibility," said Jay Howell, a 
former prosecutor in Jacksonville, Fla., who helped set up the National Center 
for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims movement has shown . . . that it is increasingly well-organized, 
that it is mobilized, that it is motivated and that it has become a powerful 
force in passing legislation," said G. Morris Gurley, vice president of the 
National Victim Center, a group dedicated to securing fair treatment for crime 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 And politicians are calling the groups, soliciting support. "Suddenly, 
everybody is looking and saying: 'We've got to get on the bandwagon,' " Gurley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the public's mood at the start of his reelection campaign, Gov. Pete 
Wilson presided at a crime summit with the mothers and fathers of murder 
victims. State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, running to be his Democratic opponent, 
has also been conferring with advocates for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is seeking a fourth term, has been meeting 
with victims groups and was the principal speaker at candlelight memorial 
services in Manhattan commemorating National Crime Victims Week. The city's new 
Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, also spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has taped a TV commercial against violence directed at 
children and met recently with a few crime victims at the White House. 
Administration members were highly visible at a conference on family violence 
sponsored in Washington by the American Medical Assn., several foundations and 
victims rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala addressed the meeting with Shalala pledging: "The President has shown 
his unwavering commitment to our cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Heightened media focus on victims, particularly by TV's "reality" shows, has 
added to the national outrage over crime. TV producers are scrambling to find 
victims with gripping stories that can be converted to potentially high-ratings 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeding frenzy," said Michael I. Rudell, a New York entertainment 
lawyer who represents TV personalities and producers. "There is not only 
inter-network competition. There is intra-network competition between shows." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers usually don't have to look very far. A murder occurs in the 
United States every 21 minutes, a robbery every 46 seconds and more than one 
rape a minute. In 1992, 23% of U.S. households were victimized by a crime of 
violence or theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming a victim of crime makes victims want others not to have to 
experience what they did," said Anne K. Seymour, a longtime advocate for 
victims who has worked closely with the criminal-justice community. "That is 
the strength of the victims movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement began in 1963 when the government of New Zealand established the 
first victims compensation program. California started the first program in the 
United States two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, groups zeroed in on the lack of victims rights in the 
criminal-justice system. Victims were not kept informed about court cases or 
notified about vital proceedings. They were forced to wait long hours -- 
sometimes in the presence of their attackers -- before testifying. Victims 
complained they had no voice in the filing of charges, plea-bargaining or 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy N. Friedman, executive director of New York's Victim Services, the 
nation's largest victim-assistance organization, said: "We would hear these 
horror stories about rape victims walking into a police precinct and having the 
desk sergeant yell: 'Would the victim of the rape last night come forward?' We 
would hear the mother of a homicide victim saying that when she asked when the 
next adjournment was going to be on the case, the assistant district attorney 
would say: 'Why do you want to know? You weren't the victim or you weren't a 
witness to the crime.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In more than two decades, the victims movement has scored some notable 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 All 50 states now have compensation programs making direct payments to victims 
for such expenses as unpaid medical bills, mental health counseling and funeral 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the Justice Department set up the Office for Victims of Crime to 
administer a fund to funnel money to state compensation programs. The office 
also makes direct grants to victim assistance organizations. Federal courts and 
U.S. attorneys collect fines and other penalties from convicted criminals to 
pay for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' bills of rights ensuring dignified and respectful treatment, 
including the right to participate in key legal proceedings, have been adopted 
by most states. 
</P>
<P>
 All states now include some input from victims in sentencing, with at least 35 
allowing victims to appear in court to make a statement before a judge renders 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 14 states have passed constitutional amendments that would guarantee 
victims the right to be present, informed and heard at all key stages of the 
criminal-justice process. Maryland, Idaho and Utah have such an amendment on 
the ballot this year. 
</P>
<P>
 All U.S. attorneys and many district attorneys have established victim 
assistance programs. Typically, they notify victims of the key steps in their 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Victim Center's legislative database has grown to 20,000 
statutes, ranging from laws allowing child victims to provide testimony on 
videotape to up-to-the-minute information about the status of the state 
constitutional amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached the point where the rules are on the books," said David 
Beatty, the center's public affairs director. "Now we are trying to (win) the 
hearts and minds of people charged with implementing those rules." 
</P>
<P>
 But major problems still exist. Many state compensation funds face serious 
financial difficulties. Federal contributions vary from year to year, depending 
on the amount of criminal fines collected, while the number of victims seeking 
money is rising. In New York state, a backlog of 17,000 claims exists, and the 
waiting period victims face for payment is about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 While many judges throughout the nation order offenders to pay restitution, 
enforcement often is spotty and many convicted criminals don't pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, victims organizations have branched out, operating shelters and 
support groups for battered women, day-care centers in courts and 
student-mediation projects that try to prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
 They also train police officers to be sensitive to victims' needs and help 
hospital workers to detect signs of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In some hospitals, advocates for victims seek out new parents at high risk for 
child abuse and provide continuing counseling when they go home with their 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, 1986, when 14 people were murdered at a post office in Edmond, 
Okla., organizations in the movement have sent trauma teams to the scenes of 65 
disasters -- including plane crashes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and mass 
murders -- to help both survivors and rescuers cope with crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We train volunteers every year who are ready to go at a moment's notice," 
said Marlene Young, executive director of the National Organization for Victim 
Assistance, a Washington group dedicated to victims rights and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims movement has moved beyond its original goals," she added. "Now we 
are focused not only on the direct victims of crime, but we also can recognize 
the impact on family members, friends and the community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 That is partly why Hubbard made his trip to Rikers Island. Here was an 
opportunity to put a face on the consequences of violence, to humanize himself 
and underline his family's ordeal after the death of his son. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prisoners -- some of them convicted murderers -- listened, Hubbard told 
them how his wife isolated herself in their Brooklyn home for months after the 
murder. He recounted how his eldest daughter found him, his eyes red from 
crying. " 'You see these shoulders?' " he recalled her asking. " 'You made 
these shoulders so therefore you can cry on them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He told how his wife finally snapped out of her depression. He said he 
recalled to her an incident in which their son had eaten his own son's 
sandwich. With a straight face, their grandson said the sandwich was part of 
his school science project and he had put four worms between the bread, which 
caused their son to throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 The story made his wife roar with laughter. "She was on her knees and holding 
her belly and she was just going nuts," Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he said, they stayed up and hugged and talked most of the night, 
and when Hubbard woke up the next morning his wife was gone. The phone rang. 
She was calling to say she was out having her hair and nails done. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the breakthrough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only one set of tear ducts in the human body," he told the 
prisoners, "tears of joy and tears of sorrow. Tears of joy are really large."

<P>
 Yemen's opposing armies both claimed victory Thursday in the fight for a 
strategic southern city. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from the southern forces said they seized Dhala, which is 65 miles 
northwest of the southern bastion of Aden on a main route from the north. 
</P>
<P>
 But northern officials also said they controlled the city. The claims could 
not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners continued to flee the country. Britain sent two Hercules C-130 
transport planes Thursday to Sana, the capital, to evacuate 154 people, 
including 67 Britons and 36 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Casualty estimates in the civil war have varied widely, ranging from a few 
hundred to 12,000 killed or wounded.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: ROGAN'S HAPPY AS LONG AS THEY DON'T ASK HIM TO GRAB A MOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 HIZZHONOR ARRIVES: James E. Rogan may have followed in Pat Nolan's footsteps 
in representing the 43rd Assembly District in the Legislature, but don't think 
for a minute that he got to move his law books and family photos right into 
Nolan's roomy former office. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this week he's settling into what's known around the Assembly as the 
"broom closet" -- the smallest office in the most remote area of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting visitors are shown to seats in the cafeteria next door. And if you 
open the side door to Rogan's private inner chambers, you'll see a fleet of 
aluminum meat-cutting carts parked just outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a reminder of his lowly status as the most junior member of the minority 
party, courtesy of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who carried 
on a love-hate friendship with Rogan's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rogan, a Glendale Republican who ran for the Assembly after Nolan resigned 
and pleaded guilty to racketeering, might be a short-timer at that -- filling 
only the remainder of Nolan's 1994 term unless he wins the primary and general 
election too. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the Speaker assigning him to the notorious office-ette, Rogan speaks 
optimistically about his future in the Capitol. He regards his sentence to Room 
6017 as a "badge of honor." History, he notes, shows that among the previous 
tenants of the broom closet are two who, once upon a time, ran afoul of former 
Assembly Speaker Jesse Unruh -- Brown himself and a young assemblyman named 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rogan says Democrats and Republicans alike have been gracious in 
welcoming him, with many confiding that they never really believed Nolan meant 
to break the law, and several posing the question that is foremost on their 
minds: Why would anyone give up a judgeship and take a $30,000 pay cut to 
become a legislator? 
</P>
<P>
 With wry humor, the former Glendale Municipal Court judge relates, "My mother 
had the best answer when asked that. She said, 'Well, you know, that time when 
he was a baby and I dropped him on his head. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PAY BOOSTS: Being new in town, Rogan is also not shy about forthrightly 
answering another oft-posed question: Will you, or will you not, accept the 37% 
salary increase that a citizens panel granted legislators? 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers are just plain ducking the issue, realizing that this kind of a 
salary boost doesn't sit well with voters who have tightened their own belts to 
ride out the recession. Consultants are advising them to figuratively throw up 
their arms and remind reporters they had nothing to do with the citizens 
commission's decision to boost their pay from $52,500 to $72,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rogan thinks that is a gutless response and says legislators shouldn't 
"hide behind" such a stance. "I need it so I'm going to take it," he said, 
noting it could make the difference between "Motel 6 and sleeping on my office 
couch." 
</P>
<P>
 Other legislators were skittish about even discussing the issue. Some dared 
not utter the dreaded words and had legislative aides return reporters' phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), for example. Among San Fernando 
Valley lawmakers, no one has a better talent for seeking publicity than Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the matter of the pay raise, it took spokeswoman Sue Gold to address 
the query: "Richard said to call and say, yes, he accepted it. Richard has 
nothing else to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) also had an aide call to 
read this statement: "I will accept the raise recommended by the citizens 
commission. This increase puts state legislators' compensation in line with 
comparable jobs in both the private sector and in many other public positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the money for the raise must come from the Legislature's own budget, 
which is capped under Proposition 140, there will not be any additional cost to 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Three area legislators avoided the issue like it was a hot potato to be dodged 
if tossed their way. They simply did not return calls on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena), state Sen. Don Rogers 
(R-Tehachapi) and state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who has moved 
into the Valley's 20th Senate District to run for election here. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others responded by saying they would rather not say, thank you, noting 
that the raise wouldn't affect them anyway because they are not seeking 
additional terms. The salary boost would take effect in December, their last 
month in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood), who is running for Los 
Angeles County Superior Court; Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), who 
is running for state insurance commissioner, and state Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys), who wants to be state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) said she'll take the pay hike, 
but only because it will be funded out of the Legislature's existing budget. 
She too noted that it was out of her hands, and the Legislature had no say-so 
in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'll accept it but only because it's not costing the taxpayers any 
additional dollars," Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's always the potential for flip-flopping on the controversial topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale) initially told reporters he 
would take the raise, tossing back the question of whether they would turn down 
a pay increase if offered one. 
</P>
<P>
 A day or so later, however, Knight's office phone started to ring with the 
most unhappy constituents complaining the loudest. "They're upset," he said, 
"and I can understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Knight says: "I don't know what I'm going to do with it yet," noting that 
he may decide to sign some of the money over to a local charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a hot issue and one of the worst things the 
commission could have done at this point in time," Knight said, upon 
reflection. "The state's in a recession, people are having to take pay cuts and 
the commission comes up and says, you're going to get a 37% pay increase. It 
couldn't have come at a worse time." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) did not get bogged down with the 
issue, however, noting that she is running for the Republican nomination for 
lieutenant governor and expects to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking very positively, and as lieutenant governor I don't get a pay 
raise, so I'm not concerned," Wright said. If she fails to emerge victorious 
from the June primary, Wright will then examine whether to accept the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow state Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale) said he has no qualms about 
taking the raise, though he seemed well aware that his decision may spark a 
ripple of discontent in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's a sensitive issue and I think most people feel that in the 
Legislature, even if we worked for free, we'd be overpaid," he said. "There 
would be no way for the Legislature to get even a dollar increase without the 
public being upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one Valley-area lawmaker said "Absolutely no way!" to the pay hike. And 
he happens to be the only one who is wealthy enough to fund his election bids 
by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) urged a roll call vote by the 
Legislature, putting every member on record about whether he or she will accept 
the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 In registering his outrage, however, the reformist senator and gubernatorial 
candidate did come clean in a news release: "Hayden acknowledged that his 
financial situation is better than most other legislators." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A QUESTION OF LIBEL: A state appellate court has dismissed a 5-year-old libel 
suit against Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by former Supervisor Baxter Ward, alleged that Antonovich 
defamed Ward during the 1988 campaign by charging that Ward had removed or 
destroyed 5th District office files eight years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal, in a ruling filed March 24, upheld a 1992 
judgment that found that Antonovich did not know the statement about the office 
files was false and did not publish the statement in reckless disregard for the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court also found that Ward, who represented himself, filed 
briefs that contained "an incomplete summary of the facts, insufficient record 
references and virtually no citation of pertinent authority."

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; WARNER NAMES NETWORK PROGRAMMING CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warner Bros. has tapped former Fox and Disney TV executive Garth Ancier to 
head programming for its new fifth network, which is set to premiere early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancier, who is teaming up with his former Fox boss and current WB Network 
President Jamie Kellner, will continue to produce the syndicated talk show 
"Ricki Lake" and divide his time between New York and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellner has also recruited former Fox executives Bob Bibb and Lewis Goldstein 
to head advertising and on-air promotion. Both worked with Kellner and Ancier 
in the early days of the Fox network.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ELVIS COSTELLO CAN STILL PUMP IT UP; DESPITE A SUBDUED 
STERILITY IN RECENT SONGS, THE BESPECTACLED '70S ROCKER CRAFTS A REUNION WITH 
THE ATTRACTIONS USING TENSION AND WIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On his arrival in the late '70s, Elvis Costello established himself virtually 
overnight as one of the most compelling rock songwriters since Bob Dylan. His 
clever word play, sharp wit and penetrating insights about relationships 
continued to serve him well through the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at the Universal Amphitheatre, the bespectacled Costello -- still 
wearing the dark suit and pointy shoes that initially set him apart from the 
ratty punks and dinosaur rockers of the '70s -- reunited with his original band 
the Attractions before an adoring audience that treated him as if he were still 
very much this year's model. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Attractions played with precision and Costello hardly missed a note 
vocally, the music -- especially the more recent material -- seemed too sterile 
to stir any feelings beyond the rush of pure entertainment and the warmth of 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with those qualities, but they pale next to the 
originality and daring that once were the cornerstones of Costello's work. At 
this point in his career, he seems like a brilliant craftsman at a time when a 
new generation of rockers is reaffirming that it's not just craft that makes 
great pop music -- it's also the raw purging of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the songs from his earliest albums did sound dated on Wednesday, they 
still had their original angry bite, and their tense edge cut through the 
polite atmosphere. Newer material, though, tended to be subdued and finely 
tuned, more concerned with perfect pop lines than emotional urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Costello's half-croon/half-hiss still sounded strong and vibrant, but it 
wasn't until the tail end of the set that the audience -- predominantly 
longtime fans -- got out of their seats for the classics "Watching the 
Detectives," "Alison" and "Pump It Up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Attractions -- keyboardist Steve Nieve, drummer Pete Thomas and bassist 
Bruce Thomas -- were the players on Costello's great early records; their 
contributions at the Amphitheatre were mixed. The faster, harder songs came out 
energized and fun, but the intensity of the ballads was compromised by the 
instrumentation. The keyboards became overwhelming and even grating at points, 
drowning the songs in their acrobatics, and a perfectionist approach sometimes 
squeezed the music dry.  
</P>
<P>
 The few moments Costello sang alone with his acoustic guitar glimmered with 
personality and a sense of who he really is these days. The feeling that 
emerged was as powerful as his old displays of anger and bitterness, and it 
showed that while striking a complex musical balance is admirable, putting your 
unedited self in the songs is what gives them life. 
</P>
<P>

Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m.

NBA PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; HAWKS SET RECORD FOR STINGINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Lenny Wilkens became Atlanta's coach 11 months ago, he began teaching and 
preaching. The Hawks would play defense, he said. Defense gets you into the 
playoffs and wins for you once you are there. 
</P>
<P>
 Never was that more evident than on Thursday night, when the Hawks held the 
Indiana Pacers to the fewest points in NBA playoff history in a 92-69 victory 
that tied their Eastern Conference semifinal series, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning and Kevin Willis had 20 points each for the Hawks, who stopped 
Indiana's winning streak at 12 games: the final eight of the regular season, a 
first-round sweep of Orlando and the series opener, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a huge turnaround for us after we were embarrassed the other night," 
Wilkens said. "All year long our team has been responsive and resilient, and we 
certainly did not want to go to Indiana down, 0-2." 
</P>
<P>
 The 69 points by the Pacers broke the league-low mark of 70, shared by Golden 
State against the Lakers in 1973 and Seattle against Houston in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock added 11 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds for the Hawks, the 
fourth triple-double of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in and took care of what we had to," Willis said. "We need that type 
of effort the rest of the series. We've got a little confidence now, and if we 
can keep that up and keep the intensity up, we're going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jon Koncak: "I really felt after the game Tuesday that our focus would 
have to be on defense. It's huge. We had a great defensive effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta took a 61-42 lead midway through the third quarter, then withstood a 
Pacer comeback that closed the gap to 65-57 on Reggie Miller's three-point 
basket with a second left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored 12 points and Derrick McKey 11 for Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were right there going to the fourth," Indiana's Haywoode Workman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they faded. The Pacers shot only 29.4% in the final quarter, when they 
had seven of their 17 turnovers.

MORNING BRIEFING: FOR DOING NOTHING, THIS IS SOMETHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Sharman, former Laker coach and executive, was a rookie with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1951 when they were engaged in a tight pennant race with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against the Boston Braves on Sept. 27, umpire Frank Dascoli, 
believing he was being heckled, ejected every player from the Dodger bench, 
including Sharman.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything, " Sharman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he became part of baseball trivia history: the only player to be 
ejected even though -- as it turned out -- he never played in a major league 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Sharman: He will be the inaugural inductee for basketball at the USC Hall 
of Fame banquet on May 21 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who are the only two Angel managers to have led the club to 
first-place finishes? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it worth it?Golf World reports that diving for golf balls can be hazardous 
to your health. Louis Mannion, who works for Second Chance Golf Ball recovery, 
found that out the hard way when an 11-foot alligator clamped down on his foot 
while he was retrieving balls from a water hazard at the Palm Beach Polo & 
Country Club in Wellington, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
 Mannion wasn't seriously injured and the alligator was later destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherman: From the book, "We Played the Game," edited by Danny Peary: Bill 
Rigney on Johnny Mize, his New York Giant teammate and roommate: 
</P>
<P>
 "If the wind would be blowing out, Mize would lie back in bed, and puff that 
cigar and say, 'Roomie, I'm going to hit one or two out today.' And he would. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the wind was blowing in, he'd come back to the bed and put out his cigar 
and just lie there." 
</P>
<P>
 Splendid idea: Woody Woodburn of the Ventura Star-Free Press writes that if he 
were NFL commissioner, "I would put football goal posts on tracks and have them 
move back and forth like those little ducks in a county fair's shooting 
gallery, you know, just to make field goals interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent flyer: Jackie MacMullan of the Boston Globe wonders whether Indiana 
Pacer Coach Larry Brown has finally found happiness with a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, Larry is never happy," replied team President Donnie Walsh, a longtime 
friend of Brown. "I think he had his bags all but packed a couple times this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "Larry never thinks his teams are good enough, but that's what makes him 
tick." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1950, USC's Dick Attlesey set the world record in 
the 120-yard high hurdles at the Fresno Relays with a time of 13.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Jim Fregosi, 1979, and Gene Mauch, 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Coach Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston Rockets on not lobbying 
extensively for Hakeem Olajuwon as NBA defensive player of the year: "It's like 
selling a Rolls-Royce and having to go out there and talk about its interior."

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; MAPLE LEAFS WIN TO PUSH 
SERIES TO THE LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Gartner has scored 652 regular-season and playoff goals in a 15-year NHL 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 The 652nd has no equal, Gartner said, after the Maple Leafs beat the San Jose 
Sharks, 3-2, in overtime Thursday night at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest one so far," Gartner said after his goal at 8:53 of overtime 
provided a season-saving victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner's shot came from the side of the San Jose net after a pass from behind 
the net from Doug Gilmour. It forced a seventh and deciding game Saturday night 
in the Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the side of the net and Dougie made a great play behind the net to 
get me the puck," Gartner said. "I slid a shot into the crease and it hit 
(goaltender Artur) Irbe's skate and went in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It couldn't be called a pretty goal, but it looked pretty from my angle." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendel Clark scored Toronto's other two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor Larionov and Jeff Norton scored for the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose forward Johan Garpenlov came within an inch of ending the game when 
he whistled a shot off a post 73 seconds into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what's going to happen in overtime," Shark Coach Kevin 
Constantine said. "We had a couple of chances and didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a chance and they scored. That's the way it goes. . . . Toronto's a 
good team. Nobody thought this would be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks, with the worst regular-season record in the playoff field, pushed 
the Maple Leafs to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't count on putting ourselves in a position where overtime would be 
needed," Gartner said. "It's a great sense of relief to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "A goal the other way would have ended our season."

 The all-women's Colorado Silver Bullets, saying the competition in the 
Northern League is too tough, called off their scheduled baseball games with 
the minor league. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, I feel that we cannot compete at their level," Silver Bullet 
Manager Phil Niekro said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets played an all-star Northern League team last weekend in 
Fort Mill, S.C., and lost, 19-0. The independent Northern League is the lowest 
level of professional baseball, although it does feature former major leaguers.

par at DuPont Country Club a virtual impossibility.

 Juli Inkster, who finished in tennis shoes because of lightning nearby, and 
Noelle Daghe were a shot behind the co-leaders. Only 16 of the 141 golfers -- 
three were on the course when play was halted for the day -- finished at par or 
better.

Haywood Jeffires, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, had agreed to terms on a 
one-year deal worth $1 million, including another $100,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeffires, who rejected a three-year, $3.9-million offer from the Rams 
April 15, said Thursday night that he will decide today between one-year offers

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; ILMOR ENGINES' DOMINATION CONFIRMS STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ilmor Engineering, designer and manufacturer of the Mercedes-Benz and other 
Indy car engines, has been named recipient of the Queen's Export Award for 
Achievement for the second time in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is given for outstanding export achievement in international motor 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to put their stamp of approval on the award, two of Roger Penske's Ilmor 
Mercedes drivers posted the fastest laps Thursday in practice for the May 29 
Indianpolis 500. Defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi's lap of 230.438 m.p.h. 
was the fastest of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was the first day I felt comfortable in the car," Fittipaldi said. "It 
took me a few days after I arrived back from (Ayrton Senna's funeral in) Brazil 
before I felt where I was physically and mentally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Paul Tracy was second fastest at 228.444. Both Fittipaldi and Tracy 
had trap speeds of 244 m.p.h. at the end of the straightaway. The third 
Mercedes driver, Al Unser Jr., was fourth at 227.457. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Michael Andretti, in a Reynard-Ford Cosworth, broke the Penske monopoly 
with a 227.698 lap. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the fastest rookie in Indy 500 history? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sponsors of the Lola-Buick driven by Stan Fox is the American 
Bowling Congress, so car owner Ron Hemelgarn had a golf cart made in the shape 
of a bowling pin to tow the car from the garage to the pits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only golf cart that takes two mechanics," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mark Smith, the McMinnville, Ore., driver who was bumped from the 500 last 
year by Geoff Brabham, is back again in one of Derrick Walker's cars in an 
attempt to become a footnote to Indy history. In 77 races, no Smith has ever 
started the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Jimmy Vasser, 222.313 m.p.h., in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Herta of Los Angeles and Adrian Fernandez of Mexico City are two of the 
10 rookies who will attempt to qualify for the 500. What do they think of it 
all?  
</P>
<P>
 Said Herta, driving for A.J. Foyt, "I think the speeds at first are a little 
intimidating. To pass my rookie test I had to go 70 m.p.h. faster than I'd ever 
been in a race car." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Fernandez, driving for Rick Galles: "Rick Galles and (crew chief) Owen 
Snyder are my coaches. I have to show patience and wait for them to release me 
to go faster. A lot of people have asked me if this is easy and it isn't." SHAV

 It was the kind of run the Oakland Athletics used to get, scored by a player 
the A's used to have. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a Tony rally," said Tony Phillips, who scored two runs, including the 
one that broke a tie and gave the Tigers a 6-5 victory over the A's on Thursday 
at Detroit. "When I was in Oakland we called that a Rickey (Henderson) rally. I 
really don't have a green light. Today I was aggressive and I got good jumps." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the A's fourth loss in a row and 20th in 22 games. It was brought 
about, in part, because they stranded 11 runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had big chances to win this game, and I thought we should have won it," 
Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't because Phillips, an Athletic in the glory days of the '80s, 
singled against Billy Taylor (0-1) to start the sixth inning, then stole second 
and third. Travis Fryman brought him home with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second steal, third base umpire Daryl Cousins ruled Phillips' 
head-first slide beat the tag of third baseman Scott Brosius. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the steal of third base, looking back at the game, was the big 
play," La Russa said. "That's tough for me to take because that's a play we 
should stop. Brosius thought he was out, but we let Phillips get too big a 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, Cleveland 6 -- Bernie Williams singled home the winning run with 
the bases loaded in the 10th inning at New York as the Yankees stretched their 
winning streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stanley reached on third baseman Jim Thome's fielding error and took 
third on a single against Eric Plunk (3-2) by pinch-hitter Luis Polonia, his 
1,000th hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Steve Farr intentionally walked Mike Gallego, and Williams slapped a 
2-and-2 pitch past first baseman Eddie Murray for his third hit of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 3, Milwaukee 1 -- Roger Clemens stopped Milwaukee on two hits in seven 
innings and the Brewers wasted a strong performance by Ricky Bones at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (4-1) struck out eight and walked three before leaving after seven 
innings because of an apparent minor leg problem. He lowered his earned-run 
average to 0.80 in his last six starts covering 45 innings. His ERA for the 
season is 2.59. 
</P>
<P>
 NATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, St. Louis 6 -- Pinch-hitter Shawon Dunston broke a ninth-inning tie 
with a two-run homer as the Cubs rallied from a four-run deficit to win at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Parent led off the ninth inning with a single, his third hit. Two batters 
later, Dunston homered against Rob Murphy (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, Pittsburgh 4 -- Pete Incaviglia went three for three and 
scored three runs at Philadelphia to help the Phillies end a three-game losing 
streak.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; FASTBALL MUST IMPROVE BEFORE PARK IS PROMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the resurgence of the Dodgers' pitching rotation, Chan Ho Park's chances 
of being recalled soon appear bleak. Before Park is promoted, he has to learn 
to trust his fastball, which is what he is working on at double-A San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get calls every day from reporters wanting to know if Park is doing OK, 
because he's only pitching a few innings every start," said Steve Kim, Park's 
uncle and agent. "His pitch count has been increased, but he needs to develop 
confidence in his fastball and that's one of the reasons he was sent down. He 
wants to do well and doesn't want to give up a run, and he thinks that's the 
only way he can show people that he can pitch. But that's not why he's there. 
They know he can pitch. Now he needs to learn how to stay out there for seven 
or eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks his best pitch is the fastball, and it is, but Park thinks 
the slider is his best pitch. He needs to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and Executive Vice President Fred Claire have 
visited Park in San Antonio. "Burt (Hooton, San Antonio pitching coach,) said 
to me that Chan Ho has a better fastball than he did," Claire said. 
</P>

 Mike Piazza said the longest home run he has ever seen was hit by San Diego 
Padre first baseman Dave Staton during a triple-A game in Las Vegas two seasons 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Staton, who wore No. 28 last season when he was called up in September by the 
Padres, changed to 31, Piazza's number, before this season, saying maybe he 
would hit better. But he is batting .190 with four home runs and is in jeopardy 
of losing his first base job. MARYANN HUDSON

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Devil His Due is back in the Pimlico Special to defend his title against some 
pretty familiar company. 
</P>
<P>
 Devil His Due, Valley Crossing and Pistols And Roses finished 1-2-3 in the 
race last year, and they're back in the six-horse field on Saturday.Devil His 
Due is the 7-5 favorite and will carry high weight of 121 pounds in the 
$600,000 Grade I race at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining them will be As Indicated, Greatsilverfleet and Gavel Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Devil His Due, a 5-year-old, was second in the Oaklawn Handicap his last time 
out and opened the year with a victory in the Broward Handicap. He has been 
worse than fourth only twice in his last 10 races, and has amassed career 
earnings of almost $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Devil His Due, to be ridden by Wigberto Ramos, drew the No. 5 post. 
Greatsilverfleet and As Indicated, expected to be the early pace setters, drew 
one and three, respectively. Valley Crossing got two, Gavel Gate four, and 
Pistols And Roses will be on the outside.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; BROCCO HAS NUMEROUS REASONS TO SKIP PREAKNESS FOR BELMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brocco, fourth in the Kentucky Derby after a terrible start, will skip the 
Preakness on May 21 and wait for the Belmont Stakes three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Randy Winick said the Santa Anita Derby and Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
winner, who was beaten by just over five lengths by Go For Gin last Saturday, 
came out of the race in good shape, but he decided to give the son of Kris S. 
the extra time rather than come back in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of horse who does much better when he has a month between 
races," Winick told the Daily Racing Form. "I think he'd run well in the 
Preakness, but he was tired for two or three days after the Derby and lightened 
up a little bit and if I ran him back in two weeks it could knock him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing of the Belmont is better and the Broccolis (owners Cubby and Dana) 
live in New York. It's usually a smaller field, and other than Strodes Creek, I 
don't think you have as many horses to beat as you've got in the Preakness. 
It's a long year, and I don't want to (wear) him out right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, trainer Charlie Whittingham had said Kentucky Derby runner-up Strodes 
Creek would skip the Preakness and also wait until the Belmont. Whittingham 
will be represented in the second race of the Triple Crown by Numerous, winner 
of the Derby Trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five of the 14 horses who started in the Derby are expected to run in the 
Preakness. Besides Go For Gin, the others are Blumin Affair, who finished 
third; Tabasco Cat, who finished sixth; eighth-place finisher Powis Castle and 
beaten choice Holy Bull, who finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers in the second race of the Triple Crown are Arkansas Derby winner 
Concern, Polar Expedition, who won the Jim Beam at Turfway Park; Silver Goblin 
and Looming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start since June 24, 1991, Patchy Groundfog finished eighth 
of nine in Thursday's fifth race, a $32,000 claiming race at 5 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Put back in training by owners Lamont Isom and Bob Fisher after his stud 
career tailed off, the 11-year-old Instrument Landing horse will best be 
remembered for being the last horse Bill Shoemaker rode on Feb. 3, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchy Groundfog finished fourth that day, but he has won 16 races in his 
career and earned more than $708,000. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will simulcast the $600,000 Pimlico Special on Saturday. The 
race will be shown between the second and third races. Devil His Due is the 7-5 
favorite. . . . Flawlessly, yet to make her 1994 debut, worked a mile in 1:41 
2/5 on turf Thursday morning. . . . Soviet Problem easily defeated Lazor in 
their $33,000 winner-take-all match race Thursday at Golden Gate Fields. Ridden 
by Russell Baze, Soviet Problem covered the six furlongs in 1:08 2/5 in the 
first match race in that track's history.

DANA PARSONS: BACK-YARD MENAGERIE IS URBAN ANSWER TO CALL OF THE WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd never suspect from the outside that things are a little different at Ron 
and Karen Stephens' house. Although technically in unincorporated Orange 
County, they live plop in the middle of the modern urban scene, along four-lane 
Holt Avenue and between 4th and 17th streets. You pass a million houses like 
theirs every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but looks deceive. What you can't see from the street is the Stephenses' 
back yard, an acre that looks like every homeowner association's nightmare but 
every kid's paradise. All right, it's a little overgrown. And you have to watch 
where you're walking. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Viejo it ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Boy Scouts love to come visit us," Karen says proudly, as I duck branches 
and walk through the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled into the Stephenses' world -- a world much like that of my 
small-town Nebraska boyhood but unlike any I've lived in since -- when I saw 
their ad in the lost and found: "Found. Bird. Large." 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens that a stunningly beautiful peacock -- just like I remember from 
my childhood -- recently found its way into the Stephenses' sanctuary. After 
going out to visit the Stephenses, I felt like I had temporarily left the 
modern world and stepped into a pastoral Twilight Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birds do seem to drop in on us from time to time," Ron says, as we talk 
inside the large enclosure where they're keeping the peacock. 
</P>
<P>
 In their living room, the most prominent features are a giant green-winged 
macaw, which they found in front of their house last December, and a white 
umbrella cockatoo. A few years ago, Ron says, a weakened Lutino cockatiel fell 
into their back-yard fish pool. Other unexpected guests over the years have 
included a golden pheasant, blue herons and various ducks. That's not counting 
the more mundane visitors like the crow named Blackie for whom Karen would put 
out dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it coincidence or careful planning by the vagrant birds, but the Stephens 
family is full of nature lovers. Until visiting Ron and Karen, I thought you 
had to live in the canyon country of Orange County to let your kids see what 
theirs do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Stephens is living in the house he grew up in in the 1950s. A two-lane 
road separated the family house from orange groves on the other side of what is 
now Holt Avenue. A flood control channel behind the house took out the barn one 
year and dumped it beyond the persimmon and orange groves even farther from the 
house. The son of pet store owners, Ron Stephens grew up with animals. One 
birthday present was a calf. He once had a de-scented skunk. The family kept 
chickens and rabbits. He and Karen once had a pig. And Ron has had sheep, a 
spider monkey and a porcupine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several weeks after we were married, I had a rooster that was being a real 
pain in the tail," Ron says. "So one Sunday morning, I dressed it out and 
brought it into the house. Karen, having always been a city girl, refused to 
get out of bed until I wrapped it in Saran wrap and put it in the refrigerator. 
I said, 'This is ridiculous,' but she said the only chicken she had ever eaten 
was wrapped up with a price on the top of the package." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Karen has come around during their 15 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like animals," she says. "I won't eat my own animals. I lived in Tustin for 
25 years, and you'd go to the grocery store to buy food. You didn't raise it in 
your back yard, but now I've learned that you do, in fact, do that. So there's 
your favorites you save as pets, and then there's food. There's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, their three kids and however many friends want to come over often 
camp out. "The kids love animals," Ron says. "We have tree frogs that live on 
the property, and the kids are always looking for frogs or lizards; we have 
salamanders that live out here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen adds that the family has at least 10 flashlights, which are dispensed to 
the children for their camp-outs and the nocturnal searches for whatever they 
can find. "To find a tree with three nests in it . . . to see hummingbirds feed 
their little babies is something most people cannot say they've seen," Karen 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that lots of people, including some relatives, think she and Ron are 
a little wacky. While not vociferously disputing that, she adds in her defense: 
"It's important for kids to learn how to live. I think children need to learn 
to live with the world and to take care of it. I think it's important for them 
to learn you can't just turn on a switch and live." 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment, she adds: "That's right up there with learning how to fish." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if they're nuts or not. I couldn't live with a macaw and a 
cockatoo in my living room and lizards in the back yard, but I'm glad there are 
people who can. And I know their kids are better for it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Karen sees it, too: "When you have the opportunity to give children 
this kind of back yard in the crazy world we live in today, it's just nice to 
know that when they come home, they have a place to go and run, have fun, have 
the dogs chase them through the plants and to learn about nature. You look at a 
lot of people's back yards and they're nothing but cement and a swimming pool, 
but my kids swim in a pool with a hundred fish in it. People think I'm nuts. 
They say, 'You're crazy,' but I say, 'Haven't you ever been to the ocean? How 
many fish do you think they're swimming with in there?' "

JUSTICES OPEN DOOR TO SUITS BY EMPLOYEES; COURTS: RULING ALLOWS WOMAN TO CHARGE 
FALSE IMPRISONMENT OVER QUESTIONING IN THEFT. WORKERS' COMP IS GENERALLY THE 
SOLE RECOURSE FOR PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL INJURY AT WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, providing a crack in the shield that protects 
employers from most workers' suits, held Thursday that a Los Angeles Fedco 
employee can sue the chain for falsely imprisoning her during an interrogation 
over whether she stole $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision is significant because California workers generally 
have no recourse in the courts when they are injured physically or emotionally 
on the job. They can obtain relief only by collecting limited amounts from the 
state's workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case before the high court, sales clerk Julie Fermino said that in 
1990, managers and security agents at Fedco Inc.'s Westside store imprisoned 
her for more than an hour in a windowless room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fermino said a security agent falsely charged that witnesses had seen her 
pocket a $4.95 sale, refused to let her call her mother, "hurled profanities" 
at her and pressed her to confess "the Fedco way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fedco way, as outlined by the security agent, was to award one point for 
each time the clerk denied her guilt. When the count reached 14, the agent told 
her, she would be turned over to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, then 18, said she repeatedly asked to leave and when she moved 
toward the door, one of the security guards slid in front of it, threw up a 
hand and gestured to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 After she became hysterical, she said, the security agents finally said they 
believed her and let her go. She quit her job shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 In an opinion written by Justice Stanley Mosk, the court held that false 
imprisonment is not a normal aspect of employment, even if it is motivated by 
an employer's reasonable objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "False imprisonment is, by definition, an unreasonable and indeed criminal 
confinement," Mosk wrote. "It is the close cousin of assault." 
</P>
<P>
 Fedco had argued that the alleged false imprisonment was carried out in a 
reasonable manner and asserted the store's right to hold and question employees 
to protect against theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court ruling overturns two lower court decisions that denied 
Fermino the right to proceed with her suit. Now a student and part-time 
cashier, Fermino is seeking $200,000 for her pain and suffering and unspecified 
punitive damages intended to deter Fedco from such behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Ball, a Beverly Hills lawyer who represented Fermino, said security 
departments of major stores are under pressure to "produce numbers to justify 
their existence." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to wonder," Ball said, "whether this type of treatment of employees 
is somewhat connected to the recent rash of workplace violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The case posed a test between merchants' rights to protect themselves against 
theft and employees' rights to not to be held against their will at the whim of 
their employers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said it was not denying employers the right to detain workers 
suspected of theft or to fire them if they refuse to cooperate. But if the 
employers' actions go beyond reasonable interrogation and detention and become 
false imprisonment, they are not protected from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball said the case met the test of false imprisonment because Fermino was 
denied the right to leave and threatened with arrest if she did not confess. 
</P>
<P>
 Fermino said she was ecstatic about the decision. The Fedco job was "my first 
real job," she said, and the interrogation was "totally humiliating and 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never want that to happen to anyone else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision probably will trigger more lawsuits alleging false 
imprisonment, said Steven Weston, attorney for Fedco. The chain did not dispute 
the facts of the case, arguing instead that such suits are barred by workers' 
compensation law. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the suit can proceed, Fedco will investigate Fermino's allegations 
thoroughly, he said. "Fedco has not committed any improper acts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Schachter, a San Francisco attorney who represents employers, said the 
case was important because it defines a line between normal and abnormal 
employer behavior and appears to contradict previous decisions by the 
conservative court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am surprised because there have been other outrageous kinds of cases in 
which the courts have said that it is included within the workers' compensation 
system," Schachter said.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said he doubted the decision would trigger massive litigation because 
the employer's alleged behavior in the case was extreme.

FIRST-GRADE GIRL STRUCK BY SCHOOL BUS; SAFETY: THE 6-YEAR-OLD IS IN SERIOUS 
CONDITION. A TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT THE INTERSECTION WAS BURNED OUT, BUT THE 'DON'T 
WALK' SIGN WAS WORKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A first-grader was seriously injured Thursday morning when she was struck by a 
small school bus at an intersection where the traffic signal had burned out, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old Veronica Pech was airlifted to Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center, where she was being treated for a ruptured spleen and a deep cut on her 
face, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her condition was upgraded from critical to serious Thursday afternoon, but 
she remained in the pediatric intensive care unit, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, the red light where Veronica was crossing -- at 
the northeast corner of Strathern Street and Vineland Avenue -- was not working 
because the bulb had burned out, a city Transportation Department employee 
said. The pedestrian signal was operating properly but was partially obscured 
by a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the pedestrian signal at the corner was working, authorities believe 
Veronica should have known not to cross, CHP Officer Rich Obregon said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the CHP and witnesses, the North Hollywood girl had gotten off a 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus about four blocks from her school, 
Roscoe Elementary School in the 10700 block of Strathern Street. 
</P>
<P>
 When she reached Strathern and Vineland, Veronica waited for a car to turn 
right, then stepped out into the street. Witnesses and authorities said her 
comments after the accident indicated that she might have been confused by the 
burned-out red light. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that she didn't know the light was red and couldn't remember that it 
was," Obregon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica was hit when the driver of a Los Angeles Unified School District 
mini-bus was unable to stop, authorities said. The driver tried to swerve, 
witnesses said, but the right front corner of the bus hit Veronica in the face 
and knocked her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie McLeod, who was waiting at a nearby bus stop, said he saw the school 
bus bearing down on the girl but was too far away to try to pull her out of the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the bus coming, so I called out and she stopped," McLeod said. "If she 
had kept on going, the bus might have run over her." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, McLeod said, he talked to Veronica to keep her calm until help 
arrived. "I lied to her and told her it was just a scratch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school's principal, Ruth Bunyan, rushed to the corner when she 
learned what had happened. "(Veronica's) eyes were open, but she was not 
moving," Bunyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obregon said it does not appear that the 28-year-old bus diver was at fault. 
In fact, witnesses praised Ricardo Barajas, a district employee, for doing the 
best he could to avoid a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Barajas nor the lone student riding in the school bus were injured, a 
school district spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The red light bulb was replaced Thursday afternoon and the tree that hid part 
of the pedestrian signal was trimmed, said Don Benjamin, a senior traffic 
signal superintendent at the city's Transportation Department. But Benjamin 
joined those who discounted the light as a contributing factor in the accident, 
saying the pedestrian signal had been at least partly visible from the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the intersection, which is crossed by hundreds of students each 
school day, is a hazard -- even when the traffic signal is functioning properly 
-- partly because there is no crossing guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children need to be protected at this corner, not a block away," said 
Sharon Lyle, referring to two crossing guards who work at intersections nearer 
to the school.

A PROBLEM OF ATTRACTION; MAGNET SCHOOLS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO RECRUIT BILINGUAL 
TEACHERS BUT CAN'T OFFER A VITAL BONUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles' highly lauded magnet schools find themselves in a Catch-22: They 
are under increasing pressure to hire more bilingual teachers but can't pay as 
much as regular campuses with higher minority enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 A districtwide shortage of bilingual teachers, coupled with the fact that they 
can receive a $5,000 annual bonus at regular schools with mostly minority 
students, has led to stiff competition between magnet schools and other 
schools. Magnet schools, long considered the gems of the school system, are 
joining the race without the financial incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had some of the finest bilingual teachers pass through here, but 
they're on their way to schools where they'll get paid $5,000," said Greta 
Pruitt, the principal at 32nd Street/USC Magnet School Performing and Visual 
Arts Magnet Center near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake for the magnet schools is continued political support for the 
program. In expanding the magnet school program by 24 schools, the Board of 
Education said last week that it wants magnet schools to hire more bilingual 
teachers and recruit more non-English-speaking students. Supt. Sid Thompson 
said he was reviewing the ways students are selected for magnet schools, which 
offer specialized academic programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents are applying for magnet schools in record numbers this year. The Los 
Angeles Unified School District has received 40,500 applications for about 
14,000 openings. Parents will be notified next month whether their children are 
accepted or will go on waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the magnet schools attracting the highest interest are Balboa 
Gifted/High Ability Magnet in Northridge, with 1,400 applications; Bravo 
Medical Magnet on the Eastside, 1,400; Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies 
in Reseda, 2,036; Open School in Mid-Wilshire, 744; and 32nd Street/USC Magnet 
School near Downtown, 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents think these schools are the best choices for their children," said 
Leticia Quezada, school board president. "There are parents of all ethnicities 
who want their children to have the best education they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, officials say they have had trouble attracting qualified 
bilingual teachers. There are 3,500 bilingual teachers in the school system, 
but officials say they need about 2,500 more. Just 169 work in magnet schools, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bilingual teachers certainly have some leverage now," said Jesus Limon, a 
bilingual teacher and coordinator at San Fernando Elementary School. "But I 
think most people would be more apt to stay where they're making more money." 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage more bilingual teachers to apply to Los Angeles schools, the 
district agreed six years ago to offer a pay differential -- $5,000 to work in 
schools designated as predominantly minority campuses and $1,000 to work in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within our budget constraints, we are going up and down the state trying to 
recruit bilingual teachers," said Ben Lujan, who oversees the district's 
teacher recruitment and selection division. "It's a fierce competition within 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most magnet schools enroll more than 60% minority students, they are 
not considered to be predominantly minority -- a designation that is given to 
schools with about 90% minority pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's 640,000 students, about 44% speak limited English. Of the 
37,000 who attend magnet schools, less than 10% do not speak fluent English. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the competition for bilingual teachers will be even more 
fierce next year. In a settlement with the teachers union, the district has 
decided to stop paying bilingual teachers the $5,000 bonus next year at 50 
schools -- primarily in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. Because 
those schools have fewer students who don't speak English than in previous 
years, the district decided that it could no longer justify giving those 
teachers the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bilingual teachers at Chatsworth Park Elementary have decided to leave the 
school district in part because they will no longer receive the $5,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain a full bilingual credential, teachers must take extensive courses. 
The district hires teachers who have earned portions of the full bilingual 
credential, but they do not receive the full bonus pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members said they fear that siphoning off the bilingual teachers 
from regular schools will mean fewer bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough problem," said board member Jeff Horton, who favors reducing the 
number of white students who can be admitted to magnet schools to increase the 
number of minority students. "But the whole idea of magnets has something 
unfair about it to the extent they drain off active teachers, involved parents 
and motivated students." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnet schools are considered by many teachers to be the gems of the school 
system. When Granada Hills High School began its magnet center last year, the 
school received 60 applications from teachers for seven positions. Only a 
couple were bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet schools' biggest draw is the fact the students -- and their parents 
-- choose to attend. Principals say they have an active group of parents and 
students and teacher morale is high.  
</P>
<P>
 "The incentive to teach at magnets is great," said Assistant Supt. Amy 
McKenna, who oversees the instruction division. "But I imagine it will be tough 
recruiting" bilingual teachers.

RON HARRIS: FOR $20, MORE LIVES ARE PULLED INTO A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE; "ALL THOSE

<P>
 Maybe if we had saved Kenneth Redman we could have saved Titus Imaku and he 
would still be here to save his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Imaku, a Nigerian-born engineering student at Cal State Long Beach, was 
working his night job as a cabdriver in May, 1991, when he drove three people 
to a grocery store at Crenshaw and Slauson. One was Kenneth Eugene Redman, 20, 
an unskilled, unemployed high school dropout who had recently fathered a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the store, Redman told one passenger, an acquaintance, that he planned 
to rob Imaku. The idea was so absurd that the other passenger thought he was 
joking. But back in the cab, Redman directed Imaku down an alley behind 
Gramercy Street. A danger sign should have flashed in Imaku's head, but it 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Imaku, 35, was thinking about the stillborn daughter his wife delivered 
just two months earlier. Maybe he was thinking about the sick mother in Nigeria 
to whom he regularly sent money. Maybe he was thinking about his children, a 
girl, 5, and a boy, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, Redman fired two bullets into the back of Imaku's head. He 
rifled through Imaku's billfold. He found $20. Back at the house, the other 
passenger asked Redman in terror how he could kill a man for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was $20 that I didn't have," was Redman's chilling response. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that night, Redman had never had any contact with police. He was not a 
gang member. But anybody who scratched just slightly beneath the surface would 
have known that he was a time bomb waiting to go off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like this was destined," said Mark Borden, Redman's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Redman the killer was once Redman the man-child, which, those close to the 
case say, may explain how he became Redman the killer. His mother, a drug 
addict/prostitute, had raised him in a world of abuse, poverty, uncertainty and 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 15, he had moved 20 times, mostly to the homes of drug users and drug 
dealers. His mother often abandoned him, leaving him to tend a younger brother. 
Neighbors and friends said she verbally and physically abused them. 
</P>
<P>
 No agencies intervened. Thin budgets make that sort of thing unlikely these 
days. But there is money available now, $35,000 a year to keep Redman locked up 
in state prison for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of Imaku's family? When Redman murdered their breadwinner, he 
re-created the Imaku family largely in the image of his own -- fatherless, 
poor, balancing on the edge of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Imaku, 37, now subsists on federal assistance. Consequently, she has 
moved from the security of their Long Beach apartment to a hazardous public 
housing project in Compton. Most troubling, however, is the impact of her 
husband's murder on her son, now 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of anger, but he won't talk about it," the mother says. His 
grades have fallen from Bs to Ds. He ditches classes, refuses to do schoolwork 
and generally does "things he never did when his father was alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things are going," says his mother, "he's going to end up dead or in 
jail." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response to such cases, for the past 17 years California's policy-makers 
and the populace have clung fervently to a formula of longer sentences and more 
prisons, an empty, emotion-filled policy that accomplishes little and leaves in 
its wake a continually climbing body count. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the California prison system housed 19,000 prisoners; it now houses 
109,000. California now locks up a higher percentage of its citizens than any 
state in the nation, almost twice that of South Africa and nearly three times 
that of the former Soviet Union. And nobody feels safer, because nobody is 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so bent on incarceration we're not dealing with the issues," says Bobby 
Grace, the prosecuting attorney who last week tried for the death penalty on 
Redman. "Unless you change the economics that drive people to do things, 
there's always going to be an 18-year-old out there who does things because he 
thinks this is what he has to do to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of Kenneth Redmans right now roaming the streets. They have 
no regard for life, because life has had little regard for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, many of them will end up behind bars -- forever. For victims like 
the Imakus and those who are to follow, however, it won't really matter. For 
them, we will have dealt with the issue way too late.

PLAN TO AWARD $80-MILLION MTA CONTRACT SCUTTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has scuttled 
plans to award an estimated $80-million management contract to a firm whose 
supervision of earlier subway construction was found deficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White announced his decision in a letter 
made public Thursday to appointees of the MTA's governing board. An MTA 
spokesman said new proposals to manage construction of subway extensions to the 
Eastside and the Mid-City would probably be solicited in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 White's decision comes as a rebuff to the agency's rail construction staff. 
After soliciting proposals in April, 1993, the staff this spring had ranked the 
firm of Parsons-Dillingham No. 1 among competitors for the new contract, 
according to people familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff's ranking came despite a critical report in February by outside 
specialists retained by the MTA. The specialists, who assessed the construction 
and management of the 4.4-mile Red Line subway, found that numerous segments of 
the tunnels were built with concrete that was thinner than specified. 
</P>
<P>
 They concluded that Parsons-Dillingham fell short of "acceptable industry 
practice" in seven areas of performance -- including its inspection of 
construction. Parsons-Dillingham "certainly intends" to continue seeking the 
construction management contract in a new round of competition, said Ron 
Wildermuth, director of corporate relations for the firm's parent, the 
Pasadena-based Parsons Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham has agreed to pay the MTA $1.4 million for the earlier 
studies and to inspect, at no charge, recommended repairs now under way by the 
original contractor to tunnels linking Union Station and Pershing Square. 
Parsons-Dillingham and its partners have been paid more than $200 million to 
oversee subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 White, in his letter to MTA board members, referred to the specialists' 
findings and noted that high concentrations of a toxic gas were recently 
confirmed in the path of some of the new subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these matters have resulted in a significant time delay," White wrote, 
noting that proposals for the new management contract were sought more than a 
year ago. ". . .We intend to re-procure the construction management services 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The new management contract, worth an estimated $80 million, involves part of 
what is to be the third segment of the subway. The first 4.4 miles link Union 
Station and MacArthur Park. The next leg, to be opened by 1998, extends to 
Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue and north along Vermont Avenue to 
Hollywood Boulevard. The third segment, perhaps to open by 2000, would extend 
east from Union Station to Indiana Avenue and west to the vicinity of San 
Vicente and Rimpau boulevards.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 JAIL 
SUICIDES PROMPT REVIEW OF CELL DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two inmate suicides in the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley jail last 
year have caused the LAPD to review its jail doors and recommend design 
improvements intended to stop inmates from hanging themselves from the bars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a proposal to be considered by the Police Commission next week, department 
officials call in-custody suicides a serious problem and note that jail suicide 
rates are two to three times as high as those in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure of the existing cell doors within the department's jail system 
poses a significant safety concern," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 To cure the problem, department officials are proposing that the LAPD spend 
$22,655 to install heavy grates across the bars of jail cell doors. The grates 
make it more difficult for inmates to hang themselves, according to the report.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
PAY $1.35 MILLION IN POLICE BEATING AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has agreed to pay $1.35 million to settle a 
lawsuit involving eight people who said police officers beat them up at a 
private party nearly seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The altercation occurred outside a Mt.Washington apartment Sept. 13, 1987, 
when police ordered revelers in the street to move indoors.  
</P>
<P>
 Officers said some people started hurling bottles, but the eight plaintiffs, 
including a pregnant woman, said they were cooperative.  
</P>
<P>
 No officers were disciplined in connection with the incident, Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was not even an investigation because no personnel complaint was 
filed," Goldberg said. "This was prior to the Christopher Commission," formed 
after the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs were Bertha Naranjo, who was eight months pregnant, her 
husband, Aristeo Perez Camacho, her brother, Ruben Martinez, and five other 
men: Rogelio Avila, Hector Adrian Pineda, Jesus Salas, Rigoberto Rodriguez and 
Adeodato Varela Espinoza.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Work began this week on a $980,000 project to install storm drains along Trask 
Avenue between Harbor Boulevard and Fairview Street, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Patapoff of the Development Services Department said the project is 
intended to prevent flooding at Trask Avenue and Ranchero Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Patapoff said traffic and parking will be restricted during construction, but 
there will be access to residents and business in the area. At least one lane 
in each direction will be open at all times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction hours are from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. The project is expected to be 
completed in October, Patapoff said. BERT ELJERA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEFENSE 
RESTS IN KING TRIAL AFTER BRISENO'S TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The defense rested Thursday in the punitive damage phase of Rodney G. King's 
federal lawsuit stemming from his March 3, 1991, beating, and the jury is 
expected to get the case early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John Davies sent the jury home until Monday, when final 
arguments are scheduled to begin.The same panel awarded King more than $3.8 
million in compensatory damages at the end of the trial's first phase April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The final witness in the trial was suspended Los Angeles Police Officer 
Theodore J. Briseno, who told jurors he is $260,000 in debt. Briseno said that 
King struck him in the chest before the beating and that he will sue King for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony followed that of former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and former Officer 
Laurence M. Powell -- who are serving 30-month federal prison terms for 
violating King's civil rights -- and fired Officer Timothy E. Wind. All of them 
testified that they have been left destitute in the aftermath of the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorney had asked for more time to cross-examine witnesses, but on 
Thursday the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals turned down that request.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 3 
POLICE AGENCIES GET U.S. GRANTS TO HIRE 20 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two suburban police departments and the MTA's transit police have received 
federal grants to hire a total of 20 new officers, President Clinton announced 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawthorne Police Department, the South Gate Police Department and the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority were among 142 agencies to share $74 
million in federal money in the latest round of community policing grants, 
which Clinton called a down payment on his campaign pledge to put 100,000 new 
officers on the nation's streets within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were the final round of disbursements since Clinton took office, 
and are expected to fund the hiring and training of 1,001 additional police 
officers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA won the largest grant, a more than $1.1-million award that will fund a 
dozen new transit police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne was awarded a $532,980 grant that will fund six new officers and 
South Gate received $199,030 for two new officers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY GIVES 
10-YEAR PERMITS TO 9 TAXICAB COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Transportation Commission renewed the operating permits of nine 
taxicab companies Thursday, granting longer terms to help them raise more 
capital for new equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, commissioners had doled out franchises for five-year terms to keep 
a tight rein on the industry.But Mayor Richard Riordan's appointees agreed with 
taxicab operators that 10-year permits will open the way for more lending from 
banks.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to do is upgrade the industry," said Commissioner Ryan 
Snyder, chairman of the panel's taxi subcommittee. "I want them to get 
computerized dispatch systems. I want them to get new vehicles."  
</P>
<P>
 Improved borrowing will also help taxi companies meet a planned city mandate 
for a portion of each fleet to be accessible to passengers who use wheelchairs, 
Snyder said.  
</P>
<P>
 Only seven wheelchair-accessible taxis currently operate in the city, all in 
the San Fernando Valley. But the commission recently awarded Bell Cab permits 
to field 10 more south of the Santa Monica Mountains and Hollywood Hills.

A CAUSE FOR KOREAN AMERICAN CELEBRATION -- AND CONTROVERSY; ACTIVISM: COMMUNITY 
CENTER'S EXPANDING ROLE HIGHLIGHTS FRICTION BETWEEN GENERATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN 
VALUES COMPLICATE TASK OF POST-RIOT RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Korean Youth & Community Center on Thursday proudly showed off its new 
$4.6-million quarters and housing complex in Koreatown by inviting hundreds of 
people, including a good number of African American community leaders, and 
treating them to traditional Korean court dance, music and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 The completion of the five-story building at 680 S. Wilton Place is a 
milestone in the 90-year history of Koreans in Los Angeles and symbolic of the 
leading role being taken by the community's younger generation. But the 
center's expanding role is also a source of controversy to some longtime Korean 
American community leaders, who have watched the agency since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 The friction involves generational, cultural and language differences and gaps 
in values and priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried that the KYCC is trying to be too many things," said Keith Kim, a 
former KYCC board member who helped raise money to acquire the site where the 
new building stands. 
</P>
<P>
 As he looked at the light gray modern structure, encompassing the center's 
offices and 19 low-income housing units, Kim added: "There are times when I 
wonder if they're taking on so many projects to get more funding to create jobs 
for themselves or if they're doing it to really serve needy immigrant youths 
and their families, which after all is KYCC's first mission." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's biggest Korean American service agency has received its share of 
criticism in the last two years from riot victims and other members of the 
Korean American community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Hyun Seung Yang, a United Methodist minister who runs a food and 
shelter program in Koreatown, said the agency enjoys "a lot of privileges" 
because it is viewed by mainstream politicians and institutions as the 
representative of the Korean American community. Yet, he said, the agency isn't 
always willing to share its resources with small community-based groups that 
lack the administrative savvy and connections to compete for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang's comment drew a sharp retort from Bong Hwan Kim, Korean Youth & 
Community Center executive director, under whose leadership the agency's budget 
has grown from $300,000 in 1988 to more than $2 million today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic problem of trying to work with the first generation," said 
Kim, who was 3 when he came to the United States with his family in 1962 and is 
a leading spokesman of younger Korean Americans. He said Yang and he "come from 
two different mind-sets. He wants to focus on getting the money; I'm focusing 
on political representation." 
</P>
<P>
 H. Cooke Sunoo, an agency board member and ardent Kim supporter, said the 
center has become "flak catchers for the city" as many frustrated Korean 
American riot victims face countless obstacles in trying to get back on their 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the riots there was a desperate, crying need for somebody, some 
institution to try to perform that bridge role between the Korean community and 
the rest of the world," Sunoo said. "We took that role almost by default." 
</P>
<P>
 A common complaint about the center is that its staffers are mostly young, too 
Americanized and in some cases, do not speak Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communication was a real problem," said Sung Ho Joo, a riot victim who has 
had extensive contacts with the center. "They mean well and tried hard to help 
but their Americanized thinking and our ways simply did not mesh. For those of 
us who lost everything during the riots, everybody failed us, including the 
KYCC." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult for Koreans, to whom age and social status mean a great deal, 
to seek advice from young staff members. One Korean American grocer who sought 
counseling at the center said she was taken aback. "I thought to myself, how 
can I possibly get help from people my children's age?" she said. "I came home 
thinking I should be helping those kids, not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Bong Hwan Kim says he understands how these people feel but that it is next to 
impossible to get experienced, bicultural and bilingual Korean American 
professionals to work at the salaries the center offers. Except for himself, 
with a salary of $60,000 a year, and Pat Wong, head of the liquor store 
conversion program, whose salary is $45,000, Kim said his staffers earn $18,500 
to $38,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has made great strides since it began as a part-time project under 
a different name nearly 19 years ago. It operated out of a tiny three-room 
office with a desk and a Ping-Pong table. Today, the center has 70 full-time 
employees and offers a wide range of programs from family counseling to job 
training and placement. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kim, a big headache has been the controversial liquor store conversion 
project. After the riots, the city took action to make it more difficult to 
re-establish destroyed liquor stores. The project was designed to give 
merchants an alternative line of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's support to reduce liquor stores angered many Korean liquor store owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency received $260,000 from the city last year to administer the liquor 
store conversion project. To date, however, only two Korean-owned liquor stores 
have been converted to other businesses. Kim said he hopes to have 20 by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the project has not lived up to his expectations because so few liquor 
store owners want to risk unfamiliar businesses with lower profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said the riots served as a "critical turning point" for him. "Unless you 
have political power or influence, you might as well spin wheels," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel's Pat O'Connell won his main event first-round heat at the Bud 
Pro Surfing tour Thursday at Huntington State Beach. And he picked up a few 
stitches in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, the star of the new surf movie "Endless Summer II," fell on a wave 
late in the heat and suffered a deep cut on his foot from a skeg on the bottom 
of his board. Lifeguards treated the wound, then took O'Connell to the hospital 
for stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's lead held through the end of the heat and he advanced to today's 
second round along with Huntington Beach's Kirk Tice, who finished second in 
the heat. O'Connell is expected to compete despite the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition resumes at 7 a.m. today with the final eight first-round heats, 
followed by the second round. Expected to compete are former world-champion 
Kelly Slater, defending world champion Derek Ho, Newport Beach's Richie 
Collins, and San Clemente's Dino Andino, Shane Beschen and Mike Parsons. MIKE

PREP ROUNDUP; WOODBRIDGE'S BUYUKUNCU SETS DIVISION I RECORD IN 50 FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodbridge's Derya Buyukuncu set a Division I record in the 50-yard freestyle, 
but missed his national record in the 100 backstroke at the Southern Section 
Division I Swimming and Diving Preliminaries Thursday at Belmont Plaza in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu, a senior, swam the 50 freestyle in 20.51, breaking the record set 
in 1977 by Fountain Valley's Mike Kelly by .21 seconds.Buyukuncu's heat was so 
fast, five of the seven swimmers qualified for today's finals, three of them 
for the championship finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could go faster but . . . I'll go all out tomorrow," Buyukuncu said. "But 
the 50 (free) is going to be so close, I'll probably miss (the national record) 
by .05 or break it by .02." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu finished first in the 100 backstroke with a 49.04, short of his 
47.84 national record but still almost two seconds ahead of the second-fastest 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an off start in the backstroke," he said. "But (today) I'll probably 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 His coach, Dan Gaines, agreed. "He'll go much faster. He's one of those 
swimmers with a combination of talent and incredible work ethic. I think that's 
what sets him above his peers." HEATHER STEVENS

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; VILLA PARK ENDS CANYON'S HOPES FOR PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon's season turned on one play three weeks ago. The Comanches, tied for 
first place at the time, had runners on second and third with one out but 
failed to score.Seven innings later, in the 12th, they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 That was against Foothill, and the Comanches haven't been the same since. They 
lost five straight and six of their last seven games, ending their season 
Thursday with a 1-0 Century League loss to Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches' slide created little margin for error. They needed a victory to 
get the third-place automatic playoff berth. They needed a victory to be 
considered for a Division I at-large berth. They got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill (21-6, 9-1) won the title for the fourth year and Villa Park (17-9, 
8-2) was second. El Modena (10-13, 5-5) took third despite its loss to 
Foothill, and Orange (13-9, 4-6) moved moved past Canyon (12-10, 4-6) for 
at-large consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's Brandee McArthur pitched a one-hitter, with 10 strikeouts and an 
intentional walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "As good a game as I've ever pitched," McArthur (10-3) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park had runners every inning but the first but scored only in the 
sixth. Dawn Kobota singled and McArthur doubled off the base of the fence -- 
200 feet away -- one out later. With two down, Jamie Hunter drove in Kobota. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's only chance to salvage the season came in the sixth. Kristi Hiatt's 
leadoff single ended the perfect game. She was bunted to second, and after a 
pop-up to the catcher, Nina Lindenberg (batting .415) was intentionally walked. 
Kristy Kachig also popped to the catcher, ending the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canyon Coach Lance Eddy: "It was all or nothing for us." MARTIN HENDERSON

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; MORENO GIVES GARDEN GROVE A PLAYOFF BERTH

 Ronnie Moreno pitched a one-hit shutout Thursday as host Garden Grove beat 
Bolsa Grande, 4-0, to clinch a berth in the Southern Section Division III 
baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno (7-4) struck out five and walked two, and retired 14 of the last 15 
batters he faced.The only hit he gave up was an infield single by catcher Dan 
Hendrix with one out in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my pitches were working today," Moreno said. "I got ahead of most of the 
batters, which made it easier. I don't throw that hard, so I had to change 
speeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Argonaut Coach Jim Rawls said he didn't expect his team to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a plus," he said. "We've only got three seniors, and four 
sophomores. (But) it was Moreno's best outing, and his second-best was the last 
time we played them (a 3-2 Garden Grove victory)." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove (15-9, 9-5) scored the only run it needed in the bottom of the 
first on third baseman Kevin Loken's home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande starter Brian Moore (7-4) was nearly as impressive as Moreno. The 
senior pitched a three-hitter, allowed two earned runs and at one point retired 
12 batters in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore, trailing, 1-0, had control problems in the sixth. He hit Moreno in 
the leg to start the inning, and after a sacrifice bunt, walked Mike Campuzano. 
A wild pitch allowed pinch-runner Brian Jones to score. Then Moore 
intentionally walked Loken. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Adam Bass responded with an RBI single, and Loken scored on a 
throwing error by first baseman Alex Navarro, giving Garden Grove a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande finished the season 11-12, 7-7. GABE LACQUES

EL CAMINO REAL SAYS 14 ENOUGH FOR CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an unconventional way to get an illogical victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With two meetings this week, the El Camino Real High baseball team figured it 
had a chance to end Chatsworth's run at an undefeated season in the Northwest 
Valley Conference. With ace pitcher Randy Wolf on the mound, Tuesday looked to 
be the day, but the Conquistadores lost by a run. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, an accidental stolen base on a botched sacrifice attempt 
in the fifth inning led to two runs, giving El Camino Real a 2-0 victory that 
snapped the Chancellors' 14-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Kyber (6-1) went the distance for the Conquistadores (18-5, 10-4 in 
league play), giving up six hits while preventing Chatsworth (22-4, 13-1) from 
clinching the West Valley League title outright with three games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 How improbable was the victory? El Camino Real was dealt a blow before the 
game started when Wolf, the team's best hitter, couldn't even play because of a 
sprained left ankle suffered near the end of Tuesday's game. He will rest the 
ankle over the weekend but expects to pitch next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor starter Oscar Bocanegra (2-1) was just as effective as Kyber until 
the fifth inning, when he hit second baseman Joey Maiden with a pitch to open 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Tays tried to sacrifice Maiden to second base, but missed the pitch. 
After hesitating, Maiden took off for second and beat Brandon Murphy's throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was caught for sure and I wasn't going to make it," Maiden said. 
"I wanted to go back to first, but I don't know why I hesitated." 
</P>
<P>
 Maiden went to third on a balk after Tays popped up to Murphy. Designated 
hitter Shawn Fishman followed with a double that kicked up chalk down the 
left-field line for the game-winning hit. Fishman scored on a single by Clint 
Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth threatened in the fifth, loading the bases with one out, but Kyber 
escaped with the help of good defensive plays by Tays and Gavin Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game was a lot like Tuesday, except they jumped out on us instead of us 
jumping out on them," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "We had chances, 
especially in the fifth. It just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyber didn't have any more trouble until the seventh. After getting two out, 
Kyber threw five consecutive balls, bringing out Coach Mike Maio for a 
conference with Bryan LaCour at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just told me not to worry and not to pitch too fine to him," Kyber said. 
"We had a solid defense behind us, I just had to settle down." 
</P>
<P>
 Two pitches later, LaCour popped to first baseman Craig Carlton.

PREP NOTES; WHITE TO COACH GIRLS' BASKETBALL AT EDISON AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Abraham, girls' varsity basketball coach at Edison High, announced 
Thursday that he was resigning to continue his education, girls' Athletic 
Director Bruce Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham will be replaced by Dave White, who was the girls' varsity coach for 
eight seasons before taking over the Chargers' football team in 1986.White led 
Edison's girls to the Southern Section 4-A title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he will rely heavily on assistant coaches Michelle Hennessey and 
Alonda Varisco. Hennessey played for White's championship team in 1987. Varisco 
was a standout player at Mater Dei and UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be some overlap (of seasons), how much depends on how far 
we go in the football playoffs," said White, who also coaches the girls' 
distance runners on the track team. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham had an 81-50 record in five years as a walk-on coach. The Chargers 
finished 17-9 last season, losing in the first round of the section I-A 
playoffs. 
</P>

 Each will receive a $2,500 college scholarship from KCAL and be honored at the 
State track and field championships June 4 at Cerritos College.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: GRITTY HIGHLAND MAKES WAVES ON VOLLEYBALL COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only sand the Highland High volleyball team sees is the chalky, dusty 
stuff that coats the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Bulldogs stroll into prestigious weekend tournaments that often 
include longtime beach powers, they kick some figurative sand in the faces of 
their high-profile coastal opponents -- and bring the championship trophy back 
to the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what these kids have accomplished," Highland Coach Mike Bird 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkable indeed, for a program in only its third year of varsity play. The 
school opened five years ago and fielded a junior varsity team the first two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulldogs have grown up quickly. They are 14-0, won the Golden League 
championship, and are the top-seeded team in the Southern Section Division II 
playoffs that begin today. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Ryan Millar, a 6-foot-7 middle blocker, is the team's best player, and 
was the MVP of the recent Redondo tournament. Highland stunned everyone by 
defeating South Torrance, Poway, Laguna Beach and Brentwood to win that event. 
Highland also won the Poway tournament earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar teams with 6-8 Mac Wilson to patrol the middle and is aided by setter 
Toby Sides and outside hitter Scott Packer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most good high school players play on club teams during the off-season, but 
not one Highland player does. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just play on their own and have a great desire and love for the game," 
said Bird, who played for Cal State Northridge from 1984-87. "It's really neat 
to see." MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Fade Away 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Del Campo's high school career came to a disappointing close as the 
Thousand Oaks senior finished fifth in the 3,200 meters in 9 minutes 42.59 
seconds and sixth in the 1,600 in 4:30.85 in last week's league finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Campo, the 1993 Southern Section Division I cross-country champion, opened 
the outdoor season with a personal best of 9:24.59 to finish second in the 
3,200 at the Spartan Relays in March and nearly matched that time with a 
second-place clocking of 9:25.13 in the Ventura County championships in April. 
But his performances otherwise were inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't quite put my finger on (what went wrong)," Thousand Oaks 
distance coach Jack Farrell said. "If I was able to explain it, I probably 
could have done something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, (Brandon) doesn't feel as confident on the track as he does 
in cross-country. He just doesn't run with the same reckless abandon in track 
like he did on several occasions in cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
 A failure to take a break between cross-country and track might have played a 
part in Del Campo's struggles. After running in the state Division I 
championships in November and the Foot Locker West regional in December, the 
UCLA-bound senior continued to train for the national junior (age 19 and under) 
cross-country championships in Memphis in February. 
</P>
<P>
 He also ran in the high school portion of the two-mile run in the Sunkist 
Invitational in February. The Spartan Relays kicked off the outdoor season two 
weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chadd Aldrich, Del Campo's teammate, was given an extension on his senior 
season when Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo withdrew from the 1,600 in order to 
concentrate on the 3,200 in Saturday's Southern Section Division I 
preliminaries at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich finished fourth in the 1,600 (4:28.19) in the league finals -- the top 
three finishers in each event advance to the Southern Section preliminaries -- 
but he was awarded the league's final qualifying spot when third-place 
Hernandez dropped the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake baseball Coach Rich Herrera said he has no plans to resign despite 
the pleas of a group of parents upset with the direction of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Marti Treese, representing the Westlake Booster Club, met with Herrera and 
Athletic Director Jim Martin last week and asked Herrera to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program has been plagued with some problems and, as booster club 
president, I felt it was up to me to talk to Rich and open the lines of 
communication," Treese said. "The reason for the meeting was more to clear the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult. I know Rich personally and I like Rich. It was not a 
personal vendetta. It was not the parents going out to get Rich out of his job, 
but it was concern for the program in the future. Our players just don't seem 
to be responding." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, in his sixth season as a walk-on coach at Westlake, said he has 
parents behind him and he plans to remain at the school. The Warriors are 
13-13, 4-9 in league play, and are tied for sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said no decisions on Herrera will be made until after the season ends 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at every sport at the end of the season and evaluate it," Martin 
said, "and baseball would be no different." WEST VALLEY LEAGUE

 Reseda's Carlos Nunez is one such athlete. His coach says the 6-1, 180-pound 
pitcher/shortstop is the best player in the Northwest Valley Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nunez's name is not as recognizable as Randy Wolf (last season's City 
Section 4-A player of the year) or Bryan LaCour, who play for perennial powers 
El Camino Real and Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think by far he's the best player in the Northwest Valley Conference," said 
Reseda Coach Mike Stone of Nunez. "I think he's a better overall player than 
Randy Wolf but he's just stuck here. When it comes to postseason accolades, he 
gets hampered because of our record." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda is 5-11-1, 3-10 in league play, but Nunez at the start of the week was 
hitting .488 with six home runs and 14 stolen bases. As a pitcher, he has a 
2.20 ERA, with 51 strikeouts in 54 innings. His record is 3-5. FOOTHILL LEAGUE

 A Big Surprise 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the best way for a high school to develop a successful swimming 
program is to load up on club swimmers, athletes who train year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs Coach Jon Kunishina didn't have the luxury of club swimmers but that 
hasn't stopped his team from succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having only one swimmer (Alex Amato) qualify for the Southern Section 
Division II championships, the first-year coach has led the Indians to the 
school's first league title in boys' swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs had a 4-0 record in league meets and won the league title last week. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the Indians do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a lot of luck," Kunishina said. "Sometimes I would have no 
idea how we would do. We upset Saugus right after spring break and I didn't 
have more than a couple of kids at practice that week." 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the team had a change of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a great tradition here of winning and I wanted to change that," 
he said. "They started to believe they can win and they did." MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking Around 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham swimming Coach Nick Rodionoff knew he had something special in 
freshman diver Arus Gyulbudakian. After a solid season in league meets, 
Gyulbudakian easily won the one-meter City Section title this week with a score 
of 456.60, beating her closest competitor by nearly 60 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Rodionoff thought Gyulbudakian had the potential to be an 
Olympian for her native Soviet Armenia but after the success she's enjoyed, the 
plans have changed slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she wants to stay," Rodionoff said. "Now she plans on becoming a U.S. 
citizen and we're happy she'll be around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves nearly took the boys' title as well. Mike Roman (297.10) finished 
only 24 points behind North Hollywood's Tom Everett. GOLDEN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Phenoms 
</P>
<P>
 Two freshmen have helped Antelope Valley contend for the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Jeremy Holiday threw a three-hitter to beat first-place Palmdale, 4-1, 
last week, improving his record to 6-1 and his ERA to 1.83. Tuesday, he earned 
a victory in relief in a key game against Ridgecrest Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman third baseman Kevin Barlow, at the start of the week, had 11 hits in 
his last 15 at-bats to raise his average to .418. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a freshman on the mound and one at third base, and sometimes it can 
make you a little nervous," Coach Ed t'Sas said. "And they wonder why I've got 
some gray hair. But they've played well, both of them." Passing the Bar

PLAYING AGAINST THE ODDS; PIANIST CHARLES FIERRO CALLS HIS BEETHOVEN 
PERFORMANCE AN 'APT SYMBOL' FOR A RETURN TO NORMALCY AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parallels are few between earthquake-damaged Cal State Northridge and 
Vienna of the 1809 Napoleonic siege. But there's inspiration enough there for 
pianist Charles Fierro from the example of Ludwig van Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 The German-born composer's adopted city of Vienna was under fire as Beethoven 
wrote his publisher: "The existence I had built up only a short time ago rests 
on shaky foundations. What a destructive, disorderly life I see around me." And 
yet that same year, the composer would create his "The Emperor Concerto," his 
"String Quartet Concerto, Opus 74," and other important works. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's life and work continued amid the chaos. "The more I thought about 
it, the more I realized this is what Beethoven believed in," said Fierro, a 
CSUN music professor. "His music, as well as his life, symbolizes courage and 
even heroism against the odds, against adversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fierro's own return to normalcy will be marked Wednesday night in the campus 
Little Theater with a solo piano performance of a variety of Beethoven pieces. 
It's the fifth in a continuing series of Beethoven concerts that Fierro began 
in 1990, although this one has taken on added meaning for the music department, 
which still awaits repairs to its building. The facility suffered significant 
damage during the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to me an apt symbol for our assertion of normal life and art in 
this term," Fierro said of the concert, and the Beethoven letter he recently 
rediscovered in a biography of the composer. "That letter from Beethoven could 
apply to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The music program will include Beethoven's "Pastorale," "The Tempest" and 
"Sonata in G Major, Opus 31, No. 1." All pieces were composed in 1801 and 1802, 
and remain core elements of the classical piano repertoire, although it's an 
era of music that Fierro has focused his energies on only in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his current study and practice of Beethoven, Fierro was mainly a 
champion of contemporary classical music by the likes of Aaron Copland. Of 
Fierro's five albums of solo piano, recorded in the 1970s and '80s mainly for 
the prestigious Nonesuch and Delos labels, all spotlight the music of 
contemporary composers, beginning with his former teacher at USC, Ingolf Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
 His album of Copland's "Piano Fantasy" and "Night Thoughts," the premiere 
recording of those works, even enjoyed the active support of Copland himself, 
after favorable word of Fierro's 1970s concert performance of the same works 
reached the composer in New York. And in 1980, Fierro and Copland appeared on 
the same stage in Los Angeles during a celebration of the composer's 80th 
birthday. "His involvement was very encouraging to me," said Fierro, now 55, 
who has taught piano at CSUN since 1970. "And it also gave the project a great 
deal of prestige and publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fierro continued his focus on more contemporary composers with his next three 
albums, three consecutive releases of music by the late-19th-Century American 
composer Edward MacDowell. But, he said, he felt the need to reacquaint himself 
with the standard classical piano repertoire, starting with Schubert, 
Mendelssohn and others before focusing on Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who loves and plays contemporary music takes on a kind of missionary 
spirit," Fierro said. "We need to bring our own excitement to the music in a 
new way. There is a pleasure in presenting a new work to an audience and 
selling it, something they didn't know they would like. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge in playing the classics, especially the familiar classics, is 
to demonstrate that these pieces are ever-new, and have something new to say to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fierro's case, that new interpretation may simply be in the energy of his 
performance, suggested David Aks, music director for the CSUN Symphony. "He's 
quite a serious artist," said Aks, who added that he's seen some of Fierro's 
approach emerge in the playing of some of the students they share. "I think 
it's done with a lot of reverence for the music, too. He's a strong 
interpreter, but he has a tremendous respect for the composer. That really 
comes through in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very powerful pianist. He brings a very strong approach to the 
instrument, which I think is very appropriate for Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
 Fierro said he sees the music as timeless, forever relevant, even as many of 
the more familiar bits of Beethoven and other composers are commandeered 
regularly for television commercials. "The music is indestructible." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about Beethoven's music is that it addresses us in so many ways. 
I find it has a fusion of structure and freedom, to a very high degree. And at 
the same time it has a gentleness and power, as well as philosophy and humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven was the son and grandson of German musicians, and emerged to create 
nine of music history's most important symphonies and a crowded list of piano 
and chamber compositions. They spanned a variety of styles and personalities, 
from the heroic tone of his early work to the darker flavor of his later years, 
when he finally lost his hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "His music, no matter what character it may be, is always challenging, 
technically and musically," said Fierro, who hopes to record a Beethoven album. 
"And it's rewarding in every way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the most familiar of his pieces always seem to be new in a way," he 
said. "They not only transcend their own time, but our own familiarity. They 
have something directly to say to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of the campus series of Beethoven performances, Fierro often performs 
with a variety of local ensembles, recently including the Rio Hondo Symphony 
based near Whittier, the Riverside Symphony and the Ventura County Symphony. 
Fierro said he plays "where the opportunity comes." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also enjoyed in recent years support from the California Arts Council and 
a touring grant from the National Endowment for the Arts that enabled him to 
perform in California, Kansas and Tennessee in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 And he insists that he has not forgotten the modern works that launched his 
performing career. In spite of his current Beethoven fascination, Fierro 
remains strongly committed to the works of modern composers. "There are 
different kinds of music, and they have different things to say to us," he 
said, although he acknowledged the practical impossibility of playing 
everything he'd like. Between his study of Beethoven and his teaching duties, 
there is little time for much else, he said. "Life is short and art takes a 
long time to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 But even now he's pursuing the score to "Universe" by Gerald Humel, an 
American composer based in Berlin. "It's an extraordinary piece of music," 
Fierro said of the music he's determined to perform. "If I get my hands on that 
score, I'm going to play it, Beethoven or no Beethoven." WHERE AND WHEN

ORCHESTRATING ACTIVITIES; * LADD MCINTOSH, WHO WORKS ON FILM SOUNDTRACKS, ALSO 
FINDS TIME TO LEAD HIS BIG BAND AND TEACH JAZZ IMPROVISATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phone call came at 3 a.m. on a Thursday, and Ladd McIntosh was up, dressed 
and out of his North Hollywood house in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, crunched over a desk at the nearby home of his colleague, Bruce Fowler, 
the two men scribbled tiny black dots on musical manuscript paper, writing 
pieces for an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wrote nonstop for 10 hours," McIntosh recalls. "There were no breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times couriers arrived, taking McIntosh's and Fowler's finished work to 
a music copyist, and by 2 p.m., while the pair were still writing, musicians 
were on a sound stage, recording the first parts they had completed. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh is part of the world of film soundtrack orchestration, where music is 
regularly written under intense deadlines. In this case, he and Fowler were 
writing parts for individual strings, brass, woodwinds, etc., working from the 
basic and detailed score by composer Hans Zimmer for the soundtrack to the 
upcoming Penny Marshall film, "Renaissance Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Known first in the world of jazz education, McIntosh is thrilled to be working 
in film, a field he wanted to break into when he moved to Los Angeles in 1975, 
but simply couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the world's worst person at going out and making things happen for 
myself," he says. "I have a lot of ability, but I don't want to sell myself."  
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh has been orchestrating for film about two years, and his work has 
been used on such features as "A League of Their Own," "Short Cuts" and the 
upcoming Disney animated extravaganza, "The Lion King." His change of fortune 
came about through Fowler, whom McIntosh met while teaching in the mid-'70s at 
the University of Utah, where Fowler's father, the noted educator William 
Fowler, ran the jazz program. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Bruce Fowler has been one of composer Zimmer's chief 
orchestrators, and hired McIntosh to help him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladd's really good at orchestrating," Fowler says. "He's long been deserving 
of more opportunities along these lines, so I've been glad I've been able to 
call him." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, McIntosh wears several musical hats. Besides his film work, he 
teaches arranging and jazz improvisation at Cal State Northridge, and once a 
month -- except during football season -- he leads his rough-and-tumble big 
band at Jack's Cinnamon Cinder in Burbank. The ensemble, which often includes 
Fowler on trombone and Kurt McGettrick and Glenn Garrett on reeds, plays this 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh and big bands go back quite a way. As a teen-ager growing up in 
Akron, Ohio, he was first "overwhelmed," he says, by the sound of Stan Kenton's 
band. And, later, as a student at Ohio State University, he wrote all the music 
for the school's jazz band. The ensemble won first place at the National 
American College Jazz festival in Miami, Fla., in 1967, and was recorded on an 
album by Impulse! Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Relishing the sounds that his players are getting as he stands in front of 
them at the Cinnamon Cinder is one of life's high points, McIntosh says. "Next 
to sex, there isn't anything better." 
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh's music, heard on his 1992 Seabreeze CD, "Bulbous Garlic Blues," 
covers a wide range of styles, reflecting such influences as Gil Evans -- "his 
colors and textures" -- Duke Ellington -- "his creativity" -- and Bela Bartok, 
whose music represents "clarity, logic and imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Unpredictability is a mark of a McIntosh performance. "Anything can happen . . 
. " he says. "I give the guys a lot of leeway. The charts are challenging, and 
they have to make the chord changes, but in terms of how they create the feel, 
that's pretty much up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon McIntosh will be working on a new film score for the June release, 
"Speed." "This work is kind of crazy, but it's wonderful to put 30 years of 
writing experience to use," he says. "It's a lot of fun to be involved in 
something big, where I'm making a contribution." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>

GETTING IN TUNE TOGETHER; * WORKSHOPS OFFER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THE CHANCE TO 
LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Here's a terrifying thought for all you parents of the 
kindergarten-to-third-grade set: At about the turn of the century, you might be 
the grown-ups running for cover whenever your child turns on the computerized 
stereo system. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you could try launching a preemptive strike by developing the 
musical taste of your progeny before they become opinionated teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the ideas behind new workshops at Pages Bookstore in Tarzana, 
where parents can bring their children over the next several months to learn 
about classical, folk, country-Western or rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to present the different styles of music to children and parents and 
introduce the artists who perform that music," says Linda Fisher, a singer who 
will help lead the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to discuss the characteristics and a little history of each 
musical style," Fisher says. "We'll have some activities, and we'll keep it 
simple so it's interesting to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also will discuss the age appropriateness of the various performers. "I 
remember getting a tape when my children were very young and thinking it was so 
boring," she says. "They just adored it and listened to it over and over. We 
want to help parents find music that they and their children can listen to over 
and over." 
</P>
<P>
 The five classes, expected to last about an hour, begin 11 a.m. Saturday with 
an introduction to classical music. Classes from June to September will cover 
folk music, country-Western, rock and artists who play multiple styles. 
Participants can attend any or all workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Kohan, a clinical psychologist from Encino, has enrolled her 6-year-old 
in the first workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to be really interested in classical music, and I play it around my 
house quite often," says Kohan, who read about the workshops in the bookstore's 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter calls classical music 'flute music,' " Kohan says. "And she likes 
it. This is a good opportunity for us to both learn something together. And, I 
like the idea of exposing her to the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Daniel, owner of Pages, says giving parents the opportunity to explore 
all types of music with their children was one of her primary motivations for 
holding the workshops. She also wants parents to be aware of the many 
selections in children's music that are on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for highly commercial musical offerings for children, exposure and 
distribution of children's music is much more difficult," Daniel says. "There 
are few opportunities to find out about music they might really enjoy, unless 
it is suggested by a teacher or a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Each workshop will cover the distinguishing characteristics and history of 
each style of music, the instruments commonly used to perform it, significant 
composers and performers of each style and what makes that particular music 
pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and children attending the workshop also can listen to musical tapes 
available at the bookstore and see some of the instruments used on those tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first workshop on classical music will, in part, focus on the Classical 
Kids composers series, a set of recordings produced by Children's Group Inc. 
that combine drama and music to tell the story of great composers and their 
works, including Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Vivaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher says she hopes the workshops will broaden the horizons of parents and 
children alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents just don't know where to start when it comes to choosing 
music for their children," Fisher says. "These workshops will give them a 
framework for finding their way through the maze." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: Music workshops for children 5 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Pages Bookstore, 18399 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Classical music, 11 a.m. Saturday. Other workshops June 11, folk music; 
July 16, country-Western; Aug. 13, rock; Sept. 10, "Music for Today's 
Children." 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $15 non-refundable registration fee includes admission for one adult 
and up to two children, audiocassette of your choosing for $9.98 or less, and 
list of recordings. Enrollment limited; preregistration encouraged.

STAGE FOR NEW TALENT; * THEATRE EAST PRESENTS ITS FIRST EVENING OF ONE-ACT 
PLAYS IN OVER 20 YEARS. THE 10 PIECES VARY IN MOOD AND STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom would have it that the more galleries there are, the 
better for the art gallery scene. The more orchestras and ensembles there are, 
the better for the music scene. The more theaters there are, well, bully for 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may be why it's called conventional wisdom. The irony of so many 
theaters in Los Angeles, and more than 30 in the San Fernando Valley, is that 
without a distinct identity, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new Valley companies have easily whipped that problem. Despite the 
deliberately uncommercial name, A Noise Within is positioned as the Valley's -- 
and some think, the area's -- premiere classical ensemble. You want good sketch 
comedy? Easy. You go to Acme Comedy Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not so easy with Theatre East, and company president Geoffrey Woodhall 
seems to know it. Despite a track record of more than 30 years as both a 
workshop arena for actors, writers and directors and a producing theater, 
Theatre East is strangely obscure to everyone but the local theater community. 
The public might only know it as that place above Jerry's Famous Deli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we don't do shows a lot," Woodhall says in the theater's lobby, 
"playwrights don't really know us. And it's a continual question for us here: 
Are we a producing organization, or an ongoing workshop for developing craft?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, he continues, is both, but the producing end is about to get a 
more public face, as the company's first evening of one-act plays in over 20 
years, collectively titled "Turning Point," opens tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 pieces, all around or under 10 minutes long, don't fit any easy label, 
which may make it all the more difficult to identify just what Theatre East 
does. But Woodhall, with co-producers Ted Donaldson and Joseph Patridge, have 
tried to fashion an evening of shifting moods and styles. "Some are very 
sweet," says Woodhall, 32, "and some will definitely be controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 The opener, John Touchstone's "The Telephone," involves an elderly rural 
couple getting their first phone. This, and the following "My Father, My Dad" 
by Bruce Kirby, are among several pieces about seniors, which naturally follows 
for a company with an age range from early 20s to 70s. While Woodhall describes 
Michael Cole Dinelli's "The Donut Shop" as "borderline existentialist, about 
two guys waiting for a woman in a New York doughnut shop," he says that the 
next work, Allison Gregory's "Breathing Room," (which Woodhall directs) is "the 
show's one intensely dramatic piece." Jacob Edelman's play-within-a-play, 
"Vendetta," features some of the theater's 20 or so apprentice artists -- a 
group Woodhall himself used to belong to in Theatre East's sister company, 
Theatre Artists Workshop of Westport (Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
 The second set's mixture of sweetness and seriousness may be even more 
extreme, as Jim Inman's self-descriptive "Two Old Codgers Sitting on a Bench in 
a Country Town Square" (directed by Patridge) leads into Daisey Crane's South 
Central-based "Bad Talking Boys." The evening heads home with William Borden's 
absurd miniature, "Ledge," about two people ready to leap off a building ledge, 
then "Karl and Mary Are Afraid" by Jaime Meyer which Woodhall unhesitatingly 
calls "pretty brilliant stuff." Meyer's black comedy about white-and-black 
paranoia was no way to end the night, Woodhall and company decided, so the 
capper is Hindi Brooks' retirement-era comedy, "The Present." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodhall says some members "have the impression that this show was put 
together in the past couple of months. This has actually been a year in the 
making, with Joe (Patridge) really spearheading things. It was his idea to come 
up with a way of attracting new writing talent to this theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted (Donaldson) then became invaluable in the selection process," a winnowing 
down of a mountain of submissions. "Ted and I are very close in taste, which is 
that blend of the entertaining and the challenging. Once we picked the obvious 
stuff of quality, our choosing among the good pieces was almost automatic."  
</P>
<P>
 "Geoff and I got along so well because we both have a very strong sense of 
structure," Donaldson says.  
</P>
<P>
 Woodhall knows that it would be a different "Turning Point" with a different 
selection group. "We are, basically, editors. What I really hope," he says, "is 
that we can do this annually, that we can look back at 20 years of one-acts, 
just like we can now look back at 30-some years as a company." 
</P>

longer. WHERE AND WHEN

DEATH IN THE WINGS; * 'MIJO' DRAMATIZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EX-LOVER 
OF A MAN DYING OF AIDS AND THE MAN'S MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Janice Arkatov writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ask Michael Kearns where his newest play, "Mijo," comes from, and he answers 
with a single word: truth.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking care of an ex-lover, a Cuban, and his mother had come to live 
with him in the final weeks," says the writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most chilling things I ever heard -- a line he repeated over and 
over -- was, 'You brought me into this world; you have to take me out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the relationship between the boyfriend and the mother was 
dramatized in Kearns' 1993 collection of AIDS-related tableaux, "Off." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has reshaped the story into a two-act play: The first part takes place 
as the son is in the next room dying; the second, after he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a challenge to come up with a fresh take on the subject, admits Kearns, 
an activist and writer whose theater work includes the AIDS-themed 
"intimacies," "more intimacies," "Myron" and "Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to approach this AIDS thing in a different way, make you want to go 
to the theater," says the actor, who vamped it up in Charles Ludlum's drag 
tragicomedy "Camille" last year at Highways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, the dying person is off stage, and the focus is on the people around 
him, their responses to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Kearns' drama will have its world premiere at NoHo Studios, as part 
of its ongoing "Theatre at Three" series. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never see the son; it's just two characters -- a black man and a Hispanic 
woman," explains the play's director, Alec Doyle, who has worked locally at 
Beyond Baroque, Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble and Theatre/Theater. "The 
mother, Carmen, is doing this deathwatch on her son, and in walks Juan's 
longtime lover, Michael, who basically tells her, 'You've got to let him go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 5 inches, flamboyant and leather-clad, Michael, Doyle says, is a bit 
of a metaphor -- "real but not real." 
</P>
<P>
 "On a deeper level, he's been conjured by Carmen to get her through this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of Carmen's stoic Catholicism, notes Doyle, Michael argues 
passionately for euthanasia: "He tells her, 'It's not about bad boys or good 
boys -- it's about finding forgiveness.' Michael works as a combination guide, 
shaman, trickster; he takes her down the path to shed all of this old-world 
guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Between acts, we learn that the two, working in concert, have killed Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carmen realizes it was a release she did for her son," says the director, 
"that she can hold onto him in her heart, and what a good feeling that is." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the seemingly heavy subject matter, Doyle -- who has a degree in 
cultural anthropology from the University of New Hampshire -- promises "lots of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
 When he originally read the script and talked about it with Kearns, he recalls 
thinking, " 'This is interesting and disturbing.' It stayed with me, leaving a 
question mark. Also, as a straight man, the fact that I'm attracted to this 
piece, and that Michael would choose to work with me, points out its universal 
qualities. It's about AIDS and euthanasia, but it's really universal. Everyone 
can get a handle on that." WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Mijo."

THEATER REVIEW; A MAD ENDEAVOR; * SELDOM HAS DRAMATIZED INSANITY BEEN MORE 
IRRITATING AND MORE ABLE TO SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF EVERYTHING AROUND IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 One way of putting Dostoevsky on stage is to adapt one of his works -- 
preferably one of his shorter works, such as "The Gambler." Another way is to 
put Dostoevsky on stage as Nicholas Meyer did last year with Leo Tolstoy in his 
playful "Loco Motives." 
</P>
<P>
 But playwright Edvard Radzinsky has found a third way: Create a character 
insane enough to think that he is Dostoevsky, with another willing enough to go 
along and make believe that she's his wife, Anna. The third way, alas, is not 
the charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Old Actress in the Role of Dostoevsky's Wife" is Radzinsky's alluringly 
archetypal title, and it suggests that the emphasis will be on her, less on 
him. In director Esther Bates' staging at the Little Victory Theatre, the 
effect is something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Try as the elegant Irene Roseen might to command attention as the Old Actress 
who is shunted off by her family to a home for the aged, she must share the 
stage with Rod Gerber as the kooky guy who is convinced he's the great author, 
affectionately called Fedya. It's a losing battle for her, because it's a 
losing battle for Gerber to make this into anything more than a peculiarly 
asinine depiction of both the insane and the artist himself. Seldom has 
dramatized madness been more irritating and more able to suck the life out of 
everything and everyone around it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Radzinsky meant to re-create a dostoevskian atmosphere -- the pressures of 
an institution, the blurringsR of identity -- he could not have flubbed more. 
The situation is ludicrous on its face, with the Old Actress pestered in her 
new room by Fedya, hiding under her bed. Why he's even in a retirement home is 
unclear, since Gerber plays him as a man in his 30s or 40s. Why she doesn't 
have orderlies remove him at once is even less clear. She's a serious artiste, 
of the old school; this fellow possesses all the charm of a ratty-looking dog 
who never stops barking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On this quicksand is built some kind of love story, as Fedya gradually tries 
to blur the lines between real love and Anna's and Dostoevsky's as she 
described it in her diary. Supposedly, the Old Actress is to feel the double 
allure of a man adoring her and the chance to play one last great role, even if 
there's no audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Radzinsky does nothing to make these blurred lines dramatically 
interesting -- and Bates adds nothing on her own to theatricalize delusional 
madness on one end and inspired creativity on the other -- actress and madman 
both end up looking simply . . . mad. 
</P>
<P>
 One has to feel especially for Roseen, because she has all of the tools for 
the finely cultured lady. Her voice is as much theater as we get here, 
caressing every word with great, elocutionary care. But she has little to play 
against, and we get only the faintest sense of a faded artistic life. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be interesting to hear someone other than Gerber do Fedya, if only to 
hear something other than Gerber's puppy-dog approach. No one as well-read as 
the Old Actress would ever mistake this grinning goof-off for the writer of 
"The Gambler," even when he reads from it and recites Anna's diary from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to the play's own blurred vision, Peter Hyde's set is the kind of cozy 
drawing room-bedroom that doesn't seem very institutionalized, and Kevin 
Cohen's lights are almost always at TV-like intensity. A very different kind of 
light needs to be shed here. WHERE AND WHEN

BUILDING AN IMPRESSION; * AN EXHIBIT BY SEVEN ARTISTS EXPLORES HOW ARCHITECTURE 
INFLUENCES THE WAY WE THINK AND FEEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Architecture has an impact on us every day of our lives. The dwellings we live 
and work in can provide the foundation for a better life or an uncomfortable 
existence. In some circum stances, such as earthquakes, they can even collapse 
on us and kill us. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite architecture's omnipresence, how much thought do we really give to the 
effect a building's design and construction has on us? 
</P>
<P>
 "Architecture is so much a part of our lives, and we take it for granted," 
Artspace gallery director Scott Canty said. "It's funny how we build these 
huge, monumental structures like the ones Downtown. We want to show we're the 
best. It reminds me of the story of Babel." 
</P>
<P>
 He has organized the exhibit, "Artists and Architecture," in the Woodland 
Hills gallery to "explore and question how our architecture influences the way 
we think and feel," he said. The seven artists in the show "use elements of 
architecture to talk about something else: social, spiritual and environmental 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Candice Gawne accentuates the potential for excitement in our living 
environments with her dramatic use of light. The open doors of the assemblage, 
"Mi Casa es Su Casa" invite viewers into a domicile pulsating with neon. The 
room in the painting, "The Bed," has been energetically illuminated by two 
lamps on either side of the bed. With this light and the painting's contrasting 
dark, moody palette, one is given the sense that something mysterious is about 
to take place here, or maybe it already did. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sedivy works with oil, varnish and phosphorescent paint on Masonite to 
realize his visions of home, which glow in the dark. In "The Joy House," a 
simple, angular dwelling stands next to the word, "joy," presented in bubbly, 
flowing curves that convey the exhilaration inherent in the word. 
</P>
<P>
 The outright gaiety of "The Joy House" seems somewhat tempered in "Rosy 
Blemish: A Sense of Alacrity" by the many screws that have been driven into its 
structure. Yet, the symbols of nature -- among them a flower, fruit, leaf and 
branches -- suggest a liveliness about the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hughes contemplates worlds beyond the home environment in his oil on 
canvas and wood panel "L.A. Mystery." It pulls viewers in with seductive images 
typical of a good mystery novel or film set in L.A. -- palm trees, a bungalow, 
silhouetted figures, car headlights beaming in the night. In the oil on burlap 
and wood panels of "Cathedrals," an industrial plant rests above two cathedrals 
resembling Notre Dame. Below the cathedrals, another picture suggests an urban 
skyline. Underneath it is a wavy form, much like a snake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense of the story but the plot line is not truly revealed. The 
viewer supplies that which is missing to complete the plot," Hughes writes 
about these works. "This incomplete story creates a mystery or enigma about the 
meaning of each piece and the relationship of the characters in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways are central to Seta Injeyan's feelings about nature, architecture and 
us. In the middle of each painting is her photograph of a freeway section. From 
the photograph she moves out onto the canvas with her paints, creating 
expressionistic views of her own inner landscape as well as the physical one 
before her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristan Marvell questions humankind's use of natural, organic forms in its 
designs and construction in his dimly lit installation "Requisite Columns." The 
sturdy-looking, wood-like beams that seem to come out of or hold up the roof 
are actually made from Styrofoam he carved and painted. 
</P>
<P>
 In exploring the artist's role in society, Richard Turner created "I Was 
Hitler's Curator." Reading about the art of the Third Reich, Turner learned 
that Hitler had planned a grand museum to house the works his Nazi regime had 
commissioned, purchased and stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the role of Hitler's curator and architect, Turner has drawn an 
imaginary floor plan for this museum, which is in the form of the words, Kunst 
Halle (Art Hall). The artwork titles and artists listed in the drawings were 
taken from books about the art of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner writes: "The piece poses the question, What would I have done had I 
been an artist in Hitler's Germany? Would I have resisted enlistment in the 
National Socialist enterprise and been persecuted or driven into exile, or 
would I have allowed myself to become co-opted by the state like the artists 
whose names and works make up this drawing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the show is photographic work by Jody Zellen. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 What: "Artists and Architecture."

<P>
 Location: Artspace Gallery, 21800 Oxnard St., Woodland Hills.

TAKING TIME TO LOOK CLOSELY; THERE IS A WORLD OF TREASURES AT THE DESERT 
TORTOISE NATURAL AREA, BUT YOU NEED PATIENCE TO APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE 
WILD.

 Two hours of hiking across rugged terrain in the morning sun has Chuck Boland 
complaining about the television generation. People expect instant 
gratification. That is the point he's trying to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "To enjoy the desert, you have to walk in it and go slowly," says Boland, a 
Bureau of Land Management naturalist. "You have to watch. You have to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Patience. It is more than a virtue at the Desert Tortoise Natural Area, a 
federal wildlife preserve outside California City, two hours north of the San 
Fernando Valley. Patience is the reality of this place. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape used to crawl with Xerobates agassizi , a native California 
tortoise. In 1973, the BLM set aside these 40 square miles in the Mojave Desert 
because the biome supported 200 tortoises per square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, drought, disease and human encroachment have caused that population to 
dwindle to some 20 per square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 So when visitors arrive, either for the guided tour or to walk a marked path, 
Boland doesn't mind if they search for half a day without so much as glimpsing 
a tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them a sense of what's really happening out here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives them an opportunity -- if they are patient -- to enjoy some of 
the desert's other jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 That lightness, that dry aromatic odor . . . one could breathe that only on 
the bright edges of the world, on the great grass plains or the sagebrush 
desert . . . something soft and wild and free.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Willa Cather, from "Death Comes for the Archbishop"  
</P>
<P>
 Another dry winter has scared away most of the wildflowers. Life in the 
western Mojave runs its course in subtle grays and greens and browns. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the land of creosote, with its gnarled branches and small waxy leaves 
that deflect the sun's full strength. The bushes reach to chest-height but not 
much higher, then die off at their centers and grow outward. They progress in 
sturdy fashion, in expanding rings across the desert floor. 
</P>
<P>
 You must look closer to the ground to find vibrancy. The horsebrush is covered 
in tiny white wool and the prickles of the stubby cholla cactus shine silver 
and gold in daylight. Cheesebush leaves smell as strong as Limburger if you rub 
them between your fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 "You take what you can get," says Carol Panlaqui, a member of the Desert 
Tortoise Preserve Committee, a nonprofit organization devoted to raising funds 
for the federal area. "That's the way it goes in the desert. One year is good 
and the next is not so good." 
</P>
<P>
 And this long, low valley wavers in the heat, buttressed by the Sierra Nevada 
range to the west and the Rand Mountains east. A hollow wind blows, fluttering 
the odd, inflated seed pods that hang from the otherwise sparse branches of the 
paperbag bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle angrily.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Lewis Carroll, from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."  
</P>
<P>
 Few humans might venture to this preserve were it not for the prospect of 
spotting one of the armor-plated creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 They are land-locked turtles protected by high-domed shells. The Iroquois hold 
that mankind first found a home on the Giant Tortoise's ever-expanding back. In 
fact, these creatures grow to roughly the size of a toaster. Sluggish with 
their elephantine legs, they poke about like short-sighted old men, eyes 
blinking. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, tortoises rest in cool burrows. A given creature will dig 
several burrows in the half-mile area of its home range. Summer burrows run 
shallow. Winter burrows, used from October through February, can extend 10 feet 
down. Only from March through May will the tortoises become truly active, 
venturing forth in the mid-morning and late afternoon, foraging for wildflowers 
and drinking from standing pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like them because they are wild and they're cute," Boland suspects. 
"And they are different-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 But the very highway that leads visitors here has proved to be the reptile's 
downfall, says Bob Parker, a wildlife biologist for the BLM. Roads bring 
road-kill, which attracts ravens. The blackbirds quickly discover that young 
tortoises have soft shells and tasty meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more dangerous are people who come to mine and ranch and tear across the 
land on their motorcycles. And, Boland says, it occasionally becomes faddish to 
drive to the Mojave and bring back a pet tortoise. A good number of them are 
subsequently returned to the desert. They return with urban diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert tortoise was placed under the Endangered Species Act in 1990 after 
the BLM surveyed the tortoise population in all of its desert areas and found a 
50% decline since the mid-1980s. According to a recent University of Florida 
study, a chief cause was a mysterious upper respiratory tract infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The decrease proved even greater -- as high as 90% -- at the Desert Tortoise 
Natural Area. Boland explains that people are more apt to release pet tortoises 
at the preserve, and disease spreads quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Desert knows  
</P>
<P>
 That Water grows  
</P>
<P>
 His Sands suffice  
</P>
<P>
 But let him once suspect  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Sahara dies.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Emily Dickinson A black-tailed hare springs from beneath its bush and 
skitters, rocket-fast, ears pricked up, across the sand. These sightings occur 
less frequently now than in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the tortoise, the hare and other Mojave fauna have suffered from a deadly 
combination of natural and man-made conditions. Predators such as kit foxes and 
golden eagles have also dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the creatures on the high desert, antelope squirrels remain plentiful. 
So do lizards, squirming across the sand or remaining absolutely still, 
blending into rock and sand as they sunbathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of people who come out here just to look at the lizards," 
Boland says. "They're the prettiest things out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The zebra lizard boasts light and dark rings on its tail. Colorful blotches 
mark the sides of the uda . When sunning, this creature performs spasmodic 
pushups. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger whiptail lizard uses its exaggerated appendage to slither along. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland warns visitors not to try to catch these reptiles. The energy a lizard 
expends fleeing from human hands can leave the creature fatally dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the desert," the naturalist explains, "the line between living and dying 
is very fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesson. People must learn to be respectful, he says, to enjoy from 
afar. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh! that the desert were my dwelling place.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Lord Byron Humans provide an interesting sight here. Visitors walk in 
awkward steps with their heads down, whispering, pointing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a matter of searching for clues. Animal tracks. The flutter of a cactus 
wren. The rattle of a rattlesnake. Countless burrows dot the ground: large ones 
for tortoises, smaller for squirrels and mice, smaller still for the lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 A ring of grass and forbs betrays the location of a harvester ant colony. The 
ants, carrying seeds into their hole and tossing out the refuse, germinate a 
circle of land a foot in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are scats. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Altieri and his mother, Lisa, visiting from Berkeley, come upon hare 
droppings. The 7-year-old boy has a pet rat at home and recognizes the green 
pellets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them turds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes leave larger grayish droppings. Owls regurgitate clumps of hair, fur, 
feathers and bone. Tortoise scats are cigar-shaped and can be used to determine 
which direction the reptile was traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nature is neutral. Man has wrested from nature the power to make the world a 
desert or to make deserts bloom."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Adlai Stevenson  
</P>
<P>
 Turds are fine, but Benjamin wants to see a tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mornings, if Boland knows that a school group is scheduled to arrive, he 
will survey his preserve, checking near burrows, looking for tortoises so he 
can bring visitors back later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ecstatic when they see a tortoise," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On this morning, hours of searching bring no such ecstasy. That's the way it 
goes in the desert. Benjamin and his mother must satisfy themselves with 
examining a stuffed specimen on display in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The BLM has considered increasing its tortoise population by artificial means. 
Bringing in food, such as alfalfa hay, has not succeeded at other sites, Parker 
said. The tortoises became ill. Irrigating to promote wildflower growth during 
drought years has proved too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 So the tortoises, given protection from man, are left to rebound on their own. 
And Boland hopes that, in the absence of a tortoise sighting, visitors will 
take the time to notice what they can see. 
</P>
<P>
 The cholla and the hare. The uda and the cactus wren. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the whole message," he says. "If I can instill an appreciation for the 
desert . . . that's how you save the desert." Act to Preserve More of Desert 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate passed legislation April 14 to preserve 6.3 million more acres of 
the 25-million-acre California desert, a national treasure that encompasses 90 
mountain ranges, more than 100,000 archeological sites, waterfalls, wetlands 
and 760 species of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 This action virtually assures that the California Desert Protection Act will 
become law this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It will create 74 wilderness areas and three new national parks, protecting 
portions of the fragile desert from off-road vehicles, mining exploration and 
new livestock grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparatively tiny Desert Tortoise Natural Area, set aside by the Bureau 
of Land Management in 1973, is located amid these new federal areas but is not 
a part of them. WHERE TO GO

A VOLUME OF TOPICS; * VALLEY BOOK STORES CAN SATISFY A RANGE OF LITERARY NEEDS, 
FROM ADVICE ON THE METAPHYSICAL TO GUIDES FOR SURVIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL R. FARKASH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Michael R. Farkash is a North 
Hollywood writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The literary challenge: how to leaf through the forest of the printed word and 
harvest the "write stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 To save time on picking tomes, trek straight to one of the San Fernando 
Valley's specialty bookstores, which range from the purely pragmatic to the 
obliquely metaphysical. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Survival Books -- The Larder in North Hollywood, co-owner Nancy Litwack 
presents information on surviving life in the urban jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, those on the run can bone up on assuming a new identity and escaping the 
scrutiny of creditors. Care to stand and fight? Pick a volume on handling 
explosives or the secret ways of the ninja. 
</P>
<P>
 Litwack and her husband, Morris, have guided the store through two decades, 
offering up the grim facts of life and death. "My husband says we have 
something to offend everyone," Litwack said with a brief smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the explicit content of reference books such as the six-volume set of 
the "How to Kill" series, which features information on items such as camera 
guns and poisoned daggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have qualms," Litwack said. "I'm concerned that people do not use these 
books appropriately. But you have to have the privilege to read what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 The original title of the store was simply The Larder, when packaged food was 
its big menu item. After the L. A. riots, Litwack says, there was a demand for 
survival foods. And following the recent quake, there was a big run on food, 
candles, light sticks, emergency checklists and manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mormon, Litwack is among those survivalists who believe in stockpiling at 
least a year's worth of food for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Dangerous Visions in Sherman Oaks, manager Arthur Byron Cover and his 
wife, owner Lydia Marano, both authors, ride herd over a compilation of science 
fiction, fantasy and horror literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous Visions draws its name from a cutting-edge anthology series edited 
by science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, who once helped the store in a 
special promotion -- pounding out stories for a solid week while sitting in the 
display window. 
</P>
<P>
 A reader-friendly place with separate nooks containing used books, Dangerous 
Visions has a couple of chairs that invite browsing, and two canine mascots 
that invite petting. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has experimented with a number of lively events, including authors' 
autograph parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field attracts a wide walk of people," Cover said. "I had a macho guy 
come in, a gas station owner. He raved about how (Robert) Heinlein changed his 
life and made him capable of expressing love." 
</P>
<P>
 * In the non-secular world of Valley Book & Bible, pop culture signposts are 
everywhere. A poster near the back of the store features a picture of Christian 
speaker Chuck Swindoll as "Sermonator," a take-off on "The Terminator" film. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop contains books, videos, music cassettes, posters and an upstairs area 
for church supplies and textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Book reading is on a kind of a comeback," said David Wilke, vice president of 
the chain of six shops. "There's a disappointment among parents with all the 
violence on TV." Of the two stores in the Valley, the Van Nuys locale, 40 years 
old, is the main branch; a branch in Canoga Park had to close because of quake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilke emphasized that the store contains mostly uplifting material. Self-help 
books. Twelve-step program information. How to wrest your child from a cult. 
Even the video games for kids are positive. No Mortal Kombat here. 
</P>
<P>
 An adjacent annex contains a full Spanish-language section, with two bilingual 
employees. Upstairs are church supplies and textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more popular Christian and inspirational novels are the works of C. 
S. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'Shadowlands' out, a lot of people are asking for 'Surprised by Joy' 
(the autobiography on which the movie is based)," Wilke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell a lot of books on family issues. A lot of people are hurting, looking 
for answers. This is a good place to come to find them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the ground or in the air, Autobooks/Aerobooks in Burbank revs up its twin 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 The store, owned by Ron Schroeder, delivers the lowdown on cars, mainly. And 
last summer, Schroeder expanded the aeronautical section, buying out a 
neighboring aviation bookstore that took a nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots, model-builders and enthusiasts come in for the flight stuff, to read 
up on jets, pick up a pilot's manual or peruse such pearls as "Disney Dons 
Dogtags: The Best of Disney Military Insignia From World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the car lore, Schroeder finds that there are two kinds of customers: 
enthusiasts and those who come in to pick up repair manuals. "Most people can't 
afford to own a Ferrari, but they can afford to read about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more popular books on cars are "The Modern Formula 1 Race Car" and 
"Custom Cars of the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of recycling, a corner of the car section offers a few 
tongue-in-cheek selections, including "The Original Road Kill Cookbook." 
</P>
<P>
 * For lovers of the literature of the visually fantastic, Forbidden Planet in 
Sherman Oaks presents a cosmos of comic books, toys, books and masks. 
</P>
<P>
 With masks of creatures from vintage horror films mounted on the walls, the 
store looks like the retreat of some particularly successful hunter of the 
unusual. These movie masks are hung like totems above racks of comic books, the 
store's main staple. Both current and back issues are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant manager Joe Masset says comic book titles have proliferated in 
recent years, with hundreds of different characters and concepts published each 
month. Many of these comic books swell enormously in value in a very short 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Comic books are definitely not for kids only. Much of this material is for the 
over-18 crowd and, yes, they will check your I. D. That's because there's a 
proliferation these days of sex and violence in comics. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to believe you need shock value to sell a piece of entertainment. 
But I don't agree with that," Masset said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if it's classic combat you're after, check out some of the biggest 
comic book best sellers, such as Superman, Batman and the X-Men, Masset said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales for Superman went through the roof when he 'died' last year," he said. 
The death of Superman, a special series of comics that ended with Superman's 
burial, garnered nationwide attention. But breathe easy, Man of Steel fans -- 
Superman was battered but not broken in that epic battle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Psychic Eye in Sherman Oaks is the flagship of a chain of growing 
metaphysical bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 A scent of incense fills the room, which feels more like a sacred temple than 
a bookstore. The store's ambience is deliberately cultivated, says Mary Kara, 
who co-owns the Psychic Eye chain with Robert Leysen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have six rooms for psychic readings," Kara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The psychics do this full time," she said, stressing their commitment. "They 
don't sell cars during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The store offers volumes on self-help, comparative religions, co-dependency, 
angels and sprites, and even lesbian vampire tales. 
</P>
<P>
 If the future is your wont, there are more Tarot card decks than you can shake 
a wand at, and candles of every color and magical persuasion to help manifest 
your destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Extraterrestrial messages are also popular, represented by books including 
"Bringers of the Dawn," revealing teachings of the Pleiadians, a positive E. T. 
force. (These Pleiadians are not to be confused with the antisocial aliens who 
allegedly kidnap humans for medical experiments not normally covered by HMOs.)

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: A TASTE TRUST; * WINE DISCOUNT STORE ALWAYS CHECKS FOR 
QUALITY BEFORE BUYING THE DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The folks at the Los Angeles Wine Co. trust their palates enough to discover 
un heard-of brands of wines. Owner Steve Bialek and his sister Nancy taste 
wines for quality before checking the wholesale price, an unusual procedure for 
wine discounters who usually just buy the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison-shopping wines can be difficult, since some discounters carry 
off-brands that cannot be found elsewhere. They often buy whatever is cheap, 
with little or no concern for quality. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the case at the Los Angeles Wine Co., northeast of Marina del Rey, 
where there are excellent quality wines at discounted prices from France, 
Germany, Italy, Chile, Spain, Australia and, of course, the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Some recent deals, per bottle: 
</P>
<P>
 Among the champagnes, Moet & Chandon White Star, $16.95 (usually retailing at 
$28); Dom Perignon, $64.95 ($70); Korbel, $6.99 ($11.50) and Domaine Chandon, 
$8.99 ($16.50). The chardonnays include Meridian, $6.99 ($13); Kendall Jackson 
Vintners, $6.99 ($13); Grgich Hills, $17.95 ($24); Edna Valley, $8.99 ($15) and 
Sonoma-Cutrer, $10.95 ($16). Other wines include Clos du Bois Merlot, $9.95 
($12); Jordan Cabernet, $18.95 ($24) and Santa MargheritaPinot Grigio, $11.95 
($18). 
</P>
<P>
 In the wine industry, the term kitchen-sink reds refers to a generic blend of 
varietals. Two exceptional finds in this category, both California wines, are 
Marietta Cellars Old Vine Red for $4.99 and, from the Sean Thackrey winery, '92 
Pleiades, which consists of all old vines (20 to 80 years old), 70% Grenache 
and 20% Mourvedre (varieties grown in the French Rhone area). Price is $11.95. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're an oenophile, you'll find many wines here to your liking or, if you 
think you have an untrained palate, tell the folks at Los Angeles Wine Co. what 
you like and let them run with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bialeks and their staff are experts and are happy to inform their 
customers of the intricacies of the world of wines. They are proud that they 
are now the largest single-store purveyor of fine wines in California, a fact 
they gleaned from their suppliers who, mindful of the volume business that Los 
Angeles Wine Co. generates, come to the Bialeks first with their best deals on 
close-outs or new releases. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Steve Bialek, the company stands behind the quality of every 
product it sells and if for any reason a customer is not happy with a purchase, 
"we will gladly refund, replace or exchange it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they always negotiate for large quantities when buying, the Bialeks do 
not special-order, and they do not hold regular sales. 
</P>

A DOSE OF INFORMATION; * WOMEN'S RESOURCE CENTER OFFERS ANSWERS, REFERRALS AND 
SOMETIMES A SHOULDER TO CRY ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAMMERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Maryann Hammers is a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman was frantic. Her 3-year-old grandson, who lives in Texas, had a 
brain tumor and was undergoing his second surgery in three months. She couldn't 
afford the plane fare from Los Angeles, but there was so much she didn't 
understand about his condition. In search of answers, she came to the Women's 
Resource Center at Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sat in the reading room with every book we could find about brain 
cancer," said Wendy Kelman, a registered nurse who manages the center. "She 
cried, and we talked as she pulled out pictures of her grandson. And she left 
with stacks of information and phone numbers of local agencies that could help 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Women's Resource Center is all about, Kelman said -- providing 
information, giving referrals and, sometimes, most importantly, offering a 
comforting shoulder to cry on. 
</P>
<P>
 The resource center was established just over a year ago in response to 
community surveys that showed that women -- who make the majority of 
health-related decisions for themselves and their families -- crave 
information, convenience and respect. The center, in the hospital's Women's 
Pavilion, aims to provide all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can browse through a library of hundreds of health-related books, 
videos and pamphlets with topics ranging from pregnancy and parenting to 
Alzheimer's disease and aging. Menopause, breast cancer and lupus are the most 
sought-after book topics, according to Kelman, and childbirth subjects lead the 
video hit parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to see an actual delivery," she said. The library is also stocked 
with a large selection of books and information on topics geared to men, such 
as testicular cancer and prostate disorders. For those who need additional 
help, Kelman keeps a file of local health organizations, community agencies, 
support groups and crisis hot lines.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every day somebody asks me for something different, and every day we add to 
the library," she said. "And if our library doesn't have it, I'll find it." 
People who have turned to the resource center include a woman whose doctors 
could not agree on treatment for her severe urinary infection, a mother who was 
at her wits' end with a difficult teen-age daughter and an embarrassed 
14-year-old suffering from her first yeast infection. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, a woman scheduled for a cervical biopsy called for 
information on cervical cancer. There was just one problem. She was in Kansas 
on a business trip, and her biopsy was to take place immediately upon her 
return. So Kelman gathered reams of information on cervical cancer and sent it 
to the woman by overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The resource center also sponsors the first public access computer information 
network in Los Angeles. Called Free-Net, the system -- which was officially 
launched May 10 -- includes databases from myriad health organizations, 
governmental agencies, libraries, universities and medical centers.  
</P>
<P>
 Free-Net users also can access electronic bulletin boards, participate in 
on-line discussions or form support groups. For example, a bulletin board 
called "Doctor's Office" enables callers to pose health-related questions -- 
anonymously if they prefer -- that will be answered within 24 hours by a panel 
of physicians.  
</P>
<P>
 The public can use the computer in the resource center to reach Free-Net at no 
charge, and anyone with a computer and modem can access Free-Net from home, for 
a $10 one-time fee. Free-Net is funded by Encino-Tarzana Medical Center and the 
H.O.P.E. Foundation, an Encino organization that offers counseling and 
education for people with cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 "When someone is diagnosed with a medical condition, they are forced to become 
educated very quickly -- often with inadequate resources," said H.O.P.E. 
co-founder Dr. Avrum Bluming, an Encino oncologist. "Usually, they go by word 
of mouth, which is not very reliable. Free-Net will give them a grounding in 
reliable information, so they can be better informed consumers."

A JUMP-START ON EDUCATION; * STUDENTS FROM JUNIOR HIGH TO 12TH GRADE CAN TAKE 
COURSES AT NINE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- FOR FREE.

 Call it the fast track to college or just an antidote to boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 Students -- from junior high through 12th grade -- who are capable of pursu 
ing college-level work can take courses at any of the nine Los Angeles 
community colleges, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a program for the precocious few, said Yasmin Delahoussaye, 
director of school relations at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. It is open to 
all junior and senior high school students of public and private schools. All 
they need is the signature of a counselor or principal verifying that they are 
capable of benefiting from taking community college courses. The program also 
is offered at Mission College in Sylmar and Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Students enroll in anything they want, from freshman English to physics, 
string instruments or physical education -- and get college credit. Those who 
take a course or two every semester over several years can enter college with 
sophomore standing, saving time and money and allowing them to pursue their 
interests at a faster pace. And courses completed count just like the coveted 
"advanced placement" honors high school classes, a great way to get AP credit 
without having to take the special exam, Delahoussaye said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kate Noah, 12, of Reseda, has finished three semesters of choir and music 
courses at Pierce. "I like the classes. They don't feel too hard, and I wasn't 
scared," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kate's 14-year-old sister, Amanda, has taken classes at Pierce for seven 
semesters, including violin and art, and has joined the Pierce College 
orchestra. At first, Amanda was worried that she would stand out as especially 
young to the other students. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, I was afraid to talk to people and some would ask me how 
old I was, but everyone was nice and helpful," Amanda said.  
</P>
<P>
 The average age of the general student body at Pierce is 26, so there can be a 
down side to being less mature than the other students. Amanda recently decided 
to drop out of a life drawing class after learning that the next week's 
assignment would be to draw a nude male model. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "She just wasn't ready for that," said her mother, Karin, who has 
home-schooled both daughters. But the experience has been terrific, she said. 
"By the time they graduate from high school, they'll be halfway through 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Aclia Khan, 17, has attended Pierce for three years, completing courses in 
biology, chemistry, English and political science, while also a student at 
Valley Alternative Magnet School in Van Nuys. With a 3.8-grade point average at 
Pierce, she is on the dean's list, and loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a challenge, different from high school because you learn more," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Valley Alternative has a shuttle service to Pierce, allowing 65 10th- to 
12th-grade students to regularly pursue community college courses as part of 
their high school experience, said Susan Garcia-Phillips, the magnet 
coordinator. The younger students usually start with physical education and 
health, then begin more rigorous work, such as math, science and accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules at Pierce are more stringent than at many secondary schools. 
Students can miss only one hour of class for every course unit they are 
carrying, and teachers can drop a student if that limit is exceeded. The 
faculty does not coddle the younger students -- they are not even told that a 
junior high or high school student is enrolled in their classes, Delahoussaye 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Students interested in enrolling at Pierce fill out an application and may be 
asked to take an assessment test before taking their first math or English 
class. They also meet with a counselor, who can explain the routine and answer 
questions before they register. While courses are free, students must pay a 
$7.50 health fee, which allows them to use the health center on campus, and buy 
their own books and supplies. Courses are available to students year-round, 
including summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is where kids will find enrichment," Delahoussaye said. "It's one of the 
greatest bargains in education anywhere." WHERE TO GO

BACK TO THE STONE AGE; BOLTON HALL TELLS TUJUNGA'S HISTORY. MCGROARTY ARTS 
CENTER DISPLAYS WORK BY STUDENTS, TEACHERS AND PROFESSIONALS 
</P>

<P>
 Taking a trip back to the Stone Age is easier than you think. It doesn't 
require a time machine, rather a quick trip to Sunland-Tujunga, where about 200 
homes are fashioned from stones gathered from the Tujunga Wash and local fields 
and hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 This tour targets two of the larger, well-known buildings -- Bolton Hall, 
built in 1913, and the McGroarty Arts Center, constructed in 1923 as the home 
of Rep. John Steven McGroarty, a Democrat. Bolton Hall was built as a meeting 
house by the Little Landers, a settlement and social movement that believed in 
self-sufficiency through farming. Little Landers founder William Smythe named 
the hall after a writer friend. 
</P>
<P>
 1 p.m.: Three stone homes along the route to Bolton Hall make a good prologue 
to this tour. Begin at 10620 Samoa St., near the corner of Summitrose Street. 
Built in 1923 of local rock and field stone, the two-story structure has a 
curious past. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmer Reavis, a blind man, built the house himself. No doubt he chose the box 
architectural style to simplify construction. "He used a system of pulleys and 
ropes," said Mary Lou Pozzo, vice president and librarian of the 
Sunland-Tujunga Little Landers Historical Society. "And I'm told he hoisted a 
1,500-pound stone above the fireplace using that same system." 
</P>
<P>
 Drive west on Summitrose for four blocks and turn right on Tujunga Canyon 
Boulevard. Within the next block, look for 10428, the Livingston home. It was 
built by the father of Chan Livingston, 94, who was present at Bolton's opening 
in 1913 and is a member of the Little Landers Historical Society. Built in 
1923, the house features a stone veranda, stone columns and a fortress-like 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther south at 10217 Tujunga Canyon Blvd. (at the intersection of Valmont 
Street), a scaled-down replica of Ireland's Blarney Castle guards the corner. 
Built in the early 1920s, the building was the home of Virginia Smith, a local 
physician. The cement tower on the north side of the house was added in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 p.m.: To find Bolton Hall, turn left on Valmont, head east for two blocks 
and turn left on Commerce Avenue. You'll spot the museum on the right. As you 
enter the front door, look for a tobacco-stained stone that juts out from the 
wall on your right. It was used by early colonists to clean out their pipes 
when the building was used as a church, one of its many incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, you'll find a main meeting room wreathed with exhibits showcasing 
Tujunga's early history, as well as Indian artifacts that go back 10,000 years. 
Metate stones, used for grinding corn, are displayed, along with woven mats 
used by the Gabrielino tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of items from Tujunga's early days as a city (it was incorporated in 
1926) are also here: A fireman's hat, police badge, city ledger, a gavel used 
at Bolton Hall town meetings and, even older, an 1890 tin of Sunland Olive Oil. 
Many photographs of Tujunga families are posted and, not to be missed -- a 
yellowed copy of the Tujunga city song: "Tujunga -- See What You've Done for 
Me," written in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special note is a 1913 photograph of a determined farmer standing in front 
of Bolton Hall. He's pictured tending his struggling bean fields amid Tujunga's 
Godforsaken soil, which is known for pushing an endless quarry of stones to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display are kitchenware from the 1800s and early 1900s and wood 
carvings by William Nicholson, an early grocer in the area. Tools used by 
George Harris, a self-described "nature builder," an architect who preferred 
using natural materials in his creations (which included Bolton Hall), also are 
featured. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' structure "is built to stand for ages," reads a 1913 article from the 
Los Angeles Tribune. Indeed, Bolton Hall weathered the 1971 Sylmar and recent 
Northridge earthquakes without a crack. The building had been closed for 
earthquake retrofitting over the past two years, reopening in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of Harris' tools include trowels, a hammer, nails and an old 
wheelbarrow. The rough-hewn benches and tables scattered about the room are 
also Harris' work. Look for his signature brand, an encircled "GH" etched into 
the edge of his work. Harris also built the immense stone fireplace that is the 
room's centerpiece, along with a 10-foot-long mantel, beneath which Harris 
inscribed: "To the Spiritual Life of the Soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Other interesting highlights include a tiny jail cell, ("It housed mostly 
drunks -- no murderers," Pozzo said), now used as storage for bound volumes of 
the Foothill Leader newspaper dating to 1933. A library near the cell houses 
dozens of California books dating to the 1890s, covering such subjects as 
costumes, textiles, historical homes, antiques and agriculture. A gift shop 
sells Bolton Hall T-shirts, books that detail the area's history, genealogy 
kits, postcards and tapes of the Tujunga city song, sung by local musician 
Ralph Younger. 
</P>
<P>
 3 p.m.: McGroarty Arts Center is about one mile from Bolton Hall. Drive west 
on Valmont Street to Plainview Avenue; turn left and travel about half a mile 
until the road turns into McGroarty Terrace. Follow the road around the park 
and turn right up a steep driveway to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's main room is used for piano lessons. Off the living room is an 
art gallery that features work by students, instructors and professionals 
associated with the center's art programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To see McGroarty's study, you need to make an appointment. The upstairs room 
was restored and dedicated in 1974 as the John Steven McGroarty Memorial 
Archive-Library. McGroarty was named California's poet laureate in 1933, and he 
worked for 40 years as a journalist for the Los Angeles Times. On display are a 
200-year-old hand-carved chest, a hat and sword of the order of St. Gregory 
that were gifts from Pope Pius XI, McGroarty's books and a first-prize silver 
cup won for his float in the 1922 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade. 
McGroarty wrote 11 books and seven plays, and was most known for his Mission 
Play, which depicted early California history. He died in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is now used by various civic groups, including the McGroarty Writers 
Circle, which occasionally gives readings at the center. A wide range of 
classes are also held, including ones in ceramics, painting, watercolor, 
drawing, piano, tai chi , stitchery, dance and Chinese brush painting. WHERE

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE TASTE OF A GOOD TAVERNA ; * CHEF AND OWNER MARIANTHE 
RUNS A SWEET LITTLE CAFE WITH THE KIND OF FARE YOU'D FIND IN A GREEK VILLAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 So you have a little trouble with the name Marianthe's? You say you don't know 
which way to grab hold of it (actually, it's simple -- pronounce it 
ma-ree-AN-thee, with the "th" voiceless, as in theater )? Think about this: The 
owner might have given the restaurant her last name, Ioannidu. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianthe Ioannidu is an exuberantly friendly woman born in Istanbul, Turkey, 
of Greek parentage, who cooks, in her own words, "to satisfy her ego." She was 
trained as a child psychologist, not as a professional chef, and as any visitor 
to this sweet little cafe can see, the lack of formal training has its up side 
and its down side. 
</P>
<P>
 The down side is that she really doesn't put out a full-blown Greek menu. What 
we have here is basically a mixture of Greek and Syrian appetizers plus a 
rotating list of daily specials. The up side is that this cooking doesn't taste 
like restaurant food. It's the simple taverna fare, fragrant with garlic, lemon 
and mint, that you'd hope to encounter in an out-of-the-way Greek village. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is by no means fancy, but you probably guessed that. It's 
little more than a storefront in a Canoga Park mini-mall, directly opposite a 
teriyaki chicken emporium. Oh, there are the obligatory blue-and-white photos 
of Greece hanging about, but basically what you see is a mass of cane chairs 
and plastic tables -- and, pretty soon, Marianthe herself, coming out from 
behind the counter to take your order. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are far from fancy, too. Nothing costs more than $6.95, which suits 
her mostly local clientele just fine, thank you. Come here for the first time, 
and it's likely that Marianthe will come over and chat with you before taking 
your order, so she can determine how much of her native cuisine you have 
experienced.  
</P>
<P>
 You should insist on her appetizer combination, a $6.95 feast of hummus, the 
eggplant dip called baba ghannouj , dolmades (tangy grape leaves with an oily 
rice stuffing), falafel and Greek salad. This pikilia , as an appetizer combo 
is called in Greek, also can be customized to include a mound of a creamy cod 
roe spread ( taramosalata ) or even her wonderful homemade tzatziki , a thick 
yogurt dip flavored with cucumber, garlic, fresh dill and mint.  
</P>
<P>
 Other appetizers include obelisks of feta cheese, bitter Kalamata olives and 
the orange- and garlic-flavored Greek sausage known as loukaniko . Sometimes 
Marianthe makes little pastry triangles filled with cheese ( tiropi ta ) or 
spinach ( spanakopita ), and my advice is to grab them if you find them 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 The limited selection of main dishes varies according to the day of the week. 
For instance, Tuesdays there will be a simple country-style baked lemon 
chicken, drizzled with olive oil and served with wedges of roasted potatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 My favorite is Marianthe's Saturday night special, the Greek meatballs known 
as keftedes . This is an extremely common Greek dish, but not all keftedes are 
created equal; they're like the little girl who, when she is good, is very, 
very good, but when they're bad -- well, we won't go into it. These keftedes 
are wonderful, partly because Marianthe hand-chops the meat for them ("You know 
what you are getting that way," she says) -- a mixture of lamb and beef, 
seasoned with mint and garlic.  
</P>
<P>
 Fridays she prepares moussaka, the ground meat and eggplant casserole famous 
throughout the Balkans. In a way, this one is her most impressive dish, because 
it tastes the least like the versions served in the more commercial Greek 
restaurants. First she layers a pan with sauteed eggplant that has been dredged 
lightly in flour, then she adds a meat mixture aromatic with cinnamon and 
allspice and finally a thick topping of Bechamel sauce. It's finished off in 
the oven, and the result is distinguished by penetrating flavors and a 
refreshingly home-cooked quality.  
</P>
<P>
 All the main dishes are complemented by a dense lentil soup or a Greek salad ( 
horiatki ) chock-full of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and olives, not to 
mention sliced onions and salad greens. You could make a meal of it, rounded 
out with wedges of the house pita bread. In fact, many of Marianthe's customers 
like to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianthe doesn't rely entirely on her Greek dishes. There's also a 
lunch-counter menu of hot dogs, tuna sandwiches and the like, plus 
American-style breakfasts, from pancakes to omelets, that she will cook any 
time of the day or night. She also makes roast lamb ( souvlaki ) or chicken 
every day, and sticky-sweet homemade baklava. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite every day. Never on Sunday, as the song goes; that's her day 
of rest. She can use it, believe me. WHERE AND WHEN)

MAGNET SCHOOL TO PUT SPECIAL FOCUS ON MATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mound School in Ventura is preparing to become a math magnet school this fall, 
making it the first public school in Ventura County to specialize in an 
academic subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan that the Ventura school board is expected to approve next month, 
Mound teachers will put special emphasis on mathematics, weaving it into their 
instruction of all other subjects during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to become a magnet school is part of Mound's response to a federal 
civil rights investigation last year that found the primarily white school was 
not doing enough to attract minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 Mound officials hope that a beefed-up math curriculum would help entice Latino 
parents whose children are interested in math to transfer from their 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Mound's 550 children, about 90% are white, a far higher proportion than the 
60% white enrollment in the Ventura Unified School District as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 A probe by the U. S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights ended 
last fall with school officials agreeing to encourage minority parents to enter 
their children's names in Mound's annual admissions lottery and to give 
preference to minority youngsters in the drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Mound officials agreed to offer some unique educational program that 
might lure minority students from around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are talented students all over the district in math," Assistant Supt. 
Patricia Chandler said. "We're hoping -- once we make it really clear that 
we're taking a specific-subject approach -- it will attract students from all 
over the district regardless of their ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mound School opened in 1988 -- after being closed for several years -- as the 
Ventura district's first year-round school. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment was opened to all families who preferred a non-traditional school 
calendar, making Mound the only school in Ventura without a particular 
attendance area from which it draws students. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, Mound has no bus transportation, requiring parents to bring their 
children to and from school. 
</P>
<P>
 From its inception, Mound attracted teachers who were excited by the school's 
year-round calendar and parents who were willing and able to drive their 
children to school. 
</P>
<P>
 And that combination of strong teachers and highly involved parents helped 
earn the school a reputation as one of the best in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But four other Ventura elementary schools converted to year-round calendars in 
recent years, so school officials began to consider a magnet program for Mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Mound needed an alternative educational program to justify its continued 
open-enrollment policy as well as to to attract minority students, Chandler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So beginning in the fall, Mound plans to adopt a curriculum developed by the 
University of Chicago that weaves math into the instruction of other subjects, 
such as science and social studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be trying to integrate it into the whole day, to relate it to 
their everyday lives, " said Mound teacher Susan Frank, one of two teachers who 
piloted a Chicago program in two classes this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The district chose math, officials said, because of the success that Frank and 
her colleague have had with the new curriculum this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the new curriculum, Frank said her third-graders have progressed further 
in math than classes in previous years, making them comfortable discussing 
prime numbers, square roots and other concepts that are usually introduced to 
older students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concepts we've gone over have been way beyond anything I've ever taught 
before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With no math textbooks, the program represents a shift from the traditional 
emphasis on rote learning of long division and other subjects. Instead, Mound 
students will learn math primarily from hands-on classroom activities, games 
such as dominoes and word problems that challenge students to apply arithmetic 
to their everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, for instance, did not formally teach the multiplication tables this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students had to learn their multiplication tables to be able to do 
other activities, such as play a classroom bingo game that uses multiplication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is completely different from the way that I've taught math before," 
Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference from traditional math programs is that new concepts are 
reintroduced repeatedly throughout the year to reinforce learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before when you taught math you taught one concept, like decimals, you taught 
it and then you seldom came back to it," Frank said. "This program spirals. You 
introduce a concept, then you go on. Then you bring (the concept) back."

IMPENDING NATIONAL BAN TRIGGERS RUN ON FIREARMS; GUN CONTROL: FEAR THAT 
CONGRESS WILL CUT OFF ACCESS TO SEMIAUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS PROMPTS BUYING 
REGIONWIDE.

 Gary Creagle never thought he would see more buyers in his Fillmore gun shop 
than he had the weekend after the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed its ban on 
semiautomatic assault weapons -- setting off a run on guns from Simi Valley to 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible," said Creagle, owner of Up in Arms. "I've got twice the volume of 
post-riots." 
</P>
<P>
 His usual Saturday crowd of 100 browsers swelled to 500 last weekend and, he 
said, "they were all buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that Congress will cut off any access to rapid-fire weapons, 
sportsmen, gun collectors and ordinary buyers from across the region are 
stocking up on guns and rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best salesmen we have are Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Janet Reno," 
said Tony Montemorra, owner of Sportsmen's Exchange in Oxnard. "People have 
cleaned us out of certain models of guns on that list, and you just can't get 
them any more from the wholesalers." 
</P>
<P>
 One gun store in Simi Valley has three salesmen on the phone all day looking 
for the guns and ammunition magazines in what is quickly becoming a speculative 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 When they do find the hardware, chances are the prices have jumped as quickly 
as the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 An MAK-90 military-style rifle that once sold for $367 now goes for at least 
$600 at one local store. A Springfield M1A .308-caliber rifle that used to 
retail for $1,200 now costs store owners as much as $1,800, pushing the retail 
price even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Ammunition magazines for the high-capacity guns are also commanding higher 
prices as supplies grow shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers' prices are going up," said Steve Cotter of Hilldale Discount 
Gun Sales Inc. in Simi Valley. "All of a sudden they're going to have to cover 
overhead with about half the products." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill approved by the slimmest of margins a week ago would ban the 
manufacture, sale and possession of combat-style assault weapons and magazines 
holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar measure has already passed the Senate, and members from both houses 
are expected to send a compromise measure to the White House soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending ban has touched off a rush nationwide, with sales doubling on 
the West Coast and tripling in the Midwest, said Bob Lesmeister, director of 
the National Assn. of Federal Licensed Firearm Dealers, which represents 30,000 
gun store owners nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guns on the list were already in short supply," Lesmeister said. 
"I think as the shortage gets worse, the demand gets great as it gets closer to 
becoming law." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters, gun merchants do not know how many weapons could be 
affected. The House bill specifically names 19 kinds of semiautomatic handguns 
and rifles, many of them already banned from sale in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also prohibits the sale and manufacture of weapons with certain 
"assault-style" features, such as bayonet mounts, pistol grips and flash 
suppressors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That 19 could turn into 219," said Michael Pinner, manager of Battlefield 
Adventure in Ventura. "Or it could be nine," if manufacturers modify their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers are not quibbling. 
</P>
<P>
 One customer at Pinner's store dropped $900 on ammunition and magazines at 
lunchtime Thursday, trying to beat the spiraling prices and the impending ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prices are going up at an incredible rate," said the buyer, who declined 
to give his name for fear he would offend some business people he deals with. A 
hunter and a collector, he offered no apologies for his love of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can protect you, they can feed you, and they're a good investment," he 
said  
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, the phone rang behind Pinner's counter. It was a salesman 
offering to sell him some of the 4,000 MAK-90 rifles on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinner checked his display and found only two of the wood-handled guns left. 
He asked for the price. The salesman wanted $400, up from the usual $200 to 
$240 Pinner pays for the rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to play this game," Pinner told the salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about dealing almost in a commodities market," Pinner said 
after hanging up the phone. "You don't know where the prices are going." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pinner, the rush began last November, after Congress passed the Brady 
Bill. Even though the measure was less strict than existing California law, it 
signaled that the federal government was serious about gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "All hell broke loose in this industry," Pinner said. "Anything that had to do 
with firearms became extinct." 
</P>
<P>
 While many stores are raising their prices to meet the higher demands, Creagle 
in Fillmore has a different strategy. He will sell his current stock until he 
runs out of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm probably going to be out of business in two years," he said. "And 
then you know what you're going to have: a black market that will make the sale 
of drugs look like a picnic."

2 DIE AS THEIR PLANE CRASHES INTO ORCHARD; AVIATION: THE VICTIMS, WHO 
MAINTAINED A THOUSAND OAKS RESIDENCE, WERE RETURNING TO ARIZONA HOME. THE 
AIRCRAFT BARELY MISSED HOUSES.

 An Arizona couple who also maintained a residence in Thousand Oaks were killed 
early Thursday morning when their single-engine plane plummeted into an eastern 
Ventura lemon orchard less than five minutes after taking off from Camarillo 
Airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 John William Reeds Jr., 65, and Patsy Jean Reeds, 62, died instantly when 
their four-seat turbocharged Mooney 231 plunged out of low clouds in a 
near-vertical dive and crashed into a 45-acre lemon orchard off Bristol Road 
about 8:20 a.m., according to federal authorities and the Ventura County 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the ground was injured, but the plane missed a row of houses on 
Ermine Avenue by about 300 feet. National Transportation Safety Board and 
Federal Aviation Administration investigators at the scene said the pair had 
just departed Camarillo Airport and had filed a flight plan for Sedona, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan called for the Reeds to navigate by instruments alone while climbing 
above the heavy, low clouds and fog to a higher altitude, where clear skies 
prevailed, according to NTSB investigator Thomas Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reeds left under "instrument conditions" -- weather typically marked by 
the low altitude of the clouds and limited visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing at the site to immediately indicate why the plane, a 1983 
model first purchased by the Reeds in 1987, crashed, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we just don't know what caused this accident," Wilcox said. "We 
know that he departed Camarillo without incident, but three or four minutes 
later he crashed. We have witnesses saying he descended out of the clouds nose 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 The speed of the aircraft at impact was evident from the fact that most of the 
plane's engine compartment and part of its cockpit were driven 4 to 5 feet into 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox added that investigators could not find any evidence of fire or 
explosion at the crash site or elsewhere in the orchard, which is owned by 
Helen J. Ellis, the great-aunt of Ventura City Councilman Greg Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 John Reeds III said his parents flew out of airports in the area on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't know what went wrong," Reeds said in an interview late Thursday 
from his Simi Valley home. "They both have been flying for the last several 
years and never had a problem. They were trying to sell the house in Thousand 
Oaks for the last year but had been living mostly in Sedona. They've been 
flying back and forth a lot lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeds said his father was a retired aerospace engineer for Hughes Aircraft 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they believed the white Mooney, which is also known as an 
M-20K, never lost power and in fact the pilot may have gunned its 
210-horsepower engine just before the crash in a failed attempt to climb out of 
the dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Burke, a 25-year-old Ventura resident, said he was driving to work on 
Bristol Road when he saw the plane nose-dive into the orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just driving along and looked over to my right and saw him go down," 
Burke said. "It was surreal. It reminded me of how those wooden model airplanes 
look when you throw them and they loop down violently. When it hit the ground, 
it kicked up a huge spray of dew off the lemon trees." 
</P>
<P>
 People living nearby said they believed that at first a crop duster was 
preparing to spray the field when they heard the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was that something had hit my house," said Karen Dunwoody, 
43, whose back yard faces the orchard. "When the plane went down it shook the 
house pretty good. At first we didn't know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Lawhn, 43, was gardening in his front yard at the time of the accident. 
"I heard the plane, looked up and saw it bank into a step dive," Lawhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, about four seconds later I heard a very loud thud. I ran to the plane 
and called out to see if anyone was alive, but there wasn't any response. There 
was blood everywhere. It was pretty awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Fire Department crews brought in heavy lifting equipment at the site 
to dislodge the tangled wreck from the ground and free the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA records show that both the Reeds held valid pilot's licenses and that John 
William Reeds was rated to fly the aircraft by instruments alone. The couple 
both passed an FAA medical examination in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Once dug out from the ground, parts of the wreck were loaded onto a truck for 
delivery to Camarillo Airport where a more detailed analysis can be performed. 
Along with John Reeds III, the Reeds are also survived by a daughter, Eileen, 
of Texas.

SHELL-SHOCKED RESIDENTS ASK OFFICIALS, EACH OTHER FOR HELP; FORUM: CITING FEAR 
OF CRIME, VENTURA AVENUE-AREA NEIGHBORS PLEAD PASSIONATELY FOR POLICE PATROLS, 
AN INCREASE IN JOBS AND CLEANUP OF STREETS.

 Saying they live in constant fear of crime and random drive-by shootings, 
about 400 Ventura Avenue-area residents crowded a school cafeteria Thursday, 
imploring their neighbors and city officials to help revitalize the community. 
</P>
<P>
 During an impassioned two-hour meeting, residents yelled, pleaded and reasoned 
with each other to work at increasing area jobs, intensifying police patrols, 
cleaning up unkempt Avenue-area streets and driving out neighborhood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've always stood for is pride and we don't have any pride anymore," 
said 49-year neighborhood resident Carol Wren, urging her neighbors to take 
action amid bursts of audience applause. "Where has it gone? We've got to take 
our community back!" 
</P>
<P>
 The forum at Sheridan Way School came in the wake of a series of nighttime 
shooting sprees on West Harrison Street in March that sent residents cowering 
under tables and sleeping on floors to duck stray bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic climax to the meeting, Ventura City Police Chief Richard Thomas 
announced that officers in his department will open a substation in the area 
and are in final negotiations on a property at Olive and Main streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But a substation was only one of many improvements residents called for at the 
forum, which they decided would be the first in a series. The next meeting will 
be June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker after speaker complained of the local gang members, who they said 
terrorize residents and deface property on a regular basis. One woman, who 
asked that her name not be used, said she was watching a television show 
Wednesday night when she was startled by rocks crashing through her front and 
bathroom windows.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who has been active in galvanizing the community, said she received 
an anonymous call Thursday morning from someone who warned her: "Next time, it 
won't be your windows or your house. Back off." 
</P>
<P>
 During Thursday's meeting, after about 15 minutes of gang-related complaints 
from that woman and other residents, resident Paul Castaneda called out from 
the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, all of you people right here!" he said. "You were never sweating this 
issue 20 years ago. We were all in the streets then, too, but you weren't 
sweating it." 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda, who identified himself as a former gang member, chastised many in 
the audience for organizing only after the violence spilled over onto their 
streets, and then wanting to banish gang members rather than trying to help 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You people are all scared, but how many of you ever took time to stop and 
talk to a gang member?" he asked. "I work, I'm getting married, I'm trying to 
make it, but you guys go on me by what I look like." 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda's remarks provoked a flurry of cheers and yells, and the meeting 
threatened to disintegrate into warring fragments as neighbor started shouting 
at neighbor across the large room. 
</P>
<P>
 But M. Tony Garcia, a West Park Road resident who has lived in the area for 
all of his 77 years, stood up and called out for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how division begins," he said. "We've heard grievances all evening. 
But you know who's to blame? We're all to blame." 
</P>
<P>
 By 7:30 p.m., an hour and a half into the session, the volunteer resident 
coordinators directing the session had begun to compile a manageable list of 
immediate objectives, among them helping the police to construct the substation 
and badgering City Council members to spend more money on Avenue projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who attended the meeting along with Councilman Jim 
Monahan and Mayor Tom Buford, urged the residents to pester city politicians as 
much as their more affluent, east-side peers do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting to be city budget time, and right about now, I get about 20 or 
30 calls from people on the east end, wanting to know what about my sidewalk, I 
need my olive trees trimmed," he said. "My suggestion to you is to call all 
seven council members all day, and you will get results. One hundred fifty 
calls to council members will make a difference."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STUDENTS CHALK ONE UP FOR ART IN PUBLIC 
PLACES 
</P>

<P>
 The aim of Ventura High School's annual chalk festival is to give young 
artists a chance to copy famous paintings, to encourage other students' 
artistic appreciation and to generally make art part of the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 But 16-year-old Jennifer McPhie's reason for enjoying the festival is less 
lofty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a chance to get dirty," said Jennifer, whose arms, face and legs 
were smeared with colored chalk by the middle of the festival Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior was one of about 100 Ventura High students who participated in the 
chalk festival throughout the day, drawing giant chalk replicas of famous 
paintings on large sheets of white canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after an annual event in Santa Barbara, the chalk festival allows art 
students to learn by copying the work of famous artists, while at the same time 
sparking their classmates' interest in art, said art teacher Patricia Post. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the finished work will be hung in classrooms and offices around the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher Tamara Currie already has two of the chalk drawings from 
previous festivals on her classroom walls, and this year she will get another 
-- a copy of a Monet painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Currie teaches social studies and English rather than art, the 
drawings in her room stimulate classroom discussions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great how having a piece of artwork really titillates the students' 
interest in art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students raised money from teachers and local businesses to cover the cost of 
materials, with remaining funds going to defray student costs for taking 
Advanced Placement exams in studio art, which cost $102 per test, Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chalk drawings are copied, they still pose an artistic challenge 
to the students, Post said. Students must guard against distortion because the 
canvas sheets, each measuring several feet wide, are much larger than the 
photographs they are copying from. 
</P>
<P>
 To some students, the work was challenging not only artistically, but 
physically. Drawing on such large canvases forced them to stretch and crouch in 
ways that were not always comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my Lord," said Jennifer, as she stood to stretch after working on a 
colorful replica of a Paul Gaugin painting. "It's like playing Twister." MAIA 
DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SCHOOL TO CELEBRATE LATINO CULTURES

<P>
 Youths from preschool to high school will celebrate the different cultures of 
Central and South American during a daylong festival called Dia 
Hispano-Americano on Saturday at Oak Grove School in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope the event will raise consciousness about Spanish language and 
culture among the private school's 180 students and the Ojai community. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will offer food booths, activities such as demonstrations of 
Mexican weaving and Argentinian tango dancing, a Spanish-language book fair and 
live musical performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we've done this," said Holly Mitchem, publicist for the 
festival and a parent of two Oak Grove students.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every class picked a country, and they've been cooking and doing crafts so 
that it becomes more of a hands-on experience rather than sitting in class and 
learning words." 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off Dia Hispano-Americano, the Ojai Playhouse will present a free 
screening of the Academy Award-nominated film "El Norte" at 3:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of Saturday's festival will include a demonstration of Argentinian 
tango by local dancers Lana Flora and Charles Raabe at 12:30 p.m. and a 
performance of Peruvian music from 2 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will cost $3, but all other events are free and open to the 
public. Oak Grove School is at 220 W. Lomita Ave. in Meiners Oaks. For more 
information, call 646-8236. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; HEAD START PRESCHOOL FORMALLY DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rush of childhood memories overcame 13-year-old Fatima Chavez as she 
addressed the crowd Thursday at the grand opening of the new Head Start 
preschool in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctant guest speaker burst into tears while conjuring up remembrances 
of her godmother, Meliss Wade, the longtime farm-worker benefactor for whom the 
new facility is named. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember her gifts were always different than any others because she would 
give me books," said Fatima, who attended the old Head Start preschool in 
Fillmore when she was younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always said it would help me to know the world better," said Fatima, who 
now volunteers after school at Meliss Wade Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 people crowded onto the patio of the preschool in the Rancho Sespe 
Housing Development to formally dedicate the preschool center. 
</P>
<P>
 It replaces a smaller Head Start campus that had operated near downtown 
Fillmore since 1970. The new center boasts two large classrooms, a playground, 
kitchen, offices and an expansive multipurpose room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible experience to see children grow and develop their skills," 
said Head Start teacher Terri Davis, who said preschool prepares young people 
for the rigors of later life. "If they don't have a foundation to start with, 
they would be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is a joint project of the nonprofit Child Development Resources, 
which administers 17 Head Start centers in Ventura County, and the Rancho Sespe 
Workers Improvement Assn., the homeowners group that leased the space to the 
nonprofit group for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to give back to the community some of what we've gotten," said 
Jaime Zepeda, a Rancho Sespe homeowner whose daughter attended the Head Start 
preschool. "It's not only Rancho Sespe children who come." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Sespe is a cooperative affordable-housing project of 100 units built by 
the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., which also helped open the new 
preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Zepeda said the Rancho Sespe homeowners wanted to name the preschool after 
Wade, who died several years ago, in honor of her long-term commitment to farm 
workers and low-income families in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always worried about the little kids and she was a strong supporter 
of our labor struggle and our housing struggle," said Zepeda, a former farm 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Nely Carrillo said the preschool activities have helped her 5-year-old 
daughter, Cristal, who spends four hours a day at the Meliss Wade Head Start 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives her many ways to develop her skills," Carrillo said. "It helps her 
get ahead." JEFF McDONALD

 Dozens of pilots flying homemade and experimental planes will land at 
Camarillo Airport this weekend for the 14th annual Fly-in/Air Show sponsored by 
the Ventura County chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which starts today and runs through Sunday, will feature more than 
100 planes ranging from home-built to military to ultra-light, said Deborah 
Torbert, a spokeswoman for the air show. 
</P>
<P>
 Aircraft owners will compete for prizes including best of show, people's 
choice and best new design awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California wing of the Confederate Air Force, which restores and 
flies World War II-era aircraft, will have an open house of the hangar and 
museum during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Torbert said this year's theme will be "Twenty-Five Years Since the Moon 
Landing," honoring the Apollo 11 spacecraft mission. NASA Col. Carl Meade will

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OJAI SCHOOL CARNIVAL MEANS FUN AND FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai's public schools hope to raise $10,000 for student athletics and 
educational programs during their fifth annual carnival this weekend at 
Nordhoff High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival, which begins at 3 p.m. today and continues through Sunday, is 
presented by Nordhoff and Mira Monte Elementary School in conjunction with 
Butler Amusements, the largest carnival company in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day event, one of the schools' largest fund-raisers, generated 
$10,000 last year. Administrators hope to meet or top that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real nice fund-raiser for us and a fun activity for the 
community," said Nordhoff Assistant Principal Jack Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival helps offset the dwindling funds available for athletics and 
other programs, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, funds from the carnival have paid for transportation for the 
high school's sports teams. This year, the school intends to put the money 
toward purchasing two new vans for Nordhoff, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Monte Principal Larry Hartmann said money raised at the carnival will be 
added to the elementary school's fund-raising pot and will help pay for 
numerous school needs, including the library, computer lab and bilingual 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the funds generated directly for Mira Monte and Nordhoff, 
Ojai's other public schools are able to raise money by selling ticket booklets 
for the carnival's 20 rides and by selling food at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival is being held at Nordhoff High, 1401 Maricopa Highway. The hours 
are 3 to 10:30 p.m. today, 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Saturday and noon to 10 p.m. 
Sunday. There is no charge for admission, but ticket booklets cost $10 for 
eight to 10 rides. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: MOORPARK; WOMAN REAR-ENDS DEPUTY'S PATROL CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County sheriff's deputy who had stopped his patrol car at a red 
light was rear-ended by a 27-year-old Moorpark woman whose foot slipped off the 
brake of her minivan, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Jerardo Gomez, 27, of Thousand Oaks, was treated for neck and shoulder 
pain at Los Robles Regional Medical Center and released, authorities said.The 
driver of the minivan, Roxanna Biejo, was not injured, but an unidentified 
passenger in the car with her complained of minor back pain, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened about 9:15 p.m. Wednesday in Moorpark, as Biejo was 
driving westbound on Los Angeles Avenue. As she approached the intersection at 
Moorpark Avenue, her foot slipped off the brake and hit the accelerator, said 
Deputy Cindy Vickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Biejo then hit the brake pedal again and swerved to the left, hitting the rear 
of Gomez's police car, Vickers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness estimated that Biejo was driving about 35 m.p.h. when she rear-ended 
Gomez, Vickers said. A preliminary investigation did not show any problems with 
Biejo's van, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biejo was not cited and an investigation is continuing, deputies said.

COLLEGE TO HOST MAY KITE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The skies over Moorpark College will be flecked with hundreds of multicolored 
kites Saturday when the college hosts a May Kite Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers came up with the idea this year as a way to "get the community 
involved in a big way" at the college, said event coordinator Susan Jeffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is to get people out here to have fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the day's agenda is a kite-flying demonstration inside the school 
gym by a nationally recognized kite flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "These new kites are totally amazing," Jeffers said. "They don't need any 
wind. They lift off with just the motion of walking." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the demonstration, kite "dogfights" and kite "ballets," the event 
will include several contests in which awards for the most creative and most 
aerodynamically designed kites will be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It will be held on the lower athletic 
field south of the college gymnasium. Admission is $3, with children under 12 
admitted free. Parking is also free.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ROBBER SENTENCED, ANOTHER CONVICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley woman was sentenced on bank fraud charges and another woman was 
convicted of bank robbery charges in two Ventura County cases this week, FBI 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Cesar, 34, of Simi Valley was sentenced Tuesday to four months in 
jail, to be followed by five years' probation, and ordered to repay the money 
she stole from Home Federal Bank in Westlake Village, said Gary Auer, in charge 
of the FBI's regional office. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Fed Bank officials referred Cesar's case to the FBI in March, 1993, Auer 
said. Cesar, a teller at the bank, withdrew money from accounts of bank 
customers and illegally cashed checks for deposit between June, 1990, and 
November, 1992, Auer said. Altogether, she took about $43,300 for her own use, 
Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, 19-year-old Shonte Lynn McKinzie of Los Angeles was convicted 
on bank robbery charges after a three-day trial that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinzie was the getaway driver in a Ventura bank robbery that occurred in 
January, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After two of McKinzie's partners robbed the Bank of America branch at 2698 E. 
Main St., the three briefly escaped to Fillmore before Curtis Eugene Smith was 
hit by a tractor-trailer rig, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinzie, who is scheduled to be sentenced July 21, faces a maximum of 20 
years in prison and a $5,000 fine, Auer said. Smith is healing from his 
injuries and will be charged with bank robbery when he recovers, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third person in the robbery was convicted in Ventura County Superior 
Court. His name was not released because he is a juvenile. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY BACKS REPORT ON FIRE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Fire Department should incorporate all the suggestions made 
in a citizens advisory report when department officials develop a long-range 
strategic plan, county supervisors said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The citizens group, which convened after a county audit criticized fiscal 
practices within the department, recommended that the county reduce pay for 
sick leave at the end of the year, cut overtime, use civilians for some 
non-emergency work and reinstitute a volunteer force, among other suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairwoman Vicky Howard supported the work of the 14-member group, calling it 
one of the "best reports ever submitted from a citizens committee." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go beyond thanking you for this report," said Howard, adding that 
every suggestion should become part of the long-range plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she liked a proposal to bring the administration of the department 
back to the County Government Center in Ventura. The Fire Department 
administration is now at the Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion would combine dispatch centers with the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department to cut expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 She also praised a suggestion to institute a reserve fund to replace equipment 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the department does not back the proposals, Supervisor Maggie Kildee said 
officials should be required to explain why. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY OKS LOAN TO FIX DAMAGED HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to speed up efforts to rebuild earthquake-damaged homes, Ventura 
County supervisors have approved a temporary loan of $300,000 from the county's 
general fund to replace delayed federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Rehabilitation Program, to be administered by the city of Fillmore 
to help residents there and in neighboring Piru, needs the funds now to buy 
materials to help residents repair homes, Administrative Analyst Susan Van Abel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have been assembled to help repair the homes and the victims have 
been identified, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to go with the program in Fillmore and Piru, but we don't have 
the money because of an administrative holdup with the Community Development 
Block Grant funds," Van Abel told the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will help Hand to Hand, Habitat for Humanity and the Christian 
Relief Work Reform Committee work with residents of the two communities to 
repair homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Project organizers have requested a total of $575,000, but the $300,000 will 
get them started until the federal funds arrive, probably in August, Van Abel 
said. JOANNA M. MILLER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: SIMI VALLEY; MOLESTATION SUSPECT TO STAND TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A three-time convicted robber was ordered to stand trial on 10 felony counts 
of child molestation after a detective told a judge that the Simi Valley man 
has had sex with a 13-year-old girl on a weekly basis for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Henry A. Diaz, 40, will be the first person charged in 
Ventura County under the state's new "three strikes and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, enacted five days before Diaz's arrest March 22, mandates a sentence 
of 25 years to life for anyone convicted of a felony with at least two prior 
serious felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-strikes allegation will be filed against Diaz on May 26, the date of 
the defendant's arraignment, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice A. Koenig. Diaz's 
robbery convictions were in 1978, 1982 and 1986, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Detective Gary Galloway testified Thursday at a preliminary 
hearing that Diaz had sex with the girl at least once a week from shortly after 
Jan. 17 until his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered the girl leaving Diaz's room while conducting an early 
morning raid for drugs at the Sitka Avenue home shared by the defendant, the 
girl, her mother and at least two other people, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was later interviewed by Galloway, a child-abuse investigator. She 
told of her sexual encounters with Diaz, Galloway testified. Diaz also admitted 
the affair, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother told authorities she suspected that Diaz was molesting her 
daughter but did not report her suspicions because the girl denied sexual 
involvement with the defendant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn has said that Diaz is considering 
pleading guilty. The girl is now in a foster home, Koenig said. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: THOUSAND OAKS; SYMPHONY BENEFIT CONCERT CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Conejo Symphony pops concert scheduled for Sunday at Cal Lutheran University 
has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed as a benefit for the Conejo Symphony Orchestra, the afternoon event 
would have included a concert, arts show and street fair.But symphony 
organizers realized this week that they could not get the program organized in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just became logistically too difficult," Conejo Symphony Director Everett 
Ascher said. The group began planning the event at the end of March but found 
that "45 days was just not enough time to do this," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascher had hoped to raise $5,000 with the street fair and pops concert. But 
even with the cancellation, he predicted the symphony would reach its goal of 
raising $25,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 To help reach that target, symphony members are organizing a June 5 benefit 
called "A Day at Ascot." Scheduled for 11:30 a.m. at the Foxfield Riding 
Academy in Westlake Village, the event will feature a champagne brunch and an 
equestrian drill team performance. Tickets cost $55. 
</P>
<P>

ELECTIONS / VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISORS; SCHILLO HOPES TO MOVE HIS FIGHT FROM 
THOUSAND OAKS TO BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Thousand Oaks city councilman, Frank Schillo has spent much of the past 
10 years battling Ventura County government for more and better services for 
his city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Schillo wants to take his fight directly to the Board of Supervisors as he 
campaigns for the seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, he promises to push for more law enforcement, transit, library and 
other county services for the people of the 2nd Supervisorial District. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm representing Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and Port Hueneme, then those are 
the people I'm going to be fighting for," Schillo said. "I'm going to be 
fiercely loyal to the people who elect me, just as I've always done." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo has long complained that the county has neglected Thousand Oaks while 
it continues to ask the city's affluent taxpayers to subsidize services in 
other parts of the region. It is an issue he does not take lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time he proposed that the city break off from the county system and 
form its own fire department because he believed it would be cheaper to 
operate. On another occasion he demanded that the county share with its 10 
cities $26 million in revenues derived from the Proposition 172 public safety 
tax measure approved last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, 60, said he is running for the Board of Supervisors because he 
believes he can bring a clear sense of direction and strong fiscal leadership 
to county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than setting priorities based on one-year budget projections, Schillo 
proposes that the county establish long-term goals and then determine what is 
financially feasible. He also suggests establishing a two-year budget, similar 
to one adopted in Thousand Oaks, to help in planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors needs to set goals for the county, instead of 
letting department heads do that," said Schillo, a financial consultant. "Once 
you have goals, then things fall into place from a financial standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he would also push to have the supervisors' meetings televised to 
make officials more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way people know what's going on," he said. "With television you would be 
able to decide for yourself exactly why someone voted for a particular thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his Thousand Oaks council seat, Schillo is chairman of the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission and is both chairman and founder of 
the Ventura County Council of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sits on a special committee studying a proposal to establish a 
commercial airport at Point Mugu. The Navy has offered to share its runway with 
the county to cut its operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the proposed airport could be an economic boon to the county, 
attracting new businesses and giving the area's large agricultural industry 
another way to ship its products. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and residents of nearby Camarillo have voiced concerns over the 
potential noise and the number of flights in and out of the airport. But 
Schillo said the airport study shows that most flights would approach the Navy 
base from the ocean and not over residential areas. Only when there is heavy 
fog, he said, would the flight patterns have to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, Schillo said he backs the development of a new landfill to 
serve the cities of the west county. Bailard Landfill in Oxnard is scheduled to 
shut down in 1997, and the candidate said he is worried that the Simi Valley 
Landfill could become the county's only dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a landfill has been proposed for Weldon Canyon near Ojai, residents 
there have successfully fought against a dump for years. But Schillo said a 
west county landfill site must be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's irresponsible to say, 'Well, we don't want a dump site, so let's use 
Simi,' " Schillo said. "That's not a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 In the area of public safety, Schillo said he believes that the County Fire 
Department in the future should receive a portion of Proposition 172 funds. 
Money now generated from the sales tax measure is split among the county's law 
enforcement agencies and criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo said the Fire Department must first take steps to improve its 
operating efficiency, noting that an audit of the department showed it was 
top-heavy with managers and spends too much on overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he once proposed that Thousand Oaks form its own fire department, 
Schillo said he has since reconsidered his position. He initially believed the 
city was paying substantially more in taxes to the county for fire services 
than it was receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fire Department study, however, showed that the city essentially pays $11 
million toward fire services and in return receives about $10.2 million of that 
for its own fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the difference -- $750,000 -- is not enough to justify a city 
fire department. To recapture this money, however, Schillo proposes that the 
County Fire Department perform some building and safety services now done by 
the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing it in unincorporated areas, so why can't they do it for us?" 
Schillo said. "That would cut our costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he has not reached a final decision on establishing a county 
firefighter paramedic program, though he questions the need for one. The county 
is now served by three private ambulance companies, which includes Pruner 
Ambulance, serving Thousand Oaks and Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters argue that a paramedic program would mean faster response times. 
But Schillo said the county cannot afford to implement such a program now. He 
said he also believes that Pruner is doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo had supported a proposal by Pruner to place an ambulance in the 
county's fire station in Oak Park, where a study showed response times to be 
inadequate. The firefighters union argued against such a move, saying it would 
interfere with the ability of firefighters to do their job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to affect their job or their chances of getting a paramedic 
program," Schillo said. "Let's get on with it. We have people that could 
possibly die because there are no services there." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials with Pruner, which this week received a contract extension with 
the county, said they now plan to open their own station in Oak Park in the 
immediate future to avoid any problems with the firefighters' union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he supports the proposed $30-million expansion of the Ventura 
County Medical Center. The plan has sparked an opposing campaign by neighboring 
Community Memorial Hospital, which considers the public hospital an emerging 
competitor for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the responsibility of the county to serve the indigents of the region," 
he said. "It's unfortunate -- the physical location of the two hospitals. But 
other (private) hospitals" will not be hurt by the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his strong name recognition and his government experience, Schillo 
said he has not received any major endorsements from any county organization or 
county leader. But Schillo said he is not bothered by this, adding that the 
only endorsements that matter will come from the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since elected to the Thousand Oaks City Council in 1984, Schillo has come 
under attack for some of his decisions over the years and at one point was even 
the target of a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Councilman Alex Fiore were accused of ramming the $64-million 
Civic Arts Plaza development through the City Council without heeding concerns 
of some residents over its price, design, size and location. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall group collected more than 10,000 signatures, but the county 
registrar invalidated several hundred, so the petition fell short of the number 
required for a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo defends the project, saying it is financially solid and that the 
public was given ample opportunity to speak out on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who don't like it and I understand that and I respect 
them," he said. "But that's not the majority in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo has also been criticized by some of his opponents for helping to 
create an atmosphere of pervasive mudslinging and personal attacks that has 
come to characterize the current City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo said others, not him, are to blame for the bickering that goes on. 
"I've been trying for the longest time to get things focused on the issues and 
not on personalities," he said. "But in order to have success you have to have 
cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequent criticism of Schillo among his opponents for supervisor is 
whether he would be able to fairly balance the needs of the county with that of 
his own city. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo upset some county officials earlier this year when he demanded that 
Thousand Oaks receive at least $400,000 from the Proposition 172 sales-tax 
measure to pay for school crossing guards and additional police services. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, most of the $26 million generated from the tax this year will go 
toward the Todd Road jail under construction near Santa Paula, increases in 
sheriff's patrols and added staff at the district attorney's office. Although 
county officials argue that Thousand Oaks receives substantial benefit from all 
of these services, Schillo disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is we got screwed with Proposition 172 in Thousand Oaks," he said, 
adding that his city has been forced to pick up the cost of providing school 
crossing guards. "For me to be for the county when the citizens I represent are 
getting screwed is not my idea of fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 Although now guarded in her comments on Schillo, opponent and former county 
Supervisor Madge Schaefer has been particularly harsh in her attacks on the 
councilman over the years on the issue of county versus city responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In several letters to the editor, Schaefer has sought to "educate" Schillo, 
whom she referred to in one instance as the "Marie Antoinette of Thousand Oaks 
(minus the hair)," on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (county) has the responsibility for providing services of last resort for 
children, the aged, disabled, medically indigent, hungry and homeless," 
Schaefer, also a Thousand Oaks resident, wrote in one 1993 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Schillo) should learn compassion for those less fortunate and gratitude for 
the fact that he lives in a city that has few citizens in need. While his city 
was pondering whether to enter a city float in the Rose Parade, his county 
government was closing health clinics and making across-the-board cuts in 
county services." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he understands the county has responsibilities to provide 
services for the needy, and said that is why he supports the public hospital 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for it," he said, "and I don't think that's going to benefit anyone in 
Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo concedes he was hurt by remarks made by Supervisor Vicky Howard when 
he insisted his city receive a share of Proposition 172 money. Howard stated 
how she too had once served in city government, but learned that when she 
became a county supervisor she had assumed different responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sounded to me like you have to forget where you came from," Schillo 
said. "I'm not going to forget where I came from." Profile of Frank X. Schillo

ELECTIONS / CONGRESSIONAL RACES; SYBERT'S WEALTH GIVES HIM A CASH CUSHION IN 
24TH DISTRICT CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relying heavily on his own funds, businessman Richard Sybert is financially 
overwhelming his opponents in the race for the Republican nomination for the 
politically competitive seat held by U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson who moved to Woodland Hills last 
year, has loaned his campaign $430,000 of the $473,080 he has raised for the 
June 7 primary, according to campaign reports filed with the Federal Election 
Commission. These records reflect activity through March 31, the close of the 
most recent reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 His closest fund-raising competitor in the 24th Congressional District -- 
which includes most of Thousand Oaks -- is Robert K. Hammer, a Newbury Park 
investment-banking consultant who had garnered $70,367. His fund raising has 
been meager; he loaned himself $61,160 of that total. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have necessarily had to pay some attention to my primary opposition, but I 
don't consider it substantial and I do expect to win the primary," Sybert said. 
"I see my major opponent as Mr. Beilenson in the general election." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Ventura County congressional contest, the two Democrats seeking 
to oppose Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) made little initial fund-raising 
headway. Ventura attorney Kevin Ready, the only Democrat to file a report, had 
raised only $4,089 and had $635 on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who spent $862,061 to win reelection in the 23rd District in 1992, 
had a stockpile of $133,073. Representing all of Ventura County -- except 
Thousand Oaks -- as well as Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, he faced a 
vigorous challenge from Democrat Anita Perez Ferguson two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the Southern California recession and pervasive earthquake 
damage, this appears to be the year of the self-financed (and generally 
underfinanced) challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the 24th District, which runs from Sherman Oaks through the 
western San Fernando Valley to Malibu and Thousand Oaks, will be closely 
watched. Five Republicans, none especially well-known, are squaring off in a 
low-key contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who was Wilson's director of planning and research and is now 
president of a small Santa Barbara toy company, has racked up many endorsements 
while pumping large sums of his own money into his first election bid. He said 
he plans to spend $200,000 to $300,000 on numerous campaign mailings and, 
perhaps, radio and cable television advertising as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Republican primary, commercial real estate broker Emery Shane of 
Woodland Hills reported raising $48,631 this year, including $37,436 that he 
has loaned his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Boos Benhard of Woodland Hills, who owns a media-relations firm, reported 
raising $7,081 this year. He loaned his campaign $10,000 in December and 
another $500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park businessman Sang Korman, who poured more than $800,000 of his own 
funds into three previous unsuccessful Republican congressional bids, did not 
file a report. Korman is not waging an active campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his own largess, Sybert's fund raising has been modest as well. He 
brought in $8,000 from political action committees, including $3,000 from a PAC 
representing car dealers nationwide and $2,000 from the Lockheed Employees PAC 
in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of Sybert's 43 individual contributions and funds have come 
from outside the district, according to a review of his campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert emphasized his fund-raising success relative to the record of his 
opponents and insisted that many of his contributions came from within the 24th 
District. And he said he had delayed some fund-raising initiatives in the wake 
of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he acknowledged, "between the earthquake and the new higher tax rates 
that have really dried up a lot of discretionary income and the Southern 
California economy, fund raising is like pulling teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson cast Sybert's efforts in a less charitable light: "He's failed 
utterly thus far to show he has any real support other than his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer raised only $7,320 in the first three months of 1994 and spent $41,540 
during that period. He reported $10,177 on hand as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never enough money. Never enough time. Never enough resources," said 
Hammer, who touted his volunteer supporters. "We have made great gains with the 
resources we have. I think that's what people are looking for, not someone 
who's going to buy an election." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has sought no PAC money because candidates should not accept 
contributions from groups whose interests they may vote on. He said that his 
many years residing in the district -- in contrast to Sybert, who moved there 
last year to launch his candidacy -- and activism in Republican circles will 
overcome his spending disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get into six figures, I think you'll have a credible campaign," Hammer 
said. He predicted he'll be "close to or over that when all is said and done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson did little fund raising during the first three months of this year. 
He faces a nominal primary challenge from Scott Gaulke, a Sherman Oaks 
businessman who has run previously as a follower of political extremist Lyndon 
LaRouche. No report was available for Gaulke; candidates who raise or spend 
less than $5,000 are not required to file. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, a nine-term lawmaker, reported that he had $62,142 available. His 
campaign owes him $50,000, which he said he doesn't expect to be repaid. In 
addition, he said he has raised nearly $40,000 since the March 31 reporting 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, the third-ranking Democrat on the influential Rules Committee, 
spent $753,415 to win 56% of the vote in 1992 -- the first time he ran in the 
newly drawn "swing" district. The congressman, who does not take PAC money, 
said he was uncertain how much he'll need for the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on who wins the Republican primary," Beilenson said. "It depends 
on how much he is likely to have. I tend to be responsive." 
</P>
<P>
 The general election campaign is expected to attract a considerable flow of 
contributions as a nationally targeted race. Sybert has said he would need to 
spend $1 million to oust Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 23rd District, Ready, who is senior deputy counsel for Santa Barbara 
County, contributed $3,721 to his own campaign, received $300 in in-kind 
research from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and raised only 
$67 from other sources. His opponent, Ojai businessman Frank P. Stephenson, had 
no report on file. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't even been a candidate a month when I filed" the report, insisted 
Ready, who added that he has raised $4,000 since. "We've got enough to deal 
with this primary. Then we'll go in earnestly to start fund raising for the 
general election." 
</P>
<P>
 Ready previously ran for Congress in Iowa in 1984.

BODY OF MAN IS DISCOVERED IN EL RIO HOUSE

<P>
 The body of an unidentified man was discovered in a house on Simon Way in El 
Rio on Thursday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men discovered the man's body when they went to the house on the 800 
block of Simon Way about 6 p.m. to feed the dogs there, according to Sheriff's 
Lt. Craig Husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the condition of the body would indicate that a homicide has 
been committed," Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband declined to provide any further details about the condition of the 
body, and said there was no indication of how the man had been killed or how 
long he had been dead. J.E. MITCHELL

MAN TO UNDERGO PSYCHIATRIC TESTS BEFORE TRIAL IN SHOOTING OF BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura man accused of shooting and injuring a 14-year-old boy was found 
mentally incompetent and will undergo psychiatric treatment before he stands 
trial, a jury ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Adams, 21, who has already begun psychiatric treatment, was ordered by 
Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath to undergo further evaluation at Patton 
State Hospital in San Bernardino County, according to George Eskin, Adams' 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury found that he would not be capable of assisting in his own defense," 
Eskin said. "The jury felt, I believe, that this young man should be able to 
make a rational decision about where he is going to spend the rest of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams is accused of forcing his way into 14-year-old Kevin Natale's Ventura 
Keys home in January and firing several shots from a 9-millimeter handgun, 
hitting Kevin in the neck. He apparently was angry because the boy hit his car 
with a baseball while playing catch, prosecutors said. Kevin has been paralyzed 
from the neck down since the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams pleaded not guilty in January to charges of attempted first-degree 
murder and first-degree burglary and denied a special allegation that he used a 
firearm in the commission of a felony, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, he could receive 25 years to life in prison, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams wanted to change his plea to guilty, but Eskin said his client had not 
reached that decision rationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels that by pleading guilty he can keep his own demons to himself, and 
won't have to reveal them to anybody," Eskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eskin said Adams has been in a deep depression for more than a decade and has 
been suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just thinks he has figured out a way to have other people help him commit 
suicide by (sending him) to prison," Eskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams will undergo treatment, and he may be capable of standing trial in a few 
months, Eskin said.

NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH ON WHEELS PROPOSED FOR THOUSAND OAKS; CRIME: A BUSINESSMAN'S 
PLAN WOULD FURNISH CELLULAR PHONES TO HUNDREDS OF WORKERS WHO ARE ON THE ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to enlist local companies in the fight against crime, a Thousand Oaks 
businessman has proposed a new Neighborhood Watch program that would ask 
workers on the road to report crimes in progress.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan, presented to the Thousand Oaks City Council this week, would put 
cellular phones in the hands of hundreds of workers who drive around the city 
every day, said Lance Winslow, the owner and operator of a mobile carwash 
service.  
</P>
<P>
 "This week I read that we have the third safest city in the United States for 
its size," Winslow told the council. "That's great, but I have never been 
satisfied with third place." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members referred the suggestion to a committee, but agreed that the 
idea of recruiting private sector workers -- from plumbers to pool cleaners -- 
has promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could be the eyes and ears of the Police Department," Councilman Frank 
Schillo said. "It would be people doing their civic duty." 
</P>
<P>
 But creating a force of cellular-phone-toting civilians is not new to Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, local businessman Roger Pero brought the same suggestion to 
the council for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the support of the council and the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, 
no one was capable of recruiting enough businesses to get the program going. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were missing last time was a person who could put it all together," 
Schillo said. "I think (Winslow) may be able to pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow, who was involved in a long battle with the city on behalf of his 
mobile carwash business, said the idea of a mobile Neighborhood Watch force 
struck him after one of his trucks was vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a fairly safe place to live," he said. "But we should shoot 
for zero crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Local law enforcement officials said they met with Winslow about the plan and 
offered their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all had a chance to look it over and we think it's a good concept," 
said Senior Sheriff's Deputy Patti Dreyer, an officer with the department's 
crime prevention bureau for Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's great value in having members of the community be aware of 
suspicious behavior and calling it in," Dreyer said. "We can't always be where 
the crime is." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyer said the department agreed to meet with potential volunteers to train 
them how to identify crimes in progress and how to call the crimes in to the 
dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who said she would likely support the idea if it came 
back to the council, said she would want to ensure such training was a part of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to have some training," she said. "We certainly don't want 
residents going around thinking they're law enforcement officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow told the council he planned to bring the proposal back, and said he 
may ask for $1,500 to pay for signs that volunteers would display on their 
vehicles. He said a cellular phone company had offered to sell phones to the 
group at cost if the program was initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said for what the city would be getting, the price was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the cheapest police force you could imagine," Schillo said. "Spending 
$1,500 to pull that off would be great for the city."

THOUSAND OAKS SCHOOL BOARD SETS GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drawing on hundreds of suggestions by community members, Thousand Oaks school 
board members on Thursday drew up a list of long-range goals that emphasize 
campus safety, boosting student performance and finding new sources of funding, 
such as grants and business partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 In a freewheeling discussion at an afternoon workshop, members of the Conejo 
Valley Unified school board also focused on reducing class size, recruiting 
top-flight teachers and administrators, and improving school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals replace ones set in 1989 and provide a blueprint for education in 
the Conejo Valley. They will be used to set budget priorities and guide 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board's action Thursday came after months of meetings with parents, 
business leaders and community members. Technology -- including more computers 
in the classroom and a better use of high-tech equipment -- emerged as a 
priority at many of those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school board resisted setting a broad goal focusing solely on 
technology. Instead, board members agreed that it should fall under a broader 
priority that called for giving students "curriculum options" that would allow 
them to perform to their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members also agreed that offering programs for at-risk students -- from 
those with emotional difficulties to those with limited English -- should fall 
under the same broad heading. 
</P>
<P>
 While several board members praised school officials for trying to gather 
community opinions on the new goals, board member Richard Newman said he was 
troubled that so few people had participated in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're making false assumptions based on who talks the loudest and who 
shows up at 6 o'clock versus 6:20 (p.m.)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to formally adopt the goals at a future meeting.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY ECONOMY OUTPERFORMS COUNTY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley economy has fared better than that of the rest of Los 
Angeles County, mainly because it has fewer of the defense industries that took 
the biggest hit during the recession, according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The San Gabriel Valley joblessness rate is 7.6%, while L.A. County's is 
9.9%," said Roger Conover, the study's author and director of the International 
MBA program at Azusa Pacific University. 
</P>
<P>
 "High-tech took a major hit, but the San Gabriel Valley only had 6% of all of 
the high-tech activity in the county," Conover said. "So when high-tech 
employment decreased by a third between 1990 and '93, the San Gabriel Valley 
didn't suffer much loss from that." 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley businesses suffered job losses attributable more to a 
downturn in the normal business cycle -- jobs that are more likely to come back 
once a recovery starts in the region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A greater share of jobs in the area are in services and retail than in the 
county, the study found. Already, employment levels in the valley are on the 
upswing, with health care particularly strong, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was prepared for the San Gabriel Valley Commerce and Cities 
Consortium Economic Outlook conference in Industry Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first phase of an attempt to monitor the economic conditions in the 
valley, which encompasses about 30 municipalities, about 1.5 million people and 
a gross output of $180 billion to $200 billion, Conover said. PATRICK LEE

COLUMN ONE; WHEN THE PROSECUTOR IS GUILTY; A FLURRY OF MISCONDUCT CLAIMS HAS 
RAISED CONCERN ABOUT ROGUE GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS WHO BREAK THE RULES TO WIN 
CONVICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in the so-called Goldfish heroin case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Eric Swenson 
toasted his star witness, Wang Zong Xiao, at a banquet held by Chinese police 
in Shanghai. The moment was historic; the mood buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the People's Republic of China and the United States were 
working together to staunch the flow of narcotics from Asia. But Swenson, the 
federal prosecutor who would try the high-profile case in San Francisco, might 
just as well have raised a glass of brandy to his own failure. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of hearings, U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick ruled in 
October that Swenson illegally covered up important evidence that cast serious 
doubt on his case. The evidence indicated that before Xiao was flown to San 
Francisco to testify, Chinese detectives tortured him for days, obtaining 
statements that grew more incriminating with each poke of an electric cattle 
prod. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as devastating to the government's case was Orrick's other main 
conclusion: When Xiao created an international furor by revealing in court that 
he had been tortured, the prosecution illegally tried to deport him to China 
where, the judge believed, Xiao would have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the 51-year-old prosecutor has been on administrative leave 
pending the outcome of a Justice Department investigation. "The facts show such 
clear, flagrant and shameful constitutional violations that they shock the 
conscience of the court," Orrick said in a 59-page ruling that blocked Xiao's 
deportation and excoriated the government's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson and his colleagues are supposed to wear the white hats in the criminal 
justice system as the impartial seekers of truth and fairness -- not just 
guilty verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most federal and state prosecutors do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 But judging by a flurry of court rulings in recent years, unethical behavior 
by prosecutors is becoming a significant legal issue and a source of 
embarrassment for U.S. and district attorneys whose prosecutors have been hit 
with misconduct findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most disturbing developments in the last 20 years," said 
Pace University law professor Bennett L. Gershman, a former state prosecutor in 
New York who has written extensively about the ethics of those entrusted with 
prosecuting crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred by the courts or the threat of professional discipline, more and 
more advocates for the people have become the legal profession's rogues, 
Gershman and other scholars say. Their botched prosecutions, they say, have 
squandered law enforcement resources, wasted millions of taxpayers' dollars on 
cases that had to be retried, and threatened the constitutional right to a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors say that serious ethical breaches do not happen very often, 
and the rash of complaints is partly caused by defense attorneys more 
aggressively seeking tactical advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our ethics have been reduced," said San Diego County Chief 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian E. Michaels, a longtime member of the California 
District Attorneys Assn. ethics committee. "There may be more sensitivity to 
this today. That is why more of this is getting caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Such unethical behavior is known as "prosecutorial misconduct." It refers to 
any act that gives the government an unfair advantage in a criminal case or 
interferes with a defendant's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the playing field level, the law demands that prosecutors be more than 
mere advocates for one side. Unlike the defense, they must reveal unfavorable 
aspects of their cases to opponents, especially evidence pointing to innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 As a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision put it almost 60 years ago, the 
prosecution's role "is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be 
done. . . . While (prosecutors) may strike hard blows, (they) are not at 
liberty to strike foul ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals courts have ruled that prosecutors cannot distort evidence or present 
false information, deliberately or inadvertently. Personal attacks on the 
defense in front of a jury are not allowed, nor is any tactic, like allusion to 
the Bible, that encourages jurors to decide cases on factors unrelated to the 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors can't call the opposing lawyer a "slob" or the defendant 
"egg-sucking, chicken-killing gutter trash." Judges have chided prosecutors for 
using such language within earshot of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Digressions from the rules are wide-ranging, and they can have various impacts 
on the outcome of a criminal case. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two Orange County murder convictions, obtained during a costly three-week 
trial in 1991, were overturned last year because the prosecution withheld from 
the defense a witness' statements that tended to exonerate the accused. In 
February, an appeals court cited the same deputy district attorney, Jeoffrey L. 
Robinson, for misconduct during the trial of a surgeon convicted of attacking 
actor John Wayne's daughter. The verdict was reversed partly because of the 
prosecutor's litany of improper suggestions to the jury that the defense 
attorney had fed them a pack of lies. Robinson, who has since gone into private 
practice, has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Bakersfield, an appeals court concluded in 1990 that it would "take 
literally hundreds of pages to list the misconduct" of Kern County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Andrew Gindes, who prosecuted a complicated child molestation case 
involving seven victims. The court cited Gindes for personal attacks on the 
defense, improper questioning of witnesses and trying to get inadmissible 
evidence before the jury. The convictions of all five defendants, some of whom 
received 300-year sentences, were thrown out, and the case was never retried. 
Gindes, who is no longer with the district attorney's office, could not be 
located for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles County Grand Jury concluded in 1990 that for years the 
district attorney's office tolerated suspected perjury by jailhouse informants 
as a way to win cases, including murder trials. Often, deals made with 
informants in exchange for their testimony were concealed from judges or 
juries. Assistant Dist. Atty. Dan Murphy said the office disagreed with the 
grand jury's findings. Although new safeguards were developed for using 
informants, he said, the office agreed to retrials in only a few cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * A former Imperial County deputy district attorney admitted having an affair 
with a key witness while prosecuting a much-publicized attempted murder case 
from El Centro. The witness was the girlfriend of one of the defendants. It was 
"a sordid little scenario," state appeals court justices said in a decision. No 
convictions were reversed, because a lower court judge went to great lengths to 
uncover the transgressions before trial, enabling the defense to use the tryst 
to challenge the woman's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the court cases, a San Diego County Grand Jury is investigating the 
district attorney's handling of a controversial child molestation case that 
ended in the acquittal of Dale Akiki last year. Dist. Atty. Ed Miller faces 
accusations that he filed charges at the behest of a prominent San Diego 
businessman who was related to one of the alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, his office has been accused of withholding evidence from the 
defense indicating that another person might have committed the crimes. The 
person was a convicted child molester and a co-worker of Akiki at a church day 
care center. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Miller said there were doubts that the other person was 
responsible for the crimes and that the district attorney decided to proceed 
with the case well before discussing the matter with the businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, a spate of recent misconduct findings in several high-profile 
federal cases helped prompt U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to review Justice 
Department procedures for handling complaints about its lawyers. Although Reno 
defends the integrity of the government's attorneys, she vowed to make the 
system more open and to add staff to handle a backlog of formal complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 She was reacting to increasing concerns raised by judges, defense lawyers and 
Congress about what they thought was misconduct by federal prosecutors, and a 
failure of the Justice Department to thoroughly investigate misconduct 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most flagrant example to come to light, Justice Department 
lawyers were shown to have concealed evidence for 12 years that eventually 
exonerated John Demjanjuk, a retired Cleveland auto worker who had been found 
guilty in Israel of being "Ivan the Terrible," a Nazi concentration camp guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence, along with a memo warning of unethical behavior in the case, was 
never turned over to the defense or to Israeli prosecutors, who discovered its 
existence only after Demjanjuk was sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Idaho to Chicago to San Francisco these cases are popping up all over 
the country," said U.S. District Judge James Ideman, who found that government 
attorneys had used a known perjurer to obtain a grand jury indictment in a Los 
Angeles racketeering case three years ago. "The thinking of some of us on the 
bench is perhaps this is a symptom of a Justice Department that is out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 A computer count of published decisions by the state Supreme Court, state 
appeals courts and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals indicates that 
prosecutorial misconduct has been raised as an issue on appeal more than ever 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 In state courts, about 75% of appeals alleging misconduct over the last 50 
years have been filed since 1980. The U.S. 9th Circuit addressed more cases 
from California containing misconduct allegations from 1991 to 1994 than in the 
entire previous decade. From 1980 to 1990, there were about 100; from 1991 to 
the present, about 140. 
</P>
<P>
 An electronic search could not determine how often allegations were sustained. 
But appeals court records show that convictions are upheld in the vast majority 
of cases that contain misconduct as at least one issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A national study of 400 people wrongfully convicted of death penalty offenses 
over the last 50 years found that about 15% to 20% of the cases involved 
unethical and illegal conduct by prosecutors, including subornation of perjury 
and mishandling evidence. Northeastern University in Massachusetts published 
the study in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 State Bar of California officials say they have seen a slight increase in 
complaints against prosecutors, but they attribute the increase to a 1990 law 
requiring state courts to report attorney wrongdoing that results in reversals 
or judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the latest available statistics from the Justice Department show 
that the number of misconduct complaints rose from 95 in 1987 to 114 in 1990, a 
20% increase. But the number dropped to 61 for the first nine months of 1991. 
Officials say the majority of complaints involve prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers suspect that considerable misconduct, especially failure to 
disclose evidence favorable to the accused, goes undetected. What surfaces does 
so almost by accident or because of an anonymous tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal scholars blame the situation on many things, from overzealousness in a 
good cause to a win-at-all-costs attitude that, some veteran attorneys say, is 
more prevalent than it was 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 High on the list of explanations is an arrogance resulting from the enormous 
power Congress and state governments have bestowed on prosecutors since the 
1970s to fight drug trafficking and white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
 That has coincided with attempts by the federal government to exempt its 
prosecutors from state rules of professional conduct, and court decisions that 
have upheld laws protecting prosecutors from civil lawsuits for certain types 
of unethical behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this, said Pace University's Gershman, has created a special class of 
attorney, often immune from professional discipline or liability except in the 
most heinous cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, appeals courts have found serious misconduct, but have been 
hesitant to overturn the verdicts because the evidence appears strong enough to 
support a conviction. Such situations are known as "harmless error." Some say 
it has created an incentive for prosecutors to push the envelope of acceptable 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can win cases with misconduct, why not take the chance of losing on 
appeal once in a while," said Santa Ana defense lawyer William J. Kopeny, who 
estimates that about 40% of his appeals involve misconduct allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 15 state and federal prosecutors found by California trial judges and 
appeals courts to have committed serious misconduct since 1980, nine have come 
under investigation by the State Bar. Two cases remain open. Six did not result 
in any discipline serious enough to be disclosed to the public, although the 
Bar can privately warn attorneys, put them on informal probation or require 
them to take ethics courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The only one publicly disciplined was former San Diego County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. L. Forrest Price, who received a two-year suspension in 1982. Price 
altered taxi records to make it appear that a driver had dropped off the 
accused in the area where two murders occurred. He tried to cover up his 
actions by offering the defendant a lower sentence if he would drop his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 State Bar officials recommended that Price be disbarred, but state Supreme 
Court justices decided to suspend him, noting that he had been under stress 
from working long hours for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the enormous power of prosecutors, the State Bar should have its 
antenna out for prosecutorial misconduct -- but I don't think it does," said 
Robert C. Fellmeth, a professor at the University of San Diego Law School, who 
led the effort to reform attorney discipline in California. "I would like a 
system where if attorneys lied, something would happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and State Bar officials say the Price case, and recent court 
findings of misconduct, show that the system works well in ferreting out 
unethical behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics "ignore the penalties that occur when serious misconduct is 
found," said Michaels of the San Diego County district attorney's office. "I 
have seen severe sanctions imposed. There are cases where prosecutors have been 
terminated. If you ever wanted to be a judge, kiss your application goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors across the state also say that much has been done in the last 20 
years to ensure that convictions are obtained fairly. Ethics courses are 
required each year, and manuals and hot lines have been made available by the 
California District Attorney's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office created a 
professional responsibility unit to hold ethics seminars and advise deputy 
district attorneys. As the only office of its kind in the state, it has turned 
into a resource for prosecutors across California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we have ethics courses, better training and a vastly improved 
disciplinary system," said Robert P. Heflin, the chief trial counsel for the 
State Bar of California. "Twenty-five years ago when I started practicing law, 
this stuff was not going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some law professors and leaders in the defense bar believe that more needs 
to be done. Some say that prosecutors need better training, and the power to 
discipline prosecutors should be removed from state bar associations and given 
to an independent agency that would work like a police review board, or the 
state commissions that investigate misconduct by judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ought to be a national summit conference on this," said John Henry 
Hingson III, an Oregon attorney who is president of the National Assn. of 
Criminal Defense Lawyers. "We have been shouting at each other for too long. 
There is distrust on both sides."

OFFICER DETAILS SUSPECT'S CONFESSION IN KLAAS CASE; COURTS: DETECTIVE TESTIFIES 
THAT RICHARD DAVIS SAID HE STRANGLED THE GIRL TO AVOID IMPRISONMENT FOR 
KIDNAPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Allen Davis said he abducted Polly Klaas during a drug-induced haze 
and strangled her to "cover his tracks" because he knew a kidnaping conviction 
would land him back in state prison, according to dramatic testimony presented 
by a Petaluma police detective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mike Meese, who interviewed Davis after his arrest in December, said 
Davis told him he snatched Polly at random after drinking two quarts of beer 
and smoking a marijuana cigarette Davis believes was laced with PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoned and unsure what to do once he had the girl in his car, Davis said he 
stopped on a remote private road to think, stashing Polly -- whom he said he 
had untied -- on a wooded slope nearby. A short time later, two sheriff's 
deputies questioned Davis after a homeowner reported him trespassing, and Davis 
said he was surprised that Polly had not run down the hill and blown his cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the deputies -- unaware of the kidnaping -- helped Davis free his car 
from a ditch and ordered him to leave the area. Davis said he returned 30 
minutes later to retrieve Polly and drove to Cloverdale, stopping near an 
abandoned lumber mill. Soon after, he said, he used a strip of cloth to 
strangle Polly and tossed her body in some berry bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 At times during his interview, Davis seemed remorseful, Meese said, and once 
became tearful. But when the detective patted him on the shoulder, Davis said: 
"You don't got to show me no consideration or no respect. I know I'm a piece 
of. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's testimony marked the first public account of Davis' confession, 
revealing details of what might have happened to 12-year-old Polly after she 
was taken from her bedroom at knifepoint during a sleep-over with two friends 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony came on the third day of a hearing to determine whether there is 
enough evidence to place Davis, 39, on trial for Polly's death. Davis is 
charged with nine criminal counts and could face the death penalty if he is 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the charges is one accusing Davis of attempting to commit a lewd act on 
a child. Davis told Meese he did not believe he tried to assault Polly but 
admitted he was "hazy" on the matter. A condom was found where Davis said he 
stashed Polly in the woods, and witnesses who examined her body said her skirt 
had been pulled up. Scientific tests were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Polly's grandfather called the bulk of Davis' 
confession "garbage" and the fabrication of a "psychopath." Joe Klaas said 
Polly would never have remained silent in the woods, awaiting the return of her 
abductor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe for a second that Polly was alive on that hillside," Klaas 
said. "He knew somebody would come along and so he killed her to get rid of her 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Police have also expressed doubts about that aspect of Davis' story, but the 
prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Jacobs, did not reveal his theory about 
what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs did, however, challenge Davis' assertion that drugs had made him 
spontaneously kidnap Polly. Testimony presented this week showed that Polly and 
her two girlfriends were tied up with carefully cut strips of fabric brought 
into the Klaas home, and that a cloth hood was made and used to cover Polly's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis gave his confession Dec. 4, shortly after his arrest on an Indian 
reservation in Mendocino County. Recalling the events of Oct. 1, he told Meese 
he got a pass from the halfway house where he lived in San Mateo and drove to 
Petaluma, intending to see his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 When he could not find his mother's address in the Petaluma phone book, Davis 
said, he went to a park, drank some beer and bought a joint from some peddlers. 
After smoking the joint, he said, "things got fuzzy and hazy," and he somehow 
wound up in Polly's house. The next thing he knew, Davis said, he was driving 
down the road with Polly tied up in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 After his encounter with the deputies, Davis said he drove north on U.S. 101 
and stopped at a gas station, where Polly used the restroom. At one point, he 
said, he was passed by sheriff's deputies who looked in his Pinto but 
apparently did not see Polly on the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Cloverdale, Davis said, he pondered how to get out of his fix. "I 
figured, well, I gotta do something (to avoid returning to prison). . . . The 
only thing I had to do was get rid of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Polly died quickly and did not suffer. He said he strangled her 
because he knew that method caused victims to pass out quickly, a fact he 
learned after he once tried to hang himself in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 After covering Polly's body with a piece of plywood, Davis said, he returned 
to San Mateo and shaved his beard. When a composite sketch of the kidnaping 
suspect was released in the days that followed, Davis said he was surprised his 
parole officer did not connect it with him. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony Thursday, a Sonoma County pathologist said pieces of rope 
and cloth found in Polly's hair indicated that she had been strangled. A.J. 
Chapman also said that Polly's badly decomposed body was found fully clothed 
but that there were numerous tears on her skirt, shirt and underpants -- tears 
that might have been caused by animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert P. Dale said he would make a ruling today.

O.C. TOLLWAY'S TAKEOVER OF ROAD MAY BE ILLEGAL; STUDY: NON-BINDING RULING SAYS 
HEARINGS, IMPACT REPORT WERE NEEDED BEFORE TRANSFER OF NEWPORT COAST DRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County and tollway agency officials apparently broke state law when 
they incorporated part of a public road into a tollway without first conducting 
hearings and filing an environmental report, according to an opinion by the 
legislative counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The written opinion, released Thursday, was offered in response to a request 
from Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who had asked the counsel to 
study the legality of turning a three-mile segment of Newport Coast Drive into 
a toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of whether the county was required to hold public hearings before 
giving away Newport Coast Drive and whether the San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor Agency needed to file a new environmental impact report 
as a result are not new. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stockstill, spokesman for the tollway agencies, said the issues already 
have been addressed and expressed confidence that the legislative counsel's 
opinion would not affect the San Joaquin Hills toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion by the legislative counsel, the office that researches legal 
issues for members of the Assembly, is not binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Coast Drive is a county road used by motorists without charge. The 
county agreed to turn over part of the road to the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, which are building the San Joaquin Hills tollway and two other toll 
roads in the county. When completed, the San Joaquin Hills tollway, including 
the disputed section of Newport Coast Drive, will stretch 17 miles from San 
Juan Capistrano north to Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative counsel opinion said the Board of Supervisors had the 
authority to give the county-owned road to the tollway authority. However, the 
transfer could not occur without the board first holding public hearings, at 
which the public would have to be told that the road was being abandoned 
because it is "unnecessary for present or prospective use." 
</P>
<P>
 "The board didn't do this," Ferguson said. "The county transferred Newport 
Coast Drive (to the tollway agency) by voting on it as part of the consent 
calendar and without public notice or hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Councilman Phil Sansone, a critic of the county's decision to 
give the road to the tollway agency, said he was not surprised by the counsel's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no specific public hearings to incorporate that portion of the 
road into the tollway," Sansone said. "There were generalized hearings on the 
environmental report, but nothing specific to the issue of giving Newport Coast 
Drive to the agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Converting the county road to a tollway also robs the public of the right to 
use the road, the legislative counsel opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conversion of a county highway to a toll road effectively terminates the 
general public's unconditional right to use the highway, since use of the toll 
road is restricted to a particular class of motorists," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the opinion said, the county's decision to abandon the road and 
convey it to the tollway agency is, in legal terms, a "project" that requires a 
new environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's action may result in that highway carrying a different volume 
than before," the opinion said. "If it is concluded that the adverse or 
beneficial impacts of that traffic . . . will have a significant effect on the 
environment, it would be necessary to prepare (an environmental impact 
report)." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill downplayed the significance of the legislative counsel's opinion. 
The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency is confident it followed 
the letter of the law in incorporating Newport Coast Drive into the toll road, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The counsel seems to agree with us on virtually every point, except on the 
very narrow question of what constitutes an abandonment by the county of a 
public road," said Stockstill, who received a copy of the opinion. "Obviously, 
we don't agree that the county simply abandoned the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the county's plan to extend Newport Coast Drive to Bonita Canyon 
Drive will make the issue moot, he added. The counsel's opinion said that the 
county could avoid the need for a public hearing and environmental report if a 
public road running parallel to the disputed section of Newport Coast Drive 
were built. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sansone said the county has not decided on a route for the proposed 
extension because of opposition from local groups, who do not want the road 
built in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the legislative counsel's finding that a new environmental report is 
needed, Stockstill said the disputed section of Newport Coast Drive was 
included in the environmental impact report adopted by the agency in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said that today he will ask the county to hold hearings on the 
transfer of the road and that the tollway agency file a new environmental 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, they would better serve the public if they backed up and do 
that now," he said. "We would save the taxpayers millions in potential 
lawsuits, which could delay construction. It would be better if the county 
admitted they made a mistake and hold the hearings."

CONGRESS BANS ANTI-ABORTION HARASSMENT; LEGISLATION: SENATE'S 69-30 VOTE SENDS 
MEASURE TO CLINTON. ADVOCATES POINT TO RISE OF 'VIGILANTE EXTREMISM' AT 
CLINICS, BUT FOES SEE MOVE TO SUPPRESS PEACEFUL PROTESTS.

 Reacting to bombings, arson and even murder at abortion clinics over the last 
decade, Congress gave final approval Thursday to a bill banning blockades, 
violence and intimidation against clinics, their staffs and women who use them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted, 69 to 30, to send the measure to President Clinton, who is 
expected to sign it soon. It will take effect immediately after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This legislation is a major victory for women and for women's rights," said 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). "For the first time, Congress has passed a 
law to protect a woman's constitutional right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Rescue, sponsor of many anti-abortion protests across the country, 
reacted with outrage. "Just as politicians 144 years ago made rescuing slaves a 
federal felony, politicians have made rescuing pre-born children and their 
mothers from abortionists a federal felony," said the group's executive 
director, Flip Benham. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the bill contended that violence at anti-abortion protests has 
escalated in recent years. By their count, such activities were responsible for 
more than 1,000 violent acts between 1977 and early 1993, including 36 
bombings, 81 cases of arson, 131 death threats, 84 assaults and the slaying of 
Dr. David Gunn in Florida in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are examples of vigilante extremism," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.). "This is not rhetoric," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). "We 
cannot tolerate violence." Both voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents argued that violent acts can already be punished under state 
laws, and they denounced the bill as an unconstitutional effort to suppress 
peaceful anti-abortion demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this bill does is aim the full force of the federal criminal system 
against a class of Americans who feel passionately about one of the key moral 
questions of our time," said Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two Democrats and 17 Republicans voted for the measure, while three 
Democrats and 27 Republicans voted against it. The House approved the bill last 
week on a 241-174 roll call. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, both the Senate and the House approved bills to protect access 
to abortion clinics after the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts could not 
issue injunctions against clinic blockades under an 1871 law originally aimed 
at activities of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court is now considering a challenge to a state court order creating 
"buffer zones" around an abortion clinic and the homes of clinic staff members. 
Unlike the measure passed Thursday, however, the court order prohibits 
demonstrators from assembling near clinics even if they are not blocking 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court's decision in that case could provide guidance to federal 
courts that might later be asked to issue injunctions against unlawful 
activities around abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed Thursday would make it a federal crime to obstruct access to 
an abortion clinic or to damage such a facility. It also would be a federal 
offense to use force, the threat of force or physical obstruction to intimidate 
or interfere with anyone seeking an abortion or any reproductive health 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents attempting to influence a minor child going to an abortion clinic 
would be exempted from provisions of the bill, however. The legislation also 
would exempt peaceful picketing or other demonstrations protected by the First 
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 It would provide both civil and criminal penalties for violators. Nonviolent 
obstruction of a clinic entrance would be penalized by a maximum six months in 
prison and a fine of $10,000, with a maximum $25,000 fine and 18 months in 
prison for a second conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent violators would face stiffer penalties, ranging up to $100,000 in 
fines and one year in prison for a first offense and fines up to $250,000 and 
three years in prison for a second conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximum sentences would be increased to a 10-year prison sentence if the 
offense resulted in bodily injury and life imprisonment if death results. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill would allow providers of abortion services or those 
seeking to use them to file civil suits for injunctions to halt the activity or 
to seek compensatory and punitive damages. Federal and state governments also 
would be allowed to seek injunctions against violations and civil penalties up 
to $10,000 for the first offense and up to $15,000 for a second offense.

NEWS ANALYSIS; THE CREDITS AND DEBITS OF KATHLEEN BROWN, TREASURER; POLITICS: 
SHE IS SEEN AS INFORMED, VIGILANT. BUT MUCH OF HER RECORD RESTS ON ECONOMIC 
FACTORS BEYOND HER CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kathleen Brown was running for state treasurer four years ago, she 
unleashed a withering attack against her predecessor, Tom Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking with her own blend of charm and tough-minded confidence, she turned 
their televised 1990 debate into a death blow to Hayes' election chances. 
</P>
<P>
 She blamed him for a "backlog" of billions of dollars in un-issued state 
bonds; for earning a lower interest rate on a multibillion-dollar pool of state 
money than earlier treasurers; for the political activities of his chief of 
staff, and for his failure to rid the state's largest pension fund of hundreds 
of millions of dollars in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, four years later, Brown is running for governor with the theme "America's 
best treasurer to revive America's worst economy." 
</P>
<P>
 But just how good a treasurer has Kathleen Brown been? And how does she 
compare to her predecessor? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claims to have breathed new life into a lethargic branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I am most proud of is reviving the treasurer's office from what had 
become a sleepy bureaucratic backwater and making it a leader in financial 
management and prudent but proactive investment strategies," she said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet measured by the same standards that she held Tom Hayes to, her record is 
decidedly mixed: 
</P>
<P>
 * There continues to be a backlog of approved but un-issued state bonds -- 
$6.2 billion as of March 31 -- whittled down from the $7 billion figure that 
she used to bludgeon Hayes in 1990. However, the Brown-era gap could double if 
voters approve the $5.9 billion in bonds on the June ballot and perhaps more in 
November. In fact, there is always a delay, sometimes of several years, between 
voter approval and bond sales, no matter who is treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings on investments have plummeted, because interest rates generally 
have dropped. Today, the $26-billion pool of idle state and local government 
funds is earning only about 4.5%. In the Hayes era, a smaller pool was earning 
returns of more than 8.5%. Brown now boasts that the $4 billion earned in her 
first three years is "a state record." But in a three-year span, her immediate 
predecessors earned close to $5 billion. In her attack on Hayes, Brown charged 
that Orange County's $7.5-billion investment pool had outperformed the state 
fund. That continues to be true now that Brown is managing the state's 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown charged that Hayes' top deputy, the late B.T. Collins, was actively 
involved in running his campaign. However, soon after she was elected, she 
named her own campaign manager and onetime fund raiser, Beverly Thomas, as 
assistant treasurer. Although it is common for politicians to name campaign 
aides to high posts, sources say that Thomas was instrumental in starting up 
Brown's race for governor. Thomas denies any campaign role and says she is only 
one of many to whom Brown turns for political advice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Within months of taking office, Brown kept her campaign promise and pushed 
the Public Employees' Retirement System board to sell off $434 million in 
high-yield or "junk" bonds. The $80-billion fund liquidated the bonds, taking a 
$50-million loss. Some board members concede that the loss could have been 
reduced if the pension system had held the bonds longer. "You never know how 
the market will turn out," said board member Charles Valdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's claim to being "America's best treasurer" -- a flourish of campaign 
rhetoric -- is based on an award she received last year as one of the country's 
"most valuable public officials" from the now-defunct bimonthly newspaper City 
& State. Among earlier winners was Los Angeles County Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard B. Dixon, who was forced to resign from office under a cloud a 
few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Former City & State editor Ellen Shubart credits Brown with bringing vigor and 
innovation to her elected office. But in an interview, she expressed surprise 
at Brown's claim. "I would hesitate to say that any one who won any award was 
the best," Shubart said. 
</P>
<P>
 As treasurer, Brown serves as the state's banker -- cashing the state's 
checks, investing idle funds, and borrowing money by issuing bonds to operate 
state government and build offices and highways. She also sits on the boards of 
the mammoth public employees and teachers retirement systems, as well as dozens 
of other boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an important job and it carries with it the power to award millions of 
dollars in state business. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, in many respects, the performance of the treasurer's office is 
outside the control of the officeholder. Return on investments and bond 
interest rates rise and fall with the economy, and are affected by decisions 
about the state's budget hammered out in the Capitol between the governor and 
the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Key operations of the treasurer's office -- investments and bond sales -- 
remain in the hands of civil servants installed in their jobs by the late Jesse 
Unruh, who piloted the office into the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has nonetheless claimed credit for "historically low interest rates" on 
state bond issues, even though those rates reflect a nationwide drop during her 
brief tenure in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Willard Scott taking credit for the weather," said Gov. Pete 
Wilson's campaign press secretary, Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 In her campaign ads and in press releases, Brown also has been crowing about 
the jobs created by the $12 billion in bonds she has sold in her 40 months in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as treasurer, Brown merely sells the bonds. Each bond issue must 
first be approved by the Legislature and governor -- and often requires a vote 
of the people as well. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has taken credit for defending the state's credit rating -- avoiding 
a drop from AAA in her initial year in office during the first of a series of 
state budget crises. She has met regularly with the New York-based rating 
agencies ever since, describing the financial problems facing the state, but 
with less success. All three major rating agencies have taken California bonds 
down a few notches. Standard & Poor's now ranks California as A+ -- near the 
bottom of the states. 
</P>
<P>
 No one suggests that the fall from the highest rank is Brown's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the story for the state of California has been the recession," said 
David MacEwen, who manages government bond portfolios for the Benham Group, a 
mutual fund that buys a sizable volume of state bonds. "There's no way to 
correlate that with her job as treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do business with her office -- underwriters, investors and credit 
rating agency representatives -- praise the 48-year-old Brown for her 
knowledge, accessibility and strong appointments to key posts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Brown spoke with authority about the functions of her office 
and the continual need for vigilance in protecting the interests of taxpayers, 
particularly when dealing with the investment bankers who sell the state's 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bankers run on a fear and greed continuum," she said. "If you neglect the 
fear (of losing the state's business), the greed takes over." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her accomplishments and innovations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dedicating a portion of the $26 billion in idle state and local funds she 
controls to investments in California home mortgages and small businesses. 
Calling it the Cal-Vest program, Brown has directed $695 million to purchase 
California mortgages -- enough for 5,000 homes and apartments -- and $80 
million to cover loans for about 200 small businesses, most of them in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Changing the way the state borrows money each year to tide it through 
periods of cash shortages. Instead of borrowing all the money at a single flat 
rate, she has borrowed a portion at a lower, variable rate. Last year, when the 
state borrowed $2 billion in this way, taxpayers saved several hundred thousand 
dollars on the deal. In other years the savings has been as much as $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spreading out the treasurer's office bond sale and investment business to 
include firms headed by minorities, women and disabled veterans. State law sets 
a goal of 23% of bond sale fees going to such firms. Last year, Brown saw to it 
that 21% reached the targeted businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, like Hayes before her, boasts of making the selection of underwriters 
on major bond issues "competitive," although only certain bonds are sold to the 
highest bidder among competing syndicates of investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, Brown chooses among competing firms after reviewing 
qualifications, but without any formal bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such competition by qualifications, Brown replaced Bank of America with 
New York-based Lehman Brothers as the managing underwriter on the annual 
short-term note sales. Over three years, the winning firm managed the sale of 
$20 billion in notes and collected $6 million in fees for its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and again in 1992, many of the largest investment banking firms in the 
country submitted statements of their qualifications along with estimates of 
their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer's office records show that the Lehman Brothers' estimates were 
higher than Bank of America and several other competitors both years. 
</P>
<P>
 And campaign records show that Lehman Brothers' West Coast managing director, 
Catherine Pfeiffenberger, personally contributed $4,000 to Brown's campaign 
from 1989 through 1992. Neither Pfeiffenberger nor a Lehman Brothers spokesman 
would comment on the firm's efforts to win state business. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown vigorously defended Pfeiffenberger and Lehman Brothers and denied that 
contributions played a role. "She's one of the best bankers in the business," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown announced her decision to return the business to Bank of America 
after a similar competition this year, she declared, "I am continuing my 
commitment to keep California dollars working for us here at home." 
</P>
<P>
 If it was important to place the business with a California firm, why had she 
taken the business away from Bank of America three years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that she shifted the business because the bank "had not done a good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a strict grader," she said. "I'm very tough on investment bankers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was the first California treasurer to hire an outside firm as financial 
adviser on bond deals, making the selection after reviewing qualifications from 
a number of competitors. The business went to Public Resources Advisory Group 
-- a firm that has done similar work across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, investment bankers contacted by The Times said that the firm has 
performed well. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm and its principals contributed $11,900 to Brown's campaign -- much of 
it before the firm got the state's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her generally mild demeanor, Brown has exhibited a scrappiness at 
times -- some would call it peevishness -- in dealing with critics. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the issue was College Saver bonds -- which Brown has touted in 
press releases and public statements as a "carefree" way to save for a child's 
education. She has sold $70 million of the bonds, which were first marketed by 
her predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of financial planners contacted by The Times are critical of such 
bonds when used by families to save for a young child's college education. 
These experts say there are other long-term investments that stand a better 
chance of keeping up with college costs that have been rising twice as fast as 
the general rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, particularly with very young children, investors need to 
assume considerably more risk," said Jonathan Pond, a Boston-based financial 
planner and author. "I hate to be cynical," Pond said, "but it's a way for 
states in weakened financial situations to raise money from the unsophisticated 
investor." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1991, when Peter A. Roberts of the College Savings Bank of Princeton, 
N.J., took out ads attacking Brown and the College Saver bonds with similar 
arguments, the treasurer lashed out at him. (Roberts was making a pitch for 
federally insured certificates of deposit sold by his bank that are pegged to a 
college cost inflation index.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brown personally sent letters to publishing executives urging them to stop 
running the ads she found offensive. Newsweek pulled one of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wall Street Journal told her in a letter that "our readers are astute 
enough to make their own decision." 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Brown scrawled the words "wimp out" across the letter, according to 
her testimony in a related court case. In the same case, she was asked what her 
reaction was to Roberts' ads. Responded Brown, "It made me really grumpy."

SENATE VOTES SHOW SPLIT ON ARMS TO BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In contradictory votes underscoring the extent to which lawmakers remain 
divided over the bitter war raging in the Balkans, the Senate narrowly passed 
legislation on Thursday that calls for lifting the arms embargo against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote showed the growing discontent with the Clinton Administration's 
handling of the Bosnian crisis: 13 Democrats sided with the Republican 
initiative as the senators voted 50 to 49 for an amendment ordering the 
President to unilaterally lift the U.N.-imposed embargo, even if North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization allies do not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "strong message" that disaffected Democrats said they wanted to send 
to Clinton was a muddled one -- senators, just before, had voted by an 
identical 50-49 margin to endorse the President's position that the embargo 
should only be lifted with the consent of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, after weeks of closed-door negotiations and hours of often 
impassioned floor debate, two things were made clear by the Senate action, said 
a senior Senate foreign policy aide: "First, it is apparent that nobody likes 
what Clinton is doing when it comes to Bosnia. But second, it is just as clear 
that there is no consensus on what he ought to be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), is 
that "there is not going to be any unilateral action . . . to lift the embargo" 
to give the poorly armed Bosnian Muslims a chance to obtain the weapons they 
need to repel Bosnian Serb attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the legislation to which the amendments were attached is now 
flawed by conflicting directives, Mitchell said he sees "no chance of it 
becoming law." Before it can be sent to the President's desk, the measure also 
would have to win approval in the House, where Democratic leaders are expected 
to keep it from reaching the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the siege of Sarajevo in January, the Senate has been wrestling 
with American policy options in the Balkans. An increasing number of Democrats 
have joined Republicans in voicing dissatisfaction with an Administration 
policy they characterize as vacillating and vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the senators are nearly unanimous in wanting to see the embargo 
lifted, there is no consensus on whether it should be ended unilaterally or, as 
Clinton maintains, only if allied nations with peacekeeping troops on the 
ground in Bosnia give their consent. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest debate was triggered by an amendment sponsored by Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to lift the embargo unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing it would pass, Mitchell spent weeks trying to craft a substitute 
strong enough to keep disaffected Democrats in line without directly 
challenging the President. The alternative he finally offered directs Clinton 
to seek the allies' consent for ending the embargo and to report back to 
Congress on the possibility of lifting it unilaterally if they refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the lawmakers want to lift the embargo, the United States cannot do 
so unilaterally without inviting other countries to disregard other sanctions 
that Washington wants enforced, Mitchell said in arguing against Dole's 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't take the position that others must participate in multilateral 
actions but the United States alone can pick and choose," he said. "We can't 
have it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 But having it both ways was exactly what the Senate sought to do, as it 
approved the rival GOP and Democratic leadership alternatives by identical 
margins. Further mixing the message, eight senators, all of them Democrats, 
voted for both amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Sen. Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.), said he did so because he feared 
that Dole's amendment would lose and he thought that voting for Mitchell's 
amendment first would at least allow him to go on record as favoring an end to 
the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), said they voted with Dole because they 
wanted to send the Administration a "strong message" that its Bosnia policy has 
been "anemic" and that it "must do better" in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), who supports the Administration on Bosnia, said 
the mixed message the Senate ended up sending was anything but strong. "It 
shows you the ineptitude of the United States Senate at times in giving 
direction on foreign policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from America's allies was quick. Alain Juppe, the French foreign 
minister who was in Washington to confer with Administration policy-makers, 
warned that, if the United States were to lift the embargo unilaterally, it 
would end U.N. ground action and prompt a resumption of fighting in Bosnia  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems almost to me the worst solution," Juppe told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Juppe dismissed reports that Washington and Paris were split 
over what should be done in Bosnia, contending that the two governments were 
essentially in agreement on broad policy and "both think the time has come for 
a political settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that European governments might not be able politically to keep 
ground troops in the region much longer. "The time will come when the French 
public opinion . . . will ask, 'What are we doing in Bosnia?' " he said -- much 
as Americans did in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, a report from Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
urged the Security Council on Thursday to make it clear in new resolutions that 
U.N. peacekeepers could play only a limited role in protecting Bosnian "safe 
havens." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali's report betrayed his frustration over what he said is the 
attempt by Bosnian Muslims to use the U.N.-designated safe areas as havens in 
which to regroup and mount attacks against Bosnian Serbs. He also sees a 
worldwide impression that U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia were mainly assigned to 
repel Serbian aggression against the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeeping force, he insisted, "is neither structured nor equipped for 
combat and has never had sufficient resources, even with air support, to defend 
the safe areas against a deliberate attack or to hold ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Bosnia, he noted, the United Nations has "found itself in a 
situation where many safe areas were not safe, where their existence appeared 
to thwart only one army in the conflict, thus jeopardizing (the United 
Nations') impartiality, and where (the U.N.) role needed to be adequately 
defined in a manner that would be compatible with the rest of its mandate" -- 
protecting humanitarian relief and guiding the parties to a negotiated 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposed that the council redefine the safe areas to make it clear the 
intent "is primarily to protect people and not to defend territory and that 
(the United Nations') protection of these areas is not intended to make it a 
party to the conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 He also proposed that the council clearly set down realistic boundaries for 
the safe areas to ensure peacekeepers are not assigned to protect an area that 
is too large for them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, battlefronts across Bosnia heated up ahead of a key meeting of 
frustrated foreign states trying to stop two years of bloodshed. The Associated 
Press reported that a U.N. military observer was killed and another seriously 
wounded when they came under fire near Sarajevo, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In another reported violation of the 3-month-old truce in Sarajevo, a Bosnian 
Serb soldier was fatally shot near Vrbanja bridge, linking Serbian- and 
government-held parts of the city. There was no U.N. confirmation of the report 
by the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In northern Bosnia on Wednesday evening, mortar fire cut electricity to 
Serbian-held Brcko, in an east-west corridor vital to Serbian supply lines. 
Both Bosnian Serb and government media reported shelling in the area Thursday. 
Reported military buildups by both sides around Brcko have fed speculation 
about an impending major battle.

TIBETANS FEAR SUPPRESSION FROM CHINA IS DEEPENING; ASIA: BEIJING ALLEGEDLY 
CRACKS DOWN IN REGION, DESPITE U.S. CONDITIONS THAT IT SOFTEN STANCE OR LOSE 
TRADE BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Asked whether China has made progress in respecting human rights, Tibetan 
refugee Niyma Tsering points at his groin. 
</P>
<P>
 For two days last summer, he says, he was detained by Chinese state security 
agents in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, after taking part in a demonstration against 
rising prices. The agents fastened his hands behind his back by clamping his 
thumbs together with a "thumb cuff," then beat and kicked him in the stomach 
three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The lanky former shop employee touches the nape of his neck, then the trousers 
around his groin. "They shocked me here and there with electric cattle prods," 
Tsering, 25, says matter-of-factly, drawing on his cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled Lhasa by truck for southern Tibet in November, then walked for 14 days 
and nights through the snow-clad Himalayas to reach Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tibetan people live in extreme fear," Tsering said. "Their lives depend 
on the whims of top Chinese officials. If tomorrow they are told to shoot 1,000 
Tibetans, they will carry out the order blindly." 
</P>
<P>
 By June 3, President Clinton must decide whether to extend most-favored-nation 
status for China. In granting China those trade benefits last year, Clinton 
conditioned renewal on progress by the Beijing government in several areas of 
human rights, including preservation of Tibet's unique religious and cultural 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 In this north Indian city that has served since 1960 as the seat of the 
Tibetan government-in-exile, Tibetan officials, including the Dalai Lama 
himself, say that despite Clinton's requirements, the situation for Tibetans on 
the whole has worsened, not improved. A people's very survival is at stake, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is running out," said the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader 
of the Tibetans who fled to India 35 years ago after China crushed an abortive 
national uprising. The Beijing government's intent, he asserted in an 
interview, "is to suppress (Tibetans) completely and in the meantime to 
increase the Chinese population so that in a few years' time, the Tibetans 
become insignificant in their own land." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my friends call this the 'Final Solution' of the Tibet issue," the 
Dalai Lama said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, high-ranking Indian government officials say, China has been 
moving more troops into Tibet, including detachments that took part in the 
bloody suppression of the Tian An Men Square pro-democracy movement five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause, the Indians suggest, may be fears of widespread trouble on the May 
23 anniversary of the 1951 accord signed by the Tibetans under duress that 
legalized the "liberation" of their land by the invading Chinese Communist 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a massive influx of Chinese population," reports Pema Thinley, 
head of the human rights desk in the exile government's Department of 
Information and International Relations. "The immigrants are taking away 
economic opportunities, and the local population is getting marginalized. I 
think the population influx is the most serious human rights issue." 
</P>
<P>
 In a troubling new trend, Tibetan exile officials say, Chinese have been 
moving for the first time out of the cities to the countryside, where they are 
allegedly confiscating land from Tibetan peasants to start vegetable farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibetans say occupation of their harsh, mountainous land has led over the 
years to the deaths of 1.2 million Tibetans -- a sixth of the population -- as 
well as the destruction of more than 6,200 monasteries and wide-scale 
plundering of Tibet's cultural and natural treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent visitors and refugees who have reached Dharamsala tell of continuing 
brutal repression and torture. In 1993, 253 Tibetans were reportedly arrested 
for political offenses, in addition to about 400 already known to monitor 
groups, Thinley said. Countless other Tibetans are said to be imprisoned or in 
detention awaiting trial, including at Situ northeast of Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
 Most political offenders are reportedly held in Block No. 5 of Tibet 
Autonomous Region Prison No. 1 in Lhasa. Jigme Sangpo, an outspoken 
nationalist, has been in prison since 1964, Tibetan exiles say. In the past 
year, there has reportedly been a crackdown on nuns and monks, key figures in 
Tibet's traditionally Buddhist society. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 14 nuns already confined in Prison No. 1 received additional 
prison terms for composing a patriotic song and smuggling a cassette recording 
of it out of jail, exile officials say. One nun had nine more years tacked on 
to her existing eight-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Torture is said to be routine, an accusation repeated Thursday in a report by 
Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
 One escaped Chinese Communist Party official from eastern Tibet told 
Dharamsala exiles that 33 types of torture are still in use, including no fewer 
than four types of electric cattle prods. Prisoners have been held in cells 
whose metal floors have been flooded and jolts of electricity then passed 
through them. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is one way of simultaneously eradicating Tibetan culture and 
ensuring Chinese dominance. "In order to get a job, you must know Chinese," 
Thinley said. "In schools, after primary level, everything is taught in 
Chinese. To get a higher education, you have to know Chinese. All modern 
subjects are taught in Chinese, so the Chinese have taken away all the jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy government restrictions on religion, the second field in Tibet singled 
out for monitoring by Clinton, remain, despite some improvements since the 
Chinese instituted a policy of "liberalization" in 1979. Boards set up by the 
Chinese function in the monasteries themselves, running their finances, 
watching the monks' doings and ensuring that Communist Party doctrines on 
religion are implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Dasang, a 19-year-old Buddhist monk who fled Tibet in January, scoffed when 
asked if the Chinese respect official guarantees of freedom of worship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese say there's religious freedom inside Tibet. But it's not true," 
he said. "In the monasteries, there is no one to struggle for freedom. There 
are no teachers to instruct. There are no elder monks left. . . . They have 
fixed the number of monks for each monastery. So much for their religious 
freedom!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tibetan refugees in India describe the situation in their homeland in 
universally bleak terms. But a recent four-week journey in Tibet by two 
American journalists, one of whom has made several trips to the area in recent 
years, presented a more complex picture, in some cases supporting the Chinese 
government position. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Tibetans, for example, appeared to be suffering under Chinese rule. A 
minority of younger Tibetans, born after the Chinese occupation, appeared to be 
prospering. Western-dressed Tibetans drive up to discotheques in imported Land 
Cruisers. When asked, many contend that they and their families are much better 
off financially than they were only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporters also saw examples of unemployment and alcoholism among Tibetan 
youth. Signs of the increasing Han Chinese dominance over the indigenous 
Tibetan culture were pervasive, especially in Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
 But compared with recent years, the reporters saw more open religious 
activity. True to Beijing's claims, many temples and monasteries are being 
rebuilt and restored. Pilgrims worship openly. Photographs of the Dalai Lama, 
once rare contraband, are now sold openly.  
</P>
<P>
 Tibetan exiles, like U.S. policy-makers, seem torn over what action is most 
likely to compel China to modify its human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his commitment to 
nonviolence, appears to want to test whether stepping up global pressure will 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is now saying that increased international pressure may help," said 
Bhuchung K. Tsering, editor of the Tibetan Bulletin, published by the exile 
government, and no relation to the Lhasa refugee. "And he has said that he is 
willing to wait for one or two years to see if pressure will bring results." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dalai Lama's opinion, what is crucial is that whatever Clinton's 
decision, it satisfy forces inside China that are still struggling for 
democracy. A published suggestion by physicist Fang Lizhi that U.S. trade 
privileges be maintained for private Chinese businesses but be revoked for 
state- and military-run enterprises is an approach that has caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important to take a decision according to the wishes of the 
Chinese -- those Chinese who are carrying out the struggle for . . . freedom," 
the Dalai Lama said.

HEALTH DEPARTMENT WINS, SHERIFF LOSES IN BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reversing the trend of the past decade, Los Angeles County's budget chief is 
proposing a spending plan that would slice the biggest cuts out of law 
enforcement agencies while fully funding the health department, according to 
county officials familiar with the $13.5-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, which Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed will deliver to the 
Board of Supervisors on Monday, also would once again cut back libraries, 
parks, recreation and museum programs, said officials who have been briefed on 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the deepest cuts in the closely guarded proposal would be inflicted on 
the Sheriff's Department, which would lose about $60 million, according to 
budget documents obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous," said Sheriff Sherman Block, who has been informed of the 
budget plan. "We're talking about closing at least two custody facilities. 
That's the only place left to cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Other key law enforcement departments facing cuts include the Probation 
Department, which would suffer a cut of about $39.8 million, and the district 
attorney's office, which would lose about $4 million, budget documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's spending priorities contrast sharply to those shaping budgets at the 
local, state and federal level. Public demand for law and order is resulting in 
more money for many public safety agencies. In the city of Los Angeles, for 
example, Mayor Richard Riordan has proposed a significant buildup of the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole range of county services are important," Block said. "But unless they 
are provided in a climate of safety and security, they cannot be utilized." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors, which generally has been supportive of public safety 
departments, has the final say on the budget and could reject or drastically 
alter Reed's proposal. All five supervisors were in Washington, D.C., Thursday 
and could not be reached for comment, but an aide for Supervisor Gloria Molina 
said the board has not expressed an interest in such deep cuts for law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed would not discuss details of the plan before it is delivered to the 
board, but said in a brief interview that the budget is a difficult balancing 
act. Reed said she tried to give as much money as possible to health and 
welfare departments because most of their programs receive state and federal 
matching funds, sometimes at the rate of $7 to every $1 of county funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside law enforcement, the largest cut is planned for the office of the 
assessor, which prepares real estate tax bills. It is facing a 25% cut in 
funding, or roughly $21.5 million, which would require 400 layoffs and could 
result in $170 million in lost tax revenue, according to Chief Deputy Assessor 
Gary Townsend. "This will have a drastic impact," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the proposed cuts, some officials said it appears that thousands of 
layoffs once anticipated by Reed will not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few large departments to receive full funding is the huge Health 
Services Department, which operates six major hospitals and more than 40 
smaller clinics that largely serve the poor. Only last month Reed was 
recommending a $500-million cut in the health department. That would have 
resulted in the closure of at least one and possibly two hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health services, which was once expected to suffer a $30-million cut, 
would lose just $1.9 million under the current proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's earlier budget estimates were based on her calculation that the county 
was facing a $900-million deficit. But the board felt that figure was too high 
and directed Reed to work with department heads and special interest groups to 
find additional revenue or other alternatives to her suggested cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Reed was able to reduce her estimate of the deficit to just $184 
million, through a combination of identifying new revenue and deferring some 
expenses. Much of the new revenue that she identified in the proposed budget 
has been allocated to the Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, of the Hospital Council of Southern California, applauded the 
spending priorities outlined by Reed. He said the turnabout mirrors the 
changing composition of the Board of Supervisors from a board dominated by 
conservatives to one with a more liberal majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We convinced (the county) that health care had been disproportionately cut in 
the past," Langness said. "For the first time, the sheriff is not getting what 
he asked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Block, sizing up the county's priorities, responded: "Fear is the 
worst affliction in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was buoyed by the chief administrative officer's proposal, Langness 
and others remain concerned about an unresolved $184-million shortfall. And 
there are lingering concerns about some of the assumptions on which the budget 
is based. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget is precariously balanced on expectations of new funding from state 
and federal sources and on a proposed $150 million in concessions from the 
county employee pension fund. It also counts on pending state legislation that 
would allow new taxing powers to fund libraries. The county could also benefit 
from a proposed state bill that would help fund the assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some optimistic assumptions," Reed acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most questionable is the $150 million from the Los Angeles County 
Employee Retirement Assn. Several officials of the retirement association have 
privately told supervisors that they will not go along with the county's 
request. "I'm hopeful, but it is anything but a sure thing," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other departments facing deep cuts under Reed's plan include: Childrens 
Services, $11.8 million; Parks and Recreation, $6.7 million; the Social 
Services, $5.2 million; Board of Supervisors, $5 million, and Museum of Natural 
History, $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among departments for which full funding is proposed are the municipal courts, 
the public defender and the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are expected to give the budget proposal tentative approval at 
their regular Tuesday meeting. That would clear the way for public hearings, 
which are scheduled to begin June 1 and run through June 10. The Board of 
Supervisors would begin formal deliberations on July 11 and should complete the 
budget by July 15.

NEGOTIATORS OK TENTATIVE LAPD PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major breakthrough in a long and contentious labor dispute, negotiators 
for the city of Los Angeles and the police union reached agreement Thursday on 
a tentative contract that will go before the City Council for approval this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 7,500 officers will get a 3% raise July 1 and another 3% increase in 
1995 if the full City Council approves the tentative pact. The Police 
Protective League has scheduled a ratification vote for Thursday on the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, police officers will not get bonuses for 
working patrol duty. The city had fought for such a provision, noting that the 
Christopher Commission said extra pay would help refocus the Police 
Department's attention on its basic street patrols. But the union had opposed 
the bonuses, saying they would divide patrol officers from their peers and 
reduce the amount of money available for departmentwide raises. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also won an agreement that is expected to streamline the ranks of 
sergeants and detectives by mid-1995, so that Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
can more easily reassign and transfer employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had said the work rule changes, which will be hashed out over the 
next year, will help him run the department more efficiently. The police union 
said the simplification of ranks would reduce professionalism and expertise 
among detectives by allowing supervisors to indiscriminately shift them to 
other assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League's board of directors also agreed to give up its 
fight for retroactive raises for the nearly two years the union has gone 
without a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great contract, but it's a fair contract," league President Danny 
Staggs said. "I believe . . . we can put this episode behind us. It's been some 
of the darkest times in recent history for the LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very close now," said council President John Ferraro, one of the 
members of the committee that recommended approval of the pact Thursday. "I'm 
optimistic, but you never know until the final vote." 
</P>
<P>
 A visit by council members Jackie Goldberg and Zev Yaroslavsky to Police 
Protective League headquarters Tuesday was the key to breaking the impasse, 
with the two lawmakers persuading the union's board that the city did not have 
more to give, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as each side predicted a settlement, each also said it had come out on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 A city source said the league substantially changed its position, backing off 
from its demand for the same 9% raise over three years that workers at the 
Department of Water and Power received. 
</P>
<P>
 But the league said it moved the city from its initial refusal of any pay 
raise and postponed the restructuring in the detective ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching back more than two years, the labor dispute had grown divisive at 
times. Frustrated officers marched on City Hall with picket signs, staged a 
sickout until a judge declared the tactic illegal and erected carjacking 
billboards aimed at showing the public how essential the police are to reducing 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the ominous billboards, especially after the recent carjacking of 
two Japanese students, Mayor Richard Riordan temporarily backed off of his 
offer of a salary increase and canceled upcoming negotiating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief standoff, the 21 billboards came down and the sessions 
continued. The union continued to reserve the space, however, in case it needed 
the ads as a pressure tactic again. The union also held another negotiating 
card -- a video it threatened to release to tourism officials portraying the 
city as a haven for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fierce clashes, union officials said the hard-nosed negotiating 
was essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "The billboards brought the frustration of the officers to the forefront of 
the public and, certainly, the politicians," said Geoffrey Garfield, the 
union's communications director. "It demonstrated the intensity of the 
frustration."

2 GUILTY IN VEGAS KIDNAP CASE THAT CAST PALL ON IRVINE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury in Las Vegas convicted a former Newport Beach sporting club 
manager and another man Thursday of kidnaping the daughter of casino magnate 
Steve Wynn and collecting a $1.45-million ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 After 5 1/2 hours of deliberation over two days, jurors found Ray Cuddy, 48, 
and Jacob Sherwood, 22, guilty of conspiracy, extortion, money laundering and 
using a firearm in a crime of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The case unexpectedly threatened the reputation of Irvine real estate agent 
Spyro Kemble, a longtime friend of Cuddy, when a defense lawyer accused him 
during the trial of participating in the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reputation has been stained," Kemble, 36, said Thursday. "You can stand up 
and yell and scream that you didn't do it. But people will believe what they 
want to believe. They are quick to judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wynn, 27, was kidnaped last July 26 from the kitchen of her Las Vegas 
home. She was released unharmed two hours later, after her father, who is 
chairman of the corporation that owns the Mirage, Treasure Island and Golden 
Nugget casinos, paid a $1.45-million ransom in $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 She was found by her father in the back of her own car in a parking lot of the 
city's McCarran International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy was arrested in Newport Beach a few days later as he tried to complete a 
cash deal for a $200,000 Ferrari. Sherwood was arrested in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Tom O'Connell said he would push for 25-year prison terms for both 
men when they are sentenced Aug. 5. Under federal sentencing guidelines, Cuddy 
and Sherwood face 15- to 18-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said he thinks stiffer sentences are appropriate because the 
defendants forced Wynn to pose semi-nude and threatened to send the pictures to 
news media if her father called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wynn left the courthouse Thursday arm-in-arm with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He thanked prosecutors and investigators and later issued a statement 
criticizing the defendants for choosing to go through with a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to understand why these cruel and calculating criminals chose 
to make Kevin, her mother and the rest of the family relive that experience," 
Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor O'Connell agreed that the two men, who had been offered plea 
bargains, were "foolish to go to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just two guilty people taking a shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public comments since the allegations were made in court, Kemble 
said he now hopes to get on with his life but is still unsure how the 
allegations will affect him in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting with his wife of 2 1/2 months, Tracy, and his father in his parents' 
Newport Beach home, Kemble spoke of the shadow that has been cast by what he 
described as irresponsible lies. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial began last week, defense lawyer Dan Albregts, representing 
Sherwood, told jurors that Kemble had driven Kevin Wynn to the airport after 
the kidnaping. Albregts also pointed out that $500,000 of the ransom money was 
found in Kemble's garage in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying for the prosecution this week, Kemble denied any involvement in the 
kidnaping and said he had his father, a Newport Beach lawyer, call the FBI when 
he realized Cuddy might have stashed money in his garage. Cuddy had been 
storing several boxes there for the last several years, Kemble said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble, who was born in Berlin but has lived in Orange County most of his 
life, met Cuddy in the early 1980s at the now-defunct Newport Beach Sporting 
Club, which Cuddy managed. Kemble worked for Cuddy as a personal fitness 
trainer before receiving his real estate license and starting his own real 
estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed the arrest of his friend, Kemble said, he was 
thoroughly investigated not only by the FBI but by private investigators hired 
by Steven Wynn. On the night of the kidnaping, Kemble said, he was having 
dinner with his wife and parents in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Within moments after Albregts brought his name into the much-publicized trial 
that gripped Las Vegas, Kemble said, his phone was ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls came by the hundreds, most of them supportive, Kemble said. But the 
calls that didn't come and other subtle actions make him worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the curious looks you get when you walk by," Kemble said. "It's the 
unspoken convictions of people who think I may have had something do to with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the trial opened, Kemble said, he only worried that people might find 
out Cuddy had stashed ransom money in the garage of his former home. He didn't 
imagine he actually would be accused of participating in the crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the highly competitive real estate business, in which he specializes in 
expensive Newport Beach home sales, even a shadow of scandal can be 
devastating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want any of that to leak out, because you know how people can 
misinterpret things," he said. "In this town it takes a long, long time to 
build a good reputation, which I feel I have done."  
</P>
<P>
 One competing real estate agent, he said, has already mentioned the 
allegations to a client of Kemble's. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble's father, Donn, described the defense lawyer's attack on Kemble as the 
"age-old bit: it's not my guy, it's someone else. . . . It's the innocent 
people who have to live with the accusations." 
</P>
<P>
 In closing statements Wednesday, Albregts accused the government of ignoring 
his contentions about Kemble but said he could not prove that Kemble was in 
Kevin Wynn's house when she was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, Kemble said he should have been more suspicious of Cuddy's 
lavish spending in the days after the kidnaping, when Cuddy bought a $20,000 
Rolex watch and a $3,000 pair of ostrich-skin boots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kemble said he believed Cuddy got the money through settlement of a 
lawsuit with a former business partner and had no reason to believe his buddy 
had committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Ray as well as anybody," he said. "But apparently no one knew Ray that 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 As his father, who had grown close to Cuddy through the years, said, 
"Obviously he had a short circuit in his wiring someplace. It overloaded and 
blew. It's just too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said he has mixed emotions about Cuddy. He tries to remember the good 
times they shared, but feels revulsion about the crime disbelief that Cuddy 
pushed the case to trial and put the Wynn family through the media spotlight, 
and anger that his friend drew him into the case by putting the money in his 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemble said he intends to get on with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cast a bad shadow, and it's one that's going to take a long time to 
repair," he said.

CORRUPTION TRIAL WITNESS SAYS HILL EXPECTED TO PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness in the corruption trial of Sen. Frank Hill 
testified Thursday that the Whittier Republican knew that he and other GOP 
lawmakers would benefit financially if they advanced legislation that was part 
of an undercover FBI sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Former GOP aide Karin L. Watson told a U.S. District Court jury that in 1988 
she and Hill, then an assemblyman, discussed special interest legislation to 
assist the FBI's bogus shrimp processing company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him we'd be receiving $10,000 for Republicans as a result of our help 
on the bill," said Watson, who pleaded guilty to extortion and is cooperating 
with the government in exchange for a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was delighted," Watson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conversation secretly recorded by an FBI informant, Watson said Hill 
would want a share of the campaign contributions funneled to him. "He will 
definitely (want) one of the big ones," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In questioning Watson, Assistant U.S. Atty. Bradford Lewis sought to show that 
the onetime GOP special assistant was not acting on her own but on behalf of 
former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale and his top 
lieutenants, especially Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, who was taking notes during part of Watson's second day of 
testimony, has pleaded not guilty to charges of extortion, conspiracy and money 
laundering. His co-defenandant, Terry E. Frost, 44, a former Democratic Senate 
aide, has pleaded not guilty to a single count of conspiracy.  
</P>
<P>
 They are the latest defendants in a string of cases arising out of the 
elaborate sting operation in which FBI agents posing as Southern businessmen 
lavished money on lawmakers to support the bogus legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1988, Nolan was given two $5,000 campaign checks and Hill received a 
$2,500 honorarium from the shrimp company. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Nolan pleaded guilty to corruption charges and is serving a 
federal prison sentence. Hill is the first Republican lawmaker to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 As events surrounding the shrimp bill unfolded in 1988, neither Hill nor 
Watson knew the measure was part of the FBI's sting. 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress their case against Hill, prosecutors played several hours of 
secretly recorded conversations in which Watson boasts to an undercover FBI 
agent about Hill's clout. 
</P>
<P>
 In one conversation on May 26, 1988, Watson and the agent, known as George 
Miller, are walking to Hill's Capitol office to meet the lawmaker and discuss 
the shrimp bill. Watson describes Hill as "a tough street fighter" and as 
someone "with good connections in the governor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hill is introduced to Miller, the lawmaker says that Watson has "already 
pitched me on (the legislation) so I'm on board, I'm supposed to take the lead, 
and round up the troops. I'd be happy to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson also testified about how lawmakers discuss contributions in "code 
words" because it would be illegal to talk about money and legislation in the 
same conversation.

2 SLAYINGS MAY HAVE COLOSIO LINK; PROBE: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO 
DETERMINE IF MEN SHOT ON I-5 HAD TIES TO ASSASSINATED MEXICAN CANDIDATE. THAT 
COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT DENIES ANY CONNECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's detectives are investigating a possible 
connection between the shooting deaths of two men on a Southern California 
freeway in February and the assassination in March of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
Mexico's ruling party presidential candidate, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials, however, denied any connection between the two slain men 
and the killing of Colosio in a Tijuana shantytown March 23. One federal 
official blasted such assertions as "false and irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Sheriff's Department investigators suspect that the two men, one 
of whom was carrying credentials purportedly issued by the office of the 
president of Mexico, worked as security guards for the Colosio campaign and 
maintained residences on both sides of the border. Although the investigation, 
including interviews of witnesses in the United States and Mexico, suggests 
that the double murder may be related to the subsequent slaying of Colosio, the 
motive remains unclear, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not confirmed as yet if there is a connection between the 
assassination of Mr. Colosio and that shooting," said Sheriff's Sgt. Noel 
Lanier. "Homicide investigators are aggressively working that case and taking 
any leads and rumors and putting the case together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department investigation adds a strange twist to the already 
murky Colosio case. Although a gunman and three alleged accomplices have been 
charged with killing the candidate, the Mexican government's investigation has 
bogged down amid unanswered questions and conspiracy theories pointing to 
politicians, drug traffickers and possibly both. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the suspects in Colosio's murder were volunteer security guards 
provided by his political party for crowd control. Colosio's personal 
bodyguards were army officers who serve in the Mexican equivalent of the Secret 
Service, as well as other members of the federal security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Salvador Gonzalez, 37, and Antonio Trejo, 35, were gunned down by five 
shots from a passing car as they drove in a Cadillac on the Golden State 
Freeway, Interstate 5, near Gorman. A detective described the slayings as the 
work of professional assassins. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with the victims' families and others, authorities believe 
Salvador was "an official in the Mexican government and in the political party 
PRI (the Institutional Revolutionary Party)," according to a detective who 
asked not to be identified. Salvador and Trejo were both working security for 
the Colosio campaign, probably as bodyguards, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the documents found on the bodies was a letter of introduction 
purportedly bearing the signature of Jose Maria Cordoba Montoya, a powerful 
former aide to Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Also found were 
documents indicating that Salvador was "in charge of special investigations for 
the government of Mexico," said a source close to the investigation. U.S. 
authorities said they are operating under the assumption that the documents are 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Los Angeles-based spokesman for the Mexican federal attorney general's 
office said the credentials were obviously false and that the men did not work 
for the government. The official, Juan Miguel Ponce Edmondson, said that the 
murder appears to be drug-related and that the Cadillac is linked to an 
investigation of methamphetamine trafficking in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an incident related to drug trafficking," Ponce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican investigators examined the credentials at the request of sheriff's 
deputies shortly after the double murder and concluded that the identification 
documents were counterfeit, Ponce said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the PRI issued a statement from Mexico City saying that Salvador 
did not work for the political party or for the candidate's security force, 
denying a report that hewas a chief of security for Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador "never occupied any post or commission in the PRI," the communique 
said, adding that on the date of the murder, the plans for Colosio's trip to 
Tijuana had not yet been made. "Therefore, any possible connection between the 
two events is unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, meanwhile, said the Mexican government has not cooperated 
with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican government, they are telling us this individual did not exist and 
neither did the function he carried out," the investigator said of Salvador. 
"Our problem is we can't confirm any of this. The family tells us one thing and 
the Mexican government is telling us the other." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. authorities said the two victims both had homes near Guadalajara in the 
Mexican state of Jalisco, but also maintained residences near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative of Salvador in Glendale declined to be interviewed, but she said a 
Chevrolet Suburban outside the apartment house had belonged to him. The vehicle 
was decorated with three PRI bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no hard evidence that the two victims were involved in drug 
trafficking, detectives said, although they believe politics and drugs may have 
been involved.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cadillac driven by Trejo was traveling at 75 m.p.h. south on the Golden 
State Freeway on Feb. 27 when another vehicle pulled up alongside and fired 
five shots from a 9-millimeter weapon, authorities said. Because all five shots 
hit the victims in the neck and head, authorities suspect they were 
professional assassins. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not a single mark on the outside of the car to indicate a stray 
round," said one source. "We're talking about someone who is really a good 
shot, a professional. This was definitely an assassination. Whoever did it knew 
what they were doing."

AUTO MAKERS SEEK DELAY OF ELECTRIC CAR MANDATE; AIR QUALITY: OFFICIALS SAY 
TECHNOLOGY ISN'T READY. BUT CRITICS SAY FIRMS WANT EXCUSE TO DO NOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a daylong assault, auto manufacturers from around the world urged the state 
Air Resources Board on Thursday to delay California's revolutionary mandate to 
mass-produce electric cars and instead conduct another review in six months to 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's mandate, adopted in 1990, requires that 2% of the cars sold in 
California by major manufacturers -- about 25,000 cars -- be emissions-free 
beginning in 1998. The requirement increases to 5% by 2001 and 10% by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in Los Angeles, the board is expected to make the pivotal decision 
today of whether technology has advanced enough to meet the mandate. The 
decision will be critical to the auto industry, utilities and other industries, 
which must decide how quickly to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to 
produce the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to persuade Gov. Pete Wilson to endorse a weakening of the 
requirements, auto manufacturers focused on a new tactic: They asked that the 
board review its mandate again within a year instead of waiting until 1996 as 
planned. The industry believes 1996 is too long to wait for another review 
because production plants would have to be operating by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Thursday's testimony by auto executives echoed the words of John 
Williams, a General Motors official who heads a Big Three electric-battery 
consortium: "I love electric vehicles. I just don't like mandates."  
</P>
<P>
 Yoshitomo Shito, general manager of the Japanese Automotive Manufacturing 
Assn. in Tokyo, said manufacturers there are working on advanced electric car 
batteries but they will not be ready for 1998 model cars. The existing 
batteries, he said, "are not viable marketable products." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stempel, former chairman of General Motors, told the board he does not 
support the mandate even though it would generate business for Ovonic Battery 
Co., which he works with on behalf of GM. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm really concerned about is locking in a technology," Stempel said, 
adding that "practical electric vehicles are within our reach" but not yet 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Many auto manufacturers said that if they rush to produce cars that are not 
satisfactory to the public, it would poison the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's staff, however, insists that practical electric cars can be 
available by 1998 and that the companies are reluctant because it will take a 
sizable investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the mandate said the auto industry's push for more reviews is a 
delaying tactic and would stifle investment in electric vehicles, which they 
say is a key to revitalization of California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you did this every six months, it would literally become the excuse to do 
nothing," said Michael Gage, president of Calstart, a consortium of companies 
and public agencies promoting advanced transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every environmental group, some business groups and electric 
utilities support the mandate.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR: BROWN CAMP TRIES TO LIMIT TV COVERAGE OF 
DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weeks after agreeing to take part in three broadcast debates before the 
primary election, gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown's campaign is working 
hard to minimize how many voters will see them, prompting Brown's opponents to 
ask: What is she afraid of? 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings this week with two of the three debate hosts, Brown's 
representatives have balked at the possibility of televising the proceedings 
outside the host city, according to those who attended the negotiations on 
behalf of Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), Brown's Democratic opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Southern California's voters, who make up more than half the 
state's electorate, are unlikely to see the Democrats go head to head. The 
three debates are tentatively scheduled for May 23 on KOVR-TV in Sacramento (8 
p.m.), May 24 on KRON-TV and KQED radio in San Francisco (6 p.m.) and May 25 on 
KABC radio in Los Angeles (1 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Political scholars read the Brown campaign's behavior as an attempt to shield 
their candidate from possible embarrassment. Bruce Cain, a UC Berkeley 
political science professor, said such a cautious approach is to be expected 
from a front-runner such as Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strategy of keeping it to one media market is so in case she falls on her 
face, the damage is limited," said Cain, who speculated that Brown is seeking 
to use the pre-primary debates as rehearsals for possible debates against Gov. 
Pete Wilson before the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got to find her stride with respect to handling debates and creating 
confidence . . . that she has the knowledge to run the state," he said. "If 
you're dealing with a rookie, you might well want to keep the rookie on the 
radio until he or she develops the comfort that looks good on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Berg, director of the USC's Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "To be in the second-largest media market in North America and not have a 
televised debate is just incredible. The voters ought to have the opportunity 
to make up their own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Reilly, Brown's campaign manager, was unavailable for comment Thursday. 
And spokesman John Whitehurst said he could neither confirm nor deny what had 
occurred in meetings that he did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst would only say that Brown wants to participate in three regional 
debates, which he says will allow candidates to address local issues. He said 
this has been the Brown campaign's position from the outset and that it was 
only with this understanding that Brown agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 But spokesmen for the other campaigns and the news director of one of the host 
stations said there was no such understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Wednesday meeting with KOVR-TV in Sacramento, News Director Jim Sanders 
said Reilly "expressed a lack of willingness to have the debate go statewide. . 
. . There seems to be an opinion within the Brown camp that in the initial 
conversations with this TV station they made their position of 'no-statewide 
(debate)' clear. There is not that same recollection within this TV station." 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Peterson, Hayden's campaign manager, said Reilly made it quite clear 
that Brown would pull out if the debate were made available to other TV 
stations around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they would only do a debate if it was solely broadcast in the market 
of the debate," Peterson said, adding that Reilly called any other option 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting Thursday to discuss the format of the Los Angeles radio debate, 
one of the KABC producers mentioned that in years past, C-SPAN has covered 
similar events live. According to Peterson and Monica Mills, Garamendi's deputy 
campaign manager, Brown's representative said she would have to check with 
Reilly to see if that would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Wardlaw, who attended the meeting on behalf of Brown, was unavailable for 
comment Thursday. But talk radio host Michael Jackson, who is the moderator of 
the KABC radio debate, said that if Brown's campaign attempts to block C-SPAN 
coverage, he will object. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see how a candidate can dictate which channels should be able to 
cover an event," he said, adding that if Brown doesn't want TV coverage she 
doesn't have to participate. "Two candidates are easier than three. That's my 
answer. I'm for freedom of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, said the attempt to limit the 
viewership of the debates makes him furious.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why Kathleen Brown is willing to thumb her nose at people in Los Angeles or 
San Diego is beyond me, but that's what she's doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When told that Whitehurst had dismissed the issue as "the whining of 
underdogs," Sragow added: "Nobody here is whining. This is anger. . . . We have 
grown very tired of the duplicitous nature of the Brown campaign. They are 
constantly playing games." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, Hayden's campaign manager, characterized the furor over access as 
sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "While America is exporting democratic ideals to other nations, we're turning 
American electioneering into a marketing game. I don't think that's what the 
founding fathers had in mind."

ASSEMBLYMAN MAY PROPOSE PADDLING FOR GRAFFITI VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a cue from an internationally celebrated case in Singapore, an Orange 
County lawmaker is contemplating a bill to require the punishing of juvenile 
graffiti vandals with up to six whacks with a paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) said he began pursuing the idea -- 
dismissed as ludicrous by legal scholars -- after being prodded by constituents 
caught up in the highly publicized debate over the caning of an American 
teen-ager for spray-painting cars in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I was hearing from the public was, 'Why can't we do something like 
this? Our graffiti problem is so bad,' " Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of bringing paddling to California did not sit well with Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). "That clearly would be considered cruel 
and unusual punishment in this country," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor and nationally recognized expert in 
criminal law, said "there's not a snowball's chance in hell" that the bill 
would pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is significant about this proposal is not the likelihood of its 
enactment, but the fact that it was made at all," Arenella said.  
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, contends that his bill could survive a court test, noting 
that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -- the intellectual leader of 
the court's conservative wing -- suggested in a talk last week in San Francisco 
that he feels caning is constitutional in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy has asked the legislative counsel for an opinion on his proposal, which 
would allow no more than six strokes and require that a physician be present to 
administer first aid if needed. Conroy said he felt the punishment should be 
carried out in a public forum with a paddle, not in private with the sort of 
Singapore-style rattan cane that can leave permanent scarring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point behind this is deterrence, not punishment," Conroy said. "It could 
prove to be an effective way to change the lives of some youngsters who are now 
on the wrong track." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as a favorite to be reelected in his conservative district, Conroy 
said he will drop his effort if the public does not embrace it.  
</P>
<P>
 On May 5, Michael Fay, an 18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, 
got four strokes of a rattan cane after being found guilty of vandalism in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide public opinion polls found that most Americans disapproved of Fay's 
punishment, but supporters of the flogging bombarded Congress and the Singapore 
Embassy with telephone calls and letters. One poll found that three-quarters of 
all Americans felt caning would be the right punishment for graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 From the pillory to the paddle, the United States has a long history of 
corporal punishment. The Constitutional Congress drew up regulations in 1775 
permitting flogging on U.S. warships, and they were not abolished until 1850. 
The last legal flogging for a crime occurred in Delaware in 1952, although the 
state continued to turn a blind eye to the practice for another two decades. 
Today, 23 states still allow corporal punishment -- mostly paddling -- in 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark A.R. Kleiman, an associate professor at Harvard University's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government, said it is inappropriate to rely on judicial 
interpretations to determine the merits of Conroy's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obscene to pluck out graffiti for corporal punishment as opposed to 
something more serious, like assault and battery," Kleiman said. "I admit I 
sometimes come across graffiti and would like to see the guy who did it at the 
other end of a stick. But that's not necessarily a sane reaction."

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / PATT MORRISON: SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. ; 
SARTORIAL SHOWDOWN IN ASSEMBLY JUST A FORMALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If clothes make the man . . . campaign expenditure reports show that Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) went to the Armani Boutique for a tuxedo 
last year and ponied $2,192 of campaign funds for it, while Assemblyman Ross 
Johnson (R-Placentia) headed for Gingiss Formalwear for a tuxedo and shelled 
out $136. This was a no-tie black tie sartorial showdown: The Speaker is 
probably the best-dressed man in California.

 To be or to not be: Dorothy Kreiss Robbins, the American Independent Party's 
candidate for secretary of state, promises in her statement that as an 
instructor in grammar, she will guarantee "clear, precise, understandable" 
election material. Perhaps she could apply her red pen to help the man on the 
opposite page from her in the voter pamphlet, Republican Senate candidate Bill 
Dannemeyer. His campaign phone number splits the infinitive with "1-800-2 NOT

 Ten lives: One place in California where the death penalty is unpopular: San 
Francisco's animal shelters. As of this spring, no dog or cat turned into the 
shelters will be put to death unless it is beyond rehabilitation. The city and 
county that bear the name of the saintly four-leggers' friend are the nation's 
first to guarantee that homeless pets will not be euthanized. Under the 
shelters' pact with the SPCA, even cats and dogs with health or behavioral 
problems will be treated or trained for suitable homes. Only those who are 
beyond even that help will face the needle.

 Dad news blues: Insurance commissioner and guv aspirant John Garamendi was 
introduced at a recent Century City Chamber of Commerce event as the progenitor 
of seven children. Garamendi stood up -- remember, this was before he broke his 
leg falling out of an oak tree -- and remarked that his wife "will be surprised 
to hear that there is a seventh child" because the Garamendis have an even 
half-dozen offspring.

 Drive time: Since the state began keeping records sometime in the 1940s, 1993 
was blessed with the lowest-ever number of deaths per 100 million miles driven 
-- 1.56. In this second year of mandatory helmets, motorcyclists' deaths and 
injuries dropped markedly. So did drunk driving-related deaths and injuries. 
More bicyclists and pedestrians, though, were hurt or killed. No bills are 
pending in the Legislature to require pedestrians to wear helmets.

 Face the state: Ignore the position papers. Dump the debates. Forget the bus 
tours. Norma Desmond is right: it's about faces.

<P>
 In the first four lines of its profile of Kathleen Brown, this month's GQ 
magazine praises her "chiseled cheekbones" and "dark intelligent gaze." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the San Francisco Examiner detailed a UC Irvine professor's ratings of 
California's guv-lorn candidates by looks. Professor Shawn Rosenberg rated 
thick eyebrows as a negative (Brown, Hayden, Wilson), awarded good eye shape 
points to all three and Garamendi, found Wilson's older looks a plus and 
Brown's younger looks a minus (one advance for the mature woman). 
</P>
<P>
 All three men rated high for that great campaign asset -- head tilt. It seems 
not to matter whether Republicans tilt to the left, or Democrats to the right.

 Change of life: By Father's Day, 39-year-old San Francisco Police Sgt. 
Stephanie Thorne will have wrapped up months of treatment and counseling, and 
undergone surgery to make her Stephan Thorne, the SFPD's first transsexual 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year veteran declared her intentions at a news conference in the office 
of San Francisco Police Chief Tony Ribera, who praised her as an outstanding 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my way of being honest about it and letting the world know that I am not 
ashamed and my department is not ashamed," Thorne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can blame her, with a woman's earnings still averaging less than 80 cents 
to a man's dollar? EXIT LINE 
</P>
<P>
 "That sounds like the new math." 
</P>
<P>
 -- State Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), as the august body unanimously 
approved -- on May 2 -- a resolution declaring April to be Mathematics 
Education Month.

2 CONVICTED IN WYNN'S ABDUCTION; COURTS: MEN ARE FOUND GUILTY OF EXTORTION, 
MONEY LAUNDERING AND WEAPONS VIOLATIONS IN KIDNAPING OF CASINO OWNER'S 
DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Kevin Wynn and her parents watching intently from the front row of a 
crowded courtroom Thursday, a jury returned guilty verdicts against two men who 
abducted her last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated about five hours before finding Ray Cuddy and Jacob 
Sherwood guilty of all charges stemming from the July 26 abduction of Wynn from 
her Las Vegas home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynn and her parents declined to comment as they rushed from the courtroom 
after thanking prosecutors and investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll talk sometime," high-profile gaming executive Steve Wynn said as he 
walked arm in arm with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy, the ringleader of the kidnaping plot, stood impassively with his hands 
in his pockets as the jury announced the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy and Sherwood were charged with extortion, money laundering and weapons 
charges. (They were not charged with kidnaping because they were tried in 
federal court, and federal kidnaping charges require evidence of the victim 
being transported across state lines.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing, but not entirely unexpected," said Cuddy's attorney, 
Mitch Posin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood's attorney, Dan Albregts, said he would try to persuade U.S. District 
Judge Lloyd George before the scheduled Aug. 5 sentencing that his client 
deserves less of a sentence than Cuddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight's not over," he said. "I'm still going to try to get as little 
sentence as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Tom O'Connell said the two men, who had been offered plea bargains 
prior to the trial, were "foolish to go to trial." He said he would ask for 
sentences of about 25 years for each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wynn was released unharmed two hours after the incident began, when her 
father paid a ransom of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Cuddy, 47, had fallen on hard times and was devastated when 
he saw a $500,000 judgment he had won slip through his fingers when it was set 
aside by an appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 He had "crashed to the bottom of the heap" when he recruited Sherwood, 22, a 
former co-worker at a Sacramento truck stop, to help in the kidnaping.

BUSINESS ALLIANCE BACKS KEY PARTS OF CLINTON HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joined by a powerful congressman, a coalition of large corporations gave 
President Clinton's health care reform drive a boost Thursday, calling for 
mandatory employer-provided insurance and stringent, across-the-board cost 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 In backing the two most controversial elements in Clinton's plan, the business 
alliance was supported by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski, who warned of "exploding costs" if the nation seeks to provide 
universal coverage without enacting tough cost-containment measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't contain costs, we won't be able to afford today's coverage and 
won't be able to think about expanding coverage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois Democrat, a key Clinton ally on health reform, recently broke 
with the President by calling for a broad tax increase to help finance health 
reform, which Clinton immediately rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The business coalition, called the National Leadership Coalition for Health 
Care Reform, has 93 members, including the auto industry, Lockheed, Maytag, 
Safeway, Sara Lee, Southern California Edison, Time Warner, United Air Lines 
and Xerox, as well as unions, health care provider groups and consumer advocacy 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's call for an employer mandate -- with no exemptions for small 
businesses -- is directed at a key phenomenon known as cost-shifting: When 
doctors and hospitals treat the uninsured, they generally recoup their 
uncompensated services by imposing higher fees on patients with insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, tens of millions of dollars in costs are shifted in this way, 
reform advocates say. Hardest hit are firms such as the coalition's members, 
who already provide insurance for workers, often spending 12% or more of their 
payroll. Clinton's plan would cap such spending at 7.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition leaders conceded that, in backing the employer mandate and cost 
controls on all medical providers, they are a minority within the business 
community. But said Curtis H. Barnette, chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corp.: "We 
are here to say that a substantial part of the business community does support 
employer mandate and cost containment." 
</P>
<P>
 The two are "inextricably tied together," said Henry E. Simmons, president of 
the coalition, whose honorary co-chairmen are former Presidents Gerald R. Ford 
and Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Another speaker at a Capitol Hill press conference was Andrew H. Card Jr., 
transportation secretary in the George Bush Administration. Now head of the 
American Automobile Manufacturers Assn., he said that manufacturing firms spend 
28% more in health care costs because of cost-shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Rostenkowski nor coalition leaders would say that they specifically 
back a cap on insurance premiums, as proposed by Clinton. Rostenkowski said 
that he wants to sound out a majority of his committee members before taking a 
public stance on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition advocates the establishment of an annual target for aggregate 
health care expenditures -- covering both the private and public sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, abortion coverage survived its first key test Thursday when a House 
panel beat back an attempt by anti-abortion lawmakers to eliminate the benefit 
from the standard benefits package proposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote in the labor and management relations subcommittee of the House 
Education and Labor Committee was 16 to 11.

MIDEAST; BIG WIN PUTS ISRAELI UNION CHIEF ON EVERY DANCE CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defeated by labor-union bureaucrats on reform of Israel's health insurance 
system, Haim Ramon quit as health minister, challenged the old guard in union 
elections and this week won a victory likely to shape Israeli politics for the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Expelled last month by the governing Labor Party as a traitor for challenging 
its control of the Histadrut, the union federation, Ramon found himself being 
courted Thursday by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, wooed by other politicians as 
the country's new powerbroker and described by commentators as the person who 
will set the country's future agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he campaigned for less than a month, Ramon's ticket managed to win 
47% of the votes in the Histadrut elections, overwhelming the Labor candidates 
who received only 33% and lost control of an institution the party had led 
since its founding 73 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So stunning was his victory over the Labor Party in the union elections that 
Ramon, 44, immediately emerged as the leading candidate for the premiership 
when Rabin, 72, steps down, perhaps in two years and certainly in six. Labor 
scrambled quickly to bring him back into the party ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haim Ramon will return to his natural place, the Labor Party, but it will be 
a completely different party as a result of his victory," said Avraham Burg, a 
leading liberal in the party. "A new revolution has started in Labor . . . and 
there is a new agenda in the state of Israel -- a social one." 
</P>
<P>
 The implications of the Ramon victory are far-reaching: 
</P>
<P>
 * To take on the Labor Party leadership -- Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres and even old friends such as Burg -- Ramon drew support from the leftist 
Meretz Party and the religious party Shas in a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some Labor leaders fear Ramon might be tempted to form such a coalition for 
the next parliamentary elections if he is not readmitted to the party or if 
Labor fails to change to his liking. Some triumphant Ramon supporters assert 
that this is precisely what he should do -- form a new party focused on new 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new generation -- men and women, like Ramon, in their 40s -- are preparing 
to assume leadership of the country, pushing aside what is now called the "lost 
generation" of politicians who have been waiting for a decade and longer for 
Rabin, Peres and others to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 * A prominent dove when he was in the Labor Party, Ramon demonstrated that 
more than 80% of the country -- the combined total of votes for his ticket, the 
Labor Party and the Communists -- favor Israel's efforts to reach peace with 
its Arab neighbors. The opposition Likud Party and its right-wing allies polled 
only 18% of the votes, down from 27% at the last union election. 
</P>
<P>
 * Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu will face new challenges to his leadership 
within his party, not only because it has lost much of the ground it had gained 
in previous Histadrut elections, but also because it has not been building the 
broader electoral support that would return it to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw an amazing thing -- the whole nation standing up together, religious 
and secular, Jews and Arabs, intellectuals and working people," Ramon said of 
his victory. "It was a development I could not have imagined. . . . This is the 
coalition the Labor Party has dreamed of for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon, a lawyer by training, will become secretary general of the Histadrut. 
With 1.6 million members, it represents about 67% of Israeli workers. More than 
that, it owns many of Israel's major companies, runs its largest health care 
and sports programs and provides so many services that it is almost 
governmental in character.

 For years, South Korea trumpeted the defection of the rare North Korean who 
managed to escape the regime of Communist dictator Kim Il Sung, with news 
conferences and lavish financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Seoul faces a new and daunting problem: how to absorb potentially 
hundreds of defectors said to be fleeing Pyongyang's collapsing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials here are reviewing their defector policy to focus more on vocational 
training and other skills rather than simply cash rewards. An ad-hoc committee 
was set up this week to look for ways to help defectors adjust to South Korea 
and survive on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government will teach them how to catch the fish rather than give them 
the fish," the Seoul Shinmun, a Korean daily newspaper, reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, eight new defectors turned up in Seoul with graphic accounts of the 
virtual state of starvation facing North Koreans. People reduced to eating corn 
paste and pine bark are now being allowed to travel more freely to scrounge for 
food, they said. Growing numbers are using the opportunity to secretly cross 
into China. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts here say as many as 2,000 North Korean escapees may be hiding in 
China. Thousands more are said to be working as contract loggers in Siberia, 
and Seoul is currently involved in delicate negotiations with Moscow to accept 
at least 100 who have escaped. Pyongyang is vociferously protesting the release 
of the loggers, but Seoul is appealing on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Those loggers hunted down by North Korean agents are said to have their legs 
broken and then to be executed publicly on return to the North. China, which 
has not signed U.N. international refugee pacts and has signed a treaty with 
Pyongyang to return illegal immigrants, is returning about 80% of them, 
according to Korean news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Should war break out or the economy collapse completely, as many as 2 million 
refugees might stream over the border, one analyst said.  
</P>
<P>
 Such a flood could overwhelm Seoul. Under its "Special Law to Protect North 
Korean Brethren Defecting to the South," South Korea may pay defectors $19,000 
to $31,500 for resettlement and a reward of 10 grams to 20,000 grams of gold 
for North Korean information and equipment. The first family to come, Kim Man 
Chol and 10 of his relatives, received $630,000 in government support after 
arriving in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 100 North Koreans have defected to the South. But many are said 
to be struggling despite generous government support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some North Korean defectors are now leading poor lives after being swindled 
out of all the money the government gave them," said Park Sil, a member of the 
National Assembly Foreign-Unification Committee. "If they received vocational 
training, they would be leading stable lives now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ko Yong Hwan, 40, is an exception. A 20-year diplomat schooled in English and 
French, he defected from his post of first secretary in Congo three years ago. 
A colleague had tipped him off that two North Korean agents were about to 
arrest him because they suspected he had turned against communism. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he had: Ko had witnessed Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech in Moscow in 
1987 criticizing the socialist system and calling for glasnost and perestroika 
. He decided "North Korea has no hope," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 After he arrived in Seoul in May, 1991, the government gave him $50,500 to 
help him buy a house and provided security guards for the first six months. 
Officials also helped Ko find his present job as an analyst on North Korean 
affairs for a government institute; he also lectures and writes books. An 
Economy on the Brink 
</P>
<P>
 Recent defectors say Pyongyang's economy is so bad that North Koreans are 
facing virtual starvation, and that some have been reduced to eating corn paste 
and pine bark.

PANEL OKS SMOKING BAN FOR PUBLIC AREAS; LEGISLATION: SURPRISE BACKING IN HOUSE 
WAS ACHIEVED AFTER BILL WAS WEAKENED BY AMENDMENTS EXEMPTING RESTAURANTS, BARS, 
PRISONS AND CLUBS.

<P>
 In a significant defeat for the tobacco industry, legislation that would 
prohibit smoking in public places nationwide cleared what was expected to be 
its most difficult congressional hurdle Thursday, passing a key House panel by 
a comfortable margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The health and environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, whose members have stalled or defeated previous tobacco-related 
measures, approved the bill, 14 to 11. The outcome startled both sides -- 
especially the bill's chief sponsor, subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), who moments before had privately expressed doubts that it 
would pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major shift that has taken place today," Waxman said, attributing 
the change to mounting public pressure and increasing recognition of the health 
risks associated with smoking, particularly the effects of secondhand smoke on 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very tough place for this legislation -- there have always been 
very difficult barriers to tobacco-related bills," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was substantially weakened, however, by amendments that would 
exempt from its provisions all restaurants, bars, prisons, tobacco stores and 
private clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant and bar exemption was introduced by Waxman to address the 
concerns of several subcommittee members who otherwise would have opposed the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Waxman said, he intends to "revisit" the exemption later to try to 
include restaurants catering to families, such as fast-food chains, so children 
will be protected from secondhand smoke. Several such chains, including 
McDonald's, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box, already have voluntarily established 
smoke-free premises and support a ban on restaurant smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, the subcommittee's ranking Republican 
and leader of its pro-tobacco forces, called the legislation "the ultimate Big 
Brother." The tobacco state lawmaker predicted that it would turn "law-abiding 
citizens into scofflaws." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, three Republicans who often side with Bliley voted in favor of 
the bill, saying that they could support it as long as it contained a 
restaurant exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people should be protected in places where they don't have a lot of 
choice about being: workplace, government buildings, malls, shopping centers 
and transportation terminals," said Rep. Jim Greenwood (R-Pa.), who, along with 
fellow Republicans Fred Upton of Michigan and Scott L. Klug of Wisconsin, voted 
for the bill. "However, people can freely choose which restaurants, clubs and 
taverns to frequent." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which would not preempt state laws, would ban or restrict 
smoking in most indoor environments used by the public, such as malls, schools 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 It would require the owners of non-residential buildings regularly entered by 
10 or more persons during a week to ban smoking entirely within the buildings 
or restrict the activity to a separately ventilated room that would move the 
smoke directly outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant and bar exemptions would apply to establishments where the 
primary commercial activity is the sale of food or alcoholic beverages. The 
definition would mean that sporting arenas, or businesses such as bowling 
alleys, would not be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition on Smoking Or Health, which represents the American Lung Assn., 
the American Heart Assn. and the American Cancer Society, expressed its 
disappointment with the amendments. It said that it would seek to remove them 
when the bill reaches the full Energy and Health Committee.

MEXICO ASKS U.N. FOR HELP IN ELECTIONS; VOTING: THE REQUEST IS THE LATEST MOVE 
TO IMPROVE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CRUCIAL FEDERAL BALLOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Mexican government has asked the United Nations to provide technical 
assistance to national observers of the Aug. 21 presidential elections and to 
issue a report on the country's new computerized electoral system. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said they are acting on the request, made in a letter dated May 
10 and released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time that Mexico -- a country generally acknowledged to be 
plagued by election fraud -- has ever asked for such help. 
</P>
<P>
 The request is the latest in a series of moves to improve the credibility of 
the crucial federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has permitted audits of voter-registration rolls, organized 
tours of electoral computers and commissioned surveys from pollsters with a 
reputation for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid request to the United Nations comes atop plans to invite international 
"visitors" to watch the elections, a government official said. The Mexican 
Congress is now considering constitutional modifications to permit the presence 
of such foreigners, who would not have the official status of observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although our constitution and laws grant the right to organize and qualify 
elections exclusively to Mexicans, we believe that the assistance of the United 
Nations would be useful in prior phases," Mexican Interior Minister Jorge 
Carpizo MacGregor wrote to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 After speaking with the director of the U.N. electoral assistance unit, 
Carpizo requested a mission of election experts to review the Mexican system 
and to issue a report on it, as well as providing assistance for national 
observers who request it. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrutiny of computers that will count the votes is important because much of 
the skepticism surrounding the 1988 presidential election resulted from a 
system crash that occurred when opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was 
ahead in returns. Many Mexicans still believe Cardenas was cheated out of the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The request to assist national observers was made, a government official said, 
because "many of them do not know what they are supposed to observe." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sills, the secretary general's spokesman, described the Mexican request as 
one "not for verification on conduct of the election. It's a technical 
assistance request." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition parties called the request a positive step. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Calderon, secretary general of the right-wing National Action Party, 
said the United Nations will provide "prestige and moral force."  
</P>
<P>
 But "we will see whether the United Nations will base its (evaluation) on the 
reality of Mexico," said Cardenas, candidate of the opposition Democratic 
Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides trying to show Mexico's elections are clean and fair, the government 
has attempted to open up the campaign through efforts such as the first-ever 
debate among leading presidential candidates Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas opened the debate by borrowing a line used by former President Ronald 
Reagan in his 1980 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a situation in which the majority of Mexicans are not satisfied," 
he said. "Nobody can say we are better off than in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
stressed his government experience and said the Aug. 21 election would be a 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elections are about the future of Mexico, of our families, our children," 
Zedillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 million Mexicans were expected to tune in to the debate, which also 
included Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party.

 Japan's Empress Michiko has almost fully recovered the power of speech, nearly 
seven months after being struck with a mystery ailment, the imperial palace 
said.The empress collapsed on her 59th birthday Oct. 20. Although first signs 
pointed to a minor stroke, palace officials said later tests showed no brain 
damage. They attributed her inability to speak to deep depression over critical 
articles in the press.

 Relief workers rushed food to thousands of refugees in Kigali when the rebels 
slowed their attacks and lifted the bombardment of the capital.Fierce exchanges 
of rocket, howitzer and mortar fire in recent days had blocked deliveries of 
food to about 15,000 refugees under U.N. protection. Two cargo planes landed at 
the airport with emergency supplies. "The place is so quiet we are attempting 
to make some deliveries," U.N. spokesman Abdul Kabia said.

ARMOR DISCOUNTED AS FACTOR IN SOMALIA RAID; MILITARY: CASUALTIES IN ILL-FATED 
OCT. 3 ACTION PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH LOWER WITH REQUESTED TANKS, 
ARMY TELLS SENATE PANELISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 American military casualties in October's ill-fated raid in Somalia probably 
would not have been substantially lower, even if the Pentagon had provided the 
tanks and heavy armor requested by U.S. commanders, the Army told Congress on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. William Garrison, who headed the joint special operations command in 
Somalia at the time of the Oct. 3 raid, said the 18 Rangers who were killed 
probably would have died even if the additional armor had been deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gotten there quicker, but I do not believe it would have had 
any significant impact on the casualties we suffered," he told the Senate Armed 
Services Committee in his first public appearance since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he ordered his Army Ranger battalion into action, confident he had 
sufficient firepower to complete the mission. He said that tanks and other 
heavy armor would only have made it more difficult to maintain the key element 
of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony appeared to deflect some of the blame from former Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin said after the raid that he had turned down U.S. commanders' request for 
more armor because he feared that Congress would object if the Administration 
appeared to be increasing the U.S. presence abroad at a time when it had 
asserted that the United States was winding down its operations in Somalia. 
That decision has been blamed in part for President Clinton's decision to 
replace Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrison conceded that the addition of some AC-130 Spectre gunships, also 
requested by U.S. commanders in Somalia, might have given U.S. troops a 
psychological advantage, because Somali guerrillas were so afraid of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question it would have been beneficial," he said, referring to 
the presence of more AC-130s, equipped with laser-guided cannon. But he added: 
"I believe I had more than enough (firepower) to offset not having the AC-130 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison appeared as part of an Armed Services Committee inquiry into the 
deadly incident, an abortive attempt to capture then-fugitive Somali clan chief 
Mohammed Farah Aidid. The clash also left 84 U.S. Rangers wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively large number of casualties stunned the American public and 
prompted a decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Somalia by March 31. The 
last American forces left the country a week before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison's assessment was shared, though with caveats, by Army Maj. Gen. 
Thomas Montgomery, who had made the request for more armor. Montgomery was 
deputy commander of U.N. operations in Somalia at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said that the addition of the M1-A1 tanks and Bradley fighting 
vehicles that he had requested almost certainly would have reduced the time it 
took for rescue troops to reach the Rangers and increased their firepower as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 But he insisted that the Rangers' casualties "would not have been fewer" had 
the armor been available then, because most of the casualties occurred in parts 
of the attack in which armored units would not have been present anyway.

HOUSE OVERHAULS 'NANNY TAX' TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE; CONGRESS: LAW THAT TRIPPED 
UP ZOE BAIRD IS SIMPLIFIED TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS FOR DOMESTIC 
HELP. SENATE BILL HAS DIFFERENT PROVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The House voted unanimously Thursday to overhaul the "nanny tax" that helped 
torpedo the attorney general nomination of Zoe Baird in the early days of the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim is to promote wider compliance with a tax law that the federal 
government estimates is ignored by three of four employers of household 
workers. By failing to pay the tax, employers effectively cheat employees out 
of Social Security retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 420-0 roll call, the House approved a bill that would raise the threshold 
for paying Social Security taxes. Now, employers are required to pay the tax 
when an employee's wages reach $50 a quarter. The bill would require employers 
to pay taxes on wages of $1,250 annually and higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would begin in 1995 -- if the bill becomes law. First, though, the 
measure must be reconciled with a slightly different Senate version. Then it 
must be passed again by both chambers and signed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill would allow employers of housekeepers and child-care workers to 
pay the tax either through payroll deductions or once a year when they file 
federal income tax returns. The law now requires quarterly payments. Employers 
would also be required to file an annual statement of wages paid on a W-2 form. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate bill would impose Social Security taxes for household workers on 
wages of $620 a year or more and would exempt payments made to baby-sitters and 
yard workers under 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of Baird and her husband to pay Social Security taxes for two 
household employees, both of whom were also illegal immigrants, led to the 
withdrawal of her nomination for attorney general early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar "nanny tax" problems plagued other prospective Clinton Administration 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) said hundreds of thousands of household 
workers are affected by the failure to pay this tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely wrong that people who work all their lives do not get Social 
Security benefits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another provision of the bill would bar payment of Social Security and 
Medicare benefits to persons confined to mental institutions under a court 
order because they have been found not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity. 
The prohibition would also apply to those sent to mental facilities who are not 
mentally competent to stand trial for crimes.

RICH GET RICHER FLOUTING U.N. SANCTIONS ON HAITI; CARIBBEAN: EXEMPTIONS 
DESIGNED TO HELP THE POOR SURVIVE THE CRACKDOWN ARE BEING SUBVERTED FOR 
'ENORMOUS PROFITS.'

<P>
 Exemptions designed to help the suffering poor here survive tougher U.N. 
sanctions that take effect soon already are being subverted for "enormous 
profits" by the very targets of the international crackdown, diplomats and 
humanitarian aid experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the unintended benefactors are some of the richest, most powerful 
Haitian elite. They supported the 1991 coup that overthrew President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and have financially backed the military since. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people the embargo is supposed to drive out of power are already getting 
rich and will get even richer," said an official of a large private relief 
agency, "because they now control the import of the food exempted by the 
sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a U.N. Security Council resolution passed last Friday, the only 
trade that will be allowed here, starting May 21, will be in food and 
humanitarian-related items. And while the resolution calls for freezing assets 
and banning international travel for the military and its civilian allies, 
there are no provisions to prevent them from importing items exempted from 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and other foreign officials identify the Mev family, one of Haiti's 
richest and the most powerful allies of those who led the coup, as controlling 
the import of sugar, vegetable oil and much of the propane permitted for 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 It has already been disclosed that they are involved in the cement business 
with Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the national police chief who played a 
crucial role in the 1991 coup and who has been named by U.N. officials as being 
responsible for severe, large-scale human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brandt family -- identified by the United States as major supporters of 
the coup -- "dominate the import of nearly all the wheat and rice brought into 
the country" as well as controlling currency exchange, an American official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has been subject to various levels of sanctions since the coup, all 
measures aimed at driving out the military regime and restoring Aristide. But 
the sanctions, instead, have hurt the 95% of Haitians who live in extreme 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions have enriched army officers and their civilian allies through 
government corruption and their control of the extensive smuggling, 
particularly in gasoline, that has grown out of the usually weak, incomplete 
measures imposed on Haiti by the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the tougher sanctions ordered last week by the U.N. Security 
Council will end such profiteering by shutting down all trade, except for food 
and humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "These items are exempt," said an official of one of the largest private 
relief agencies, "so the very people who are supposed to be punished are being 
allowed to get even richer." 
</P>
<P>
 A diplomat noted: "Keep in mind, Haiti now imports most of its basic food 
needs, even rice, beans and sugar, and the Mevs (and) Brandts . . . have been 
careful to establish their control over these products, which include the 
importation of normal fresh and packaged foods to be sold commercially here. 
So, even if the embargo shuts down everything else they operate, they still get 
rich." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new sanctions, the military-supporting elite "may not be able to fly 
to Miami," another official said. "But I don't think they care." 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate how the rich get richer by flouting sanctions, Haitian experts, 
American officials and other diplomats pointed to the activities of civilian 
front men for Francois, who controls the smuggling of gasoline and other fuel 
oils. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a major gas smuggler is Gerald Caroli, who lives in the southern 
seaside town of Jacmel and is a longtime associate of Francois and other 
military officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroli, they said, has been responsible for smuggling millions of gallons of 
fuel from the neighboring Dominican Republic since U.N. sanctions on importing 
gas in Haiti took effect last October. His gross profits from his operations 
since then have gone as high as 400%, experts said. They said he has restored 
40% of the fuel supply used by Haiti before the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the Dominican border is crucial to enforcement. But this is a doubtful 
prospect, U.S. Embassy officials say. Even if it happens, several army 
officers, financed by civilian allies, have purchased small ships to continue 
smuggling gas and other banned items. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are betting that these ships will be small enough and run close enough 
to shore to escape detection or capture," one Haitian expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroli's major clients include the U.S. Embassy, which has bought so much 
black market gas for its generators and vehicles -- including private cars of 
American diplomats -- that its budget is at least $300,000 in the red, State 
Department officials in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is so serious," an official here said, "that (they) may be 
forced to cut the size of the embassy staff." 
</P>
<P>
 American sources said the huge bills reflect excessive, possibly abusive use 
of gas from the black market. It supplies almost all who drive here -- 
including foreign journalists -- since the only non-government humanitarian 
groups, such as National Catholic Relief Services and CARE, are exempt from the 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the problem was one of availability, (embassy staffers) were told they 
could have almost no gas for personal cars and very limited amounts for home 
use (in generators)," a source said. "Much of the embassy was dark. But since 
the smuggling made it available, the only problem was cost" -- about $10 to $12 
per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were senior officials who were running their home generators as much as 
16 hours a day," the source said, adding that "diplomats were permitted 10 
gallons a week for their personal cars. There was a mini-scandal around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said he would investigate the allegations of 
abuses of black market fuel, but after four days he had offered no response.

ACCEPT HAITIAN REFUGEES, U.N. OFFICIAL ASKS CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The United Nations' top refugee official met with President Clinton on 
Thursday and appealed to him to allow more Haitian refugees to remain in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said the Clinton 
Administration's estimate that only 5% of the refugees are likely to qualify 
for political asylum is far too low. She urged the United States to give at 
least temporary refuge to all Haitians who seek it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sending people back to an area where there is repression and a threat to 
their lives is against the principle of refugee protection," she said in an 
interview before her White House meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important that the United States hold a policy of not returning 
people to Haiti . . ," she said. "There is generalized violence in Haiti. 
Returning people there is like returning people to Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that the Administration could provide "temporary protection" to 
refugees without necessarily offering all of them the right to live in the 
United States permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has maintained a George Bush Administration policy of intercepting 
Haitian refugees at sea and sending virtually all of them back home -- even 
though he denounced the practice as "immoral" during his 1992 campaign. The 
President and his aides have said that admitting Haitians to the United States 
could produce a huge influx of the refugees, often called boat people because 
of the rickety craft they employ to flee their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Clinton changed the policy, permitting all Haitian refugees 
to be offered a hearing -- either aboard ships or in other countries -- to 
determine whether any are genuine political refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But both the President and his aides said they had no plan to open the doors 
of the United States to the vast majority of Haitian refugees. They said they 
expect only about 5% of Haitian refugees to qualify for asylum. And they have 
asked Canada and other countries to accept some of those. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogata said her agency, however, believes the 5% figure is too low, because it 
is based on Haitians who have applied for asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti. 
"We think there are genuine political refugees who are afraid to apply at the 
embassy," an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogata said the Administration has asked her agency to run the refugee camps 
envisioned in Clinton's new screening policy and has asked other countries to 
accept some of the refugees. A U.S. official confirmed the request was made of 
Canada, France and some Caribbean nations but said that none has agreed to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can expect other countries to do that and not offer them a 
place yourself," she said. UNITED STATES

15 NAMED TO COUNCIL SET TO RULE PALESTINIANS; MIDEAST: NEW AUTHORITY COULD TAKE 
OVER NEXT WEEK FROM ISRAELIS. TEN MEMBERS MUST STILL BE APPOINTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A 15-member authority was appointed Thursday to become the Palestinians' first 
government of their own in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian leaders 
said the new council could assume power with the last Israeli troop withdrawal 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat conveyed the names to 
Israel under an agreement that the remaining 10 members of the 25-person 
authority, whose appointments have been delayed because of political turmoil 
within the Palestinian ranks, will be named later. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat will head the authority, which includes two women, two former 
deportees, members of the PLO Executive Committee and some of the most 
influential Palestinian leaders within the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including 
Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Saeb Erekat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't easy," Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said of the delay in 
naming the Palestinian Authority. "This is the first Cabinet the Palestinian 
people have ever had to run their affairs in their country." 
</P>
<P>
 In the occupied territories, Palestinian police completed their initial 
deployment in the town of Rafah on the Egyptian border, the largest town so far 
to come under Palestinian control. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 23 Palestinian police arrived in Jericho, the West Bank town that 
will be the seat of government of the new Palestinian Authority. But 300 more 
officers were held up on the Allenby Bridge at the Jordan border in a delay PLO 
officials expected would be resolved overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The arduous process of getting a new Palestinian government in place -- 
delayed after many Palestinians expressed reluctance to serve because they 
oppose the peace plan and Arafat's single-handed management style -- mirrors 
the halting deployment of Palestinian police; both have been beset with severe 
logistic and economic problems in the days since the peace agreement was signed 
May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said arriving Palestinian forces were halted for days by Yemen's raging 
civil war and had to travel by bus and truck from Libya's southern border near 
Chad. Further, PLO officials in Egypt were left drastically short of cash for 
the police deployment, prompting Shaath to send an urgent cable to Arafat over 
the weekend begging for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath told Arafat he had sent $60,000, secured through personal loans and 
guarantees, to finance the entry of the first police. "I cannot do more. . . . 
I cannot perform miracles," Shaath told the PLO leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Thursday in Cairo, Shaath said he was trying to finance 
the initial deployment with only a $2-million grant from Norway in hand -- less 
than half the first month's salary for the 9,000-member Palestinian police 
force. "We really had very, very tough financial problems last week," he said, 
adding that forthcoming grants will ease the crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 A $5-million grant from the United States to fund the police deployment is due 
to arrive on Tuesday; $8.6 million from the European Union is due in two to 
three weeks; Germany has recently pledged $350,000 and France $2.4 million 
worth of communications equipment. Japan has agreed to provide $10 million for 
building 300 housing units for incoming police. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the naming of the initial contingent of the Palestinian Authority 
will allow normal business to be conducted. "With the naming of the first 15 
names, which will be in place soon, we will be able to constitute the 
Palestinian Authority on the ground very soon," he said. "The normal business 
of governing will start, and then the tougher questions will have to be 
answered." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication of what persuaded some West Bank leaders, 
unenthusiastic about the peace agreement and with a history of strong disputes 
with Arafat over his leadership style, to serve. But Shaath, who is among those 
named to the authority, said all of those serving expect it to represent a 
genuine voice of democracy in the fledgling Palestinian homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, blinded rulers don't see that democracy is the best way a ruler 
has to go get cooperation and acceptance from his people," he said. "Democracy 
is the best way anybody has ever discovered to marshal people's efforts without 
edict." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashrawi, the Palestinians' spokeswoman in peace talks with Israel in 
Washington, is joined on the authority by another woman, Intisar Wazir, 
popularly known as Om Jihad, widow of slain PLO official Abu Jihad. Shaath said 
he expected that several other women would be appointed when the full 25-member 
list is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The list is weighted with Arafat's Fatah faction but includes at least two 
smaller PLO factions in an attempt to assure broad-based backing for the new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday in Cairo, delegates from 40 nations, discussing the plight of 
Palestinians around the world, announced that donors have pledged more than $50 
million since October to help refugees who will not immediately benefit from 
the autonomy plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said it will be at least two to four weeks before Israel and its 
neighbors begin deciding on readmission for an estimated 800,000 Palestinians 
displaced from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East War.

VICTIMS EMERGE AS KEY FORCE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM; ACTIVISM: A MOVEMENT 
WITH SEARING CREDIBILITY HAS MOVED BEYOND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO BECOME A PRIME 
FACTOR IN MAKING CRIME THE NATION'S NO. 1 CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The first time Ralph Hubbard visited a prison, he sat alone in the parking lot 
for half an hour, his stomach churning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard, 62, a tough former cop, certainly knew criminals. But now he was 
facing them in a searing new role. When his only son was shot to death after a 
senseless argument over a videotape, he joined the swelling army of Americans 
who know helplessness, frustration and rage as victims of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 After the murder, he punched a hole in a wall. He wept almost every day for 
eight months, alone, too proud to show his tears, on the top floor of his home 
in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Hubbard's anguish turned to action. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a board member of Parents of Murdered Children of New York State, 
and that role brought him to Rikers Island, the world's largest detention 
center, with 14,800 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never just stand and forgive the person," he told a prisoner who 
asked about his son's killer. "I wanted to get my gun and go out and find him 
and blow him away. But I had responsibilities. . . . I did not push that one 
button that would have made me go over the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard's meeting with the prisoners in the Rikers library -- a recounting of 
his tragedy designed to confront criminals with the carnage they cause -- is 
just one example of the activism of the crime victims movement in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Hubbard ventured where victims did not go a few years ago, advocates 
for victims can now be found in courts, prosecutors' offices, churches, 
hospitals, mental health facilities and social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In two decades the movement has grown to more than 9,000 organizations with 
millions of members, ranging from Mothers Against Drunk Driving to the Family 
Violence Prevention Fund to Concerns of Police Survivors, which helps relatives 
of slain officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, victims-rights advocates have become a prime mover in making 
crime the nation's No. 1 concern. They are the centerpiece of media focus on 
the effects of crime. They are the most numerous voices for stiffer penalties. 
They are demanding -- and increasingly getting -- action from police, 
prosecutors, parole boards and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime victims have one horrible badge -- credibility," said Jay Howell, a 
former prosecutor in Jacksonville, Fla., who helped set up the National Center 
for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims movement has shown . . . that it is increasingly well-organized, 
that it is mobilized, that it is motivated and that it has become a powerful 
force in passing legislation," said G. Morris Gurley, vice president of the 
National Victim Center, a group dedicated to securing fair treatment for crime 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 And politicians are calling the groups, soliciting support. "Suddenly, 
everybody is looking and saying: 'We've got to get on the bandwagon,' " Gurley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the public's mood at the start of his reelection campaign, Gov. Pete 
Wilson presided at a crime summit with the mothers and fathers of murder 
victims. State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, running to be his Democratic opponent, 
has also been conferring with advocates for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is seeking a fourth term, has been meeting 
with victims groups and was the principal speaker at candlelight memorial 
services in Manhattan commemorating National Crime Victims Week. The city's new 
Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, also spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has taped a TV commercial against violence directed at 
children and met recently with a few crime victims at the White House. 
Administration members were highly visible at a conference on family violence 
sponsored in Washington by the American Medical Assn., several foundations and 
victims rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala addressed the meeting with Shalala pledging: "The President has shown 
his unwavering commitment to our cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Heightened media focus on victims, particularly by TV's "reality" shows, has 
added to the national outrage over crime. TV producers are scrambling to find 
victims with gripping stories that can be converted to potentially high-ratings 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeding frenzy," said Michael I. Rudell, a New York entertainment 
lawyer who represents TV personalities and producers. "There is not only 
inter-network competition. There is intra-network competition between shows." 
</P>
<P>
 The producers usually don't have to look very far. A murder occurs in the 
United States every 21 minutes, a robbery every 46 seconds and more than one 
rape a minute. In 1992, 23% of U.S. households were victimized by a crime of 
violence or theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming a victim of crime makes victims want others not to have to 
experience what they did," said Anne K. Seymour, a longtime advocate for 
victims who has worked closely with the criminal-justice community. "That is 
the strength of the victims movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement began in 1963 when the government of New Zealand established the 
first victims compensation program. California started the first program in the 
United States two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, groups zeroed in on the lack of victims rights in the 
criminal-justice system. Victims were not kept informed about court cases or 
notified about vital proceedings. They were forced to wait long hours -- 
sometimes in the presence of their attackers -- before testifying. Victims 
complained they had no voice in the filing of charges, plea-bargaining or 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy N. Friedman, executive director of New York's Victim Services, the 
nation's largest victim-assistance organization, said: "We would hear these 
horror stories about rape victims walking into a police precinct and having the 
desk sergeant yell: 'Would the victim of the rape last night come forward?' We 
would hear the mother of a homicide victim saying that when she asked when the 
next adjournment was going to be on the case, the assistant district attorney 
would say: 'Why do you want to know? You weren't the victim or you weren't a 
witness to the crime.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In more than two decades, the victims movement has scored some notable 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 All 50 states now have compensation programs making direct payments to victims 
for such expenses as unpaid medical bills, mental health counseling and funeral 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the Justice Department set up the Office for Victims of Crime to 
administer a fund to funnel money to state compensation programs. The office 
also makes direct grants to victim assistance organizations. Federal courts and 
U.S. attorneys collect fines and other penalties from convicted criminals to 
pay for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' bills of rights ensuring dignified and respectful treatment, 
including the right to participate in key legal proceedings, have been adopted 
by most states. 
</P>
<P>
 All states now include some input from victims in sentencing, with at least 35 
allowing victims to appear in court to make a statement before a judge renders 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 14 states have passed constitutional amendments that would guarantee 
victims the right to be present, informed and heard at all key stages of the 
criminal-justice process. Maryland, Idaho and Utah have such an amendment on 
the ballot this year. 
</P>
<P>
 All U.S. attorneys and many district attorneys have established victim 
assistance programs. Typically, they notify victims of the key steps in their 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Victim Center's legislative database has grown to 20,000 
statutes, ranging from laws allowing child victims to provide testimony on 
videotape to up-to-the-minute information about the status of the state 
constitutional amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached the point where the rules are on the books," said David 
Beatty, the center's public affairs director. "Now we are trying to (win) the 
hearts and minds of people charged with implementing those rules." 
</P>
<P>
 But major problems still exist. Many state compensation funds face serious 
financial difficulties. Federal contributions vary from year to year, depending 
on the amount of criminal fines collected, while the number of victims seeking 
money is rising. In New York state, a backlog of 17,000 claims exists, and the 
waiting period victims face for payment is about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 While many judges throughout the nation order offenders to pay restitution, 
enforcement often is spotty and many convicted criminals don't pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, victims organizations have branched out, operating shelters and 
support groups for battered women, day-care centers in courts and 
student-mediation projects that try to prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
 They also train police officers to be sensitive to victims' needs and help 
hospital workers to detect signs of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In some hospitals, advocates for victims seek out new parents at high risk for 
child abuse and provide continuing counseling when they go home with their 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August, 1986, when 14 people were murdered at a post office in Edmond, 
Okla., organizations in the movement have sent trauma teams to the scenes of 65 
disasters -- including plane crashes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and mass 
murders -- to help both survivors and rescuers cope with crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We train volunteers every year who are ready to go at a moment's notice," 
said Marlene Young, executive director of the National Organization for Victim 
Assistance, a Washington group dedicated to victims rights and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims movement has moved beyond its original goals," she added. "Now we 
are focused not only on the direct victims of crime, but we also can recognize 
the impact on family members, friends and the community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 That is partly why Hubbard made his trip to Rikers Island. Here was an 
opportunity to put a face on the consequences of violence, to humanize himself 
and underline his family's ordeal after the death of his son. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prisoners -- some of them convicted murderers -- listened, Hubbard told 
them how his wife isolated herself in their Brooklyn home for months after the 
murder. He recounted how his eldest daughter found him, his eyes red from 
crying. " 'You see these shoulders?' " he recalled her asking. " 'You made 
these shoulders so therefore you can cry on them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He told how his wife finally snapped out of her depression. He said he 
recalled to her an incident in which their son had eaten his own son's 
sandwich. With a straight face, their grandson said the sandwich was part of 
his school science project and he had put four worms between the bread, which 
caused their son to throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 The story made his wife roar with laughter. "She was on her knees and holding 
her belly and she was just going nuts," Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he said, they stayed up and hugged and talked most of the night, 
and when Hubbard woke up the next morning his wife was gone. The phone rang. 
She was calling to say she was out having her hair and nails done. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the breakthrough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only one set of tear ducts in the human body," he told the 
prisoners, "tears of joy and tears of sorrow. Tears of joy are really large."

CLINTON PICKS TRADE OFFICIAL FOR POST AT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John R. Schmidt, a Chicago lawyer who specializes in corporate mergers and who 
served as chief U.S. negotiator in world trade talks, will be nominated for the 
No. 3 post at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno announced Thursday that President Clinton had picked 
Schmidt, an early fund-raiser for his presidential campaign, as associate 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt, 50, would succeed Webster Hubbell, who resigned March 14 to resolve a 
dispute with his former partners at the Rose Law Firm over his billing 
practices and personal expenses. The Little Rock, Ark., firm has filed a 
complaint against him with the state Supreme Court Committee on Professional 
Conduct. 
</P>

STATE HIGH COURT TO REVIEW SANTA ANA'S HOMELESS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN and LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recognizing cities' vexing uncertainties about regulating the homeless, the 
California Supreme Court voted Thursday to review a Santa Ana ordinance that 
prohibits camping on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 Four justices voted to review a February decision by the 4th District Court of 
Appeal that struck down Santa Ana's homeless ordinance as unconstitutional. The 
appellate court wrote that "punishment for poverty -- which the camping 
ordinance surely is -- is cruel and unusual punishment."  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said: "We're pleased the (state) Supreme 
Court has decided to take this case. The appellate decision set new precedent 
for all cities in the state of California. It essentially abdicated their power 
to legislate what happens on public property." 
</P>
<P>
 If the court had rejected Santa Ana's petition, Cooper said, the city would 
have taken its case to the U.S. Supreme Court and may still do so if it loses 
this round. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court's interest in the case worries some homeless 
advocates, who were pleased with the lower court ruling. Four conservatives on 
the high court voted to review it: Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas and Justices 
Armand Arabian, Marvin R. Baxter and Ronald M. George. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am wary," said Harry Simon, staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society of 
Orange County. "The people who voted to grant review are not the most liberal 
members of the court, and it is among the most conservative Supreme Courts in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and opponents of the city's ordinance said the Supreme Court's 
decision probably will affect similar regulations throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be significant throughout the state. . . ," said E. Thomas 
Dunn Jr., deputy district attorney in Orange County. "We have to have some 
authoritative statement from the high court to tell us what the legal 
perimeters are and how we should be dealing with these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Kevin Phillips, however, said that the 
Supreme Court's decision may have limited ramifications, because Santa Ana's 
ordinance is much broader than similar laws passed by other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's ordinance, passed in 1992, was aimed at clearing homeless people 
off city property, particularly the Civic Center Plaza. Homeless advocates lost 
an attempt to invalidate it in Orange County Superior Court before prevailing 
in the appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, in the meantime, passed a second ordinance to clear the homeless 
from the Civic Center area only. The Legal Aid Society, which challenged the 
more sweeping ordinance, is challenging this one too. The matter will be heard 
in Superior Court in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance now before the state Supreme Court prohibits people from using a 
blanket or sleeping bag to sleep on any public property, thereby forcing the 
homeless to "leave Santa Ana," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has stirred conservative legal groups across the country, who say the 
appellate decision sided with the homeless at the expense of taxpaying 
residents and hampered cities' abilities to control public property. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something inherently wrong with the court construing constitutional 
rights so broadly that they trump everybody else's rights," said John Schmidt, 
an attorney with Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the California Supreme Court issues a favorable decision for Santa Ana, it 
may help all cities basically provide safe public parks for the citizens and 
taxpayers. The obligation of government is to provide social order so people 
can pursue their individual goals. Government does not have the duty to provide 
property to people who are homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The League of California Cities also wrote to the court in support of Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But others in the state -- including council members from Watsonville, Santa 
Cruz, Pasadena and Laguna Beach -- criticized the ordinance and urged the 
Supreme Court in recent months not to take up the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to me that the ordinance that was originally passed was so general 
in nature that it really sort of penalized people for being homeless and asked 
them to move on when there really was no place to move on to," said Laguna 
Beach Councilwoman Lida Lenney, who, like the others, wrote to the court 
independently and not on behalf of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The position of my letter was that we need to work together to solve the 
homeless problem in Orange County and passing laws like these is not really the 
right approach. I don't think making people move on is a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has about 975 permanent shelter beds and an estimated 12,000 to 
15,000 homeless people, said Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County 
Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's upheld that these kind of anti-camping ordinances are constitutional 
and lawful, what's to stop every city in Orange County from having one?" he 
said. "And then where do people go? They've got to go somewhere. They can't 
just float in the air."

MAN KILLED AS TRAIN HITS CAR; FATALITY: VICTIM APPARENTLY COMMITTED SUICIDE 
AFTER BREAKUP WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. METROLINK PASSENGERS DELAYED BUT UNHURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old man, apparently distraught over a break-up with his girlfriend, 
backed his car onto railroad tracks Thursday morning and was killed by a 
northbound Metrolink train with more than 200 passengers aboard, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was the second fatal train incident in Orange County this week and 
the first in the county involving the new Metrolink commuter line, which made 
its Orange County debut March 28, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the incident appeared to be a suicide, but the county 
coroner's office had not completed its investigation Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies had been searching for the crash victim, David Michael 
Gavin, since Wednesday evening, when they were called to his Laguna Niguel home 
on a report of a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was gone when we got there," said Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. "His 
girlfriend told us that she had been assaulted by him when she tried to end 
their relationship." Authorities said Gavin, his girlfriend and their year-old 
child lived together. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavin was not seen again until he was found at the scene of the crash, which 
occurred at Camino Capistrano, south of Avery Parkway, at 6:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer was unable to stop the northbound train, which was traveling 
about 65 m.p.h. when it plowed into Gavin's Isuzu Impulse, dragging it beneath 
the 100-ton locomotive for a quarter-mile, said Metrolink spokesman Peter 
Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The train was making a curve when the engineer noticed a motorist had backed 
onto the tracks," Hidalgo said. "He blew his horn and immediately applied the 
brakes but the individual did not move." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at a railroad crossing on private property, one of five 
private crossings in the county. Because access is restricted to the property 
owner, no crossing arm or flashing lights are required. However, warning 
stripes were painted on the street and a warning sign was posted in compliance 
with state and federal regulations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the passengers or crew members on the train were injured, but some 
were delayed in reaching their destinations by as much as three hours. 
Passengers were placed on buses and taken to their respective stops. 
</P>
<P>
 A second northbound Metrolink train, not involved in the crash, was delayed in 
reaching Los Angeles by one hour. Southbound train traffic was not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger Evelyn McNitt Silk said the incident was the third in three years in 
which she was riding a train involved in a fatal incident. Silk, a nurse 
practitioner, ran out of the train and attempted to help Gavin, who died at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally, it really upsets you," Silk said. "The most upsetting thing is 
someone getting injured or killed. And then you are hours late for work. I'm 
really shook up and I think I will be for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Another passenger, Ann Cutchall, an attorney who began riding the Metrolink 
train shortly after its debut, said, "This is my first experience like this and 
I hope it is my last experience. I said a prayer for the man in the car, but I 
understand he died. It's a very sad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound, rush-hour traffic on Interstate 5, which runs near the crash 
scene, was backed up as much as seven miles in a snarl that lasted about three 
hours after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's incident was the second in three days in which someone apparently 
committed suicide by moving in front of a train traveling though the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, a 17-year-old girl dived onto railroad tracks in front of a 
southbound Amtrak train in what authorities have officially labeled a suicide. 
None of the train's more than 100 passengers were injured in that incident, but 
they were delayed on the tracks for almost three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, an Irvine resident, apparently had made statements to family 
members about suicide following a family argument. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Railroad Administration officials said a train collides with a vehicle 
about every 90 minutes in the United States. More than a thousand pedestrians 
were killed or injured by trains last year as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the leading causes of death in our industry," said spokesman John 
Fitzpatrick. "They are almost always preventable if people understand the laws 
of crossings and obey them. Many of the collisions are accidents, but it's safe 
to say that a significant number are suicides." 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said that so far this year, they have distributed 500,000 
safety flyers to Orange County residents who live along the railroad tracks and 
have made safety presentations to about 70,000 students at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, railroad officials said, there is only so much they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, some of these things aren't preventable," said Amtrak 
spokesman Howard Robertson. "We find that even the best fence in the world is 
not going to deter someone from getting through and taking their own life."

CONROY PROPOSES PADDLING GRAFFITI VANDALS; CRIME: LEGISLATOR SAYS FAVORABLE 
COMMENTS ON SINGAPORE CANING OF AMERICAN TEEN GAVE HIM THE IDEA. CRITICS CALL 
IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a cue from the celebrated caning case in Singapore, an Orange County 
lawmaker is preparing a bill to require paddling of juvenile graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) said he was prodded into pursuing the 
idea by constituents caught up in the highly publicized debate about the caning 
of an American teen-ager for spraying paint on cars in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I was hearing from the public was, 'Why can't we do something like 
this? Our graffiti problem is so bad,' " Conroy said. "I'm not a crusader for 
beating up on children, but I'm also not for children beating up on adults or 
defacing property." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure has not been introduced, the notion of importing the 
caning concept to California did not sit well with several legal scholars or 
legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That clearly would be considered cruel and unusual punishment in this 
country," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. "We haven't had public whippings 
and lynchings since practically the Middle Ages around here. To come back with 
that now is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor and nationally recognized expert in 
criminal law, said "there's not a snowball's chance in hell" that the bill 
would pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is significant about this proposal is not the likelihood of its 
enactment, but the fact that it was made at all," Arenella said, adding that it 
reflects "the current hysterical" debate about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, contended his bill could survive a court test, noting that 
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia -- the intellectual leader of the 
court's conservative wing -- said in a talk last week in San Francisco that he 
believes caning is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Justice Scalia thinks it's constitutional, why should we question it?" 
Conroy said. "He's more of a constitutional scholar than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the urgings by constituents, Conroy said he was inspired by 
several of his young staff members who began discussing the merits of corporal 
punishment when headlines appeared about the Singapore case. Michael Fay, an 
18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, received four strokes of a 
rattan cane May 5 after being found guilty of vandalism in the island nation 
and was also sentenced to four months in jail and a $2,230 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy has asked the legislative counsel for an opinion on his proposal, which 
would require that a physician be present. As now drawn, the bill would allow 
no more than six whacks. Conroy said the punishment should be carried out in a 
public forum with a paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 While public caning has not been widely practiced in the United States for 
generations, Conroy recalled that when he was a Marine Corps officer stationed 
in North Carolina he heard about parents ordered to paddle their children in 
court as punishment for juvenile crimes. It served, he said, as an effective 
attitude adjuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point behind this is deterrence, not punishment," Conroy said. "It could 
prove to be an effective way to change the lives of some youngsters who are now 
on the wrong track." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy also insisted that he is not trying to whip up election-year publicity, 
and would drop his effort if the public does not embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
 If he goes forward, Conroy would introduce the bill as part of the 
Legislature's continuing special session on crime, which has already yielded a 
bumper crop of tough anti-crime bills. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Fay episode, supporters of the flogging littered Congress and the 
Singapore Embassy with telephone calls and letters. Meanwhile, one nationwide 
poll found that three-quarters of all Americans thought caning would be the 
appropriate punishment for graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiments reflect an American tradition. From the pillory to the paddle, 
the United States has a long history of corporal punishment. The Continental 
Congress drew up regulations in 1775 permitting flogging on American warships, 
and it wasn't abolished until 1850. The last legal whipping for a crime 
occurred in Delaware in 1952. Today, 23 states still allow corporal punishment 
-- mostly paddling -- in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark A.R. Kleiman, an associate professor at Harvard University's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government, suggested that Conroy's bill could be abused by 
the courts or penal system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd go overboard," Kleiman said. "Rather than basing punishment on the 
merits of a case, some county judge would start randomly handing out canings to 
anyone who looked like they simply needed a good flogging." 
</P>
<P>
 Kleiman speculated that state and federal courts could declare caning to be 
constitutional, but suggested it is inappropriate to rely on judicial 
interpretations to determine the merits of Conroy's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obscene to pluck out graffiti for corporal punishment as opposed to 
something more serious, like assault and battery," Kleiman said. "I admit I 
sometimes come across graffiti and would like to see the guy who did it at the 
other end of a stick. But that's not necessarily a sane reaction. . . . This is 
one trial balloon that ought to be punctured."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WHITE HOUSE AIDE HEARS FROM ELDERLY 
</P>

<P>
 Health care, nutrition, housing and economic security emerged Thursday as key 
priorities for the elderly as a visiting White House representative urged 
Southern California senior citizens to make their concerns known to national 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these concerns are exclusive to one generation, they affect young and 
old," Bob Blancato said at a forum in Costa Mesa. "We want to approach aging 
reform as an issue that everyone should be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 Blancato, newly appointed executive director of the White House Conference on 
Aging, opened his keynote address to about 70 senior citizens at the Red Lion 
Inn by asking the crowd to voice its concerns, which he promised would be 
considered as part of the agenda at next year's national conference on aging in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Blancato, invited by the host California Assn. of Nutrition Directors for the 
Elderly, was appointed by President Clinton in February to head the newly 
formed office charged with gathering policy recommendations for the 1995 
conference. The Costa Mesa forum was the only one in Southern California that 
he plans to attend before the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are saying in this conference and in other mini-conferences around 
the country is let us not be parochial," he said. "We are coming to you, the 
state with the highest population of elderly citizens, and asking for 
recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Ross, chairwoman of the Senior Citizen Council of Orange County, said 
that people must be made aware that health care is a lifelong endeavor and that 
they should practice healthy lifestyles throughout their lives to avoid 
burdening the system in later years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't sit on our duff for 25 years or smoke and expect someone to take 
care of us later," she said. "There must be lifelong learning and a sense of 
responsibility for ourselves." BRIAN RAY BALLOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TREASURER CANDIDATE REITERATES CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Completing his analysis of county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's 
investments of public money, political challenger John M.W. Moorlach on 
Thursday reiterated his claim that Citron has been pursuing an overly risky 
strategy and has left the county's investment pool vulnerable to rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "After reviewing the portfolio, it becomes clear that the possibility of loss 
is real," Moorlach said. "I don't think that anyone could come to a different 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, a Costa Mesa certified public accountant, had been studying the 
county's management of a $7.5-billion portfolio for several weeks after 
obtaining treasurer records requested under the California Open Records Law. 
The portfolio contains contributions from more than 180 government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron is facing his first challenge in 24 years to the elected post of county 
treasurer, and Moorlach has waged an increasingly contentious campaign against 
him in recent weeks as the June 7 election nears. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron was unavailable for comment, but Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe 
said the candidate's conclusions differ little from his past criticisms of 
Citron's investment management strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the right to say what he wants," Raabe said. "But there are plenty of 
people who think that what we are doing is exactly the right strategy. He's 
been making the same claims for the past six weeks. I thought he would have 
something different to say by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach's recent review again takes issue with Citron's frequent use of 
"reverse repurchase agreements" to enhance investment returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy relies heavily on using the county investment pool's U.S. 
Treasury bills and bonds as collateral to borrow short term at low interest 
rates, and investing the borrowed funds in corporate bonds and securities that 
pay a higher rate of return. This can yield large returns while interest rates 
remain low and stable. But the strategy can also fail when interest rates rise, 
as they have in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, Moorlach said, the county has had to post an additional $300 
million in collateral because the value of the securities used to borrow the 
money has declined as interest rates have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe confirmed Moorlach's findings but indicated that the office was not 
concerned about the developments because the county investment pool is 
protected by about $1 billion in liquid assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach, however, said county officials are ignoring a potential problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If rates continue to soar, couldn't the size of the calls top $1 billion?" 
Moorlach asked rhetorically. "My problem is, why aren't people making a 
connection here? I have not been screaming fire in a theater. I have legitimate 
concerns." KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; MORATORIUM VOTED ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has imposed a moratorium on issuing permits for adult 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium may be lifted in June. In the meantime, the council adopted a 
temporary ordinance, placing stiff restrictions on adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, any adult-only establishments including cabarets, 
bookstores, motels, theaters and escort and dating services would be allowed to 
open only between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. and prohibited from selling or serving 
alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to receiving permission from the city to open adult businesses, 
applicants also would be required to obtain a business license and be located 
at least 1,000 feet from residential zones, churches, schools, parks or 
recreational facilities where children congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 That rules out most of the city except for a few commercial lots along Katella 
Avenue and Walker, Valley View and Holder streets. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the council adopted the temporary ordinance earlier this 
month because it realized it did not have strict guidelines to govern adult 
businesses. Officials said the city decided to draft the temporary law after 
receiving several inquiries by people who had expressed interest in opening 
such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 23, council members will decide whether to adopt the ordinance 
permanently or extend the current law and the moratorium for up to 10 1/2 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be putting in place an ordinance that we did not have 
previously," Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the new law also gives the city some control over adult businesses. 
"We have specific (requirements) for all different kinds of businesses but 
until now, nothing to address adult businesses." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CAR CHASE LEAVES TRAIL OF DAMAGE 
</P>

<P>
 A police pursuit of a stolen car, which reached speeds of nearly 100 m.p.h. on 
city streets, Thursday left at least six vehicles damaged and led to the arrest 
of two men, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase ended at Trask Avenue, east of Brookhurst Street, when a police 
cruiser rammed the stolen Mazda RX7, which had already hit four other vehicles, 
including another police car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the driver, Joseph Luna, 25, of West Covina, and his cousin, 
Robert Luna, 23, of Victorville, on suspicion of possession of a stolen 
vehicle; felony evasion of a police officer; assault with a deadly weapon on a 
police officer; and possession of burglary tools. They were being held at 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began just after 2 p.m. when Officer Chris Wasinger noticed the 
vehicle, which had been reported stolen at 11 a.m. in Covina, near Chapman 
Avenue and Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Woods said the Mazda accelerated, going up and down Haster Street 
after making a high-speed U-turn. Woods said Wasinger lost track of the Mazda 
on Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Dave Scroggins picked up the Mazda on Euclid Street, and the chase 
began anew. But this time, the Mazda struck at least three vehicles while 
attempting to evade the officer. Minutes later, police said, the Mazda struck a 
fourth vehicle and then hit a police vehicle driven by another officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggins then hit the Mazda from behind, boxing it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Luna, who police said was released recently from federal probation, 
attempted to flee the trapped Mazda and was arrested. Robert Luna, the 
passenger, was taken into custody in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries were reported. MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 5 FIRED FOR ALLEGED FIRE DEPT. PAY FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former acting fire chief, three other high-ranking officials of the 
Westminster Fire Department and one firefighter were fired Thursday for alleged 
payroll fraud, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials fired Don Herr, who was acting fire chief from May, 1992, to 
August, 1993, battalion chief Hal Raphael, fire captains Mike Garrison and Joe 
Wilson and firefighter-paramedic Dana Bowler. 
</P>
<P>
 The dismissals took effect Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, a lawyer who represented the employees and the Westminster 
Firefighters Assn., said the five were victims of "trumped up" charges by city 
political leaders who are facing a June 7 recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty clear that what the City Council has done was not only subject 
themselves to personal liability . . . but hurt the citizens for no reason at 
all other than to pursue their own political agenda," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he will file a suit to force the city to appoint an impartial 
arbitrator to hear the case, as provided by the firefighters contract with the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Don Anderson, who joined Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco 
Jr. in supporting the firings, said the fired employees have until May 23 to 
appeal their case to acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley. 
</P>
<P>
 Transcripts of the dismissal hearings conducted by Anderson last month 
indicated that the employees were charged with failing to provide required 
paperwork for sick leave and vacation time on numerous occasions over the past 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Herr and Raphael were also accused of allowing Paul Gilbrook, president of the 
firefighters union who was fired in February, to drive a firetruck while his 
driver's license was suspended in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two argued that Gilbrook was forced to take a 30-day leave, and that 
then-City Manager Jerry Kenny was aware of the leave and approved. Herr was the 
acting fire chief and Raphael was Gilbrook's immediate superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Herr also was charged with failing to submit documentation for sick leave and 
vacation leave on six occasions in 1993 and failing to require employees under 
his command to submit so-called transaction slips for sick leave, vacation 
leave and time taken off work. 
</P>
<P>
 Raphael was charged with failing to provide paperwork for time off on 12 
different occasions since 1986, although he said that each time he was on leave 
the proper deductions were made from his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison, Wilson and Bowler similarly were charged with failing to submit 
paperwork that city policy requires for those coming back from sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees argued during their hearing that the policy was not consistently 
enforced. They said they were being singled out because of their political 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing of Garrison, a union director, was also based on alleged 
unprofessional comments by him about a fire in January that claimed the life of 
a mentally disabled man. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison had been on suspension with pay since January. 
</P>
<P>
 The dismissals came two days after DeMonaco told council members that the 
reorganization of the Fire Department will be completed in August, regardless 
of the outcome of the June 7 recall election. Mayor Charles V. Smith, council 
members Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam are targets of the 
vote because of cuts in the Fire Department.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; BOARD BACKS PROP. 1B ON NEW SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District board has narrowly approved a resolution 
supporting a $1-billion state bond issue that would permit school districts to 
build new schools and modernize old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education voted 3 to 2 in favor of the resolution, with Trustees 
Sal Mendoza, Audrey Yamagata-Noji and Robert W. Balen voting to support 
it.Trustees Tom Chaffee and Rosemarie Avila opposed the resolution, saying they 
objected to the principle of passing bond measures that will only burden state 
taxpayers with more debt. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Diane Thomas said Santa Ana Unified is expected to 
benefit from the bond issue, although how much it would receive is unknown. The 
bond measure, known as Proposition 1B, is on next month's statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Balen said the district desperately needs new schools, adding: "It's paramount 
that we support the best interests of our children. I don't see how anybody 
could deny that we need additional classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila agreed that the district needs more class space, but she said that 
"we're really putting ourselves in debt through bond issues. I don't know that 
I have the information I need to balance the issues." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HOUSE PANEL OKS DISNEY PROJECT FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A House subcommittee Thursday gave its approval to a national transportation 
bill that includes $15 million to help pay for a massive parking structure the 
Walt Disney Co. says is central to its plans to expand Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous voice vote means the funds have cleared the first of many 
hurdles before the money reaches Orange County hands.But the endorsement of the 
House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee bestows a sort of blessing 
on the $15 million and sends a green light signaling the rest of Congress to 
approve the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal money would help build a 12,000-space garage that would allow 
Disneyland to remain open while the $3-billion Westcot construction is 
underway. Disney has not yet committed to building Westcot, but has said the 
parking garage -- which would be one of the largest in the nation -- is crucial 
if Westcot is ever to be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds would also pay for special car-pool lanes at the interchange 
of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority had sought money for the freeway 
improvement even before Westcot was proposed and considers the freeway project 
even more necessary to help the area accommodate traffic from such a massive 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is far from certain, however, and must now be approved by the House 
Committee on Public Works and Transportation, the House and finally the Senate, 
where it is likely to fall into limbo for a time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $15.5 million was allocated last year for the same projects but 
has yet to be spent. If the new money is approved, it would mean that about 10% 
of the projects' $318-million tab would be paid for by the federal government.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PATROL POSITIONS CUT IN POLICE BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to cut into a $3-million city budget deficit, Newport Beach officials 
have proposed the one thing sure to provoke skepticism around town -- 
eliminating police officer positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it is disconcerting to the public to see public safety cut," said 
Newport Beach Police Chief Bob McDonell. "It is not easy for us either, but you 
have to work with what you've got." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department plans to reduce its staff of sworn officers by five 
positions to 133 to cut its overall budget $600,000 for the upcoming year. The 
positions slated for deletion are currently vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy, who is responsible for the budget, said that 
"our goal is to make cuts that do not affect front-line services." McDonell 
said the reduction should not slow police response to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do not want to create the impression that these cuts are easy," 
McDonell said, noting that they come on the heels of three straight years of 
budget cutting that has reduced police staff by 22 positions without taking any 
officers off the street. This is the first year the cuts will reach patrol 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have looked internally and have rolled back as far as you get," McDonell 
said. "The only place (left to cut) is in the field deployment arena and some 
detective positions." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1994-95 fiscal year, three patrol officer positions will be 
eliminated, as well as two of the civilians who work the department's front 
desk. By mid-1995, a sergeant in a detective division and two more officer 
slots will be vacated to allow the Police Department to fill the positions of 
records supervisor, communications supervisor, custody officer and manager of 
the department's shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Police Department wrestles with the changes, other municipal 
departments are absorbing even deeper cuts. On May 1, the city laid off six 
workers, including two in the Fire Department. Thirty-three other jobs will be 
eliminated through attrition and early retirement, including Marine Department 
director, senior building inspector and fire prevention specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find ways to save money," Murphy said.  
</P>
<P>
 The cuts come at a time when the rate of violent crime in Newport Beach has 
remained steady. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has for much of the past two decades operated with less 
than a full complement of staff, according to the city's personnel records. 
Because of poor pay and high turnover, Chief McDonell said, the department was 
forced to make do despite 20 vacant positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city granted its police officers and most other city workers a 
hefty raise to elevate their salaries from among the lowest in the county to 
among the highest. As a result, the department's ranks have stabilized so that 
fewer officers are in training and more are actually out on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all our slots filled," McDonell said. "Our goal is to be efficient as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has begun reviewing the proposed 1994-95 budget and may vote 
on it later this month or in June. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CAMP-OUT PLANNED FOR FIRE SURVIVORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of shuffling from relatives to motels to rented houses, dozens of 
people who lost homes in the October fire will try a different experience this 
weekend: camping out. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, an excursion to the San 
Bernardino Mountains will allow disaster-weary residents a chance to unwind, 
said Marsha Bode, a coalition director who thought of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody looks like they've been having a hard time," she said. "My feeling 
was, the survivors really needed to take a break from the constant thinking 
about paperwork and the millions of details that sometimes wake people up in 
the middle of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Car pools will begin leaving for Campfire Summer Camp today and will return 
Sunday afternoon. In the meantime, fire survivors will get a chance to fish, 
hike and visit with neighbors they may have lost touch with since the Oct. 27 
blaze that damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll eat in a dining hall and we're going to sing songs and we're going to 
do silly things . . . on our own, away from everything," Bode said. "Most 
people are just looking forward to having a rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the camp out will be split evenly between the coalition and the 
participants, Bode said. As of Wednesday, 55 people had signed up. The 
coalition is a community-based group that formed immediately after the fire and 
now dispenses supplies to survivors from a headquarters in the Boat Canyon 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp-out is scheduled for a weekend when some whose homes were lost may 
prefer to stay in town. The coalition is orchestrating a citywide garage sale 
Saturday, aimed partly at raising money for fire survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a special City Council meeting has been scheduled for 3 p.m. 
Saturday to allow residents eager to rebuild burned homes a chance to learn 
more about suspected ancient landslides that geologists say might lie under 
some hillside lots. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SETTLEMENT REACHED IN HARASSMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has reached a settlement with one of the plaintiffs in the sexual 
harassment civil suit against former Police Chief Arb Campbell, former Police 
Capt. Anthony Villa and the city itself, officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a statement from the city attorney's office, Shontel Sherwood 
will receive $25,000, plus another $25,000 to cover her attorney fees and other 
litigation-related expenses. In return, Sherwood will drop her allegations and 
her workers' compensation claim. She retains her job as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the city nor Sherwood would comment on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50,000 will be paid by the city, according to a June, 1993, agreement 
among the city, Campbell and Villa. The city has agreed to pay for damages 
resulting from any of the plaintiffs' lawsuits, including attorney fees and 
workers' compensation, unless a jury finds that Campbell and Villa acted with 
malice. Campbell and Villa were forced to retire from their positions as a part 
of the 1993 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood joined the sexual harassment civil suit on Dec. 1, 1992. At that 
time, she said: "I have no doubt in my mind that I was ridiculed and accused of 
ill-conceived acts by refusing to allow sexual harassment and a hostile work 
environment to exist." 
</P>
<P>
 The city, Campbell and Villa admit no wrongdoing under this week's settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the allegations surfaced in September, 1992, the city of Newport Beach 
has paid $275,000 to 11 current and former female employees of the Police 
Department to settle their claims. This week's move leaves seven women on the 
list of plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious of the pending allegations accuse Villa of unwanted touching 
and lewd comments, while Campbell allegedly tolerated Villa's behavior. In 
general, the women also accuse the former police brass of denying them 
promotions because they are female and pressuring them to socialize off duty 
with male officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put this chapter behind us -- the sooner the better," said current 
Police Chief Robert J. McDonell. He said Sherwood "is a fine officer working in 
traffic division as an accident investigator. . . . I realize that it is 
difficult for somebody still on active duty with the department to go through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said attorneys for both sides are taking 
depositions in preparation for the civil trial that is scheduled to begin next 
February. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY LOSES PATIENCE WITH WORK ON 'CASTLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials said Thursday that they will use evidence collected in this 
week's unusual search of a castle-like home to prove that the owners violated a 
1988 agreement to complete construction of the dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence, which includes photos of the home's unfinished interior, will be 
presented within a few days to the judge who brokered the agreement, said City 
Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge could grant the owners another extension to finish the remodeling, 
evict them from the property or even order that the Tudor-style home be 
demolished, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, building inspectors with a search warrant spent more than a hour 
taking photos inside the home of Victor and Fern Ganish, who, over the past 12 
years, have transformed their one-story ranch-style house into a two-story 
Tudor structure that angry neighbors compare to a castle. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have pressed the Ganishes for years to complete the remodeling 
project. Brady said the 1988 agreement set up a timetable for the family to 
finish work on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Ganish insisted that her family has lived up to the terms of the 
agreement, which she said only ordered them to complete the home's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Drywall, plumbing equipment and flooring still needs to be installed inside 
the house, Ganish said. But she insisted that the house is habitable. "We feel 
OK living here," Ganish said. "Many people stay in their homes when they are 
being remodeled." 
</P>
<P>
 The city contends that the Kron Street house violates building and safety 
codes. Officials might ask the district attorney's office to review the case 
for possible prosecution. But Brady said the city's main goal is to "make sure 
this property is safe. . . . We don't want people living in unsafe conditions."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ELIMINATE 27 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-seven non-teaching jobs in the Fullerton Joint Union High School 
District will be eliminated next month because of budget woes, trustees have 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the positions will be eliminated through early retirement incentives 
and attrition, but district officials predict that one or two people will be 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our approach is to try to provide as many options as possible for the 
employees," Assistant Supt. Greg Bice said. "We're providing opportunities 
rather than just saying, 'You're out in the cold.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 27 jobs to be cut include those of five records clerks, six maintenance 
workers, two bus drivers, two maintenance supervisors and a director of grounds 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the move will save the district about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will save another $1 million by cutting programs and reducing 
expenses for supplies, services and equipment, Assistant Supt. Ronald N. 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district faces a $3.15-million deficit in its $60-million budget for the 
1994-95 fiscal year, Bice said. The district is expected to take about $1 
million from its reserve fund to balance the budget, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all think this is terrible," school board member Marilyn Buchi said. "I 
regret that we have to do it but we have to do it."MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; AVOID GANGS, DRUGS, VASQUEZ TELLS PUPILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez brought a message of hope and 
warning Wednesday to the 1,700 students of Loara High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Art teacher Shelley Sasaki, who coordinates the Anaheim Union High School 
District's drug-prevention program, said the school had been trying for years 
to arrange a visit from Vasquez as a role model for Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that he's so busy and we could never coordinate the schedule," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 20-minute speech in the Saxon gym, Vasquez told of his own rise 
from a poor neighborhood to become the first in his family to graduate from 
high school and the first Latino to serve on the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told of friends from his old neighborhood who weren't so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 He once spotted a former neighbor behind bars while touring the Orange County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What are you doing here?' " Vasquez, a former Orange police 
sergeant, recalled asking. His old neighbor replied: "I'm still doing heroin. 
Now I'm in here for doing a robbery. I needed to support my habit." 
</P>
<P>
 That same man died in an alley about a month ago from a heroin overdose, 
Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't exist anymore. He started clean. He was a good student. He went 
downhill. He hung around with the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez urged the students to avoid becoming a statistic, citing the 74 Orange 
County youths killed in gang violence last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be deceived and don't be tricked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are blessed. You live in a great county where there's great 
opportunity."ANNA CEKOLA

TRUSTEE SEEKS RESTRAINING ORDER ON BOOK-BAN GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim Union High School District trustee on Thursday sought a restraining 
order against a parents group that she alleges has harassed her for refusing to 
ban two novels from English literature classes in local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge refused to grant a temporary restraining 
order Thursday but did set a May 26 hearing date to hear arguments in the case. 
The judge will then determine whether there is sufficient evidence to grant a 
preliminary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee R.A. (Molly) McGee, who also teaches at the Crystal Cathedral Academy 
in Garden Grove, contends that members of a group called Citizens for Better 
Schools have made threatening phone calls to her at home and at work. She also 
claims that they have visited Crystal Cathedral trying to soil her reputation 
and question her morality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about the safety of my family," said McGee, who has been a 
district trustee for 14 years. "They are making disparaging remarks that could 
hurt my record. It's embarrassing professionally and personally to have this 
occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Treva Brown, an Anaheim resident who is president of the group and the main 
defendant in the case, denies that she or other members of her group have 
harassed McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 She does admit that she and other group members have complained about McGee to 
Crystal Cathedral officials, both in person and by phone. But she denies 
calling McGee at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's harassment," Brown said. McGee's employers "have a right 
to know what type of material she thinks is suitable for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The books that Brown's group wants taken off high school students' reading 
lists are "Ordinary People" and "The Great Santini." Brown maintains that the 
books contain "pornographic" and sexual references and should not be required 
reading at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Union High School District Board of Trustees disagreed, voting 4 
to 1 last September not to ban the two books from classrooms. The books had 
previously been approved for student use by the district's citizen review 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 After that vote, Brown and her supporters targeted McGee and three other board 
members for recall. But they failed to gather enough signatures to force a 
recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens for Better Schools' members continued to protest the acceptance of 
the novels and have demonstrated at board meetings. There have been no 
allegations of harassment from any of the other three board members who voted 
with McGee on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said she was followed to her car after one board meeting by a member of 
Brown's group and told that she was immoral and "was going to hell" for 
allowing the novels in the district, and she says group members have made 
similar comments to her employers at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 3, McGee alleges, group member Carol McCabe, who is also listed as a 
defendant in the case, called Crystal Cathedral and asked to talk to teachers, 
the principal or the Rev. Robert H. Schuller "about Molly McGee and what kind 
of teacher she is and giving dirty books to children." McCabe could not be 
reached for comment on the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said she also believes that Brown's group is behind frequent phone calls 
to her residence -- 29 in the first four days of this month -- in which the 
callers simply hang up without saying anything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was held Thursday in Superior Court in Orange on McGee's request for 
the restraining order, which would block members of Brown's group from 
harassing McGee, following her, telephoning her at home or at work, or coming 
within 100 yards of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John E. Brown, who represents McGee and is no relation to Treva 
Brown, said he was "disappointed" that Judge Gale P. Hickman decided to set 
another hearing date instead of issuing an immediate temporary restraining 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is there has been harassing conduct," he said. "It is unfortunate 
that a person who is a public official can have her civil rights trampled by 
disgruntled, self-appointed censors."

JURY AWARDS EX-PRINCIPAL $700,000 FOR 1992 FIRING; COURTS: TERMINATION CAME 
AFTER HER COMPLAINTS ABOUT TOXIC FUMES AT ST. JOSEPH SCHOOL. DIOCESE SAYS SHE 
WAS 'DIVISIVE' INFLUENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 A Superior Court jury awarded nearly $700,000 Thursday to a former Catholic 
elementary school principal after determining she was wrongfully terminated two 
years ago for complaining about toxic fumes at the Placentia school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diocese of Orange had contended that Marion Patzem was fired in May, 1992, 
after a four-member committee concluded that she was a "divisive" influence at 
St. Joseph School. But the jury concluded that Patzem was dismissed in 
retaliation for her attempts to draw attention to what she said were unsafe 
conditions and noxious odors at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means so much to me. The truth got told," Patzem said outside the 
courtroom, wiping tears from her eyes. "I love the church, but they didn't want 
to hear about the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Patzem alleged that she had been wrongfully terminated after repeatedly 
complaining about toxic fumes leaking from fluorescent light fixtures in a 
third-grade classroom. The substance was later found to be a carcinogen 
commonly known as PCBs. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict began after a teacher and students complained of stomach pains, 
respiratory problems and chronic rashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Patzem contended in her lawsuit that the school's pastor once poked her in the 
chest for making the repeated complaints. When she was fired without notice, 
police escorted her from the school grounds as students looked on, her suit 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real shame, what happened to her and those kids," said one juror.  
</P>
<P>
 Juror Robert Wilson of Huntington Beach said he believed Patzem was fired even 
though her first concern was the safety of her schoolchildren. Wilson said he 
was tormented by trying to decide on the amount of the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't put a price on something like this. Children are our future," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury awarded Patzem $692,500 in damages and lost wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for the school said the award was "too high." Patzem's 
attorney could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Patzem was nominated by school officials as national Catholic school 
principal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Carey, the mother of two children who attended the school while Patzem 
was principal, said she was elated by the verdict. She said her children, ages 
13 and 7, were expelled from the school after she also began looking into 
campus problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The first witness called to testify during the wrongful-termination suit was 
Bishop Norman F. McFarland, the highest-ranking official of the Diocese of 
Orange. McFarland denied Patzem's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In his termination letter, McFarland told Patzem she was being dismissed 
because "you chose not to cooperate in our efforts to look into the general 
unrest in St. Joseph Parish."

WILSON ENVOYS WILL LOBBY FOR SPACE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With California already spinning from defense cuts, Gov. Pete Wilson announced 
Thursday that he will send a delegation of state officials and business leaders 
to Washington in two weeks to lobby for continued funding of the troubled space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The station, a sophisticated orbiting laboratory already 10 years and $12 
billion in the making, accounts for more than 4,200 California workers, about a 
third of them in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But funding for the long and costly project has lately been in danger, with a 
key member of Congress threatening to withdraw his support if National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration funding continues to dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spending for the space station is in jeopardy in the Congress, and California 
-- as a leader in NASA research -- has an obligation to provide leadership 
during the upcoming funding debate in Washington," Wilson said after a brief 
tour of the Lockheed Missile & Space Co. in Sunnyvale, which has space station 
contracts totaling nearly $1 billion. "Washington's headlong rush to slash 
defense spending is costing us hundreds of thousands of jobs."  
</P>
<P>
 The space station squeaked through the House by a single vote last year, with 
several members of Congress questioning the wisdom of continuing a project 
that, after so much money and time, has yet to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 But the station seemed even more imperiled this week when Rep. George E. Brown 
Jr. (D-Colton), long a champion of space exploration, said he will reluctantly 
recommend killing the project if NASA loses big again in this year's budget 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown worried that without a firm commitment from Congress to see construction 
through to the end, the station -- which costs $2.1 billion a year -- will 
eventually fail anyway, and it would be wiser to start saving the money now. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the station argue that it represents America's future in space, 
and NASA officials say a recent streamlining of the space station program has 
made it considerably more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson noted that any harm that comes to the space station would indirectly 
hurt the space shuttle program, which is to be the primary deployment vehicle 
to the lab. The shuttle program employs another 5,700 Californians.

FIREFIGHTERS DRILL FOR DISASTER; EMERGENCY: HANDLING OF MOCK COLLISION OF 
TRAIN, FUEL TANKER IS GIVEN IMMEDIACY BY REAL-LIFE CRASH JUST HOURS BEFORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Eerily realistic screams rang through the morning haze. Bodies were strewn 
about the railroad tracks near the blue and white Metrolink train. Firefighters 
scrambled to provide emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
 All the elements of a real train disaster were present Thursday at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Base in an emergency drill that was given extra tension by a 
real fatality just hours earlier along the tracks 10 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony and timing of the two events is just incredible," said Sarah Catz 
of Laguna Beach, a member of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority 
who attended the drill. "The silver lining to this is that hopefully it makes 
people aware that you can't mess with trains." 
</P>
<P>
 The drill simulated the aftermath of a fiery explosion caused by a Metrolink 
train crashing into a tanker truck carrying a load of jet fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews spent six months preparing for the mock disaster, which was a 
test of timing and communication among the firefighters who were first at the 
scene, the ambulance crews who arrived to transport the "victims" and six area 
hospitals that would treat the influx of patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the emergency teams won plaudits from Orange County Fire Department 
Battalion Chief Steve Whitaker, the drill commander. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say it went very well," said Whitaker, a 20-year firefighter from Laguna 
Niguel. "We got 105 patients off the train, screened and en route to treatment 
within 60 minutes. In my experience, that's pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's drill emphasized what Whitaker called the "transportation 
function," an element of disaster response that has bogged down emergency teams 
in the past. The updated plan calls for transporting all the most severely 
injured victims immediately to ambulances instead of first huddling everyone 
into an on-site treatment area, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we bypass that one step and take those patients directly to an ambulance 
and stabilize them there," Whitaker said. "We think that alleviates what used 
to be an area of bottleneck for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The drill is the largest undertaken by the Fire Department each year. Taking 
part were a 88 firefighters, 15 ambulances, four battalion chiefs and a group 
of college students and Explorer Scouts acting as victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The key term in Thursday's drill was "triage," a French word roughly meaning 
"to sort," said Fire Department Capt. Dan Young. Triage is the work of the 
first crews on the scene who immediately determine each victim's condition and 
then mark them with color-coded badges that let the next member of the team 
know who needs immediate help, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The triage process sorts out fatalities and the walking wounded who need no 
immediate treatment, and quickly finds "the guy in the middle who if you do the 
right thing in the first 15 minutes can save a life," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, the victim doing the screaming is not the one who most needs 
attention, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experienced emergency people quickly learn that the real screamers are a 
lower priority," Young said. "Screaming takes a lot of strength. It's the real 
quiet person who is not breathing you look for. That's the one who needs help."

THE SCENE: READY, AIM, BREAK: CUE THE BIG SHOTS; O.C. TEENS ARE RACKING UP AN 
INTEREST IN POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yuppies, beware. There's a younger school of sharks biting into your billiards 
fad. Their tables might not be as fancy as those at your clubs with fashionable 
furniture and valet parking. But they're just as ready to rack it up on a 
Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
 And they're smarter. They won't fork out $12 an hour for a game. Well, OK, so 
they actually can't cover the high rates. Their digs are local family pool 
halls, where for half the price they can shoot for thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 Bored with the movies or coffeehouses, high-schoolers such as Newport Harbor 
senior Deanna Adams are finding more than their friends at the felt-topped 
tables. "Pool requires a lot of concentration and thought," she notes. "A lot 
of times I leave here, and I can focus on things better. It's a real challenge, 
but it relaxes me too. I just let everything go away for a couple of hours 
while I'm in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the conversation among her friends includes little gossip. The talk is 
on the plays, miserable or rad. Suggestions on strategy and technique are 
invited and discussed. This is serious playtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just want to keep going and learning to get better," says Deanna, 17. 
"It's an addicting game, though. We decide to play for an hour, and time flies 
by."  
</P>
<P>
 At first, Deanna spent more time watching than playing. Insecure about her 
ability, she even told her dad to forget about buying a table for the family. 
She couldn't be bothered with the practice it took to master the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That was seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here almost every day now," Deanna says. "I love playing. My dad's 
going to go ahead and get a table, so my friends and I will be able to save 
some cash." As it is, she spends almost a fourth of her paycheck every week on 
the game. But even the luxury of a home table won't keep Deanna and her friends 
from going to the family pool centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her buddy Bonnie Sitz, 15, points to the social scene. "You get to know people 
through challenges and from hanging out here every week." There are kids from 
other schools, says the Newport Harbor High sophomore, and those from her own 
with whom she would never otherwise connect. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, but Deanna is quick to add that there's "certain kind of people who 
play pool, and they're not the preppies. You'll never see a smart, nerdy person 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not calling her pool peers losers -- though she has heard cracks from 
those very preppies that that is who hangs out at the halls. But her own 
categorizing of heavy metal fans dressed in New Age accouterments and grunge 
staples also proved too restricting. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey on the Saturday evening Deanna and Bonnie were at Games 
Plus in Costa Mesa turned up water polo players, trendy mall girls, 
KROQ-listening surfers and an ethnic diversity that would make the PC patrol 
proud. And these are not just guys: Mostly young women crowded around the 
tables that day and on recent weekend evenings. Some, like Bonnie and Deanna, 
went for the flannels and sneakers, while others were dressed to the teeth.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are also the kind of "older" folks present that would 
probably fit better in a dive bar setting. Even family halls sell beer, causing 
parents to worry about their kids hanging around. There are Bonnie's parents, 
who "say it's a bad influence because they think it's a bar and there's 
smoking. But," she adds, "I don't come here to see people smoke and drink. I 
come here to shoot pool. If they'd just come down here and check it out, they'd 
see it wasn't a bad environment."  
</P>
<P>
 (As a rule, Mom and Dad, there can't be much to worry about if a teen leaves 
you an open invitation to stop by.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even without all the young people around the pool tables, most family centers 
could boast a big teen clientele. Just look at the numbers standing at the 
video games lined against the wall. But that's a story in itself. As tempting 
as the electronic action is between pool games, they are a waste of money, say 
sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you get out of them?" Bonnie asks. "Pool is just so much more 
challenging." 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems if the owners of those plush pool clubs want to fill their weak 
weekend afternoons with more fish, they should take a cue from the country 
music nightclubs that have welcomed teens with incredible success. As more 
high-schoolers introduce their friends to this alternative hangout, the scene 
is certain to stick around.

 "All across the country everybody's been talking about it this week: Paula 
Jones' lawsuit against President Clinton. . . . What do such allegations mean 
to men who have important and powerful positions? And what do they mean to the 
women who make these claims? Today, America speaks out: sexual harassment. . . 
. It's all next right here on the 'Maury Povich' show." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few minutes, we will begin taping the show itself, and I will fulfill one 
of those peculiar roles in the garishly striped arcade that modern popular 
political culture has become: I will become a shouting head on a tabloid 
daytime talk program, the "Maury Povich" show, to discuss Jones' court claim 
that in 1991, while she was an Arkansas state employee, then-Gov. Clinton 
violated her civil rights by exposing himself and asking her to perform a sex 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, how the august gatekeepers of the elite media, including the 
editors of this newspaper, cover a story such as Jones' allegations is crucial 
in determining whether it gains the careering velocity of a full national 
scandal or sputters out after a day or two as a curiosity in the shallows of a 
few tabloid newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in contemporary America, the decisions of newspaper editors and even 
network news executives constitute a shrinking part of how the public views 
such events. 
</P>
<P>
 The public consciousness must also cope with a spreading number of radio and 
TV talk programs -- a new kind of social wallpaper, decorated not by newsmakers 
but observers of the news, offering their reactions to events even before they 
unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 In a week when South Africa inaugurated its first black president, for 
instance, CNN's "Crossfire" and "CNN & Company," ABC's "Nightline," talk radio 
and the weekend Washington talk shows have featured hassling over the 
supposedly larger implications of the Jones business. 
</P>
<P>
 Povich's show, which was taped Wednesday and airs today, will feature Rita 
Jenrette, the ex-wife of an ex-Congressman who admitted having sex on the steps 
of the Capitol a decade or so ago and later posed for Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a gossip columnist from the New York Daily News and a 
representative from the New York City branch of the National Organization for 
Women.  
</P>
<P>
 And with us, too, will be Connie Hamzy, a self-proclaimed rock 'n' roll 
groupie who sold a story to Penthouse that said that 10 years ago, she had a 
fondling fling with Bill Clinton and is now complaining that nobody seemed to 
believe her at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now remember, we want to use the Jones story as a, you know, a jumping-off 
point to talk about the whole issue of sexual harassment, Anita Hill, the 
Tailhook scandal, Bob Packwood, the whole thing," Ginelle Blado, the executive 
producer, tells me as I sit in the greenroom getting prepared for the taping. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to point out that Jones' complaint suggests that the President's 
genitals have a distinguishing characteristic she could identify as proof of 
her claim, and that this observation raises the specter of the President having 
to reveal his anatomy as part of the court case. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue is that feminists seem less inclined to believe Jones than they 
did Anita Hill, when she leveled allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to get into how such allegations rip the families apart. "What does 
it do to the women involved?" Blado asks. "What does it do to Clinton and 
Hillary? What are they saying to each other?" Are we driving good people out of 
government?  
</P>
<P>
 As I listen, I notice that many of these issues have been raised in recent 
days by newspaper stories from the New York Times to USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, the Povich show is transmitting issues from the newspapers into 
another form to another audience. It hardly stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But I begin to wonder, too, whether the Jones story really raises all these 
issues. It may, but I think it is too soon to tell. If Jones' story is false, 
it could actually demean the issue of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, a comedian is loosening up Povich's audience. He's a kid who lives 
near the theater and tries out new material here before using it in the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're going to learn how to clap," he tells them. And he shows that if 
they applaud twice as fast as they normally would, it sounds as though there 
are twice as many people in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, it becomes clear that Povich is trying, within the format of such 
programs, to cover the issue of harassment seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 He begins with Diane Welsh, the president of New York City NOW, about how her 
group feels about Jones' charges. Are feminists being hypocrites for not 
supporting Jones? "I think she deserves her day in court," Welsh says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Welsh says she is concerned, too, that Jones presented her allegations 
flanked by right-wing enemies of Clinton at a Conservative Political Action 
Committee convention dedicated to demeaning Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Stasi, who writes something called "Hot Copy" column in the New York 
Daily News, doesn't think much of Jones' allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time something like this happens, we become more and more foolish (as a 
country) and there is less and less authority on the top," she says. "Children 
look at this and there is no respect anywhere for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 People are clapping. Double speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Povich asks me about the role of the press here, and I burble a few minutes 
about balance and delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the first segment ends, and we are about to bring a fourth chair on 
stage.  
</P>
<P>
 Rita Jenrette's then-husband, John Jenrette, was a South Carolina congressman 
convicted of taking a bribe in the ABSCAM scandal. But she became better known 
in the aftermath for writing a book, "Diary of a Mad Congressman's Wife," about 
sex, drugs and hypocrisy in Washington, including her account of making love 
with the honorable representative on the steps of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 She later posed for Playboy, tried her hand at singing, worked for the 
television show "A Current Affair" and now has a broker's license on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenrette is wearing a miniskirt and a tight sweater, and her eyes, once called 
"chocolate brown" by the Washington Post, are now mysteriously sea blue. 
</P>
<P>
 She also doesn't think much of Jones' charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women throw themselves at these men (in power)," she says, "I don't, but. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 She had been harassed, she says. When a congressman made advances toward her 
in 1974, when she was in her early 20s, she didn't file a lawsuit -- she threw 
a Bloody Mary on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jones' experience with Clinton was so bad, she adds, why did she wait so 
long to file her suit? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe she was trying to save face," answers Welsh of NOW, finding herself 
ambivalently defending Jones as a paradigm for sexual harassment victims. 
"Maybe she didn't want to put herself and her family through what she is going 
through now, and what we, by having this show, are doing to her too." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Welsh and Stasi and I all seem uncomfortable with being on the program, 
but here we are. It's TV. Who turns down a chance to be on TV? And for Welsh, 
at least, there is an issue she cares about. 
</P>
<P>
 Stasi seems slightly less ambivalent. "I have been hit on by a lot of men, but 
I never asked a million bucks for it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Povich has on the phone Jones' brother-in-law, Mark Brown, and in 
dramatic, emotional tones, he says his sister-in-law is lying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a very sad thing what is taking place in this country," he 
says. "We need to focus on other things besides a bunch of bull crap." 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" Povich says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir. . . . This is over money. Large amounts of money. $700,000" -- the 
amount sought in Jones' complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing, Brown presses, is what all of this means for people whom he 
considers real victims of sexual harassment. Then Brown stops: "That's all." 
</P>
<P>
 The phone call seems provocative but inconclusive. Who is Brown? Is he 
estranged from his sister-in-law? We know nothing about him, which seems 
frustrating. And he raises peculiar questions. How does he know it's about 
money? Was there a family meeting asking people to lie? As Povich prepared to 
ask him, Brown stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Povich says in a "teaser" before a commercial, another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Hamzy was floating around all during the 1992 campaign. She 
relentlessly peddled her claim of having had a fling with Clinton in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 When she introduced herself to a Los Angeles Times reporter in Little Rock in 
1992, she gave him a picture of herself topless.  
</P>
<P>
 But Povich's audience is spared such details. It knows only that she sold her 
story instead to Penthouse magazine and that no one else much cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamzy is waif-like now, though her dress is low cut, and she is a decade older 
than when she said she met Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream press didn't believe you, did they, Povich says. Is it because 
you were a rock 'n' roll groupie? 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I am a groupie -- a lot of people don't feel that groupies have 
a lot of credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 But she insists that she isn't lying. "I may be a slut and a whore," she says, 
"but I'm not a liar." 
</P>
<P>
 Stasi of the Daily News looks at me. "Why am I here?" she whispers, cringing. 
I'm wondering the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are clearly degrees on such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his way, Povich is trying to make a point, not simply wallow, although one 
must wonder why Hamzy is present. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an interesting fact: In the medium of daytime talk, of Oprah and 
Geraldo, Sally Jessy Raphael and Montel Williams, Phil Donahue and a 
proliferating number of others, Povich "is trying to be the most serious, and 
to bounce most off the news," his publicity spokesman explains. 
</P>
<P>
 And true, while his questions go for the emotional, he does not, like Geraldo 
or Montel Williams, hone in on the most salacious. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the audience he has a well-known attorney, Eric Wallach, whose 
practice is almost entirely employment practices, including sexual harassment. 
What the audience doesn't know is that his work is mostly for management, 
defending such suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's, frankly, a lawsuit that if I were counseling her, I would have strongly 
suggested she not bring in the first place. It is far from clear that she 
suffered any personal or economic damages," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "More importantly, she asserts this is all about her reputation. What worse 
way to guarantee that your reputation will be injured than to put yourself in 
this position?" 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you come on the show? I ask Wallach later. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to discuss the issue of sexual harassment, he says, "these shows 
reach a hell of a lot more people in the end than CNN or NBC or the 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 We are done now, heading backstage. A driver is waiting and will take me back 
to the airport or wherever I want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamzy says she wants to go to her publisher. She has written a book about her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Town Car back to the airport, the radio is tuned to a talk show. "Does 
it hurt Clinton politically?" the host is asking about the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I can hear the answer, the driver switches stations, to a traffic 
report.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; REBUILDING BLOCKS OF EDUCATION; UNIVERSITY 
HIGH; DISSENT SPARKED AMONG TEACHERS, TEENS AND PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER CHIEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Jennifer Chien is a junior at 
University High School in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Schedule restructuring has hit University High School like a storm, dividing 
teachers, students and parents over what's working and what's not. 
</P>
<P>
 The innovative program, which gives individual schools more say in shaping 
educational programs for their students, has produced, among other things, 
block schedules and the controversial "office hours" at the high school in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 At University, the longer block-schedule periods are held on Wednesday and 
Thursday. English, for example, would be taught four days a week: in the 
traditional 56-minute class for three days, and in the extended block class, 
about 90 minutes long, one day of the week. This schedule replaces the 
traditional five-day-a-week class schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute "office hours" are held twice a week.  
</P>
<P>
 During those hours, students are free to seek individual help from teachers, 
study or do homework. When first instituted, office hours were the first and 
last period of school two days of the week. Many students simply slept in, 
skipping the office-hour option by missing first period, or left school early. 
The hours have been changed to the middle of the day to encourage students to 
use the time wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 Although opinions vary widely on the concept of restructuring, the general 
consensus is that block schedules benefit the educational program. 
</P>
<P>
 University High principal Leah Laule says the block schedule creates a variety 
of "different lengths of learning time" because learning doesn't always take in 
56-minute segments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important to provide students as well as teachers with the opportunity 
to have a longer period of time to delve more deeply into a particular subject 
or to be able to complete the teaching of a concept, and to give students more 
of an opportunity to interact with the learning on a longer basis," Laule said. 
"There is a lot of research and a lot of desire on the part of many teachers to 
use differentiated learning segments. And that is essentially what the block 
schedule does; it allows teachers to structure their instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, block schedules seem like a wonderful idea; however, in real 
life the results have been less than perfect.  
</P>
<P>
 Many students dread having to sit through 90-minute lectures when 56 minutes 
are hard enough to endure. Even teachers agree that some students have a hard 
time keeping their concentration and absorbing twice the information. Laule 
admits that the teachers who continue to lecture, rather than incorporating 
different teaching techniques, are giving their students just "more of the 
same."  
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't change your instruction, you won't get any change in results," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, one of the biggest problems with the block schedule at 
University has to do with cold, hard numbers: Teachers lose more than 20 
minutes of instruction time from each class, every week. Resorting to reading 
at home what their teachers can't cover in the classroom has left many students 
frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what they say, you are still losing a lot of instruction time that 
can't be made up," junior Min Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice principal David Want said that the missed instruction time is designed to 
be made up during office hour periods. However, as students readily admit, many 
are not taking advantage of that time for academic pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The block schedule has pleased many teachers, who enjoy not having to 
interrupt a classroom discussion that might last longer than an hour. They also 
like the teaching flexibility, which opens doors to opportunities that were 
never dreamed of before, such as practicing for a play. 
</P>
<P>
 Social studies teacher Lisa Mariotti says block schedules "will improve the 
quality of life without hurting students academically." She says the double 
blocks are a lot more like college, with fewer classes to do homework in each 
night and more time for extracurricular activities and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also are praising the new system. They say there is more time for 
creativity, special projects and labs. They also enjoy focusing on three 
subjects instead of six on block days. And, of course, they like having to do 
the homework for only three classes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, some teachers miss seeing their students every day of the 
week, saying that the traditional five-day system was like a rhythm, which was 
good for students. Instead of being "boring" or "repetitive," the daily 
schedule was consistent, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, change has brought out its supporters and its opponents. Those for 
block scheduling genuinely, and enthusiastically, say that it gives students 
the opportunity to focus on fewer subjects, interact and discuss with their 
peers, complete longer activities and learn independently. Those against block 
schedules cite the loss of total teaching time and the inability of some 
students to concentrate during the longer classes. 
</P>
<P>
 With time, the block schedule is expected to be fine-tuned as teachers and 
students adjust to what Laule calls "a whole different approach to learning."

<P>
 A number of Orange County high schools are experimenting with block 
scheduling, which is used to create fewer but longer class periods in the 
belief that students can learn more in extended, undisturbed time periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The specifics vary from school to school. 
</P>
<P>
 At Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, students typically take six 
classes per semester. On Monday, the student receives instruction in all six 
classes in the traditional 56-minute period. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the 
student receives 112-minute instruction in the second, fourth and sixth period 
classes. On Wednesdays and Fridays, the student attends block-length first, 
third and fifth period classes. Students get 16 minutes between blocks (called 
passing) to relax and prepare for the next intensive study. 
</P>
<P>
 At University High School in Irvine, 95-minute class periods are in effect two 
days a week, with the traditional 56-minute classes in effect on Monday, 
Tuesday and Friday. The schedule also sets aside time for students to seek 
individual help from teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at how the schedule changes at the two schools have fared.

Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo.

<P>
 Block scheduling, introduced on an experimental basis this year at Capistrano 
Valley High School in Mission Viejo, is getting generally favorable reviews 
from students, teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, as intended, giving students an extended time with fewer subjects on 
specified days. While students say the new schedule has worked well in many 
classes, one size does not necessarily fit all. Where it fits or does not fit 
depends on whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Math classes don't work because we do two or three lessons a day, and it is 
hard to grasp the concepts," junior Adam Weintraub said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra time in English, history and foreign language classes are appreciated, 
said German-language teacher Beth Gibb. "Students have the opportunity to 
experience more intense language." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Carol Hromadka agrees. "Before, just when you got used to speaking in 
German instead of English, the bell would ring. Now you're able to stick with 
it for a while," she said. Junior Jennifer Fox said she appreciates the extra 
time to get questions answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Electives such as ceramics and choir seem to fare well. Gay Veeh, a sewing and 
child-development teacher, says that might be because "students are able to 
accomplish more during the semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Anne Chadburn said she doesn't think there are any classes that 
don't work. "It just depends on which classes you don't like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the system, students spend 112 minutes, rather than 56 minutes, in 
classes on a rotating basis. English, for example, is taught in the 
traditional-length class on Monday, and in an extended period on Tuesday and 
Thursday, rather than meeting every day of the week.  
</P>
<P>
 "The extended-class period maximizes instructional time and allows for 
student-centered activities," principal Jessica Gorman said. And, she adds, 
discipline problems have dropped under the block schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers are positive about the new schedule. "I have more time to 
present new lessons because I'm spending less time on attendance and homework 
checks," math teacher Marlene Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers feel block has created a calmer atmosphere for students, with 
less stress, less chaos and fewer distractions. Spanish teacher Angie Martin 
says fewer students are tardy. Many teachers say it is easier to plan for block 
period because time can be allocated for skits, films, tests and collaborative 
learning. "Collaborative groups are not frenzied as before," English teacher 
Cristina Garrity said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though there seems to be general support for the block schedule, conflict 
still exists. Some students say that 112 minutes per class is just too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be too much to handle for so long," Hromadka said. "My brain can only 
absorb so much information in one day. Anything more goes in one ear and out 
the other."  
</P>
<P>
 But English teacher Garrity argues that this is the environment for true 
learning. "Our block schedule is a positive stand for learning and thinking in 
an 'image-every-instant' culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The same amount of homework is assigned, but two-days' worth is given out 
during one class period. Because the class only meets every other day, students 
have two days to complete the homework. That, however, can nurture 
procrastination. "Sometimes I find myself putting everything off until the last 
minute," Chadburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A separate area of debate centers on how the new schedule affects a student's 
non-academic time -- particularly for those involved in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the rotating schedule is detrimental to off-season training. Junior 
Laura Jeffries runs every other day on the block schedule and says the absence 
of daily practice hurts her preparation for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gymnastics coach Debbie Cunningham says the block schedule allows time for 
more thorough workouts. But Bill Harvey, a "walk-on" track-and-field coach (a 
person who only works as a coach at the school) is against the schedule. "I 
find that most athletes have a hard time adjusting to the schedule. They have 
to change the time they eat lunch on certain days because they practice right 
after lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey also said he believes injuries have increased because students have 
less energy and concentration on block days when athletic teams don't begin 
practice until 3 p.m. On non-block days, athletes start practice about 1:45 
p.m. and finish earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point of view: "Less academic time is lost for athletes leaving early 
for sports competitions," said principal Gorman.  
</P>
<P>
 While the rivalry between teachers and coaches for a student's time has 
existed for years, some sports activities actually benefit from the block 
scheduling. A swimming class, for example, is now offered because of the 
additional time for students to dry off and change clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the block schedule has been well received, Gorman said. "Students 
love it. Parents love it. Teachers love it. Administrators love it."  
</P>
<P>
 The schedule is expected to be continued next year.

 A year of effort by youths from Irvine has come together in an installation at 
Irvine Fine Arts Center, on display through May 22.  
</P>
<P>
 Teens were given cameras and asked to capture the environment they live in. 
They met with artist Danielle Michaelis during that time to discuss community 
and personal issues as the work progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation displaying their work is the re-creation if a teen-ager's 
bedroom, with photographs, essays and dialogue. The work is designed to offer a 
different perspective on teens and their encounters in the community and to 
serve as a catalyst for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The work can be viewed Monday from noon to 9 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday 
from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday to 4 p.m.; Saturday to 3 p.m., and Sunday from 1 
to 5 p.m. The center, 14321 Yale Ave., is in Irvine's Heritage Park at the 
corner of Walnut and Yale avenues. Call (714) 552-1018. Diversions

 Summer is fast approaching. If you're not sure just how you're going to spend 
your time, perhaps you can find some inspiration from a list of ideas 
(originally recommended for spring break) printed in the Smoke Signals, the 
student newspaper at Canyon High School in Anaheim Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 On the list: 
</P>
<P>
 Learn all the characters on "General Hospital." Knit a sweater for your dog. 
Actually read an entire book. Watch "Mighty Power Rangers" every single day. 
Camp out in your back yard. Make zoo animals out of paper clips. Fold this 
newspaper into a paper hat and wear it all day. Learn how to play the kazoo. Or 
(this one's sure to take you far) stay in bed until 2 in the afternoon and then 
watch TV rest the day.

THE GOODS; SOFTWARE'S OSCARS; SALUTING THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST PROGRAMS FOR 
PERSONAL COMPUTERS, THE CODIE AWARDS CELEBRATE A STRETCHING OF HORIZONS. WHAT'S 
AHEAD? A RADICALLY WIDENING VARIETY OF USES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Going unnoticed in the spring's annual deluge of Oscars, Grammys and Tonys 
were the Codies, a relative newcomer to the world of awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Codies (named for computer codes) are handed out by the Software 
Publishers Assn. for excellence in personal computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, PCs have been associated with such home chores as word 
processing or Lotus spreadsheets, with a few games thrown in. But this year's 
winners of the Codie crystal disks are a multimedia array of graphics, sound, 
motion, lighting and color. Together, they suggest a much more versatile role 
for the PC in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of entries certainly bodes well for the software industry and the 
nation as a whole, says Ken Wasch, executive director of the association. 
"These programs all enhance the way we work, live and learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Winners in 16 home consumer categories, chosen from more than 500 nominations, 
focus on interactive experience, not just sitting passively in front of a 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we see now is the emergence of a real consumer movement," says Keith 
Ferrell, editor of Omni magazine, which covers emerging technologies. Ferrell 
is on an SPA press tour of major cities this week -- at his own expense -- to 
give consumers a preview of what's coming to their home screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of wonderful computer columnists writing in the country, but 
they are mostly preaching to the converted," he says. "I'm going on this tour 
because I wanted to talk in plain English about this software explosion. It is 
something that can transform a household."  
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the PC invasion of American households passed the 25% mark last 
year, and that many PCs now come equipped with CD-ROM players, sound capability 
and modems, Ferrell describes the growth as a "revolution that is happening 
very quickly" and attributes the momentum to three aspects: 
</P>
<P>
 * The software is easier to use. "Instead of typing a string of commands to 
start a program, you use a mouse to point an arrow and click." 
</P>
<P>
 * The hardware quality is better. "It's closer to the TV experience in terms 
of sound and graphics, much more appealing than the old green-and-black 
monitor."  
</P>
<P>
 * The prices are more accessible. "I don't know of a more price-competitive 
field. There are bargains everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The SPA tour highlights 10 of the Codie winners, to emphasize the new software 
spectrum. Looking over the categories, Ferrell discussed their versatility: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Fantasy/Adventure: Myst, a nonviolent, surrealistic CD-ROM adventure in 
which a battered old book leads the reader into a world of mind-bending puzzles 
with a haunting soundtrack. "It's a role-playing experience, with phenomenal 
graphics, plunging you into the surrealistic world of dark mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best School Productivity / Creativity: Kids Studio. "Addresses the generation 
coming along for whom computers are second nature. It gives kids a lot of 
multimedia tools. They can make reports, put in their own photos and sound, mix 
it all up into a report that talks, writes, sings and dances." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Personal Productivity and Best Consumer Program: Quicken 3.0 for Windows. 
Designed for people who hate math. "The creators have conceived the electronic 
wallet -- one place where you can track everything, print checks, pay bills, 
update your register and reconcile your bank account, all made extremely clear 
and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Home Learning: Microsoft Encarta Multimedia Encyclopedia, a CD combining 
the full text of Funk & Wagnall's 29-volume encyclopedia with eight hours of 
digital sound, thousand of photos, interactive videos and more. "You can click 
a button and see Neil Armstrong walk on the moon."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home Entertainment Product of the Year: Lemmings 2: The Tribes. Hours of 
hilarious and nonviolent problem-solving as kids try to save 12 tribes of 
cartoon creatures from their perilous plight on Lemmings Island. "It's one of 
those products that blows it wide open -- for children, men, women, 
grandparents. Everyone who plays gets hooked on it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Personal Creativity Program: Davidson's Kid CAD (computer-aided design). 
Like a computerized Lego set, it's basically a three-dimensional kit of 
electronic building blocks that will let children or adults create almost any 
kind of structure imagination allows. "You can create from scratch or pre-made 
structures, then add every detail from staircase to wallpaper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Special Needs Program: Write: OutLoud. The same machine that plays Myst 
and balances your books is also a superb tool for a program that gives voice to 
thoughts. "Extremely sophisticated technology, for the student with a speech 
defect, who can write the words and hear the pronunciation of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Sports Program: Indycar Racing. Race the actual tracks from the Indycar 
speedway circuit. You're behind the wheel making all the decisions an Indy 
diver would make with the same results -- if you put your wings up high, you 
will slow down; if you pump up the tires, you change the treads. "Simulations 
have grown dramatically in believability." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Simulation: SimCity 2000. "As computers have gotten more sophisticated 
and powerful, programmers have taken advantage of it. This is a new version of 
one of the most successful programs of all time, that allows you to do all 
sorts of new things. You can build maps, re-create the earthquake, design an 
earthquake-proof city, all in the context of entertainment."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Strategy Program: Iron Helix. An action adventure set in a cold-war 
future where a terrible biological weapon threatens to touch off a galactic 
holocaust. Players pilot a robot through a starship maze to foil the weapon. 
"Science fiction on a CD-ROM is a category I think is poised to take off."

THE GOODS; TECHNOWATCH; PALM-SIZED SCOPE LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From Russia with tiny technology comes Moonwalker, a palm-sized night-vision 
scope that's the smallest and cheapest of its kind. Weighing only 12 ounces, 
the five-inch-long scope easily fits in a pocket or purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Moonwalker costs $399, compared with larger night-vision devices that can run 
from $599 to $2,900. 
</P>
<P>
 The imported device amplifies light 6,000 times and has a field of view of 20 
degrees. It's good for personal security -- say, checking out a dim underground 
parking garage -- and for observing wildlife at night. One birder says she uses 
it for owl watching.  
</P>
<P>
 For use in total darkness, you'll need an optional tiny infrared illuminator, 
which costs $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Moonwalker is available from the American Wild Bird Co., P.O. Box 1093, 
Rockville, Md. 20849, or Moonlight Products, 5965 Pacific Center Blvd., Suite 
711, San Diego, Calif. 92121.

 Just Say Squirt: Yo, kids. Remember how you loved those high-powered Super 
Soaker water guns? This summer you can take aim with Shout 'n' Shoot, a new 
battery-operated water shooter activated by voice command. 
</P>
<P>
 Just speak into the microphone on the adjustable headset and a steady stream 
of water powers out. No pumping or pulling of a trigger is required. A 
flip-down targeting eyepiece helps guide you to a direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured by Cap Toys of Bedford Heights, Ohio, the shooter has a 24-ounce 
water tank that attaches to a belt so you have free movement of your hands. 
Shout 'n' Shoot, retailing for about $25 (batteries not included), is available 
at Toys 'R' Us, K Mart and Wal-Mart.

 Beep for Danger: First marketed in Canada in 1991, Safe & Sound Homecare Alert 
has come to the States. It is the first perimeter alert system to use a pager. 
</P>
<P>
 When a toddler wanders into home danger zones such as a workshop or swimming 
pool area, an electronic sensor installed there activates the device worn by 
the parent or caretaker without sounding a loud, startling alarm. (The system 
has also been used to keep Alzheimer's patients safe.) The pager, which 
operates on a nine-volt battery, can be programmed to beep or vibrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating within a half-mile range, the system can be used indoors or out and 
is portable, so you can take it on vacation. The base unit weighs only 6.5 
pounds and plugs into any standard outlet. The system also has a back-up 
rechargeable battery that maintains the unit up to four hours in case of power 
failure.  
</P>
<P>
 It comes with two wireless magnetic sensors to be attached with Velcro-like 
mountings to doors or other structures. An extra sensor is optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe & Sound Homecare Alert is a bit pricey at $1,995, but its manufacturer, 
Wander Alert Systems of Vancouver, Canada, has a lease program available. For 
information, call (800) 328-0526. LYNN SIMROSS

THE GOODS; ECONOTES; CULTIVATING ORGANIC GARDENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenny Ausubel wants to revolutionize the way we think about food, and he's 
starting with the country's 100 million back-yard gardeners. He wants them to 
plant organic seeds and suggests green Hubbard squash, red Wethersfield onions, 
Osaka purple mustard greens and early moonbeam watermelons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the writer, filmmaker and environmental entrepreneur founded Seeds of 
Change, the first company to sell organic seeds nationally. Its mail-order 
catalogue offers more than 500 fruits, vegetables and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only can organic gardeners grow food without toxic chemicals, Ausubel 
says, they can reintroduce biodiversity to our diets and focus on nutrition as 
a primary criterion for food selection.  
</P>
<P>
 Ausubel's new book, "Seeds of Change," (HarperSan Francisco), explains that 
because of hybridization, many of the food plants available to our grandparents 
are no longer grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to reverse the trend, Seeds of Change has 80 farmers in 27 states 
growing organic seeds collected worldwide, including heirloom varieties that 
have been tucked away for years.  
</P>
<P>
 Anybody can be an organic gardener, Ausubel says. "You can start with lemon 
basil or a chocolate daisy in a little window pot. Or Luther Hill sweet corn in 
your back yard -- it's totally fantastic. We have 65 kinds of tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds are $1.50 a packet at health food stores and garden centers. For a 
free catalogue, call (800) 95-SEEDS.

 Waste Not: If spring housecleaning has left you with a bunch of clothes, books 
and maybe an exercise bike or rowing machine to dispose of, you can turn to the 
City of Los Angeles, which has updated last year's hit publication: "Put It To 
Good Re-Use," a directory of donation opportunities. The brochure has been 
enlarged to 78 pages of names, telephone numbers and short profiles of 
organizations that will take items off your hands to benefit others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many more listings this year," says Joan Satt of the Integrated 
Solid Waste Management Office, which published the brochure. Free copies are 
available by phone, (213) 237-1444; fax, (213) 847-3054, or by writing to 200 
N. Main St., Room 580, Los Angeles, Calif. 90012.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; REBUILDING BLOCKS OF EDUCATION; HUNTINGTON: 
MOST SUPPORT BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A survey of students at Huntington Beach High, which is also among Orange 
County schools experimenting with block scheduling, found general support for 
the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked in December if they favored keeping block scheduling, more than 
three-quarters of students said yes. Ninety-one percent of students in the 
school were polled: 1,423 favored keeping the system; 428 were against it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an article in the student newspaper, the Oiler Times, the primary 
reasons given by students opposed to block scheduling were that class periods 
are too long, classes are boring and students forget past lessons. Advantages 
listed were staff and students are more relaxed, there are more opportunities 
for hands-on activities and there is increased productivity.

INFANT DAUGHTER IS NO PEA-BRAIN IN A POD; CHILD CARE: WORKING MOTHER ENDURES 
"EXPERT" CRITICISM BUT FINDS HER OFFSPRING DEVELOPING JUST FINE, THANK YOU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA T. ROESSNER, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, wonder of wonders. The child has made it through her first year, and her 
brain appears to be developing quite well, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 She points; she babbles; she lurches around on two feet. She picks up her toy 
phone, throws the receiver over her shoulder and inquires, "Eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 All this despite the fact that her mother works. 
</P>
<P>
 Penelope Leach, do you hear me? The baby's neurons have been stimulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Esteemed authors of the Carnegie report, are you listening? Her synapses are 
activated. 
</P>
<P>
 Young women, take heart. Steel yourself against the flood tide of information 
about the deleterious effects of day care. It's not that it's false. But it's 
not the whole truth. And it emphatically does not mean that if you dare to 
retain your employment after procreating, your offspring will be condemned to 
idiocy. 
</P>
<P>
 Phew. These first 12 months have been a minefield like no other, and I've 
already been through this baby thing several times before. 
</P>
<P>
 There are always the issues of nursing and weaning and why doesn't she play 
peek-a-boo when the baby down the street does? And there always has loomed the 
great dilemma of when to return to work, and how much and what kind of day care 
is to be entrusted with the thing you love most. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't recall ever hearing quite this desperate a drumbeat of impending 
danger and imminent doom for the children of working mothers. The fretting 
about whether they're safe, whether they're fed, whether they're being calmed 
and comforted on cue -- that's always been there. But I don't ever remember 
having to worry about the size of the cerebellum. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure who started this -- science, I suppose -- but the Carnegie 
Corp.'s latest report, "Starting Points: Meeting the Needs of Our Youngest 
Children," certainly brought it to the fore. And a similar salvo by Penelope 
Leach (Britain's Dr. Spock) in the New York Times Sunday Magazine a while back 
certainly clinched it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both injected the day-care debate with new advances in molecular biology and 
neurology that show an infant's earliest interactions determine how many brain 
cells they will have for the rest of their lives. If the stimulation isn't 
sufficient and correct, the cells are literally pared from the infants' brains. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look very closely, if you read carefully and fully, what Leach and the 
Carnegie folks are really saying is that we need more generous parental-leave 
policies in this country and better-funded, higher-quality day care. And in 
that they are, of course, right. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the myriad stresses that afflict today's working mothers, given our 
acute sensitivities to these matters, the underlying message is: Go home. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few women I know have been plunged yet again into a crisis of 
self-doubt and self-blame; more than a few are talking about quitting their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't gone that far, although I have somehow managed to fixate on one 
Carnegie statistic -- that 53% of women return to work within one year of a 
child's birth. That's about half. Only half? I thought I, routinely back at my 
desk within a few months of childbirth, had more company than that. I thought I 
had safety in numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was I thinking? What have I done? Does that other half know something 
I don't? Am I raising a pea-brain after all? 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the reports and the research and the question marks, along 
comes the first birthday, a most poignant milestone for mother and child. There 
have been so many times during the past year when I thought I'd never make it. 
But I'm here. And so is my baby's brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid combs her own hair. She methodically places macaroni on a spoon. She 
wrestles her brothers and her sister and in so doing has acquired that 
all-important survival skill, the fake cry. 
</P>
<P>
 No one taught her these things. No one took it upon themselves to deliberately 
activate her synapses. She watched. She engaged. She learned. She was loved and 
nurtured and "stimulated" naturally, spontaneously, even during those times 
when I wasn't around. 
</P>

INK: DEATH AND RESURRECTION FOR SPY MAGAZINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. His column is published Fridays.

<P>
 As chronicled at length in Inside Media, a biweekly trade publication, the 
last days of Spy were marked by nasty feuding among the staffers -- the kind of 
meltdown the magazine used to gleefully discover in somebody else's back yard.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the plans had been to plant cocaine in my desk and then call the 
police," said a bitter Tony Hendra in the article. He was the editor in 
February when owner Jean Pigozzi finally cut off financial life support and 
closed the unprofitable, but rarely dull, satirical monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 Comes the spring and Spy is being resurrected by new management. Sussex 
Publishers Inc. confirmed Monday that it had purchased Spy -- presumably the 
name and the valuable subscription list -- and on Wednesday, the 
Manhattan-based company announced that the magazine would reappear with a July 
/ August issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sussex is not new to revivals. It stepped in and bought two other 
once-struggling magazines, Psychology Today and Mother Earth News, from Owen 
Lipstein, now the company's editorial director, and made them work.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the announcement, Lipstein will become editorial director of Spy, 
Jim Mauro will serve as editor, and the relaunched mag will include 
contributions from writers Jamie Malanowski, Mark O'Donnell and other alumni.

 Waiting on Haldeman's "Diaries": Those who felt Richard M. Nixon was 
undeservedly lionized in death may rest their case when "The Haldeman Diaries" 
by the H.R. Haldeman is published posthumously by G.P. Putnam's Sons next week 
(with a CD-ROM edition from Sony). 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News' "Nightline" lined up a first peek at the book and plans to devote 
next Tuesday's broadcast to what apparently is an unfiltered and often 
unflattering chronicle of the Nixon presidency as related in diary entries that 
Haldeman made on each of the 1,500 days he served as White House chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the "Nightline" exclusive, Putnam plans to withhold books from 
other media until Wednesday, when copies also are expected to reach stores.

 New Editor at N.Y. Observer: With a heavy dose of media stories, fresh gossip, 
irascible columnists and even some hard-edged news, the New York Observer has 
grown in seven years of publication to exert an influence that far exceeds its 
modest circulation of about 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There are glossy monthly magazines that would love to be the kind of must-read 
that the weekly newspaper with the salmon-colored pages has become among media 
hounds in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter W. Kaplan, whom owner-publisher Arthur L. Carter named this week as the 
new editor, praises the paper that he will take over on June 1 while signaling 
that he plans to stir the by-now-familiar mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I want to add more pop to the pitch, to juice up the paper," said 
Kaplan, 40, who has been executive producer of PBS' "Charlie Rose Show" since 
September and previously worked at Conde Nast Traveler, the now-defunct 
Manhattan, inc. and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan's hiring comes as New York's two other leading weekly publications also 
have changed top editors: Karen Durbin rejoined the Village Voice and Kurt 
Andersen has been overhauling New York magazine. Unlike these competitors, 
however, the Observer continues to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carter was buying pieces of the East Hampton Star and Sag Harbor Herald 
in 1991, he said he hoped to make the Observer profitable within five years, 
after investing another $5 million to $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I would say that that estimate was a little optimistic," Carter said 
Tuesday -- and then he laughed. "The time is longer and the money is more. My 
patience is fine, but the dollars are another matter." 
</P>

 Teen Gathers Life's Lessons: Several years ago, teen-ager Beau Bauman wrote to 
about 2,000 famous folks and asked them to identify the most important thing 
they had learned in life. Hundreds replied. Then, a weekly paper in the 
book-minded Hamptons ran a story about his mail. Which prompted publishers who 
saw the piece to come courting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Most Important Thing I've Learned in Life," edited and compiled by 
Bauman, a student at Southold (N.Y.) High School, has now been published as a 
$6.95 paperback by Fireside Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, which 
reportedly paid him a $25,000 advance. The print run is a hefty 50,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheelchair-bound physicist Stephen Hawking wrote to Bauman, "What I have 
learned from life is to make the most of what you have got." 
</P>
<P>
 Katharine Hepburn: "Keep going -- whatever -- always."

FEW BILINGUAL TEACHERS FEEL MAGNETS' PULL; EDUCATION: BONUS PAY AT REGULAR 
CAMPUSES WITH MORE MINORITIES LURES INSTRUCTORS AWAY FROM THE HIGHLY LAUDED 
SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' highly lauded magnet schools are finding themselves in a Catch-22 
situation: They are under increasing pressure to hire more bilingual teachers 
but can't pay them as much as regular campuses with higher minority 
enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 A districtwide shortage of bilingual teachers, coupled with the fact that they 
can receive a $5,000 bonus at regular schools with higher minority enrollment, 
has led to stiff competition among campuses. And most of the magnets, long 
considered the gems of the school system, are joining the race without the 
financial incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had some of the finest bilingual teachers pass through here, but 
they're on their way to schools where they'll get paid $5,000," said Greta 
Pruitt, the principal at 32nd Street/USC Performing Arts Magnet near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep trying to build the idea that the focus of the magnet is good enough 
to draw them from the additional salary," Pruitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake for the magnet schools is continued political support for the 
program. In agreeing to expand the magnet program by 24 schools -- including 10 
in the San Fernando Valley -- the Board of Education last week required all 
magnets to hire more bilingual teachers and to recruit more 
non-English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnets offer a specialized academic program with integrated classrooms 
and a hand-picked staff. Nearly one in three students who apply will get in 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents think these schools are the best choices for their children," said 
Leticia Quezada, the school board president. "There are parents of all 
ethnicities who want their children to have the best education they can. This 
is part of making our schools accessible to all our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, officials say they have had trouble attracting qualified 
bilingual teachers. There are 3,500 bilingual teachers in the school system, 
but officials say they need about 2,500 more. In addition, just 169 work in 
magnet schools, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bilingual teachers certainly have some leverage now," said Jesus Limon, a 
bilingual teacher and coordinator at San Fernando Elementary School. "But I 
think most people would be more apt to stay where they're making more money. 
Personally, I wouldn't want to take a pay cut and continue to do the same 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage more bilingual teachers to apply to Los Angeles schools, the 
district agreed six years ago to offer a pay differential -- $5,000 if they 
work in schools designated as predominantly minority campuses and $1,000 if 
they work in others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring fully qualified bilingual teachers is a problem for all schools 
throughout the Los Angeles school district -- and throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within our budget constraints, we are going up and down the state trying to 
recruit bilingual teachers," said Ben Lujan, who oversees the district's 
teacher recruitment and selection division. "It's a fierce competition within 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 While most magnet schools enroll more than 60% minority students, they are not 
considered to be predominantly minority -- a formal designation that is given 
to other schools with about 90% minority pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada and others acknowledge that bilingual teachers in the nation's 
second-largest school system are in high demand because of the increasing 
number of students who can't speak English. Of the district's 640,000 students, 
nearly 280,000 -- or 44% -- speak limited English. Of the 37,000 who attend 
magnets, nearly 3,000 -- less than 10% -- do not speak fluent English. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools that have them (bilingual teachers), don't want to lose them," 
said Ann Hill, the magnet coordinator at Granada Hills High, which has a math, 
science and technology magnet center. "It absolutely is difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the competition for bilingual teachers will be even worse 
next year. In a settlement with the teachers union, the district has decided to 
stop paying bilingual teachers the $5,000 bonus next year at 50 schools -- 
primarily in the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles. Because those 
schools have fewer students who don't speak English than in previous years, the 
district decided that it could no longer justify giving those teachers the 
extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers will, however, receive the $1,000 district bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, two bilingual teachers at Chatsworth Park Elementary, for 
example, have decided to leave the school district in part because they will no 
longer receive the $5,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain a full, bilingual credential, teachers must take extensive courses. 
The district hires teachers who have portions of the full bilingual credential, 
but they do not receive the full bonus pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals throughout the district say they are recruiting bilingual teachers, 
but they do not want to undercut each other. In addition, some board members 
and others say they fear that siphoning off the bilingual teachers from regular 
schools will mean fewer bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough problem," said board member Jeff Horton, who favors reducing the 
number of white students who can be admitted to magnets to increase the number 
of minority students. "But the whole idea of magnets has something unfair about 
it to the extent they drain off active teachers, involved parents and motivated 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnet schools, which have a waiting list of more than 23,000 students, are 
considered to be the gems of the school system. When Granada Hills High, for 
example, began its magnet center last year, the school received 60 applications 
from teachers for seven positions. Only a couple were bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnets' biggest draw is the fact that the students -- and their parents 
-- choose to attend. Principals say that they have an active group of parents 
and students, and that the teachers' morale also is higher than at regular 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incentive to teach at magnets is great," said Assistant Supt. Amy 
McKenna, who oversees the instruction division. "But I imagine it will be tough 
recruiting" bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Gee, the principal at Vintage Magnet in North Hills, said she hired a 
bilingual kindergarten teacher who left after a year to work in a school where 
she could receive the $5,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is an important issue," Gee said. "It's a problem not only in the 
magnet schools but in all schools."

STATE SUES DISTRICT OVER CLAS EXAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to convince the Antelope Valley Union High School District it must 
administer the controversial CLAS exam, the state Department of Education on 
Thursday turned to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The department filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking a court order 
mandating that the 12,400-student district give the California Learning 
Assessment System test. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time the department has taken a school district to court over 
CLAS although department attorney Allan Keown said the same action will be 
taken against all of the districts refusing to administer the test. As of 
Thursday, six of the 1,007 California school districts have notified the 
Department of Education they would not administer the 1994 test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have certain legal responsibilities and in order for us to carry out our 
legal responsibilities each (school) district in California has to carry out 
its responsibilities and give the test," said Keown. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS has been praised by supporters as a revolutionary method of testing 
students' critical thinking skills, but has been attacked by others for asking 
students personal questions, containing reading selections that denigrate the 
family and being shrouded in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the test, including a majority of the Antelope Valley district 
board, also have argued that while the Education Code requires that a statewide 
test be administered annually in every school district, there is no law 
designating CLAS as that test. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the Wilson Administration called for an independent review 
and a financial audit of CLAS. The California Teacher's Assn., a longtime CLAS 
supporter, also criticized the Education Department's handling of the exam with 
Del Weber, CTA president, calling for suspension of the exams pending a full 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley board president Billy Pricer said he was expecting Thursday's 
lawsuit. But, he said, he had remained hopeful the Department of Education 
would not file the suit in light of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 He said regardless of whether Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issues a court 
order mandating that the test be given, the Antelope Valley district has 
brought a lot of attention to the problems with CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were the catalyst, taking as strong of a stand as we did," Pricer 
said. "The state displays a lot of arrogance and I don't like that. They drew 
the battle lines and we had no option as far as I was concerned but to confront 
them with the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer said he will obey a court order to give the test, but will continue to 
fight CLAS in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Tony Welch, who with Pricer and Sue Stokka voted not to give the 
test, echoed Pricer's comments, saying also that he would not want to spend 
district money to fight a court order to give the test.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our responsibility is to argue that there is no clear mandatory duty at this 
point for the district to give this test," said attorney Frank J. Fekete, whose 
Schools Legal Service represents the Antelope Valley district. "The burden is 
on the department to prove there is some clear mandate to give the test." 
</P>
<P>
 With all the controversy over CLAS, Fekete said he believes the state will be 
hard-pressed to prove its point in court. The test is not given to special 
education or limited-English proficiency students, and the department agreed 
last week to allow parents to exempt their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think an argument can be made that the things the state has done with 
respect to the test, without regard to whether the test is good or valid, has 
undercut the value of the test," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They say the state wants some statewide test, that they're giving (CLAS) so 
they can assess and compare school districts. How can there be any validity to 
the comparison when it's not a random sample, when anyone can opt out?" 
</P>
<P>
 A conservative majority of Antelope Valley district trustees voted April 20 
not to administer the test, criticizing its secrecy and saying it violates 
parents' rights by asking personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education responded to the board's 3-2 decision by ordering 
the district to administer the test by June 15 and giving it until May 6 to 
make a decision, threatening legal action if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The board majority, however, continued to refuse to administer CLAS. "I still 
contend we're doing the right thing," Pricer said. "My whole position is to be 
a parent's advocate." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Wilda Andrejcik and Bill Olenick, who voted against the decision 
not to administer CLAS, said after reviewing the test they found nothing that 
violates parents' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it most educational," said Andrejcik, who herself answered questions 
from seven versions of the 1994 CLAS test for 10th-graders. "I thought it was 
enlightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick said that after hearing the criticism and receiving copies of what 
test opponents claim are portions, he was surprised at what he found when he 
reviewed the actual tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, it's a good test, period," he said. "All these horror stories 
are just that, horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Keown said a June 1 hearing is likely. Antelope Valley district Supt. Robert 
Girolamo said if the ruling is not made until early June, there will not be 
time to administer the test before the school year ends June 15.

OFFICIALS SEEK PAROLE OFFICE CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local elected officials and police joined a Sherman Oaks homeowners group 
Thursday to protest the recent opening of a parole office in their community, 
complaining that the office is located too close to a park and that public 
notification about the opening was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents Sherman Oaks, and 
Capt. James McMurray of the Los Angeles Police Department joined a Sherman Oaks 
homeowner group at a news conference to ask state officials to close the parole 
office on Van Nuys Boulevard that opened last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) called Gov. Pete 
Wilson and state Department of Corrections Director James Gomez to demand that 
the state relocate the parole office, according to a Roberti aide. Roberti has 
yet to receive a response to his request, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 State parole officials defend the decision to open the office, saying they 
properly notified state and local officials. They also reject criticism that 
the office will generate more crime in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The parole office opened April 25 at 5121 Van Nuys Blvd. to consolidate two 
San Fernando Valley parole offices and provide more room for parole officials. 
It has 70 state employees, including 50 armed parole officers, and serves 4,100 
parolees. The office is located across the street from the Van Nuys/Sherman 
Oaks Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky criticized state corrections officials, saying he received no 
notice about the opening. After reading a notice sent to Roberti, he said, he 
was angry that the document was vague about what type of office was being 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's behavior on this has been sneaky and shocking," Yaroslavsky said 
in an interview after the news conference. He said he will urge the City 
Council today to ask the Department of Corrections to close the Sherman Oaks 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray, commander of the LAPD's Van Nuys Division, said he too was not 
notified of the office opening. He said he fears that the parolees coming and 
going at the center will cause problems in a relatively low-crime area. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky and Sandy Miller, Roberti's district chief of staff, said they 
believe the opening violates the state's own guidelines, which says parole 
offices should be located at least a quarter-mile from parks and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of office, by their own guidelines, should not be within a 
quarter-mile from a park," the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Marino, who heads the parole office, said the state's Department of 
General Services sent notices about the opening last to elected state 
officials, the Los Angeles city clerk's office and LAPD Chief Willie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the charges that the office violates state regulations, Marino said the 
guidelines regarding the location of parole offices are merely recommendations 
and not requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the state has already signed a five- to 10-year, $2.5-million 
lease and that relocation would be unlikely because of the money already 
invested in the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the office will serve 4,100 convicted criminals, Marino said parolees 
will come to the office only to sign papers or receive special drug testing. 
For the most part, he said, parole officers meet with parolees at the parolees' 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my personal experience of 24 years, I have had little or no incidents 
around parole office sites," Marino said, adding that parolees tend to stay 
clear of parole offices. "They have an aversion to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the public outcry over the parole office is not new. In other cities, 
such as El Monte and Alhambra, local officials have agreed to help pay the 
costs of relocating parole offices that have created a public furor, Marino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yaroslavsky rejected any suggestion that the city of Los Angeles will help 
pay to relocate the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is not going to pay," he said. "This is not the city's mistake."

GIRL IS STRUCK BY SCHOOL VEHICLE, SERIOUSLY HURT; SUN VALLEY: AUTHORITIES SAY 
FIRST-GRADER MAY HAVE BEEN CONFUSED BY BURNED-OUT TRAFFIC SIGNAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A first-grader was critically injured Thursday morning when she was struck by 
a small school bus at an intersection where the traffic signal had burned out, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old Veronica Pech was airlifted to Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center, where she was being treated for a ruptured spleen and a deep cut on her 
face, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her condition was upgraded from critical to serious Thursday afternoon, but 
she remained in the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit, according to a 
hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, the traffic light where Veronica was crossing -- 
at the northeast corner of Strathern Street and Vineland Avenue -- did not 
signal stop because the red light bulb was burned out, said a city 
Transportation Department official. The pedestrian signal, with its orange 
don't walk hand, was operating properly, but was partially obscured by a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the California Highway Patrol, which is investigating the accident, said 
that because the pedestrian signal at the corner was working, authorities 
believe Veronica should have known not to cross, said CHP Officer Rich Obregon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the CHP and witnesses to the 7:25 a.m. accident, the young North 
Hollywood girl had gotten off a public Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
bus about four blocks from her school, Roscoe Elementary School, 10765 
Strathern St. 
</P>
<P>
 When she reached the corner of Strathern and Vineland, Veronica -- who was 
trying to cross Strathern from south to north -- waited for a car to turn 
right, then stepped out into the street. Witnesses and authorities said that 
her comments after the accident indicated she might have been confused by the 
burned-out red light. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that she didn't know the light was red, and couldn't remember that 
it was," Obregon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica was hit when the driver of the Los Angeles Unified School District 
mini-bus was unable to stop in time, authorities said. The eastbound driver, 
who had a green light, tried to swerve out of the way, witnesses said, but the 
right front of the bus hit Veronica in the face and knocked her over. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie McLeod, who was waiting at a nearby bus stop, said he saw the school 
bus bearing down on the girl, but was too far away to try to pull her out of 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the bus coming, so I called out and she stopped," McLeod said. "If she 
had kept on going, the bus might have run over her." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, McLeod said he talked to Veronica to keep her calm until help 
arrived. "I lied to her and told her it was just a scratch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school's principal, Ruth Bunyan, rushed to the scene when she 
learned what had happened. "Her eyes were open but she was not moving," she 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus driver -- Ricardo Barajas, 28, of Lancaster, a district employee -- 
has not been charged in the accident. "It doesn't appear he did anything 
wrong," Obregon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses lauded Barajas for doing the best he could to avoid a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It totally took this guy by surprise," McLeod said. "He did very well just 
avoiding the oncoming traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Barajas nor the sole elementary student who was riding in the school 
bus were injured, a school district spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The red light bulb was replaced Thursday afternoon and the tree that hid part 
of the pedestrian signal was trimmed, said Don Benjamin, a senior traffic 
signal superintendent at the city's Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benjamin joined those who discounted the light as a contributing factor in 
the accident, saying the pedestrian signal had been at least partly visible 
from the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a red light out for vehicle traffic, but the hand signal was 
working," he said. "It wasn't totally clear but it was visible." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the intersection, which is traversed by hundreds of students 
each school day, is a hazard -- even when the traffic signal is functioning 
properly -- partly because there is no crossing guard there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children need to be protected at this corner, not a block away," said 
Sharon Lyle, referring to two crossing guards who work at intersections nearer 
to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured girl told officers at the scene that her mother's boyfriend had 
ridden the MTA bus with her, but had gotten off several stops before she did 
and instructed her to stay on the bus until she reached her stop. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, classmates created a mural at the school with their 
handprints and made get-well cards for Veronica. 
</P>
<P>
 A counselor, John Hall, said: "They were very upset but were very relieved to 
hear that she was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the cutest, bubbliest little girl in the world," Hall added. "It's sad 
because she's so responsible."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; COSTUME COMPANY SELLS FASHIONS FROM FILM 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a chance to wear home a piece of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of prison fatigues are on sale for $100, but hey, they were worn in 
"Papillon." If you're a woman with a 14-inch waist, there are plenty of 
showgirl outfits awaiting.  
</P>
<P>
 And should you ever have the occasion to need one, there's a clothes rack 
dedicated to blood-stained, bullet-riddled jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 For a film buff, an actor going to an audition or a collector of vintage 
clothing, there's no better place to buy the shirt off a star's back. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the North Hollywood outlet store of the Western Costume Company, a 
film fashion flea market where a buck can buy a piece of Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
 From "Papillon" to the "George Washington" miniseries, every item in the 
cluttered, musty store has appeared on the silver screen or television.  
</P>
<P>
 To make room for more inventory in the main warehouse next door, the outlet 
store opened last month to sell the outdated costumes to the public for the 
first time in the rental company's 82-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else are you gonna find this stuff?" said actor Chris Darga, 36, of 
North Hollywood, as he checked out one of the "Untouchables" television series 
jackets on sale for $25, still spattered with fake blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the 1,000-plus shoes, hats, dresses and other outfits in the 
outlet store were worn by extras, occasionally there are hidden treasures among 
the racks -- items with the name of the famous star who wore it inscribed on 
the tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one guy who found a two-piece outfit worn by Shirley Temple," said 
Giovanna Edwards, the costume curator at the shop, located on Vanowen Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 "He and his friend were going to rent a bunch of old Shirley Temple videos to 
see which one it was in." 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no knowing when a rare, collectible item will come in. Stock for 
the outlet store is replenished once a week from the warehouse next door, which 
has an inventory of 5 million costumes that are rented. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for most items range from $1 -- for a woman's hat from a 
turn-of-the-century film -- to $25 -- for hats worn by the Mexican troops in 
the film "The Alamo."  
</P>
<P>
 The rest is a hodgepodge of costumes in conditions ranging from good to 
tattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards recalls one woman who wanted to buy the movie poster from Rodgers and 
Hammerstein's "Flower Drum Song" hanging above the cash register.  
</P>
<P>
 While it wasn't for sale, the Japanese kimono worn by an actress in the movie 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she looked at the tag inside it had the name of the actress . . . she 
was so excited," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 A visit to the store Thursday revealed that some customers are just as 
interesting as the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, you need costumes to audition for the characters you do and 
thrift stores have become more expensive than Bullock's," said Darga, who 
recently appeared in a "Seinfeld" episode and once spent $1,500 for an audition 
suit.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good place to get cheap stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Darga settled for something to wear until the next residual check comes in: a 
pair of $10 camouflage trousers that struggled through a few too many war 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Fleming from Frazier Park walked in the door like he was already in 
costume. 
</P>
<P>
 Decked out in cowboy boots, a red handkerchief, and a Stetson hat covering his 
wild, gray hair, Fleming came over to look for some old blankets he could cut 
up for a scene he would be doing in an upcoming Western flick. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not find what he was looking for, he still left happy after 
shelling out $5 for a Revolutionary War officer's jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here since the first day they opened," said Fleming, 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what you are going to find." JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FIREFIGHTERS BRUSH UP ON HILLSIDE SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Area firefighters clothed from head to toe in fire-retardant garb practiced 
skills used to battle stubborn brush fires on Thursday on green meadows dotting 
the steep hillsides of the Verdugo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Come summer, these green meadows will dry out when exposed to 100-degree 
temperatures and become highly flammable, posing a danger to homes on Southland 
hillsides and to the city below, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters from Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena and Los Angeles County attended 
the three-day drill -- held at the end of Oakmont View Drive -- to perfect 
methods used to fight fires ignited by dried grass and brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The exercises were also designed to hone fire officials' management skills and 
to coordinate firefighting activities between city fire departments, said 
Glendale Battalion Chief Michael Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The drills were a eerie reminder of the brush fire that swept through the 
hills above Glendale College in the summer of 1990, destroying a multitude of 
hillside homes.  
</P>
<P>
 About 15 engine companies and four camp crews from Los Angeles County 
participated. JENNIFER OLDHAM

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; GAS SHUT-OFF VALVES: TIME 
FOR A MANDATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council declined to approve a plan that would 
require all new city buildings to be equipped with automatic gas shut-off 
valves, sending the proposal to the council's Public Safety Committee for 
further study. Under Councilman Hal Bernson's plan, the devices, which stop the 
flow of gas during and after an earthquake, would be required in all new 
buildings, structures being substantially remodeled, mobile home parks and 
multifamily residential buildings. Critics have argued that the devices may 
create more problems for the city if they can be triggered by insignificant 
aftershocks or vibrations caused by traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Los Angeles require all new buildings to be equipped with automatic gas 
shut-off valves? 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Estrada, spokeswoman for Southern California Gas Co.: 
</P>
<P>
 "We are opposed to regulations and legislation to mandate the installation of 
these devices. Part of the reason why we're opposed is that they're so easily 
triggered. They may be triggered by a truck driving by, for instance. The 
problem we had in the Northridge earthquake is that there were people who 
panicked (and shut off their gas unnecessarily). If these devices were 
mandated, that would pose a lot of operational problems to the company. Another 
problem is that there's not a real consistent standard for manufacturers to 
follow. . . . Overall, we're still opposed to mandating the widespread 
installation of these devices. It ought to be a personal decision. When 
customers buy these devices, they ought to think about the potential 
drawbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Bernson, city councilman: 
</P>
<P>
 Shut-off valves "would prevent fires in the case of gas lines that rupture. We 
had a number of gas lines that ruptured in this recent quake. . . . Had it not 
occurred at 4:31 a.m., people would not have been home to turn the gas off. In 
the history of earthquakes, most of the damage is caused by fires. . . . The 
council's going to have to have the courage to do what's right. I don't know if 
this council has those guts. It just depends on what the council does. . . . 
This nonsense that a truck is going to trigger it, or a much smaller quake, is 
absolutely untrue. I would prefer to see the standards change so they're not 
quite so sensitive, but in the meantime, we need some protection. If the 
standards change, the valves will have to be changed, just like our building 
codes. We need some action on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Nicolaides, owner of Fullerton-based Quakemaster, a valve manufacturer: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very critical about the construction and design of our valves. Ours are 
not very sensitive. It's sensitive where it needs to be. A big truck or a train 
is not going to set it off. The only reason it would go off unnecessarily is if 
it wasn't installed properly. If it's installed properly, it'll work. . . . It 
would be very good for business -- my business, but I have some reservations 
about mandating it. How many things work properly that are mandatory? . . . I 
think people need to be aware of (these devices). Unfortunately, the gas 
company has taken a very negative stand on them, but I see their side. If they 
have to start up 50,000 homes again, that's a problem. With any of the valves 
on the market, the homeowner can reset (the gas). People need to be able to 
detect a gas leak before they do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sills, senior architect supervisor for the office of the state architect 
of California, the agency that regulates the valves' manufacture and sale: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy as the state architect's office is that we're neutral. We do 
recommend in highly seismic areas that people consider all things to protect 
their property, like strapping their water heaters down, which is now required 
in the state of California. People can anchor bookcases to the wall, they can 
anchor file cabinets, place latches on their cabinet doors -- simple, common 
things. . . . I don't believe (the valves are as faulty as critics say), but 
we're not getting enough feedback from earthquakes and the people who have (the 
valves). One of the projects we want to do is take different manufacturers . . 
. and subject (their valves) to different earthquake frequencies so we can 
compare and see what happens to manufacturer A and manufacturer B. We hope we 
can toughen up the seismic response even more."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MURDER CONVICTIONS URGED AGAINST DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man who ran a red light while driving drunk and slammed into 
another car, killing two people, should be convicted of murder, a prosecutor 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel McGinnis, 39, is liable for murder because he made a conscious decision 
to go drink at a bar, and he knew that he would be driving home, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow said during closing arguments in McGinnis' trial. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinnis is charged with two counts of murder stemming from a July 27, 1992, 
accident at the intersection of Woodman Avenue and Valerio Street, where 
McGinnis' Ford Ranger slammed into four young people in a Hyundai Excel. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers Maria Henriquez Delcarmen, 16, and Eynar Contreras, 25, were killed 
in the early morning wreck, which occurred after McGinnis left one bar and was 
headed to another.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the vehicle, Rocael Contreras, who was then 23, and Anna Suarez, 
then 20, were injured but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinnis was traveling 52 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone when he went through a 
red light and struck the Hyundai, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, McGinnis had a blood alcohol level of 0.25% -- more than 
three times the legal limit of 0.08%.  
</P>
<P>
 When questioned after the crash, McGinnis admitted to Police Detective Maureen 
Correa that he was too drunk to drive, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, McGinnis was on probation for his second drunk-driving 
conviction, he was attending a court-ordered alcohol awareness school and he 
had a restricted license that allowed him to drive legally only to and from 
work, Rabichow told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinnis does not contest that he was driving while under the influence of 
alcohol and that he caused the accident.  
</P>
<P>
 However, he strongly disagrees with the prosecutor's contention that he is a 
murderer, said defense attorney Michael Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have this level of alcohol, you cannot appreciate what's going on," 
Gottlieb said outside court. "You cannot form the prerequisite knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb said he will concede to the jury during his closing argument this 
morning that McGinnis is guilty of vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to gain a murder conviction -- in this case murder in the second 
degree -- prosecutors must prove the defendant had "malice aforethought." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabichow has attempted to convince the jury that McGinnis formed malice by 
going to the bar, intending to drive home and knowing full well the dangers of 
drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor admitted to the jury that McGinnis had no intention of killing 
two people, but that he embarked on an intentional course of conduct that 
McGinnis knew was inherently dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 If McGinnis is convicted of murder, the law would require Van Nuys Superior 
Court Judge Michael J. Farrell to sentence him to a minimum of 15 years to life 
in prison.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, gross vehicular manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of six 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is expected to begin deliberations today. THOM MROZEK

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HORSE OWNERS DECRY PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 San Fernando Valley horse owners on Thursday blasted a 
complicated set of restrictions they fear are designed to drive their beloved 
animals out of suburban neighborhoods across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a raucous 90-minute meeting at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club, a 
standing-room-only crowd of equestrians decried a proposed Los Angeles law that 
would more closely regulate how horses are kept within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to change a whole lifestyle for a lot of people," Granada 
Hills resident Kent Lovelady said. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this 
is warped to suit somebody's needs, but not a horse owner's." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovelady and other equestrians said they felt betrayed because planners did 
not listen to recommendations they made in a 1992 document dubbed "The Horse 
Owner's Bill of Rights." That report was prepared at the request of Los Angeles 
City Councilman Hal Bernson, who wanted to streamline the complicated laws now 
governing horse keeping and to balance the needs of horse owners with the 
desires of developers. 
</P>
<P>
 But planners who drafted the regulations say the new rules would actually make 
it easier for horse owners to maintain their lifestyle in the face of pressure 
from developers. In fact, they said, the bulk of the new regulations are minor 
changes to existing rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no conspiracy here," city planner Steve Ciccarelli said. "There 
really isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the regulations would require 2,000 square feet of corral 
space for horses. Opponents claim that is too much space and they also attack a 
requirement to set pens and stables back at least 10 feet from property lines. 
Existing properties that do not meet the requirements would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a licensed horse has not been kept on the property for more than three 
years, a property owner would be required to make the necessary changes before 
a new horse would be allowed. Opponents complain that would leave them with no 
flexibility and unable to sell their property to other horse enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission was to consider the regulations Thursday, but the vote 
was delayed at least two weeks because the body lacked a quorum. Arline 
DeSanctis, field deputy for City Councilman Joel Wachs, said her office will 
ask the Planning Department to meet with equestrians before the next meeting to 
talk about the regulations and to try to iron out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are totally confused right now," DeSanctis said. AARON CURTISS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; BONE MARROW RECIPIENT MEETS HER LIFESAVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under the rush of emotion, Tracy Van Ryswyk found simple words work best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," the 27-year-old waitress and cosmetologist said again and again. 
"Thank you. Thank you for saving my life." 
</P>
<P>
 For Paramount television executive Joe Lucas, there were no words at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were united in a tearful ceremony organized by the American Red Cross 
on Wednesday night, more than two years after the tall, bright-eyed Van Ryswyk 
learned she'd die without a bone marrow donor, and one year after Lucas, of 
Tarzana, underwent surgery to save the life of a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony at Paramount Studios in Hollywood -- which also honored 25 other 
marrow donors from Southern California -- brought to a close two years of hope 
and fear and unanswered questions for those on both the giving and receiving 
ends of the biological gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old Lucas was introduced to bone marrow transplants on his way 
home from a softball game in 1990. A friend stopped to have his blood tested, 
hoping he could match tissue types with the young Adam Brock, whose search for 
a donor had captivated the Los Angeles area at the time. The friend invited 
Lucas to be tested as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither matched (and the 12-year-old Brock died in 1991, before a donor could 
be found) but both registered their names with the National Marrow Donor 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later and more than 500 miles away in Mesa, Ariz., Van Ryswyk became 
ill. She began thinking something was seriously wrong, despite reassurances 
from various doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having stomach problems," she said. "My spleen was getting really big." 
</P>
<P>
 In April 1992 she was diagnosed with chronic leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The options were horrifyingly simple: she could find a marrow donor or die. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Ryswyk's early hopes for a quick cure waned when she learned that only 
about 30% of patients find a match with the most likely source -- a family 
member. She was adopted, and so faced lottery-like odds anywhere between 
1-in-100 and 1-in-a-million of finding an anonymous donor. 
</P>
<P>
 She beat the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, doctors pumped three bags of Lucas' marrow into Van Ryswyk 
through a catheter in her chest.  
</P>
<P>
 When she was checked last month, there was no evidence of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of strict confidentiality rules, patients and donors are not allowed 
to meet, or even know the other's name, for at least a year after the marrow 
transplant. The primary reason for the secretiveness is in case a transplant 
doesn't take and more marrow is needed, the Red Cross can act as go-between.  
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials -- who flew Van Ryswyk in from her new home in San 
Francisco for the meeting -- went to great lengths to ensure the two remained 
unknown to one another until the ceremony, even checking Van Ryswyk into a 
Hollywood hotel under the assumed name of Sophie Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lucas first matched and learned he could become a donor, doctors told him 
of the serious risks of surgery, of the possible failure of the procedure, of 
the pain. He was undaunted then, and remains so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine any pain great enough to keep someone from saving another 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 60,000 potential donors on the registry in Southern California, but 
people continue to die almost daily because they are unable to find matches. 
The only requirements to become a donor are you must be between 18 and 55 and 
in good health.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; 2,000 LINE UP FOR MARCH OF DIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Balloons, clowns, children pushed in baby strollers and approximately 2,000 
people with their walking shoes on could mean only one thing: the annual Warner 
Walk for the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the first year of the march, 96 employees representing five companies 
participated. Thursday, about 2,000 marchers raised $91,600 for the charity's 
Campaign for Healthier Babies, a nationwide effort to prevent birth defects and 
infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers, wearing brightly colored T-shirts emblazoned with their 
company's name, set out at noon for the mile-long trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they were walking because they believed the March of Dimes was a 
good cause, and they described the event as fun and good exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have children and I'm thankful that they're healthy," said Earline 
Polk-Smith, a senior policy analyst for HealthNet, the event's underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a concerned parent and concerned about the children of the world, and I 
think it's a good cause."  
</P>
<P>
 Isabel Moreno of Blue Cross had been meaning to participate for the last eight 
years but said she would always forget about the march until it was too late. 
On the day before the march, when a co-worker reminded her of the 10 a.m. 
deadline for signing up, Moreno spent the next hour getting sponsors. She 
raised $35. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only two employees of the law firm Lovretovich & Karen donned walking 
shoes, they raised $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "We twisted everybody's arm. They didn't want to walk, but they paid us," said 
Tracy Watz, a legal secretary.  
</P>
<P>
 Lunch -- sandwiches, bottled water, soft drinks and chips -- awaited the 
walkers at the finish line. So did an awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Drake, 23, raised $100 but had the most sponsors, 156. Drake, an 
employee of The Pacific Rim Co., won a two-night stay in Las Palmas, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good charity and my wife had a baby who died from early birth," Drake 
said. The child, not Drake's, was born with an underdeveloped lung and died 
shortly after being born. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Quitazol, a HealthNet employee, raised $4,225 and won a two-night stay at 
Lake Arrowhead resort in the San Bernardino mountains near Big Bear.  
</P>
<P>
 Marci Armin of HealthNet received an award for the company that raised the 
most money.  
</P>
<P>
 "She works for weeks before and weeks after the march," said Jill Luick, a 
HealthNet employee who works with Armin in the company's legal affairs 
department.  
</P>
<P>
 "You associate Warner Walk with Marci." 
</P>
<P>
 As team captain for HealthNet, Armin won a two-night stay in San Diego. Armin 
has walked in all 12 Warner Walks, but her involvement with the March of Dimes 
goes back to her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going door to door for the Mother's March at night with my mother 
holding my hand and asking for money for polio research," said the Sherman Oaks 
native.  
</P>
<P>
 "We would ask people for dimes." TERESA ANN WILLIS

 A 19-year-old construction worker was rescued by firefighters Thursday after a 
concrete wall collapsed on him during earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ballestero and three other laborers were digging out a quake-damaged 
concrete wall surrounding a swimming pool at 10618 Baird Ave. when it toppled 
forward, trapping Ballestero's leg, according to fellow construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
 After a neighbor's call, Los Angeles City firefighters helped Ballestero get 
out by using a high-tech inflatable pillow to lift the heavy wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballestero was treated at Granada Hills Community Hospital for a fractured 
lower leg and released Thursday afternoon, said hospital spokeswoman Sara 
Steinman. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

CREWS URGING VIEWERS TO BOYCOTT NBC; LABOR: BEHIND-THE-SCENES EMPLOYEES ARE 
PROTESTING THE NETWORK'S PLANS TO REDUCE PAY AND ELIMINATE HUNDREDS OF JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The behind-the-scenes crews that work on such television programs as "The 
Tonight Show with Jay Leno," "The NBC Nightly News" and "Days of Our Lives" 
have urged viewers to boycott their employer, NBC, during the important ratings 
month of May. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the latest tactic in an increasingly bitter labor dispute involving the 
union representing 800 behind-the-scenes employees at the Burbank studios, the 
National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians-Communications Workers of 
America.  
</P>
<P>
 Union members have been working without a contract since March 31 and are 
demanding, among other things, a 6% annual pay increase for the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important issues in the dispute are what union officials said are 
the network's plans to reduce pay for some workers and eliminate hundreds of 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic part of the package is not as significant as the preservation of 
jobs and benefits for staff employees, and obtaining benefits for a growing 
number of casual employees," Paula Olson, vice president of the union local in 
Burbank, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is one of the largest in the Valley, and last struck NBC in 1987 for 
17 weeks, the longest strike in network history. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC officials declined to detail bargaining, but said the boycott has no 
noticeable effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We submitted a comprehensive offer that is not to be confused with a final 
offer," said Mary Neagoy, a network spokeswoman in New York. "The boycott has 
had no impact we've been able to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Contract negotiations began in January and have been in recess since early 
April. There are no plans to resume negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that there are many unresolved issues on working conditions 
for 2,500 writers, stage hands, electricians, camera and audio operators, and 
others at NBC stations in Burbank, New York, Washington and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, union members are angered by a proposal to replace newswriting 
and equipment maintenance jobs with cheaper alternatives, to reduce the pay of 
librarians and utility engineers by as much as 60%, and do away with the 
traditional one-hour paid meal period in favor of a shorter amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has mailed 2 million postcards nationwide urging the public to tune 
out NBC programs from April 28 to May 25, and ads carrying the same message 
recently appeared in USA Today and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know NBC is No. 3 in the ratings," Carrie Biggs-Adams, a videotape 
engineer and a member of the union's negotiating team, said during a march 
Thursday at NBC. "We are perfectly willing to take credit for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard decision to make emotionally. We'd rather be proud employees of 
NBC. . . . We hope not to strike. We'd rather see a contract worked out with 
NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 An employee of the network for 18 years, Biggs-Adams took part in the 1987 
strike that lasted for more than four months. The walkout began after NBC 
imposed a contract that union negotiators had rejected. In the end, NBC held 
firm with its intention to eliminate 200 jobs formerly held by union members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very difficult on our members," Biggs-Adams recalled. "It was a 
massive financial hit to us. We gave up some things at the bargaining table." 
</P>
<P>
 Many marchers said they are proud to work at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this company," said an engineer who declined to be identified. "I put 
in 22 years here. Unfortunately, we're in a little labor dispute."

2 PIT BULLS ATTACK WOMAN IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 50-year-old woman out for an afternoon walk was attacked Thursday by two 
dogs that had escaped from a nearby home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was not identified, was walking near the intersection of Parish 
Place and Chandler Boulevard about 5:40 p.m. when she was attacked by two adult 
pit bulls, said Sgt. Rick Madrid of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs dragged the woman to the ground, biting and clawing her on the head, 
back, chest, neck and legs, Madrid said. The dogs' owner, whose name was not 
released, was able to call the dogs off of the woman, Madrid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madrid, who saw the victim, described the attack as a "very serious dog-bite 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman suffered puncture, tear and bite wounds and was taken to a local 
hospital, where she was treated for her injuries, Madrid said.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose condition was not known, was still being treated late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs have been quarantined at the Burbank Animal Control Center until an 
investigation by animal control officers is complete, Madrid said. The dogs' 
owner was not charged.

MORE STUDENTS ARE APPLYING TO MAGNETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students are applying for magnet schools in record numbers this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has received 40,500 applications for 
about 14,000 openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more applications are expected over the next month after the district 
sends out new forms for the 24 newly created magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's phenomenal," said Assistant Supt. Theodore Alexander, who oversees the 
district's integration division. "It's tremendous -- I'm pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 The district last year received 38,000 applications for about 10,000 openings, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While only about one in three students will be selected for the fall, the 
others will be placed on a waiting list for the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education recently approved creating 24 new magnets -- including 
10 in the San Fernando Valley -- that will open up an additional 5,300 new 
classroom seats next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the magnets that already have received a high number of applications 
are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Balboa Gifted/High Ability Magnet in Northridge, with 1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bravo Medical Magnet in East Los Angeles, with 1,400 applications. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies in Reseda, with 2,036. 
</P>
<P>
 * Open School in West Los Angeles, with 744. 
</P>
<P>
 * 32nd Street/USC Performing Arts Magnet near Downtown, with 1,800 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will be notified next month whether their children were accepted into 
the magnet program. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet schools were created during the divisive busing battles of the late 
1970s. They are intended to provide students with a specialized academic 
program in smaller, integrated classrooms. BETH SHUSTER

CONTRACTOR NAMED FOR SIMI FREEWAY REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans on Thursday tapped a San Diego-based construction company to complete 
the rebuilding of the earthquake-damaged Simi Valley Freeway within four 
months, a project that should restore the roadway to pre-quake conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the $9.6-million contract, F. C. I. Constructors has 110 
days to finish rebuilding the westbound side of the bridges at San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek, which were weakened considerably by the 
Northridge temblor. Work will be conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
Caltrans spokeswoman Pat Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a departure from recent practice, Caltrans will award no bonus if work 
is completed early, though penalties for missing the deadline will still apply. 
The state transportation agency has come under fire for the handsome incentives 
it has offered contractors to finish quake-related projects ahead of schedule, 
including a $50,000-a-day bonus a Fontana firm can collect if it completes work 
on the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway before May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 F. C. I. President Ken Dunford said his company would have preferred a similar 
incentive program in the contract awarded Thursday. But he said he was pleased 
nonetheless to have won the contract, adding, "we agreed to the terms before we 
submitted the bid." 
</P>
<P>
 The company will take over and begin restructuring the western half of the 
damaged spans as soon as the eastbound phase is complete. Officials say those 
repairs, which cost $9.7 million, might be finished by Thursday, three days 
before the given deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans split the repair work into two parts to allow drivers to continue 
using part of the Simi Valley Freeway, the main artery through the northern San 
Fernando Valley. During this first phase of reconstruction, eastbound motorists 
have been rerouted onto lanes previously reserved for westbound traffic, 
reducing the total number of lanes available from eight to six. 
</P>
<P>
 When repairs begin on the westbound side of the crumbled bridges -- which 
sagged nearly four feet in some spots after the earthquake -- officials will 
shift traffic to the eastbound side of the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 If construction holds to schedule, the entire freeway should be open by the 
beginning of September, bringing the 528-mile freeway system in Los Angeles 
County nearly back to pre-quake strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, state officials announced that the Golden State Freeway at 
Gavin Canyon will reopen next week, earning a hefty $4.5-million bonus for 
contractors who finished three weeks ahead of schedule. In April, the collapsed 
Santa Monica Freeway was reopened two months earlier than expected, which 
netted an extra $15 million for contractor C. C. Myers Inc.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ACE PILOT UPLIFTS YOUNG OFFENDERS; 
CORRECTIONS: DICK RUTAN STEALS THE SHOW DURING SYBIL BRAND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AT 
DRUG TREATMENT BOOT CAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Juvenile offenders aren't easily impressed by old social workers, but fighter 
pilots are a different story.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Probation Department Drug Treatment Boot Camp in Lake 
Hughes held a 92nd birthday party on Wednesday for Sybil Brand, a pioneer who 
fought for more humane women's prison facilities, and whose name graces the 
front of the Los Angeles County women's jail, the Sybil Brand Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Along for the celebration came Dick Rutan, a highly decorated Vietnam War 
fighter pilot and aviation pioneer best known for flying the homemade plane 
Voyager around the world in 1986 without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 105 teen-agers seemed impressed with Brand's vivaciousness and 
wit, it was the folksy Rutan who stole the show, spinning yarns about being 
shot down in combat and visiting the Reagans in the White House after his 
record-setting flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in military fatigues, the offenders -- most convicted of drug-related 
crimes -- seemed taken by Rutan's message that they, too, could achieve their 
dreams if they devote themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging," said Astor, who wants to study architecture when he 
finishes his 21-week term in two weeks. "It's kind of uplifting after being 
here so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are juveniles, none of the boys' last names can be released. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rutan, who lost a close race for Congress in 1992, visiting the boot camp 
was a way to reflect on his accomplishments.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is therapy," said Rutan, who usually charges $5,000 as a public speaker, 
but who spoke to the youths for free. "I look at all those guys and think, 
'There's nothing separating me from them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although he admits it is extremely tough, William, 17, said the boot camp has 
taught him discipline, responsibility and the harmful effects of drugs. He 
plans to join the Army when he is released. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16- to 18-year-olds in the boot camp go through a rigorous quasi-military 
program, attending school during the day while fixing county roads and helping 
flood-control workers at night. In many cases, the money they earn goes to 
repay victims of their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The military approach is effective, said boot camp Director Dennis Dyer. The 
young offenders seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win," Astor said. "But if you behave well and cooperate, they can 
help you."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LOCKHEED DEDICATES NEW SKUNK WORKS SITE; 
AEROSPACE: THE FACILITY WILL BECOME ANTELOPE VALLEY'S FIRST FULL-SERVICE

 The relocation of Lockheed Advanced Development Co. from Burbank to Palmdale 
is nearly complete, with the last of the nearly 4,000 Skunk Works employees due 
to arrive here by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skunk Works will become the first full-service aircraft company based in 
the Antelope Valley, an area well known for its history of aerospace 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest and newest of the 21 buildings the highly secretive aerospace 
company has constructed at its 542-acre site, located adjacent to Air Force 
Plant 42 in Palmdale, was dedicated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 225,000-square-foot office building, named the Kelly Johnson Advanced 
Development Center in memory of Skunk Works founder and renowned aircraft 
designer Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson, will house nearly 1,000 engineering and 
program management employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe what we have here are the most modern and efficient buildings in 
the aerospace industry," said Skunk Works President Jack Gordon.  
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five decades at its birthplace in Burbank, Lockheed officials 
decided in 1990 to relocate Skunk Works to Palmdale and make it an independent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picking up the stakes and moving out of Burbank involved some risks," Dan 
Tellep, Lockheed Corp. chairman and chief executive officer, told a crowd of 
several hundred employees and invited guests who attended the dedication 
ceremony. "That's true to the nature of Skunk Works." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials, of course, were delighted to be home to the Skunk Works. 
Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said, "We look forward to a long and lasting 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Skunk Works is credited with developing and producing some of the most 
advanced planes of the past several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 It started in a shop building at Lockheed's Burbank plant in 1943 when Johnson 
promised the U.S. Army Air Forces that Lockheed would build a jet fighter 
prototype in 180 days. Just 143 days later the XP-80 was ready for flight.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Skunk Works has continued to operate in super secrecy, 
designing and building such aircraft as the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird and 
F-117 Stealth Fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the dedication ceremony, while kept outside of the guarded 
buildings, were treated to flyovers by a U-2 and an F-117, one of which will 
also be put on display outside the Johnson building.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW SCHEDULE CLOSES CITY HALL TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who try to go to City Hall today will be out of luck -- and not 
because it's Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, this is the first closure of city offices under Santa Clarita's new 
operating schedule, modified so employees can work 80 hours over nine days and 
not 10.One of the reasons: The city has about 185 employees and must adhere to 
South Coast Air Quality Management District standards that call for agencies 
with 100 or more workers to reduce car trips. 
</P>
<P>
 City employees previously worked a modified schedule with half of them off 
Mondays. Department heads said that after two years half-staffing days had not 
proved productive and asked to shift the schedules so all workers had the same 
day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-administrative tasks, such as maintenance work or emergency services, will 
still be conducted every day of the week as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 City offices are open 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m. on alternating Fridays. DOUGLAS ALGER

JEFFIRES DEAL ISN'T DONE YET; PRO FOOTBALL: RAM OFFICIAL SAYS CONTRACT IS SET, 
BUT WIDE RECEIVER SAYS HE COULD REMAIN WITH OILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' pursuit of free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires may have hit a 
familiar stumbling block Thursday night -- the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, said Thursday that Jeffires, a 
three-time Pro Bowl selection, had agreed to terms on a one-year deal worth 
$1.1 million, including $100,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram assistant head coach Joe Vitt and receivers' coach Steve Moore were on 
their way to Greensboro, N.C., Thursday night to take the contract to Jeffires 
and his agent, Fred Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to sign him today," Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeffires, who on April 15 rejected a three-year, $3.9-million offer from 
the Rams, said Thursday night that he will decide today between the Rams' offer 
and re-signing with Houston, which has offered a one-year deal worth $1.25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't agreed to terms with the Rams," Jeffires said. "We'll have a 
decision in the morning. I'm a nice guy and I'm not leading anybody on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flattered that Jay wants me this much -- he hasn't been upset with me one 
time during negotiations. But you always have to have something else sitting 
back there for you." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, it's the Oilers, who have offered a $300,000 signing bonus, 
$650,000 in base salary and $300,000 in incentives. The Rams have offered a 
$400,000 signing bonus, $600,000 in base salary and $100,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers have been negotiating with Jeffires and wide receiver Webster 
Slaughter around the clock the last few days in hopes of re-signing both. 
Jeffires has played his entire pro career with the Oilers, who drafted him in 
the first round out of North Carolina State in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 If they lose Jeffires, the Rams could go 0-3 against the Oilers this 
off-season. The Rams tried unsuccessfully to trade for Houston quarterback 
Warren Moon, and made an offer to offensive tackle Kevin Donnalley, a 
restricted free agent, but the Oilers matched it. 
</P>
<P>
 When he turned down the Rams' original offer in April, Jeffires indicated he 
would entertain offers from other teams or re-sign with the Oilers, who were 
struggling to stay under the $34.6-million salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what I do," he said, "I want a one-year deal. I wasn't happy with 
the three-year deal the Rams put out last month, but if they would have offered 
me more money with that many years, it could have been done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, in desperate need of a top receiver, have coveted Jeffires 
throughout the free-agent signing period. Quarterback Chris Miller, who signed 
with the Rams in March, called Jeffires twice Thursday to encourage him to come 
to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, 29, would complete a rebuilding Rams' receiving corps that includes 
veteran Flipper Anderson and free-agent Greg McMurtry, whom they signed this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zygmunt said he expects to receive the signed contracts today from linebacker 
Joe Kelly and defensive end Robert Young, who agreed to contract terms with the 
Rams this week. The Rams also made a two-year, $1-million offer to tailback 
Cleveland Gary, on whom they retain exclusive rights.

ANGELOS TALKING TO RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: ORIOLES' MAJORITY OWNER, LEADING FIGURE 
IN BALTIMORE'S EFFORT TO ATTRACT AN NFL TEAM, IS IN LOS ANGELES FOR INFORMAL 
MEETINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter G. Angelos, majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles, was in Los Angeles 
Thursday to meet with Ram officials about the possibility of moving the NFL 
team to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his hotel, Angelos refused comment on a meeting schedule or what 
might be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply can't answer your questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, said he would not comment or 
confirm that owner Georgia Frontiere or team officials had met with Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source familiar with the situation said Angelos was here for informal 
meetings, mostly to allow the parties to get acquainted. Angelos was 
accompanied by Larry Lucchino, a member of his proposed NFL investment group 
who has already met several times with Ram officials. They were scheduled to 
return to Baltimore today. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, 65-year-old head of a Baltimore law firm, is a point man in the 
effort to bring an NFL team to Baltimore, which is offering construction of a 
state-of-the-art, $160-million stadium in Camden Yards and a lucrative 
financial package as incentives. The Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are most 
often mentioned as targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Angelos has said, he would like a Baltimore-based investment group to 
purchase a team. But he has indicated he would be willing to be part of a 
non-controlling interest to facilitate a move. This dovetails with Frontiere's 
stance that she does not want to sell the Rams but might be willing to take on 
a minority partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're flexible," Angelos said last week. "Our primary goal is to complete the 
Camden Yards sports complex, and that requires an NFL team in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do whatever's necessary to accomplish that. From percentage of 
ownership, we're prepared to own 100% or less than that. We're open to 
reasonable proposals, and we're interested in any franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Rams are available, it's true that we're very interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Setting a "reasonable" price might be difficult. Financial World recently 
placed the Rams' value at $140 million, with a fair purchase price of $120 
million. But it is believed team officials have a higher price tag, more in the 
neighborhood of the record $185 million paid recently for the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 A 40% non-controlling interest in a team at that price would be $74 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A group purchasing a piece of the Rams would require approval of 75% of the 
league's owners. Under NFL policy, which prohibits cross ownership with other 
professional teams, Angelos' interest in the Orioles would complicate matters. 
But there is a proposal under consideration -- sponsored by Shaw and the Rams 
-- that would lift the ban on dual ownership. The issue could be discussed at 
the next league meetings, May 23-25 in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams became free agents May 3 when they informed the city of Anaheim that 
they were exercising an escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease. The 
clause allows the team to move with 15 months' notice after a payment of about 
$30 million to cover stadium improvements made to entice the team to leave Los 
Angeles in 1980. The team made a $2-million, non-refundable deposit to invoke 
the clause. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has said he is confident of Baltimore's chances of having a team by 
1995, "because the financial arrangements available to an owner are the best in 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a new stadium, the proposed financial package includes all 
revenue from tickets, sky boxes, club seats, parking and concessions for a 
team, which would pay only $1 in rent per game. The Colts' training facility 
would also be renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, the Rams pay rent of 60 cents per admission, not to exceed 
$400,000 per year, and give the city 7.5% of ticket revenue, 20% of luxury box 
revenue and about half of parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 One potential snag in Baltimore's plans is the intention of Jack Kent Cooke, 
owner of the Redskins, to build a new stadium in Laurel, Md., about 15 miles 
away. Cooke, an influential NFL owner, has said he is opposed to having a 
second team in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angelos said last week that Cooke did not concern him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack Kent Cooke should mind his own business, which is administering to 
Redskin fans, which are a large and lovely group of people who have no 
connection with Maryland football fans," he said. " . . . I wouldn't pay much 
attention to him."

FORMULA ONE'S WENDLINGER CRITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than two weeks after three-time world champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil and 
rookie Roland Ratzenberger of Austria were killed during a Formula One weekend 
in Imola, Italy, a third Formula One driver lay in critical condition Thursday 
after crashing during practice for the Monaco Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Wendlinger, 25, of Austria, suffered head injuries when his 
Sauber-Mercedes hit a concrete barrier head-on at high speed shortly after 
exiting the famous Monte Carlo tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said he was in a "very serious coma." 
</P>
<P>
 The three tragic incidents, coming only three months after the deaths of stock 
car drivers Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr at Daytona International Speedway while 
practicing for the Daytona 500, have left the sport searching for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi and Nigel Mansell, all former Formula One 
world champions in Indianapolis preparing for the Indy 500, had varying 
opinions on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should learn something from every accident," Andretti said. 
"Unfortunately, two tragic accidents (Senna and Ratzenberger) occurred where 
it's not a likely place to lose a car. Still, even though race officials felt 
it was a safe place, it would not have cost much for two rows of tires in front 
of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said Senna was killed when a wheel rebounded and hit him on the 
forehead. The same impact, at the same speed, against rows of tires would 
probably not have sent the wheel back against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another thing is the Formula One cockpit. The driver's head and shoulders are 
naked. From the neck up is exposed. Some sort of heavily padded protection for 
the side of the head, such as we have in Indy cars, would help. It might have 
saved a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi, who won the Formula One championship in 1972 and 1974 before 
coming to race in the United States, said the current Formula One cars are much 
too fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weigh 250 pounds less than an Indy car and because they are so light, 
there is not much material around the driver to absorb an impact," Fittipaldi 
said. "The driver is much more vulnerable than he is in an Indy car. I would 
recommend a canopy cockpit, similar to those used in off-shore racing boats, to 
make them more safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell was more philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any form of motor racing over 30 m.p.h. is dangerous," the 1992 Formula One 
champion and current Indy car champion said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past 10 years in Formula One and Indy cars, there have been a lot of 
horrific accidents in which drivers walked away. I call it luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the accident in Phoenix. It was just plain luck we didn't have at least 
one, maybe two, fatalities." 
</P>
<P>
 At Phoenix last month, Hiro Matsushita was sitting in the middle of the track 
after a relatively minor accident when he was hit broadside by Jacques 
Villeneuve's car, splitting Matsushita's car in half. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Villeneuve had hit one foot to the left, he would have hit Hiro and surely 
killed him. One foot to the right and he would hit the engine, and possibly 
killed himself. Where he hit was straight between the engine and the monocoque, 
which was split. I'm telling you that was luck. The Gods were shining on all of 
us up there." 
</P>
<P>
 It had been 12 years since a fatality occurred in Formula One before the 
double deaths at Imola. Veteran Formula One driver Gerhard Berger, a close 
friend of Senna's, seemed to echo Mansell's feelings when he told the 
Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems there is a period of luck together and a period of unluck together, 
and it seems the luck period is finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Max Mosley, president of the International Automobile Federation, said the 
Monte Carlo race on Sunday could be canceled depending on Wendlinger's 
condition.

WORLD CUP '94: 35 DAYS AND COUNTING; BORA! BORA! BORA?; MILUTINOVIC ENJOYED 
WORLD CUP SUCCESS WITH MEXICO AND COSTA RICA, BUT THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE 
HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
</P>

<P>
 It can be anywhere -- Albuquerque or Yemen. It can be in Buenos Aires or San 
Francisco. At a hotel or on a soccer field. It is always a crowd. Sometimes a 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
 They seek him. They are Serbian, Czech, Romanian. . . . They are from 
Guadalajara or San Salvador or San Jose. Some are sycophants, some are fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of their desire is Velibor Milutinovic. Bora, the coach of the U.S. 
World Cup team. Often it's a phone call, but it might also be a note pressed 
into the hand of someone else to be passed on. If he's approached in person, he 
might stop and sign an autograph. Or he might select one of five languages and 
chat briefly. He might shake a hand, kiss a child. 
</P>
<P>
 He might linger, but he won't stay. He must always move. Away from Yugoslavia 
and the memories of World War II, which left him an orphan. Away from the 
soccer clubs that he says have cheated him. Always moving to the next place, 
which is sure to be better. 
</P>
<P>
 He is always optimistic, but wary.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic was born in Bajina Basta, in Yugoslavia's Serbian republic, but 
didn't live there long. The war changed that. First his father and then his 
mother were killed fighting the Nazis, and he and his sister and four brothers 
were sent to live with an aunt in Bor, about 30 miles from the borders of 
Romania and Bulgaria. The loss was deeply felt and long held. Even now, with 
his facility for languages, Milutinovic refuses to learn or speak German. 
</P>
<P>
 His aunt was a strict disciplinarian, which made life difficult for a 
hyperkinetic youngster. School was important to his aunt, but soccer was 
important to Bora. At 15, Milutinovic had finished the schooling offered in the 
small town and with his brothers went to live in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic thought this new arrangement would be a bonanza -- he and his 
brothers would play soccer all day and forget about school. But Milos 
Milutinovic, one of Yugoslavia's greatest players, was far more strict than his 
aunt had been. The new rules: No soccer until school and schoolwork were 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer was Bora's destiny. Milos and Milorad were already spectacular 
soccer players and able to judge their younger brother's talent. As he 
improved, they acquiesced and soccer became the focus of family life. The three 
were on the Yugoslav national team at the same time, and the Milutinovic name 
became famous in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora was a midfielder with Belgrade for 10 years, four on the youth team and 
six with the first team. He played on the Yugoslav Olympic team in 1964. Two 
years later, Milutinovic had a chance to play in Switzerland. He took it. And 
he went back to his homeland only once. 
</P>
<P>
 His second life began on the road. After Switzerland, Milutinovic played in 
Monaco, France, coached in Argentina and, finally, Mexico. In Mexico City, 
Milutinovic found his heart.  
</P>
<P>
 "Serbians and Mexicans are the same," he said. "It's the same feeling and 
atmosphere. I am more Mexican than Yugoslav. I've lived in Mexico for 19 years. 
In Belgrade, I had no identification with anything. In Mexico, I like the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 His plan called for him to stay for two years. Milutinovic's first wife, a 
Yugoslav, didn't care for Mexico and left. They divorced. Milutinovic then met 
the sister of a teammate and they married. He and Mari Carmen have a daughter, 
Darinka, who is named after Milutinovic's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico became home. For the first time, Milutinovic put down roots. His 
playing career evolved into a coaching career and worldwide fame. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the United States scouring the world to find a coach for its 
national soccer team displeased many coaches in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had coaches in our own federation who thought I had sold out the coaching 
program in the United States," said Hank Steinbrecher, general secretary of the 
U.S. Soccer Federation, who conducted the job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 But American coaches had not proved their worth on the international stage. 
The United States, for instance, lost all three games in the 1990 World Cup 
finals under Bob Gansler, who had never even been to the World Cup as a 
spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 When the USSF's search began in 1991, the emphasis was not so much on 
experience -- plenty of candidates had that -- but on finding a coach who could 
squeeze the last drop of potential out of a lightly regarded team. 
Milutinovic's name came up again and again. He had coached first Mexico, then 
Costa Rica to surprising World Cup success. 
</P>
<P>
 German Coach Franz Beckenbauer told the USSF that Milutinovic was the only 
person who could do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beckenbauer said, 'In order to coach in the United States, you need a very 
special human being. Bora can do the job for you. He's the only guy you should 
hire,' " Steinbrecher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinbrecher visited Milutinovic at his home in Mexico City and on the flight 
back said to himself, "This is our man." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic sometimes comes across as scatterbrained and disorganized, but he 
showed Steinbrecher detailed records of World Cup preparations from 1986 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The other issue was Milutinovic's reputation as a carpetbagging coach who 
followed the paychecks around the world. His personal charm, some said, masked 
insincerity and clever calculation. The USSF was aware and concerned. But it 
wasn't looking for a commitment as much as results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew to respect him over the years, more than when I first met him," 
Steinbrecher said. "There's a method behind his madness. I thought he was a 
quick-fix artist and he'd just come in and coach us through the World Cup. I've 
been impressed with the way he works with the younger players. These people who 
see him only as fluff -- they are seriously mistaken. He's very cagey." 
</P>
<P>
 Evasiveness is one of Milutinovic's defense mechanisms. For example, he says 
he's 49. But the official report of the 1990 World Cup lists him as 51 at the 
time, which would make him 55 now. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite of his tactics is to never answer a direct question directly. This 
used to mean not answering in English. Now, it means using greatly improved 
English but simply not answering. 
</P>
<P>
 The personable Milutinovic is well liked by reporters, but he has proved to be 
of little use as a source for information about his team. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have all been part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bora is a very evasive guy when it comes to giving out information that he 
wants to keep close to him," said Steinbrecher, who said Milutinovic doesn't 
even tell him the players who are going to start. "Bora does the sidestep 
better than anybody. He has a unique charm when it comes to this. I don't want 
to squelch it. He's generated a hell of a lot of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 This shows itself at every stop the national team makes. Milutinovic is mobbed 
by expatriate Yugoslavs or Mexicans or other soccer-loving people. But 
Milutinovic is far less known in the United States than in other countries. He 
knows it but says he doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are with me in restaurants, the cooks know me," he says, laughing. 
"These people, and the gardeners, they know me. This is enough. You have good 
results, you are famous. You don't have good results, you are not famous. This 
is the life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are parallels between Milutinovic's tenure as coach of the U.S. World 
Cup team and his previous national coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its status as World Cup host in 1986, Mexico's national team had 
little realistic basis for high expectations. In eight previous World Cup 
finals, Mexico had compiled a record of 3-17-4 and had failed to qualify in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic was widely known by Mexico's soccer fans as the successful coach 
of the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico Pumas club in Mexico City. In six seasons 
under him, Pumas won two league titles, two CONCACAF Champions Cups and one 
Inter-Americana Cup. The competition in the World Cup finals is on a higher 
level, but insistent fans fully expected Milutinovic to transfer his success 
from one arena to another. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded by reordering the structure of Mexican soccer and wresting 
control of the national team players from the clubs that paid their salaries. A 
training camp was established and the World Cup team, for the most part, 
trained together daily for more than year. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic also planned an ambitious preparation that no nation had before 
undertaken, scheduling 62 games -- nearly 50 full internationals. Critics said 
the barnstorming exposed the team to too many games in too little time. 
Milutinovic had an idea he was right about the World Cup buildup. In the three 
years he coached the Mexican national team, Milutinovic compiled a 29-7-15 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus were the high expectations of Mexican fans justified. Milutinovic made 
shrewd use of his assistant coaches, dispatching them to scout the team's 
first-round opponents by posing as fans and ingratiating themselves with team 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also wrung out the maximum home advantage by playing all its 
first-round games in Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, a venue that, for 
opponents, offered the lethal double whammy of 120,000 Mexican fans screaming 
at altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The home team rolled through to the quarterfinals, drawing West Germany in the 
heat of Monterrey. Mexico's unraveling began late in the first half when its 
playmaker, Thomas Boy, was injured and had to leave the game. West Germany won 
on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after the disappointment had subsided did Mexico begin to evaluate its 
team's sixth-place performance and deem it creditable. Not since 1970, when 
Mexico was also the host nation, had the team advanced as far as the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the next World Cup, Milutinovic got an emergency call from Costa Rica. 
The team, along with the United States, had already qualified for the 1990 
Italian World Cup from the CONCACAF region. Scarcely two months before the 
start of the finals, Milutinovic was called in to repair a splintered team. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's first move was to dump six popular players, among them the team 
captain. He reasoned that the team would be better served with speed and 
strength than with unharnessed talent. 
</P>
<P>
 His second move also rankled fans. Because of the stifling pressure and 
distractions in Costa Rica, Milutinovic took his team to Italy five weeks 
early. That he preferred the relative tranquillity of soccer-mad Italy gives 
insight to the mania rampant in Costa Rica at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 To further loosen up his players, Milutinovic allowed, indeed encouraged, 
visits to local discos. The players soon became welcomed fixtures on the Genoa 
night scene. Thus did the smallest nation in the World Cup prepare for battle 
against soccer's giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's reputation as a master tactician was solidified during the 
tournament. He had a good goalkeeper but otherwise an average team. Improbably, 
Costa Rica beat Scotland and Sweden and lost, 1-0, to mighty Brazil, gaining 
the quarterfinals. Its CONCACAF cousin, the United States, was eliminated after 
losing all three games in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same luck that had brought down Roy in Mexico also knocked out Costa 
Rica's goalkeeper, Gabelo Conejo, and suddenly Milutinovic's team was out, 
losing to Czechoslovakia, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But again, advancement past the first round was seen as a triumph. And so it 
would be viewed for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg said Thursday that he had 
"unbridled confidence" in Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the reputation as a miracle worker because of what he did with Mexico 
and Costa Rica," Rothenberg said. "He'll have his hands full duplicating those 
accomplishments." 
</P>
<P>
 There are also these obscure statistics: Milutinovic has never coached a team 
through World Cup qualifying. The World Cup host nation has never failed to 
advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Bora likes America," said team General Manager Bill Nuttall. "I think he 
appreciates freedom. He appreciates that if we put our minds to something, we 
can get it done. He's played everywhere. He's been everywhere. He's been 
affected by wars, by all kinds of adversity. He's been affected by all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he still gives the impression of being a moving target, Milutinovic 
does seem to enjoy his life in Laguna Niguel, even if he has not completely 
adopted American ways. The miracle worker works in his own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a traditional American management perspective, Bora is difficult," 
Steinbrecher said. "He'll change his direction; he'll change his mind. He's 
like a sly fox. But Bora and I understand each other. I think the man is a 
genius. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has he panned out? If you look at the win-loss record, the answer has to be 
no. If you look at where we were three years ago -- stylistically, lack of 
competition, the credibility -- the answer has to be yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, who is under contract through December, suggests he still enjoys 
moving, but soon it might affect his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, Darinka is young, it is not so bad," he said. "I think it is good for 
her. She learns a new culture and can make new friends. At some age, after, we 
should stop for Darinka. For the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to be on the road. People call me a Gypsy. But I like it. It is a 
chance for things. To learn a new language. To learn new things. It is good. 
For me to be happy, my private life and the team have to do well. Nothing 
more." Profile: Bora Milutinovic

CHILI IS RED HOT; DAVIS LEADS ANGELS IN 9 CATEGORIES, TAKES TEAM TO FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The three major league scouts sat behind home plate, watched the ball soar 
over the right-field wall for an opposite-field home run, then stared at one 
another in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Alexander, who has been in this game for nearly 60 years and is 
acknowledged as perhaps baseball's premier scout, finally broke the silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about you fellas, but I thought this guy was washed up four 
years ago," he said. "I remembering writing on my report that he was finished. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of things happen in this game in my lifetime, but I'm not 
sure if I ever misjudged someone like I did this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Theodore Davis, the man the baseball world calls Chili, is having a 
season that no one envisioned, except possibly the man himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who hit a home run from each side of the plate Wednesday against Texas, 
for the seventh time in his career, is off to the finest start of his 13-year 
career. He is batting .357 with eight home runs and 29 RBIs. He leads the 
Angels in nine offensive categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man's got to be getting a sore back by now, from the way he's been 
carrying us," left fielder Dwight Smith said. "It's been a one-man show. We're 
just going along for the ride until he tells us to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' season has been so spectacular that teammates often imitate reporters, 
pretending to put a microphone in front of his face, and ask his secret. It's 
only for show. There's not a soul in the clubhouse who is unaware of the 
driving force that has brought Davis to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, his eyes narrowing to a squint, unsure whether he wants to reveal the 
thoughts and feelings that have been scratching to get out, finally relents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, I've got something to prove," he says flatly. "Everyone said last 
year was a fluke. Everyone said it was a career year. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all I did, it wasn't good enough. It was like I had to prove myself all 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, here I am. Let's see what happens this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who signed three players to multiyear contracts this spring, would 
not give Davis a one-year extension, even after he had hit 27 homers with 112 
RBIs last season. They might have given him a contract if he had agreed to rip 
up his $2.4-million option in 1994, but that made no sense to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothered me," Davis said. "Some guys come in and need to prove themselves 
just once, and I just thought I deserved some consideration, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 So Davis, 34, walked into spring training wondering whether he would have a 
job. The Angels had signed Bo Jackson and Smith in January to guaranteed 
contracts worth $1.7 million. They looked like a team that had three designated 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't consider it a threat, but it was certainly a challenge," Davis said. 
"I think everyone knew my back was against the wall, and I had to prove I 
wasn't done yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis opened the season with two hits and three RBIs in his first two at-bats 
and has yet to stop. He already has 46 hits this season, a figure he didn't 
reach last season until mid-June. He is batting .368 with none out and nobody 
on base, and .333 with runners in scoring position. A year ago, he batted .325 
with runners in scoring position but only .135 with none out and nobody on 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in first place because of Chili, and everyone in here knows it," 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "He's been the difference. He's the one guy in 
our lineup that pitchers fear." 
</P>
<P>
 If Davis continues his performance, the looming question will be not whether 
the Angels want to keep Davis, but whether they can afford him. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said that he has begun contract negotiations 
with agent Tom Reich in an attempt to sign Davis to an extension, but they 
still are in the preliminary stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely someone we want to keep around," Bavasi said. "I can't tell 
you how impressed I am with the guy. He's a class act." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels not only want to retain Davis because they believe he is the finest 
designated hitter in baseball, but they recognize the value of his leadership. 
This is Davis' team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of being antagonistic or disrespectful toward Bo or 
Dwight, but nobody can replace this guy," Bavasi said. "We didn't sign Bo for 
his leadership. Chili has always been the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no one else in the clubhouse who commands the respect of Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done more for me than anyone will ever know," right fielder Tim Salmon 
said. "I may have won the rookie-of-the-year award, but without him, it 
wouldn't have been possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Said rookie outfielder Jim Edmonds: "I respect him more than anybody in 
baseball. I can't say enough for what he's done for me. I mean, he was even 
throwing batting practice to us the other day. Can you imagine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who broke in with the San Francisco Giants in 1982, says he treats 
everyone with respect until he is given reason to act differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a rookie has to be treated like a second-class citizen," Davis 
said. "Being a black man, I know what it feels like to be treated like a 
second-class citizen. Everyone should be treated with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I like playing here so much. Buck Rodgers might be the only 
manager I played for that has given me the respect of being a veteran player. 
From Day 1, he gave me that respect, and I appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers: "He's earned the respect I've given him. He's a true leader who 
has handled himself with class." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels say the only ones who really don't appreciate Davis are the fans. 
He remains one of the game's best-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, I went to lunch with Bo Jackson," Davis said. "People stopped at 
our table and said, 'Hi, Mr. Jackson,' and acted like I wasn't even there. They 
didn't know who I was, or care to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to me, that's fine. I'd rather have my peers and people in the game 
respect my abilities than anyone else. To me, that's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alexander, the longtime scout: "Well, let the young man know he's 
certainly got mine. Believe me, does he ever."

MIKE DOWNEY: YOUTH SERVING DODGERS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behold the Baby Blue Dodgers, the rug rats of Chavez Ravine. At first base, 
the 1992 National League rookie of the year. Behind the plate, the 1993 NL 
rookie of the year. In right field, a strong -- and we do mean strong -- 
candidate for 1994 NL rookie of the year. Seldom have the Dodger boys of summer 
seemed so boyish. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nights for Tom Lasorda when it doesn't seem so much a dugout as a 
day-care center. His team is younger than springtime. Lasorda has socks older 
than six of his regulars. Some of them probably think Babe Ruth is a candy bar. 
They wouldn't know Duke Snider from Duke University. They think Koufax means 
two people transmitting the same document. 
</P>
<P>
 Such young guns. Some mornings, Brett Butler must chuckle and feel as though 
his sons and nephews surround him. Henry Rodriguez in left, Raul Mondesi in 
right, with Jose Offerman and Delino DeShields and Mike Piazza plugging the 
middle, man, I'm telling you, these guys must slide beside Butler or Orel 
Hershiser or Jim Gott on team bus rides to ask, "Come on, were you really born 
back in the '50s?" 
</P>
<P>
 But they can play. Young, yes, but these Baby Blue Dodgers aren't green. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Right field belongs to Raul now. Kid's only been there a month, but already it 
seems as though Darryl Strawberry was never there. Mondesi's numbers by 
midsummer will top Strawberry's over two seasons. I went to a game Wednesday 
night, Mondesi made a one-handed catch, crashed into the fence, then came to 
bat, broke up a Houston Astro pitcher's perfect game with a home run, then 
confessed after the 1-0 victory that he actually told Butler he was going to 
hit one out. 
</P>
<P>
 First pitch, bam, he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him from minor leagues," Mondesi said of his victim, one Shane 
Reynolds. "Only he is better now. He got nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 But he remembered that Reynolds had a habit of being careless with a sloppy 
slider on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say to myself, that's what I am waiting for," Mondesi said. "I say, he 
throws me a breaking pitch, I have a good chance to make a home run." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds broke one off. Mondesi made a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates marvel at the young Dominican's strength, at his arm, at his power, 
even though he is hardly built like Dave Winfield. Talk about compact. Mondesi 
isn't even six feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 The homer was Mondesi's fifth, matching the output of Strawberry for the 
entire 1993 season, ditto for 1992. The date: May 11. Anything that Mondesi 
does beyond this is a bonus. On their schedule, the Dodgers still had 128 games 
left to play. Mondesi would be up there, swinging away. An impatient hitter, he 
goes up there ripping, almost never taking a walk. Mondesi goes all out. On 
offense or defense, the kid is a fence-buster. 
</P>
<P>
 He amazes Piazza, who has amazed a few people himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing of it is, there's pretty much nothing he can't do on a baseball 
field," is the way the Dodger catcher describes Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone knows it, including Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he nervous, taking over right field this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Mondesi says. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he adjusting to major league pitching? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," he says. "I know how to hit them." 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't he feel the first month was important, to prove himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because I know if I go 0 for 4, I will still play every day. I know if I 
go one for 17, they will still say, 'There's a good hitter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Self-assurance. Ain't it wonderful? Couple of nights ago, the Dodgers needed a 
run in the bottom of the 10th inning. Houston had a right-handed pitcher and 
Lasorda had a book of percentages. He also had the lefty-swinging Rodriguez, 
seated at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Up went Henry to pinch-hit and back came Mondesi to simmer. The manager had to 
mollify Mondesi in the dugout. Had to remind him that they were all in this 
together, which became evident when the Dodgers went on to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Already at that point, Mondesi had pegged out one runner with his arm, gone 
wall-banging again to rob an Astro of extra bases and had doubled and singled 
himself. The crowd standing-O'd him, twice. Last place he wanted to be was on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fault, I get mad," Mondesi said. "I know we got to do whatever Tommy tells 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy knows, too. Yet Lasorda pokes the air with his finger for emphasis and 
says, "I admire that in a guy. He's dying to play, this guy. It hurts him to 
come out. Long as he don't make a scene, I understand perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, the thing about Mondesi is, he has the ability to be a five-point 
player. That means he can hit, he can hit with power, he can run, he can field, 
he can throw. But he's also got to pay the price. Things have always come easy 
to this kid. Down there in the Dominican, he was the man. He always took a lot 
of things for granted. That's why I'll keep hollering on him. You think this 
kid's good now, wait'll you see how good he can be if he pushes himself to the 
limit." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie of the year? 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda's arms spread wide. He said, "Hell, my whole team's rookies of the 
year."

DEL HARRIS SET TO GET LAKER JOB; PRO BASKETBALL: FORMER COACH OF MILWAUKEE AND 
HOUSTON HAS LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH JERRY WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Harris, the former coach with the Milwaukee Bucks and Houston Rockets, is 
expected to be named coach of the Lakers, it was learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers might introduce Harris as Magic Johnson's successor as soon as 
today, according to two sources, though there does not appear to be a definite 
timetable and the process could last until the weekend or into next week. No 
news conference had been called as of Thursday night, and team spokesman John 
Black declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, who failed to make the playoffs this year for only the third time 
since moving to Los Angeles in 1960, fired coach Randy Pfund with 18 games left 
in the season to let Magic Johnson coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Bill Bertka filled in for two games during the transition, then 
Johnson took over for the rest of the season. Johnson said he took the job on a 
trial basis and decided not to return as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket's "Press Box" reported that Harris had agreed to a three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker General Manager Jerry West has often spoken highly of Harris in the 
past. They are so familiar with each other that Harris said early in the search 
process that, should he become a candidate, any interview would be a formality 
because the two have been exchanging views for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about the Lakers' monthlong search, which is the way they 
prefer it. Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino is believed to have interviewed, and West 
reportedly also talked to Maryland's Gary Williams. Golden State's Don Nelson 
became the most recent rumor, but Warrior owner Jim Fitzgerald said Wednesday 
the Lakers had not been given or even asked permission to speak with his coach 
and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was a finalist a year ago for the Clipper job that eventually went to 
Bob Weiss. He has spent much of the time since as a consultant to Sacramento 
owner Jim Thomas, another West friend, and is believed to have turned down a 
chance to be the Kings' general manager because his real desire is coaching and 
not the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris announced Wednesday that he had resigned that position, "due to the 
fact that there has been immediate opportunity of interest presented to 
myself." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The stints in Milwaukee -- where he was also vice president of basketball 
operations -- and Houston resulted in a 332-341 record with seven playoff 
appearances in eight seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 The most successful run was when his 1980-81 Rockets, who finished the regular 
season with a 40-42 record, reached the NBA finals and lost to Boston in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris spent four years with each team. When he left the Bucks at the end of 
the 1991-92 season, Mike Dunleavy quit as Laker coach to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunleavy was an assistant on Harris' staff in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 West, surely with no idea what would transpire over the next few years, spoke 
highly of Harris at the press conference when Dunleavy was named coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Dunleavy) had played for two people I greatly admire from a coaching 
standpoint," West had said, "and that is Don Nelson and Del Harris." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' presence in Sacramento was said to be unsettling for Coach Garry St. 
Jean. Jerry Reynolds, Sacramento's general manager, and Harris had known each 
other since they were in high school together in southern Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Jean and Harris were assistants in Milwaukee when Nelson was the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for Del as a person and professionally," Reynolds 
said when he named Harris as a consultant in September. "He'll certainly be 
available to Jim Thomas, but I think he'll probably work more for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the job with Sacramento, which paid about $40,000 a year, Harris 
continued to live in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: AWAY FROM HIS JOB, TODD DONOHO'S LIFE IS FAR FROM 
TRIVIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles media used to treat Todd Donoho as if he were Terry Donahue 
during a losing season. 
</P>
<P>
 He was called the clown prince of sportscasting in this space, and worse 
things elsewhere. Jim Healy, who tabbed one of his favorite targets, Dan 
Dierdorf, Dan Dierdork, or simply the Dorkster, used a similar moniker for 
Donoho. 
</P>
<P>
 He was once rated the worst sportscaster in Los Angeles here, and was given 
the same distinction by Steve Harvey in TV Times and by others as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoho was blindsided by all the criticism. Until he went to Channel 7 in July 
of 1989, the press clippings had almost all been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 At FNN Score, the now-defunct sports arm of the Financial News Network, Donoho 
gained national attention for his work in general and his "Time Out for Trivia" 
show in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 During his five years at FNN Score, the rave reviews included a profile in 
Sports Illustrated, which was probably seen by more readers than could even get 
FNN Score. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his FNN stint, the Indiana native and University of Missouri graduate 
was the fair-haired boy at NBC stations in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Cincinnati, 
even doing occasional NFL play by play for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he went to Channel 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he had made a name for himself with trivia, he decided to lead off his 
sports segment with a trivia question. 
</P>
<P>
 He was barely on the job two weeks when he had to deal with a tragic story -- 
the suicide of former Angel reliever Donnie Moore. But still he followed his 
regular format and led off Channel 7's sports segment that night with a trivia 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 It was deemed in poor taste, and every sports media critic in town went after 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was unfairly criticized for that," he said the other day. "At the 
top of the hour, at the start of the newscast, we led with the Donnie Moore 
story, so by the time we got to sports, it had already been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story didn't keep The Times from printing its trivia question in Morning 
Briefing the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now don't think Donoho is a complainer. He rarely complains, and when he does, 
he does it with class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you hate to see yourself criticized in print," Donoho said. "Sure, it 
hurts. But you just go on and time heals the wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Donoho realizes criticism is usually simply opinion, and opinions vary 
greatly. In an unofficial readers' poll after Harvey's 1992 critique in TV 
Times, the anti-Donoho letters led the pack, but at the same time he came in a 
close second behind Channel 2's Jim Hill as the readers' favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the bashing, which seems to have subsided, Donoho has survived in 
a major market for nearly five years, no easy feat. 
</P>
<P>
 He has made a few subtle changes along the way -- the trivia question was 
dropped two years ago -- and viewers have grown accustomed to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is he a part of L.A's No. 1-rated television news team, he is also 
part of the popular morning radio show "Mark and Brian" on KLOS-FM. He has had 
that job for 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two gigs together give him a bigger combined television and radio audience 
than any other L.A. sportscaster, something he is proud of. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donoho might or might not be your favorite sportscaster. Sports purists, who 
make up about 30% of his audience, tend to like their sports more straight. But 
off the air, it's hard not to like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd Donoho is the consummate nice guy," said Joe Safety, the Clippers' vice 
president of public relations who was the executive producer at FNN Score when 
Donoho was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Channel 4's Fred Roggin: "I've known Todd since he was in Grand Rapids 
and I was at the NBC station in Phoenix. I not only respect his talent, but he 
is also a good friend." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people around the Santa Clarita Valley consider Donoho a good friend, 
too. He and his family, which includes sons Kevin, 11; Jeff, 9, and Scott, 6, 
moved to Valencia 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoho, 38, and his wife of 15 years, his college sweetheart, Paula, are 
involved in church and charitable activities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon for people on a fund-raising home tour to find Donoho at one 
of the homes as a greeter. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 21, Donoho, for the second year, will serve as host of a charity golf 
tournament at Valencia Country Club that benefits the Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital. Last year, the event raised more than $50,000 for the 
hospital's trauma and paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Donoho serve as host, he also spends countless hours helping 
promote the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoho's charitable activities cover more than the Santa Clarita Valley. He is 
also an honorary booster for Jordan High in South-Central L.A., and donates his 
money toward a scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticize Donoho as a sportscaster if you like. But if you criticize him as a 
human being, take a hike.

MIKE PENNER: USERS' GUIDE TO SUBCAL, THE LAND THE POSTSEASON FORGOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dark Ages, Europe. General term for the centuries of decline in Europe, circa 
500-1000 A.D., after the fall of the Roman Empire, a period during which 
ignorance and barbarism were the prevailing forces and classical culture was 
stifled.  
</P>
<P>
 Dark Ages, Southern California. General term for the years of athletic decline 
in Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Diego, circa 1993-1994 A.D., after the fall of 
the Rams, Lakers and Kings, a period in which Donald Sterling and Tom Werner 
were the prevailing forces and championship-caliber performance was stifled.  
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the bad old days, to the land the postseason forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither one of our pro hockey teams -- the Kings and the Ducks -- qualified 
for the NHL playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither one of our pro basketball teams -- the Lakers and the Clippers -- came 
close to making the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 None of our three major league baseball teams -- the Dodgers, the Angels and 
the Padres -- have a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 And only one of our three pro football teams -- the Raiders -- participated in 
the most recent Super Bowl tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one for 10, Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten major professional sports teams, one playoff participant within the last 
12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Raiders might be in Connecticut, or Florida, or Al Davis' own private 
Idaho this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Raiders lost only one more game last season, finishing 9-7 instead of 
10-6, it would have been a clean sweep, a perfect .000. Ten up. Ten down. L.A. 
now stands for Lost Again. SoCal has become SubCal. And the name of the place 
is no longer San Diego -- it's Sans Benito . . . and Sheffield . . . and 
McGriff . . . and Miller . . . and Butts. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to be held accountable? 
</P>
<P>
 A partial listing, from least hapless all the way down to the Padres -- a Top 
10 (or Bottom 10; the choice is yours) for our times and tribulations: 
</P>
<P>
 1. RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Won Super Bowl in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Usually around .500, with the odd appearance in the AFC 
championship game (1990) and the odd performance in the AFC championship game 
(Buffalo 51, Raiders 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Al Davis. He railroaded Marcus Allen out of town, then watched his 
'93 team finish one tailback short of the Super Bowl. Now trying to replace him 
with the tailback Allen kept on the bench in Kansas City, Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Best player: Tim Brown. Had one foot and four toes in Denver before Davis came 
to his senses and grudgingly re-signed him. 
</P>
<P>
 2. DODGERS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Won World Series five times in L.A., most recently in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: No playoff appearances, though they fell short by one game in 
1991. Lost a franchise record 99 games in 1992, have played exactly .500 ball 
since. In today's NL West, that means contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Darryl Strawberry. If they release him, the Dodgers are screwed. If 
they play him, the Dodgers are screwed. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Mike Piazza. Unfortunately, he's only responsible for calling the 
pitches, not throwing them. 
</P>
<P>
 3. DUCKS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Tied NHL expansion record with 33 victories in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Waiting for sophomore jinx to kick in. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: San Jose Sharks. Their 6-0 record against the Ducks decided the final 
playoff spot in the Pacific Division -- and look what the Sharks have done with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Paul Kariya. Still unsigned. He and Ducks now only a couple 
million dollars apart. 
</P>
<P>
 4. KINGS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Reached Stanley Cup finals in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: First team to go from Stanley Cup finals to missing the playoffs 
in 24 years. Welcomed Ducks to the neighborhood with open arms, then finished 
five points behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Roy Mlakar. Former team president jumped to Penguins after signing 
off on trades that sent Paul Coffey, Bob Kudelski, Corey Millen and Marty 
McSorley out of town for next to nothing. His work here, apparently, was 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Wayne Gretzky. At least until Bruce McNall sells him to stave off 
the collection agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 5. CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Reached AFC title games in 1980 and '81. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Excluding strike years, nine non-winning seasons until 11-5 finish 
in 1992. Regressed to 8-8 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Alex Spanos. Enjoyed the champagne in '92, now wants to have it on a 
beer budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Anthony Miller. Now a Denver Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 6. LAKERS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Team of the '80s. Won fifth title of decade in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Lean in the '90s. Back-to-back losing seasons and first lottery 
finish in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Magic Johnson. He played, then he quit. He coached, then he quit. 
Why? He said the players quit on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Magic Johnson. See tape of any Laker practice in April. 
</P>
<P>
 7. ANGELS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: One pitch away from 1986 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Five losing seasons out of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Whitey Herzog. So he was hamstrung by Jackie Autry's penny-strangling 
financial policies. So why didn't he resign before jettisoning Bryan Harvey and 
Jim Abbott? 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: (tie) Bryan Harvey, Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 8. RAMS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Reached Super Bowl in 1980, NFC title game in 1985 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Second in the NFL in most defeats (45) during the '90s. Only New 
England, with 50, has more. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Jim Everett. On the bright side, the Rams' losing streak against New 
Orleans should end soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Trent Dilfer. Except the Rams wouldn't draft him. So Tampa Bay 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 9. CLIPPERS 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Qualified for playoffs in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: Back to same old tricks, finishing 27-55 and 36 games out in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Donald T. Sterling. Won't sell the team, won't move the team to 
Anaheim, won't approve any trade that might actually benefit the team, won't be 
watching the team in the playoffs any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Dominique Wilkins. Now accepting all offers. Not so fast, Donald. 
</P>
<P>
 10. PADRES 
</P>
<P>
 High Water Mark: Won National League pennant in 1984. Four winning seasons out 
of five from 1988 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Then: The Swap Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Villain: Tom Werner. Is in it for the money, not the pennants, which explains 
why Fred McGriff is in Atlanta, and why Gary Sheffield and Benito Santiago are 
in Florida, and why Randy Myers is in Chicago, and why Greg Harris is in 
Colorado . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best Player: Tony Gwynn. Leading the league in hitting again, but it sure is 
lonely at the top.

TANSLEY IS A WINNER DESPITE HIS RELAXED ATTITUDE; TRACK: TITAN SENIOR IS 
FAVORED TO WIN 3,000-METER STEEPLECHASE AT BIG WEST CONFERENCE MEET, WHICH 
BEGINS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Tansley's commitment to track has been questioned by others more than 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's no surprise to Tansley. He sometimes questions it, too. When he was 
at Dana Hills High School, he would skip practice to go surfing. Now, as a 
senior at Cal State Fullerton, Tansley acknowledges that his training habits 
haven't always been what they should be. He has thought about quitting the 
sport, and he might have if he wasn't so good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley has considerable natural talent, and he will be favored to win the 
3,000-meter steeplechase in the Big West Conference meet that begins today in 
Las Cruces, N.M. His top time of 8 minutes 56.28 seconds is the best in the 
conference, and Fullerton Coach John Elders believes Tansley can become the 
school's first qualifier for the Division I NCAA Championships if he continues 
to improve. Tansley also will be a strong threat in the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for someone who could just as easily be bumming on the beach waiting 
for the next big wave. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tansley talks about the things he likes to do, running isn't high on the 
list. "I really love surfing," he said. "It's so much fun. I don't do it that 
much anymore because of school and running, but I know I'll get back to it 
sometime. And I love playing basketball and soccer and riding bikes." 
</P>
<P>
 And running? "I guess it's never been that interesting to me," Tansley said. 
"And I went through a period of time when I really didn't enjoy it. It's not 
boredom or anything like that. More than anything, it's because it's so hard on 
my body. I really hurt physically when I'm done with a hard workout. The 
workouts can be very demanding for a distance runner." 
</P>
<P>
 And the steeplechase is one of track's most grueling events. In 3,000 meters, 
runners must negotiate 28 immovable hurdles, and seven water jumps that are 
preceded by solid barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley says his distance-running teammate, Steve Frisone, his parents and 
twin brother, Andrew, along with Elders, are mainly the ones who have helped 
keep him motivated. Andrew also ran for Fullerton before he was injured this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents would always encourage me to keep going," Tansley said. "They've 
supported me since my high school days, because they felt it was something I 
could be successful at. I got into it mainly to train for soccer when I was in 
high school, and I turned out to be pretty good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frisone has gone from bitter rival to best friend. "Steve's been an 
inspiration to me," Tansley said. "If I had Steve's attitude and work ethic, I 
probably could be better than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 They raced against each other frequently in high school, Tansley running for 
Dana Hills and Frisone for Laguna Hills. "We must have raced 15 or 16 times 
when we were in high school, and he probably won half the time, and I won half 
the time," Frisone said. "It was tough competition, and we barely would talk to 
one another at that time. Our senior year, we ran in the State cross-country 
meet against one another. He finished fifth, and I was sixth. I knew then what 
a talent he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley went to Long Beach College for one year after high school, then 
transferred to Fullerton. Tansley established himself as one of the Big West's 
top runners as a sophomore, winning the steeplechase in the conference meet. 
Frisone also made his mark, winning the Big West 5,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tansley's chance to win the Big West steeplechase three consecutive times 
ended last year at UC Irvine, when his right knee slammed into a barrier on the 
fourth lap of the 7 1/2-lap race. Tansley fell to the infield, gasping in pain 
with a deep knee bruise. But he got up and finished, virtually crawling over 
the remaining barriers. He was last among 10 runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt I could have won it last year if I hadn't been hurt," Tansley 
said. "I was running in second, maybe five meters behind, but I was pacing 
myself, and I felt I was going to win. I really don't know what happened. I may 
have gotten lazy or lost focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Up until about a month ago, Tansley's performance this season had not been up 
to expectations. Those questions about his desire and commitment were raised 
again after he performed below par in the prestigious Mt. San Antonio College 
Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reality slapped me in the face after that meet," Tansley said. "Steve had a 
great time . . . and I didn't do well. I didn't realize how out of shape I 
really was until then." 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley told Frisone that he was concerned that he had "let the season pass 
him by." But he decided there still was time to change that. He began working 
out with Frisone two mornings each week, running an extra four miles each day 
in addition to his regular afternoon workouts. His enthusiasm for training also 
moved up a notch. When he ran his best time of the season, winning the 
steeplechase at the California-Nevada championships two weeks ago at UCLA, it 
was clear to Elders that Tansley had made up ground in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still fairly rested now, and not as fatigued as some runners might be, 
so all this might work in his favor," Elders said. "I think the Mt. SAC meet 
snapped him out of his slump. That was kind of a relapse, but I'm extremely 
proud of the way he's improved and grown in his time here. His main goal has 
been to make it to the NCAA championships, and I think he'll make it. He's 
knocking on the door now." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders thinks Tansley will need to run faster to make the NCAA steeplechase 
field. The automatic sea-level qualifying mark is 8:44, more than 12 seconds 
below Tansley's best, but because of the high altitude at Las Cruces, the 
standard will be raised to 8:52.4 for runners competing in the Big West meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley also could qualify as one of the season's fastest 18 runners, if he 
doesn't meet the automatic qualifying standard. He already has met the 
provisional standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not so concerned about his time this weekend as much as him winning," 
Elders said of the Big West meet. "We're planning to go to an event in Portland 
the following weekend, where the competition will be great and the weather 
conditions should be perfect. That will be the opportunity for him to get his 
best time." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Tansley says he's been enjoying track a lot more lately. "It's 
nice to win," he said. "Winning is the thing I like most about running."

FENCES BEING BUILT AT THREE CUP SITES; SOCCER: RFK, COTTON BOWL AND STANFORD 
GOING AGAINST ORGANIZING COMMITTEE'S WISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerns about security problems during the World Cup have prompted three 
venues to defy the wishes of the World Cup Organizing Committee and soccer's 
international governing body and erect fencing between stadium seating areas 
and the playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call Thursday, World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg again 
emphasized that chain-link fences to keep fans off the playing fields would not 
be necessary during the World Cup finals, which begin June 17. In fact, he 
said, fences ringing a field could lead to injuries from fans being crushed 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, local police at three of the nine World Cup venues have 
overruled Rothenberg and FIFA, soccer's international authority, and have begun 
installing fences at RFK Stadium in Washington, the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and 
Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of crowd-control problems in Europe and elsewhere, fences commonly 
have been used in soccer to keep fans from rushing the field. But the recent 
trend has been to remove the fences. Tragedies such as the Heysel Stadium 
disaster in Brussels in 1985 drew attention to the potential for danger. In 
that game, 38 fans suffocated or were crushed to death when a fence separating 
rival fan groups collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA has taken a strong stand against fences. Joseph Blatter, the general 
secretary of FIFA, has said, "Animals in a zoo belong behind fences, not 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 This World Cup offers a unique logistics problem: Seating areas in American 
stadiums tend to be closer to the playing fields, thus not allowing a buffer 
zone between fans and players. In addition, soccer fields are longer and wider 
than football fields. In many of the stadiums that will be used in this year's 
tournament, the playing area extends to the edge of the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials had considered fencing or plexiglass barriers but rejected 
that idea. In some venues, such as the Rose Bowl, the same effect will be 
achieved by cutting back seats, mainly for sight-line considerations. At the 
Rose Bowl, the first 10 rows of seats in the end zones and the first six on the 
sidelines will not be sold. Those seats will be draped with tarps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the correct plan is to remove fences," Rothenberg said. "Our 
concern in the United States is not people rushing the playing field to do harm 
to the players or officials. Our concern is an exuberant fan rushing down to 
celebrate. Our concern is that in the mad rush to get down there, people will 
get crushed against a fence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other World Cup news, the World Cup Organizing Committee has agreed on a 
policy regarding the sale of alcohol during games. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue had come to the fore when Rothenberg sent a letter last month to the 
mayors of the nine venue cities, asking for alcohol bans on game days. During 
the 1990 World Cup in Italy, some cities instituted alcohol bans on game days 
to prevent security problems caused by drunken fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, which were completed Monday but have yet to be announced, 
recognize that the final decisions regarding alcohol sales can be made only by 
stadium management and local authorities.

EASY GOER DIES SUDDENLY AT AGE 8; HORSE RACING: COLT, BEST REMEMBERED FOR 
RIVALRY WITH SUNDAY SILENCE, WON BELMONT STAKES IN 1989.

<P>
 His groom beckoned, and Easy Goer came running with the stride and grace that 
made him a champion. Then he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old champion of 1988, remembered for an intense rivalry with Sunday 
Silence, died Thursday in Paris, Ky. He was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "His groom was showing some people around on a tour," Shug McGaughey, who 
trained Easy Goer for Ogden Phipps in 1988-89, said from his home in Garden 
City, N.Y. "He whistled for him and he came running down. He put a shank on him 
and let him out of the paddock. Then he went down on his knees, and it was all 
over. He was dead in 10 seconds. I'm 99% sure it was a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're terribly disappointed. He meant a lot to me. He gave us the opportunity 
to win a lot of races I'd never won before. I got my first classic victory with 
him in the Belmont." 
</P>
<P>
 In that 1989 race, Easy Goer denied Sunday Silence the Triple Crown after 
having finished second to him in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Gus Koch, assistant farm manager at Claiborne Farm, said an autopsy will be 
performed at the diagnostic laboratory at the University of Kentucky but that 
results might not be known for a week. Easy Goer will be buried at Claiborne, 
where he stood at stud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a few of his first crop of 2-year-olds here that we like," 
McGaughey said. "It looks like maybe he got off to a good start at stud and now 
this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy Goer, a son of Alydar, won 14 of 20 starts, with five seconds and one 
third, and retired in 1990 with earnings of $4,873,770. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Easy Goer won his first three starts and was the Kentucky Derby 
favorite, but he finished 2 1/2 lengths behind Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the defeat, the colt, bred and owned by Phipps, was again favored in 
the Preakness. Again he finished second to Sunday Silence, this time by a 
half-length after a stirring stretch duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy Goer beat Sunday Silence by eight lengths in the Belmont Stakes.

DESAUSSURE APPEARS BACK ON TRACK BUT MAY GET OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure of Taft High is the top returning 400-meter sprinter in the 
state and based on his performances in Thursday's Northwest Valley Conference 
track and field finals at Birmingham High, he appears to be rounding into shape 
in an injury-plagued senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't bet on him running in the state championships at Cerritos College 
next month, as the City Section finals May 26 could be his last meet of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers in each event in the City meet qualify for the state 
championships, but DeSaussure said he "probably won't run in the state meet" in 
order to prepare for a high school all-star football game in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I would go on (to the state meet) is if I run really fast in 
City," said DeSaussure, who won the 400 in 48.4 seconds and ran a 48.3 anchor 
leg on Taft's victorious 1,600 relay that clocked a season best of 3 minutes 
25.9 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track is just not what I'm thinking about right now. Football is the No. 1 
sport with me. Track is second." 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing participation in an all-star game over running in the state 
championships might seem ludicrous for someone who finished second in the 400 
in last year's state championships and is regarded as a project as a collegiate 
wide receiver, but the Washington-bound DeSaussure is leaning that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his waning passion for track, DeSaussure ran an impressive, controlled 
race in the 400 to turn back teammate Moses Backus (50.2) and Cleveland's Eric 
Brown (50.8), and he surged past Tehran Price of San Fernando with 150 meters 
left in the 1,600 relay to give Taft the victory in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to run relaxed in the 400," DeSaussure said. "I didn't think I 
was running that fast." 
</P>
<P>
 There were several other quality performances during the meet in which the top 
five finishers in each event qualified for next week's City preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Haag of Granada Hills turned back Paul Kokorowski of El Camino Real in 
the 110 high hurdles, 14.5 to 14.6, won the 300 intermediates in 39.5 and 
finished second in the long jump (21 feet 1/2 inch) behind Kennedy's Donte 
Scarborough (21-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough also won the 100 in 11.0, finished third in the 200 in 22.6 and 
anchored the Golden Cougars to victory in the 400 relay (43.5). 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy teammate Sammie Wilson was the upset winner in a highly competitive 
200. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Scarborough ran the turn well and entered the straightaway with a 
three-meter lead on Backus, but the Taft junior passed Scarborough with 40 
meters left and fell just short of Wilson as both were clocked in 22.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the field events, Kokorowski cleared 15-0 in the pole vault, Wayne Simpson 
of San Fernando won the high jump with a personal best of 6-5 and El Camino 
Real's Brian Tade took the shotput at 54-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Collins and Neisha Henderson of Cleveland produced the top individual 
marks in the girls' meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins timed 46.9 -- two seconds better than her previous best -- in the 300 
low hurdles and Henderson bounded a personal best of 35-8 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Double victories went to Tanika McThomas of El Camino Real in the 100 (12.6) 
and 200 (26.3), and to Kristin Kabo of Kennedy in the 1,600 (5:26.0) and 3,200 
(11:47.7).

FOR CONTRERAS, NORTHRIDGE MATES, THE DAYS APPEAR NUMBERED; COLLEGE BASEBALL: 
MATADORS, WITH A PITCHING STAFF DECIMATED BY INJURIES, FACE THREE GAMES AGAINST 
THE HOTTEST TEAM IN THE WAC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Marco Contreras looks like a walking memorial. He's wearing everything but an 
armband, or maybe a black veil. 
</P>
<P>
 Give him time. There are still three games left. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, Cal State Northridge's pitching ace, wears the uniform pants of 
reliever Jason Van Heerde, who is out for the season because of an arm injury. 
Contreras has scribbled the uniform numbers of starting pitchers Keven Kempton 
and John Najar on his spikes. Both are sidelined because of arm injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Contreras scrawled another number on his shoes when shortstop 
Chad Thornhill suffered a broken right elbow.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a farewell to arms. Not to mention a leg -- that of power-hitting 
first baseman Andy Shaw, who had knee surgery before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started when Shaw went down," Contreras said. "Almost everybody's gone 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Down, but not out. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an overall record below the break-even mark, despite enough injuries 
to make M*A*S*H's Hawkeye Pierce gag into his surgical mask, despite enough 
off-the-field distractions to cause third-vertebrae whiplash, the Matadors 
still have a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last rites were administered on a couple of occasions, yet illogical as it 
seems, Northridge still has a shot at postseason play before the final weekend 
of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with baseball," Coach Bill Kernen said. "It's weird stuff. 
Sometimes the game takes over. So you play it and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Northridge, what hasn't happened? But when a three-game 
series opens at Fresno State's Beiden Field tonight at 7, the Matadors (25-27 
overall) will be squarely in the running for the Western Athletic Conference 
West Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge and Fresno State (33-23) are tied in West Division play at 12-9, 
one game behind San Diego State, which plays host to Cal State Sacramento in a 
three-game series this weekend. Northridge needs a monumental assist from 
slumping Sacramento (26-26, 9-12), and three victories from the beleaguered 
Matador pitching staff wouldn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Matadors somehow finish in a first-place tie with the Aztecs, they 
would win the division crown based on the conference tiebreaker system. 
Northridge and San Diego State (31-22) split their six games of head-to-head 
play -- the first WAC tiebreaker. The second tiebreaker is the teams' records 
against the next-best team in the standings, which under this scenario would be 
Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State split six games with Fresno State. Because Northridge took two 
of three from the Bulldogs in late March and would have to win the weekend 
series to force a tie with the Aztecs, the Matadors would get the nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating Fresno State at Beiden Field might not seem realistic -- the Bulldogs 
are 21-11 at home in 1994 and hold a 40-22 series edge over the Matadors. Then 
again, a fourth consecutive postseason appearance seemed incomprehensible two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd never expect that, no way," Kernen said. "We're just lucky. Nobody in 
the league has taken charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, lucky?  
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State, ranked 29th by Collegiate Baseball, has won 12 of its last 13 
games. The Bulldogs spanked fourth-ranked Cal State Fullerton, 12-6, Tuesday. 
Fullerton bombed Northridge, 13-1, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we would have to be playing the only hot team in their place," 
Kernen said. "Maybe we're not so lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when they weren't so happy, either. At midseason, Kernen was 
so sickened by his team's less-than-killer instinct that he benched several 
starters over a two-week stretch. Kernen publicly blasted several players for 
missing class and study hall and for being late to games and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 30, Kernen refused to allow the players to to wear their uniform tops 
in a game against Cal Lutheran. Kernen called the team "dead," and players flew 
the stadium flag at half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was funereal. Frustration boiled over when two players scuffled 
briefly during a postgame meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still some fight left in the team. The Matadors will send 
right-handers Brian Vasey (1-2, 5.77 earned-run average), Aaron D'Aoust (7-3, 
7.75) and Contreras (7-6, 4.81) to the mound in the series. Only Contreras 
opened the season as a front-line starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 A front-line battle is precisely what the season has become. The casualties 
mounted with every passing week, and now the margin of error is almost 
nonexistent. There are only six sound pitchers on the staff who have logged 
more than 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like when we have our backs against the wall, we do better," 
Contreras said. "It'll never be more against the wall than right now."

FRESNO STATE REGARDS CSUN'S IVIE AS POISONOUS; ENTERING DOUBLEHEADER, BULLDOGS 
ITCHING FOR REVENGE AFTER LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Her teammates call her Bam-Bam. Her opponents know her as one of the Bad Girls 
of the Cal State Northridge softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Ivie doesn't really care what she's called -- just as long as she isn't 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie became the focal point of scrutiny when Northridge and Fresno State faced 
off in a best-of-three series in the NCAA regional championships last season. 
Ivie hit a two-run home run in the third game that stood up for a 2-0 victory 
and gave the Matadors their first berth in the Division I College World Series 
at Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 While her home run blast was memorable, it was her trot around the bases that 
embittered the Bulldogs and their several hundred fans who attended the series 
at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 After swatting an outside curveball over the right-center-field fence in the 
first inning, Ivie circled the bases jumping, thrusting her fists into the air 
and pointing randomly in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors poured out of the dugout and held a celebration party at home 
plate replete with hugs, high-fives and hand-slaps. But it didn't end there. 
After the rest of the team returned to the dugout, Beth Calcante, who scored on 
Ivie's homer, corralled the slugger for one more bow. Both dropped to a knee 
near the foul line, pointed at the Bulldogs and shouted in celebration once 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gary Torgeson was warned by the umpires against taunting, a notice he 
thought was unjustified. So did Ivie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was ridiculous," she said. "(We got a warning) because I was 
excited that I hit a home run. If everybody took it as I meant it, then it 
would have been no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Today at 1:30 p.m., the Bulldogs return to Northridge for a key Western 
Athletic Conference doubleheader and emotions are sure to run high. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (42-7, 17-3 in WAC play), ranked third in the country, trails 
Fresno State (43-12, 19-3) by one game. The sixth-ranked Bulldogs share first 
place with ninth-ranked Utah (41-9, 19-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Matadors finish WAC play with doubleheaders against Fresno State 
and Sacramento State this weekend, the focus is on the Bulldogs.  
</P>
<P>
 And because of the bad blood between the teams and that both are virtually 
assured a playoff berth, beating each other is everything -- and the conference 
title can take a back seat. "I think to (our players), beating Fresno twice 
would be more than any trophy they could win," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Matadors played in Fresno six weeks ago and earned a split, the 
doubleheader was shown on cable television in the Central Valley. Earlier this 
week, Ivie and her teammates saw a tape of the telecast in which the 
commentators harped on Northridge's bad-girl image, according to Torgeson. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcers also reported that Ivie had simulated firing six-shooters with 
both hands after the infamous homer last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, OK. Yeah, that's what I did," Ivie said sarcastically. "It's like rumors. 
It's like they don't even know what I did. It's like they said, 'OK, let's just 
make up that it was guns that they were shooting.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they really hate us up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Ivie's energetic home run trot simply played into the bad-girl image, 
a reputation that has followed Northridge in recent seasons. Truth be told, the 
Matadors' quick climb in the Division I ranks has everything to do with 
intimidation and aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to say that that was kind of the mentality I wanted to set last year 
and it worked," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge moved up from the Division II ranks in the 1990-91 season. 
Torgeson's first Division I recruiting class included first baseman Ivie, left 
fielder Calcante and center fielder Jen Fleming -- all of whom helped bring 
Northridge to national prominence with their gritty, aggressive style of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the three of them, I don't think we would be where we are today," 
Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie balks at the bad-girl image because she feels her aggressiveness is 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some girls on the team that shouldn't cuss when they cuss," Ivie 
said. "But there is sometimes when you have to be aggressive on the field. Men 
can be that way, but women can't. We've come too far to have people thinking 
that way. Why can't women be as aggressive as men?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie applies her feminist philosophy in other areas of her life. Last fall, 
she had a color tattoo -- a two-inch likeness of the cartoon character Bam-Bam 
-- drawn on her right shoulder blade. But she wasn't exactly a pioneer in that 
department. Teammates Fleming and Kelly Hunt also have tattoos in the same 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that something?" Torgeson said. "It's a trendy thing. Men do it. I 
guess the girls feel they can do it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie, who routinely plays about 30 feet from the batter, is a tower of 
intimidation at 5-foot-11. And her statistics alone speak volumes. Ivie leads 
the team with 60 hits, 40 runs, five triples and 16 walks. Her .423 batting 
average and 37 runs batted in rank second. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Opponents think I'm mean) just because I creep up in their face and I 
supposedly give looks that I don't know I'm giving," she said. "I'm not mean. 
I'm just an aggressive player. I don't mean to be mean, it's just my adrenaline 
pumping."

FINAL VOLLEYBALL TESTS AWAIT VAN NUYS AND GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's City Section volleyball championships have a decidedly local 
flavor. Call it Valleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 The two matches will be played tonight at Cal State Northridge, and each will 
feature an area team. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys will take on Marshall at 5:30 p.m. in the 3-A Division championship, 
and Granada Hills will play University in the 4-A final at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills (15-1) has made it a habit of beating traditional coastal 
powers, taking out Venice and defending champion Palisades in its last two 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful outside hitter Mike DiSimone, a 6-foot-5 senior headed to San Diego 
State, is Granada Hills' top player but by no means its only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest Yun, Mark Muir and Dan Elbert have been consistent contributors, and 
setter Victor Chang has done an excellent job in his first season as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Granada Hills Coach Tom Harp said beating University (13-0) could be his 
team's toughest task. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play our best match (against Palisades in the semifinal), but we 
still won," Harp said. "But that's not going to do it (tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp said his team's ability to serve well and keep University off balance 
will be the key if the Highlanders are to win their first 4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills won 3-A championships in 1986 and 1987 but lost the 4-A title 
match in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys was the 3-A runner-up in 1991, and the Wolves will be going for their 
first City volleyball title against Marshall (16-0). 
</P>
<P>
 All four of Van Nuys' hitters -- Hubert Kim, Bryan Oey, Shane Karimoto and 
Pilmin Park -- are less than six feet tall. But their solid play and the 
setting of Michael Suh and Ricardo Hernandez has been responsible for a 15-1 
record.

SCYPHERS WILL NOT SEEK TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian O'Neill, the attorney representing suspended Simi Valley High baseball 
Coach Mike Scyphers, said Thursday he does not plan to seek a temporary 
restraining order to reinstate the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill said he feared that a legal fight by Scyphers might hurt his chances 
for reinstatement through school district channels. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge in Ventura County Superior Court denied a restraining order Wednesday 
that was requested on Scyphers' behalf by a group of baseball parents, saying 
Scyphers himself should be a plaintiff in the case. 
</P>

LAZARD DEATH STUNS STREET, MAY HURT FIRM; SECURITIES: HIS WAS A RARE MINORITY 
SUCCESS IN FINANCIAL WORLD. SOME FEAR CONFIDENCE IN THE COMPANY WILL SUFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One of the few minority-owned firms to crack the precincts of Wall Street was 
reeling Thursday following the death of its founder and chairman, Wardell 
Lazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazard, chairman of the investment bank W.R. Lazard & Co., was found dead 
Wednesday afternoon in a Pittsburgh hotel room, his naked body face-down on the 
bed, Pittsburgh police Sgt. Mark Ninehouser said. At his side was a tray 
containing a "white, powdery substance," and an empty vodka bottle was at the 
foot of the bed, Ninehouser said. Lazard was 44. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was performed Thursday morning, but the cause of death will not be 
officially known until toxicology tests are completed. There was "no sign of 
trauma, no sign of heart disease or anything else that would cause death," the 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing to indicate it was suicide or homicide. We are tending to 
believe it was an accidental overdose," Ninehouser added. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the firm, Roy Bumstead, characterized the reaction there as 
"complete and total shock and surprise."  
</P>
<P>
 Few of his friends or associates apparently suspected that Lazard might have a 
drug or alcohol problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people in this business who are associated with that, and he was 
not one of them," said an executive at a competing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Wardell's death stunned the small community of African American financiers and 
could threaten W.R. Lazard, which specializes in municipal bond underwriting 
and pension fund management. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a visionary in our industry -- he did more with limited resources than 
anyone in Wall Street history," said Napoleon Brandford III, vice chairman of 
Grigsby & Brandford, a prominent minority-owned investment bank based in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "His ability to get major Wall Street firms to invest (in his business) became 
a model for others after him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazard launched the firm in 1985 with a $250,000 loan from Salomon Bros., and 
he quickly profited by underwriting bonds for cities. Many big cities had taken 
steps to increase the participation of minority-owned firms in city finance, 
and Wardell counted politicians ranging from former Washington Mayor Marion 
Barry to former New York City Mayor David Dinkins among his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly sought to turn the company into the nation's first full-service, 
minority-owned investment bank. But a string of acquisitions -- financed in 
part with loans from now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert -- proved to be too 
much too soon, and the firm was near bankruptcy in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company recovered, in part by renegotiating the Drexel loans. It 
ranked as the largest minority-owned underwriter in the country in the first 
quarter of this year. Its money-management unit has $2.7 billion under 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, W.R. Lazard moved quickly to control the damage, naming Melvin 
Eubanks, vice chairman of one of the firm's key subsidiaries, acting chairman 
and chief executive. The company also outlined a strategy to refocus its 
businesses on a few core markets, a plan that was in place before Lazard's 
death, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandford and several other Wall Street sources who asked not to be identified 
said they believe the firm will survive. In addition to Eubanks, two other 
senior executives, Kenneth Glover and Thomas Mead, are highly regarded in the 
underwriting world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lazard was clearly the visionary and chief salesman of the company, and 
the circumstances of his death could shake confidence in the firm -- an 
all-important commodity in the fickle world of money management. 
</P>
<P>
 If it turns out that Lazard's death was indeed drug-related, it would put 
pressure on the firm to show that it is a reputable enterprise, said one Wall 
Street executive who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 W.R. Lazard still has some financial troubles stemming from the Drexel loans, 
and it is facing an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office over whether it 
received contracts from a New York state agency in exchange for political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said Lazard himself was not a 
target of the probe.

ARCO SAVINGS PLAN'S MONEY FUND LOSES 5.3% OF ITS PRINCIPAL; SECURITIES: THE 
COMPANY MAY REIMBURSE EMPLOYEES WHO INVESTED IN WHAT WAS CONSIDERED A LOW-RISK 
PRODUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A normally low-risk money market fund managed by oil company Atlantic 
Richfield Co. for its employee savings plan lost $22 million in April, or 5.3% 
of its principal -- a surprise beating that experts said probably points to 
soured investments in so-called derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Arco declined to say why the fund dropped in value. Arco 
advised employees of the loss in a letter and said it is "looking into ways of 
reducing the effect on individual account balances." That may include some form 
of reimbursement by Arco, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco's immediate attempt to appease employees may stem from the shock some 
workers expressed upon learning of the loss in the fund, which many apparently 
felt was as safe as a bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The $400-million fund, called Money Market Plus, is managed by Arco Investment 
Management Co., the oil giant's investing arm. Employees could use the fund for 
both tax-deferred retirement savings and regular savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco said the fund took a $22-million write-off at the end of April -- the 
equivalent of 5.3% of its assets -- to reflect losses on certain securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, money market funds are used by investors who want to avoid any loss 
of principal and who may for that reason shun riskier, more volatile 
investments such as stock or bond funds. The typical money market fund yields 
about 3.2% currently, and the funds' share prices -- or principal -- stay 
constant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arco fund's stated investment objective was "stability of principal" but 
with a yield higher than what the average money fund paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Greenstein, an Arco spokesman, said the company would not comment on how 
the fund lost money or on the nature of the fund's investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment experts speculated that the fund had invested too heavily in 
longer-term bonds, or hybrid derivative securities linked to bonds, in an 
effort to boost its yield. As market interest rates have surged this year, 
long-term fixed-rate securities have plunged in value. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, mortgage-backed securities and more esoteric mortgage 
derivatives have proved dangerous for fund managers this year, because the 
securities have failed to perform as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond experts said the name used by Arco for its fund -- Money Market Plus 
-- suggests that the fund may have invested in adjustable-rate mortgage 
securities or other hybrid mortgage securities considered shorter-term and thus 
less risky in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, adjustable-rate mortgage bonds shouldn't lose much value when 
market rates rise, because rates on the home loans underlying the loans will 
rise as well. But this year, the meteoric rise in market interest rates has 
devalued even adjustable-rate securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, recent losses sustained by other investment funds and by 
corporations speculating or hedging in such derivative securities have roiled 
the bond market, artificially depressing prices of the securities. For example, 
Procter & Gamble last month revealed that it lost $102 million on a derivative 
securities bet that soured. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to employees, Arco said the Money Market Plus fund's return 
between 1989 and 1993 "was well ahead of the universe of traditional money 
market funds," thanks to the firm's investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arco also conceded that the success of the fund may have lulled employees 
into believing there was no risk involved. "We recognize that some participants 
may not have expected a decline in the value of this fund," Arco said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the company said, it is considering a "supplementation by 
Arco of affected accounts," apparently meaning it may make the investors whole. 
But the firm said "this approach may require government approval, which will 
take some time to obtain." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Arco said the fund has "changed its strategy" and now will 
invest like a traditional money market fund.

U.S. ARRESTS HEAD OF FAILED MORTGAGE FIRM; INVESTMENTS: MAIL FRAUD, MONEY 
LAUNDERING CITED IN ALLEGED SCHEME BY PIONEER CHIEF GARY NAIMAN. MORE CHARGES 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Naiman, head of a mortgage investment firm that lost more than $200 
million and cost hundreds of elderly investors their life savings, was arrested 
Thursday on mail fraud and money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman specifically is accused of involvement in a scheme to defraud a retired 
couple of $500,000, but Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Brady said the charges in 
the indictment are a "small piece of a much larger pie. . . . Further 
indictments are expected." He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman's arrest caps a three-year investigation by the FBI and the Internal 
Revenue Service. He was charged with 18 counts of mail fraud counts, each 
carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and 16 counts of money 
laundering, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman was released from jail late Thursday afternoon after posting $400,000 
bond and promising to bring back an undisclosed amount of money from Israel, 
where he maintained bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 By tapping strong investor interest in San Diego's hot real estate market in 
the 1980s, Naiman's Pioneer Mortgage in suburban La Mesa collected some $230 
million, most of it from members of San Diego's Jewish community, before the 
company went bankrupt in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors were attracted by promises of annual returns of 12% or more on 
their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 To earn the money to pay the interest promised to investors, Naiman made risky 
loans to developers and other borrowers who typically had been turned down by 
banks and other conventional lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 When San Diego's real estate market began to cool down in the late 1980s, many 
of Pioneer's loans went sour. When the dust settled after Pioneer's bankruptcy 
filing, at least $200 million of investor funds had been lost, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors had been attracted to the apparent dependability and stability of 
Pioneer, which was founded in 1946 by Naiman's uncle, Morrie Naiman. Until 
shortly before the company went bankrupt, Pioneer paid investors "like 
clockwork," one investor said. But many of Pioneer's 2,500 investors ended up 
being wiped out financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman, 56, claimed in the early stages of the bankruptcy that Pioneer's 
problems were due to sharply declining real estate values and tax law changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indictment charges him with illegally using new investment funds to 
pay off debts to previous investors -- the classic description of the scam 
known as a Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment said Naiman "fraudulently transferred" the unnamed couple's 
funds from a "relatively safe" account to a partnership controlled by Naiman, 
which he used to pay off previous debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman also "lied to the victims as to the status of their loan," according to 
a statement from the U.S. attorney's office here. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment also charges Naiman with assigning new investors the same real 
estate collateral he had pledged to earlier backers. Naiman also allegedly 
laundered money through "various businesses and accounts . . . to continue his 
fraud and conceal from the victims that their money was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Naiman, who was heavily involved in Jewish charities as well as religious and 
social activities, was unavailable for comment Thursday.

TIME WARNER ADVISER SETTLES SEC CHARGES; MEDIA: ODED ABOODI AGREES TO $931,000 
PENALTY IN INSIDER TRADING CASE. HE WAS AN ARCHITECT OF THE FIRM'S 1990 MERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oded Aboodi, the leading financial adviser to Time Warner Inc. and a key 
architect of its 1990 merger, Thursday settled civil insider trading charges 
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to pay $931,000 in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 In its complaint, the SEC alleged that two of Aboodi's family partnerships 
sold Time Warner common stock when Aboodi knew that Time Warner management had 
approved a controversial stock rights plan in May, 1991. When the plan was made 
public June 6, the price of Time Warner shares lost 10% of their value, 
declining $11.25 that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner spokesman Edward Adler declined to say whether Aboodi or his 
Alpine Capital Group will continue advising the company. The spokesman also 
declined to confirm published reports that a committee of directors has been 
formed to review Aboodi's role. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be prudent to put an outside committee on this," said Eric W. Orts, 
assistant professor of legal studies at the University of Pennsylvania's 
Wharton School of Business. "If they think there really was insider trading 
going on . . . I think directors take this seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the death of Time Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross in 1992, the board has 
shed some longtime Ross associates and attracted high-profile directors such as 
former Xerox Chairman David T. Kearns, former U.S. Trade Representative Carla 
A. Hills and former baseball commissioner Francis T. Vincent Jr., who once 
worked at the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Two sources said that a committee of directors has been formed. The panel 
reportedly includes Vincent as well as former Jewel Cos. Chairman Donald S. 
Perkins and Richard D. Parsons, chairman of Dime Savings Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboodi, 52, did not return a reporter's call Thursday. His attorney, Dennis 
Block, declined to comment on Aboodi's future role at Time Warner. In settling 
the charges, Aboodi neither admitted nor denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboodi was Ross' closest financial adviser from the mid-1980s until Ross died, 
and he developed a similar rapport with Ross' successor, veteran Time executive 
Gerald M. Levin. Aboodi and Levin were key negotiators of the 1989 plan to 
merge Time and Warner Communications Inc., a plan that was completed the 
following year, after Paramount Communications Inc.'s unsuccessful bid to break 
up the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 To ward off Paramount, Time took on billions of dollars of debt to acquire 
Warner, and Aboodi has been a key negotiator as the company sought ways to 
reduce its debt. Aboodi helped execute Ross' plan to find strategic partners, 
culminating in the sale of minority stakes in its entertainment business to 
ITOCHU Corp., Toshiba Corp. and U.S. West. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aboodi has also been involved in negotiating sensitive contracts with key 
executives, one source said, such as Warner Bros. co-Chairman Terry Semel's in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aboodi maintains an office in the Time Warner building, he is not an 
officer and his fees in recent years have not been disclosed -- even from the 
1991 rights offering that set the stage for the insider trading charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not required to disclose that and did not," the company spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent biography of Ross, author Connie Bruck said Aboodi's son, David, 
was under investigation for trading in Time Warner stock. But David Aboodi -- 
an executive at family-affiliated Berkshire Bank in New York -- was not named 
in the SEC complaint filed in federal court Thursday, and Block, the attorney, 
said he does not expect further action against any family member.

'A DIFFERENT MOUSETRAP'; ORCHARD TO OPEN STORES AMID FIERCE COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the presence of home improvement rivals such as Home Depot and 
HomeBase -- and a competitive field fierce enough to force Builders Emporium 
out of business -- San Jose-based Orchard Supply Hardware is opening a string 
of stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard, which operates 45 stores in other parts of the state, will open three 
stores Saturday in South Pasadena, Hollywood and West Los Angeles. It opened 
three others late last month in Pasadena, Van Nuys and Burbank. The company 
plans to open an additional five to 10 stores -- most of them in the Los 
Angeles area -- next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard's executives believe that the Southland's do-it-yourself market -- the 
nation's largest -- is big enough for their outlets because, while the 
warehouse stores promote low prices, Orchard emphasizes service. And while Home 
Depot and HomeBase offer lumber and other construction materials, Orchard 
carries a broader variety of "fix-it" items, housewares and garden goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a shakeout in this industry," Orchard President Maynard Jenkins 
said. "People who operate traditional hardware stores are losing sales to 
warehouse stores. But we're flourishing because we're a different mousetrap." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts agree that Orchard has a separate appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to build a deck, you would want to go to a Home Depot," said Bo 
Cheadle, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "If you just 
need to repair a leaky faucet, you would want to go to Orchard, because with 
the higher level of service, you get in and out quickly and save time." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the three Orchard stores that opened April 30, which did not charge 
sales tax during the first two days of business, have drawn large numbers of 
Southlanders. The company plans to offer the same promotion at its three store 
openings this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response in Southern California has been overwhelming and far above 
expectations," Cheadle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank resident Kim Hutchinson has already shopped at the Burbank store four 
times and recently checked out of the store with a basket full of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the way the store is laid out because it's easy to find items," 
Hutchinson said, referring to the supermarket-style lanes at the store. "Also, 
the employees are very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Burbank resident, Kyle Johnson, said the Orchard service is almost too 
much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees won't leave me alone," Johnson said as he shopped for screws at 
the Burbank store. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard executives say they have more roaming customer service workers than do 
warehouse stores. Employees are trained to approach customers and offer 
assistance. The company said it also tries to hire people with more experience 
in household repair. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the home improvement giants are also touting their service. 
Irvine-based HomeBase has been hiring more salespeople who are experienced and 
knowledgeable in home improvement retailing, spokeswoman Carol Elfstrom said. 
She said the company also recently retrained its employees to be more attentive 
to customer needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfstrom said HomeBase will compete with Orchard for some customers, but she 
noted that HomeBase also caters to building contractors by offering 
construction materials not available at Orchard. Of the 81 HomeBase stores in 
10 states, 31 are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Atlanta-based Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement 
chain, said their company also offers high-quality service. The company has 41 
Southland stores and a total of 279 stores in 24 states. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're known for low prices, but we also excel at customer service," spokesman 
Jerry Shields said. "We hire good people and we pay them well." 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard may compete more directly with some independent neighborhood hardware 
stores and nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some well-established independents such as Koontz Hardware in West 
Hollywood, say they are not concerned. An assistant manager at Koontz noted 
that Orchard has moved into sites previously occupied by Builders Emporium and 
that there were actually more competing stores before Builders Emporium 
announced in August, 1993, that it would close all 82 of its California 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Orchard was prohibited from opening stores in Southern California 
in the 1980s because it was owned by Wickes, the same company that controlled 
Builders Emporium. Wickes did not want Orchard to add to Builders Emporium's 
competition woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard, which became an independent company as a result of a management 
buyout in 1989, became a public company in April, 1993, by listing its stock on 
Nasdaq. It was founded as a modest cooperative for prune farmers in the Santa 
Clara Valley in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard began to operate as a retailer in the San Jose area in the 1950s. The 
company later expanded throughout the San Francisco Bay area.

 Southland Builder Donates $10 Million: Los Angeles developer Charles H.

 San Gabriel Valley Economy Bests L.A. County: Mainly because it has fewer of 
the defense industries that took the biggest hit during the recession, the San 
Gabriel Valley economy has fared better than that of the rest of Los Angeles 
County, according to a study. "The San Gabriel Valley joblessness rate is 7.6%, 
while L.A. County's is 9.9%," said Roger Conover, the study's author and 
director of the International MBA program at Azusa Pacific University.San 
Gabriel Valley businesses suffered job losses attributable more to a downturn 
in the normal business cycle -- jobs that are more likely to come back once a 
recovery starts in the region, he said. "High-tech took a major hit, but the 
San Gabriel Valley only had 6% of all of the high-tech activity in the county," 
Conover said. A greater share of jobs in the area are in services and retail 
than in the county, the study found. The study was prepared for the San Gabriel 
Valley Commerce and Cities Consortium Economic Outlook conference in Industry 
Hills. It is the first phase of an attempt to monitor the economic conditions 
in the valley, which encompasses about 30 municipalities, Conover said.

 Activase Value Questioned: An editorial in the current issue of the Annals of 
Internal Medicine said Genentech Inc.'s heart attack drug, genetically 
engineered tPA sold as Activase, is only slightly more effective than 
streptokinase -- which costs about one-tenth as much -- and should be used only 
on a limited basis. TPA has long been the subject of medical controversy over 
its advantages and cost.A House subcommittee was also reported to be looking 
into a major 1993 study about the medication. Both drugs, known as 
thrombolytics or "clot-busters," are given to patients shortly after a heart 
attack. Genentech shares closed down 62.5 cents at $46.125 on the New York 
Stock Exchange after tumbling as low as $44 earlier in the day.

 20th Century Ratings Drop on Earthquake Loss: Standard & Poor's Corp. 
downgraded the financial security ratings of Woodland Hills-based 20th Century 
Insurance Co. and its sister, 21st Century Casualty Co., to the "vulnerable" 
range from the "secure" range, citing the insurers' estimated $600 million in 
losses from the Northridge earthquake. The new ratings are BB ("may be 
adequate" to meet claims obligations), down from BBB+ ("adequate"). Parent 
company 20th Century Industries' credit assessment rating dropped to B from 
BB+, and the firm remains under review for further downgrades, the ratings 
agency said. 20th Century has applied to the state Insurance Department for 
earthquake insurance premium hikes averaging 172% for conventional homes and 
400% for condominiums.

ITT TELLS PLAN FOR $750-MILLION; DESERT KINGDOM RESORT IN VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second announcement involving a new Las Vegas resort in two days, ITT 
Corp. on Thursday revealed the details of its Desert Kingdom, a $750-million 
theme park, casino and hotel project the company unveiled in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The resort, scheduled to open in early 1997, will be the first phase in a 
major tourist development centered around the Sheraton Desert Inn Resort and 
Casino and 34 acres of adjacent land, which ITT bought from billionaire Kirk 
Kerkorian last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Kingdom will include a 3,500-room hotel, a 135,000-square-foot casino, 
nine restaurants and family-oriented fantasy attractions, said ITT, the parent 
of Sheraton Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Desert Kingdom is complete, ITT said, the company will proceed with a 
$50-million expansion of the venerable Desert Inn, adding a 1,200-room tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes a day after Mirage Resorts said it would build a 
$250-million, 3,000-room hotel and casino to cater to budget-minded gamblers on 
the site of the former Dunes hotel, in a joint venture with Gold Strike 
Resorts, a private partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert Kingdom marks ITT's belated entry into the resort war in Las Vegas, 
where the trend has been toward immense, family-oriented entertainment 
complexes at which gambling is only part of the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Circus Circus opened its pyramid-shaped Luxor resort, which was 
followed by the opening of Mirage's pirate-themed Treasure Island hotel and 
Kerkorian's $1-billion MGM Grand Hotel and Theme Park, the largest of the 
three.

DOW GAINS 23, YIELDS FALL ON ECONOMIC NEWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices ended higher Thursday after a raft of reports suggested that the 
economy is growing at a moderate pace and inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 But equities gave up much of the day's gains after a bond rally faded, and 
analysts and traders described a nervous market that is highly dependent on the 
direction of interest rates and bond market activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market's had just about all of the good news humankind could stand this 
morning, and it sparked a typical bear market rally that's unsustainable," said 
Michael Metz, chief strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Metz said the day's action was dominated by professional traders "with low 
convictions, who want to scalp short-term profits." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average rose 23.80 to 3,652.84 on New York Stock Exchange volume 
of 272.78 million shares. In the broader market, rising shares outnumbered 
losers by about 11 to 9 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes moved higher. The NYSE's composite index rose 1.04 to 
245.55. The S&P 500 index increased 2.26 to 443.75, while the Nasdaq index of 
mostly smaller issues advanced 2.61 to 719.61. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock and bond prices shot up in the morning after two government economic 
reports gave no indication of more inflation, which erodes the value of 
fixed-income securities such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported wholesale prices fell 0.1% in April as food and 
energy costs declined. The market had expected a rise of 0.2%. Retail sales 
also took an unexpectedly sharp drop, falling 0.8% in April, the second decline 
in four months and far weaker than the 0.3% gain economists had expected. But 
analysts blamed much of the weakness on the fact that Easter came early this 
year, pushing many sales into March. 
</P>
<P>
 A third report showed that new unemployment claims rose by 26,000 last week to 
378,000, the highest level since late January. The market had expected them to 
fall by 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond shot up 1 1/4 points in early trading 
but cut its gains after San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Robert 
Parry indicated he might be in favor of increasing short-term interest rates 
more than the quarter-point the market has been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond eventually closed up 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face 
value, while its yield fell to 7.55% from 7.59% on Wednesday. Prices and yields 
move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred E. Goldman, vice president and market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons 
Inc. in St. Louis, said the reports "relieve some of the fear that the economy 
was going to explode on the upside," but "probably (do) not rule out a rate 
increase by the Federal Reserve Board." 
</P>
<P>
 Stock and bond markets are expecting the Fed to tighten short-term interest 
rates by at least a quarter of a point when it meets next week. That would be 
the fourth tightening since early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said the economy "is developing enough steam where inflation could be 
a problem down the road" and added that he believes "there is room for another 
quarter-point tightening" in short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Margaretten Financial rose 1 11/16 to 24 9/16 on news of an acquisition by 
Chemical Bank, which ended unchanged at 34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allied Signal advanced 1 1/2 to 35 3/4 and Textron climbed 1 3/8 to 54 3/4 
after Allied Signal said it was buying Textron's aircraft engine unit for about 
$375 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris gained 3 to 50 1/2 on renewed speculation that it may spin off 
its tobacco unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailer Gap gained 3/8 to 45 1/4 on higher first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scott Paper jumped 2 to 44. Smith Barney Shearson upgraded the stock to a 
"buy," citing expectations it will sell its S.D. Warren unit to International 
Paper, which ended off 3/8 to 64 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets also closed generally higher. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index 
gained 56.13 points, or 2.58%, to close at 2235.70. Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share 
average gained 74.11 points to finish at 20,224.24. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average added 8.48 points to close at 
2,243.63, while London's Financial Times 100-share average ended the day up 7.3 
points at 3,137.8. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell slightly in global foreign exchange trading, weakened by unmet 
expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenback closed in New York at 104.30 Japanese yen, down from 104.32 yen 
Wednesday. The dollar closed at 1.668 German marks, down from 1.671. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, crude oil continued to rally, surging past $18 for the first time 
since October, and put the market's winter-long slump further in the past. 
Light, sweet crude oil settled at $18.28 a barrel, up 43 cents, at the New York 
Merc.

VECTOR PLANS TO MOVE CAR OPERATIONS TO FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vector Aeromotive Corp., the Wilmington sports car maker that made headlines a 
year ago when its founder barricaded himself in his office in a losing bid to 
keep control of the company, plans to move to Jacksonville, Fla., a Vector 
executive said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vector this year will move close to the offices of Lamborghini USA, the U.S. 
sales arm for the Italian sports car company, said Robert A. Braner, president 
of Lamborghini USA, who also was elected Vector's president Thursday at the 
company's annual meeting in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamborghini is owned by Megatech Ltd., a Bermuda holding company and an 
affiliate of the Indonesian investor group that now holds a controlling 
interest in Vector's publicly traded stock. Megatech bought Lamborghini last 
fall from Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Vector employs about 45 people, and they will be invited to relocate to 
Florida, Braner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vector was formed in 1987 by Gerald A. Wiegert to produce sleek, $448,000 cars 
that used advanced aerospace materials in their design. Vector also sold stock 
to the public to finance production -- stock that climbed as high as $13 a 
share in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vector ended up selling fewer than 20 of the cars. In its fiscal years 
1989 through 1993 (ended Sept. 30), the company lost $20.4 million on sales of 
$3.6 million, and its stock plunged. The stock closed Thursday at 62.5 cents, 
up 3.1 cents, in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Vector's investors and other directors -- who were pressing for 
Vector to build a less expensive car for the 1990s -- clashed with Wiegert and 
ultimately ousted the Detroit native from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiegert, in a desperate bid to keep control, changed the locks on the Vector 
facility, hired armed guards and barricaded himself in his office. Both sides 
went to court. Last September, a Superior Court judge ordered Wiegert to give 
up control. Both sides still have legal claims pending against each other, 
according to Vector's latest proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Vector has plans to build a new line of sports car, called the 
Avtech, that would cost less than $200,000 each. The company hopes to sell 
about 50 Avtechs in the 1995 model year. 
</P>
<P>
 Megatech is an affiliate of Setdco Engineering and V'Power Corp., two 
Indonesian-controlled firms that hold a majority of Vector's stock, according 
to the proxy statement.LAMBORGHINI (COMPANY)

CALPERS PRESSES FOR GREATER BOARD CLOUT; INVESTING: THE PENSION FUND APPLAUDS 
ACTIONS AT GENERAL MOTORS AND URGES OTHER FIRMS TO DO LIKEWISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing General Motors Corp. as a role model, the nation's largest public 
pension fund Thursday called on 200 major corporations to significantly bolster 
the power of their boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to the top 200 Standard & Poor's companies, the $80-billion 
California Public Employees Retirement System applauded a recently disclosed GM 
policy and urged other firms to take similar steps. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS, a leader in the so-called corporate governance movement, which seeks 
closer supervision of management in publicly held companies, owns stock in all 
200 firms. It asked them to reply by Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a 1992 revolt by GM's board that ousted top management and named an 
outside director as chairman, the auto maker has steadily increased the clout 
of its board members, once derided by ex-GM director Ross Perot as "pet rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 GM's board was thought to typify a cozy practice throughout corporate America 
in which board members, hand-picked by managers who spoon-fed them information, 
seldom acted as independent voices whose job was to protect shareholders' 
long-term interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, only two of GM's 14 board members are managers. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, GM formally adopted 28 principles for the board to follow in 
governing the company. CalPERS mailed a copy of the principles with its letter 
to the 200 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant of the changes, said CalPERS general counsel Richard 
Koppes, is the establishment of a "lead director" charged with conducting 
regularly scheduled meetings of outside, or non-management, directors. 
</P>
<P>
 At GM, the lead director, ex-Procter & Gamble chief John G. Smale, is chairman 
of GM's board. If that changed and the chairmanship were held by the chief 
executive, another board member would become lead director. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's policy also calls for board members to have "complete access to 
management" and for them to get in advance details of issues coming before the 
board -- theoretically ending the day when board members learned only what 
managers wanted them to know. It also requires that a majority of the board be 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking these companies to do exactly what GM has done, but we want 
them to review it and put a comprehensive policy in writing," Koppes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of companies may do some of these practices, but GM's formal 
adoption of these measures is unique. We think it's excellent and will go a 
long way toward improving corporate governance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, CalPERs has used publicity to prod or embarrass companies into 
becoming more responsive to shareholders. Koppes said that if it doesn't get 
the responses it wants, "we'll write another letter. We won't go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those to receive the letter from CalPERS Chief Executive Dale Hanson are 
California giants such as Arco, First Interstate, Occidental Petroleum, Disney, 
Unocal, Rockwell, Bank of America, Chevron, Pacific Telesis, Wells Fargo and 
Hewlett-Packard.

RETAIL SALES, WHOLESALE PRICE DIP CALM INFLATION FEARS; ECONOMY: NEVERTHELESS, 
EXPERTS PREDICT THE FED WILL RAISE SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AGAIN SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the Federal Reserve Board's fears that the nation's recovery is 
threatening to let inflation out of its cage, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday that retail sales and wholesale prices fell in April -- fresh evidence 
that the economy is growing at a sustainable pace without putting too much 
upward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The government reports, which show retail sales dropping a surprising 0.8% and 
producer prices dipping 0.1%, quelled some Wall Street investors' concerns 
about inflation -- at least for the day -- and triggered a rally in the stock 
and bond markets.  
</P>
<P>
 The reports were also welcomed by the Clinton Administration, which said the 
data reflects an economy that is growing steadily but is in no danger of 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 But many private analysts said the news probably won't be enough to dissuade 
the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates again soon in its 
controversial effort to prevent inflationary pressures from building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think the Fed is going to move rates higher soon because it's 
paranoid about inflation, even though there's no inflation to be seen," said 
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at financial services giant Norwest Corp. in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised its federal funds rate three times since February in an 
effort to discourage more borrowing, slow economic growth and keep inflation in 
check. Senior board officials recently told The Times that the nation's central 
bank is poised to raise interest rates repeatedly in coming months and hinted 
that the next increase could come within days. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's reports showing surprising weakness in retail sales and wholesale 
prices last month won't be enough to make the Fed change its course, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed doesn't make policy based on one set of numbers," said David Jones of 
New York investment bankers Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., adding that he thinks the 
central bank will again raise short-term rates by the time its policy-making 
Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Fed's strategy of raising interest rates to cool the economy is 
controversial, the news of the sharp drop in retail sales would indicate that 
it is also working. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts blamed the unexpected dip on the rise in rates -- a rise that has 
accelerated since the Fed launched the first of its three rate increases Feb. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most consumers cut back on their spending when interest rates go up, and 
rates have gone up a lot lately," said Sohn at Norwest. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite those rising rates, the 0.1% drop in producer prices -- which 
measures inflation at the wholesale level -- shows that manufacturers are still 
having trouble raising the prices they charge retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first four months of the year, producer prices have risen at a 2.7% 
annual rate, compared to a 4.4% rate in the same period a year ago, the 
Commerce Department said. Last month's core rate of inflation -- which excludes 
the volatile food and energy categories -- rose only 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third report that indicated the economy's growth may be slowing, the 
Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 
26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 378,000 last week. Economists had predicted 
claims would fall by about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many analysts said Thursday's reports show that the economy is 
already slowing and that the Fed doesn't need to raise interest rates again, 
others said inflationary pressures are building even though they haven't shown 
up on store shelves or at the checkout counter. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, prices for oil -- which is used to make literally millions of 
different products and greatly affects companies' manufacturing and 
distribution costs -- have surged over the last few weeks due to production 
problems in the North Sea and civil unrest in Yemen. Retail Sales: Seasonally 
adjusted, in billions of dollars: $183.6 April 1994

BLUE CROSS OFFERS PART OF WELLPOINT; HEALTH CARE: INSURER'S PROPOSAL COMES IN 
RESPONSE TO STATE PRESSURE TO INCREASE CHARITABLE SPENDING. THE GOAL IS TO 
COMPENSATE TAXPAYERS.

 Under state pressure to boost its charitable spending, Blue Cross of 
California said Thursday that it will donate 22.5% of its ownership stake in 
its for-profit managed health care organization to a nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross disclosed the proposal, which drew a lukewarm response from 
consumer advocates, after the state Department of Corporations asked the 
Woodland Hills-based nonprofit insurer late last month to make at least $100 
million in charitable donations this year and contribute at least 40% of its 
stock in WellPoint Health Networks to a new foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The charitable contributions are related to last year's restructuring of Blue 
Cross, which created and sold shares in WellPoint to operate most of its health 
insurance programs. The contributions are meant to compensate Californians for 
the tax-exempt status Blue Cross enjoyed while building up the health network. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross raised $517 million when it sold a 19.6% stake in WellPoint in an 
initial public stock offering in January, 1993. WellPoint includes Blue Cross' 
CaliforniaCare health maintenance organization, its preferred provider 
organization and its dental and pharmacy plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of WellPoint allowed Blue Cross to raise capital to continue to 
pay for the charity work it has performed since its creation during the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross originally agreed to donate $100 million to charity over 20 years 
in a deal that was criticized by state legislators and consumer groups as 
undervaluing the tax-free benefits Blue Cross earned. The Department of 
Corporations, which oversees the conversion of nonprofit health care plans to 
for-profit firms, now apparently shares that view. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Blue Cross directors last week, Department of Corporations 
Commissioner Gary S. Mendoza, said he "did not believe any shareholder would 
accept a return on their investment that was comparable to that proposed by 
(Blue Cross). . . . I do not believe the minimum 1994 commitment I am seeking 
is unreasonable or would in any way undermine (Blue Cross') long-term 
viability." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to boost Blue Cross' contribution pleased some critics. The 
proposal is "certainly more in keeping with what the public benefit should have 
been," said Bob Fredenburg, a spokesman for state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los 
Angeles), who had been critical of the original agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 But Harry Snyder, a co-director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, 
said the new proposals still fall short.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that Commissioner Mendoza is taking the steps he is taking," Snyder 
said. "But they are not nearly enough. They (Blue Cross) don't have the right 
to continue holding on to this money." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were also not pleased with Blue Cross' proposal to divest some of 
its WellPoint shares. On the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, WellPoint 
shares fell $1.375 to close at $30.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Thursday's stock prices, Blue Cross' 80% ownership stake in WellPoint 
is worth $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Class B WellPoint shares Blue Cross would donate under its proposal are 
valued at $363 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to donating 12 million WellPoint shares, Blue Cross would 
contribute $25 million to charities this year in addition to the $100 million 
it previously agreed to give over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross said it does not plan to donate or sell any more of its WellPoint 
holdings. The $25 million contributions and future donations would come from 
existing revenue, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations has not yet responded to the Blue Cross 
proposal. A department spokeswoman said, "We are working with them to put 
forward and implement a strategy that meets their charitable obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Garner, senior vice president for Blue Cross, said negotiations over a 
new agreement began in February "when we got a sense from the commissioner that 
the $100 million was not going to be an acceptable number."CONTRIBUTIONS

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY; ELECTRIC UTILITY STOCKS CONTINUE A 
HEADLONG SLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once the epitome of conservative investing, electric utility stocks are in the 
midst of their most severe bear market in 20 years. And many analysts say the 
worst is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you're a bargain hunter, this is not the place to shop -- despite 
dividend yields of 7% to 10%. Long-time owners of these shares may want to 
consider selling. Investors in utility mutual funds, however, may be OK staying 
put, depending on your goals and your fund's mix of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The plunge in utilities began last fall, as interest rates began to creep up. 
Because utilities, by virtue of their fat dividends, compete with bonds for 
investors, they are hostage to bond yields. If those yields go up, utility 
yields must rise as well. And the fastest way for the market to adjust a 
stock's dividend yield is to push the share price down. 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching an all-time high of 256.46 in September, the Dow Jones utility 
stock index entered a slow decline that took it down to 229.30 by year's end, a 
drop of 10.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, as interest rates have rocketed on fears about the economy's 
strength, the utility index's slide has accelerated. And in recent weeks a new 
worry has emerged to pressure the stocks: Growing fears about future 
deregulation of the industry -- and how the winners and losers might sort out 
when utilities can compete to send power to each others' now-monopolized 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom fell out of the stocks this week after Florida utility FPL Group 
announced on Monday that it would slash its dividend 32%. FPL, a healthy 
utility that had no overriding reason to cut its dividend, did so in part to 
prepare for the new era of deregulation, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that a wave of dividend reductions is imminent, investors dumped 
utility stocks across the board this week. The Dow utility index, 188.83 a week 
ago, closed Thursday at 177.76. From its fall peak, the index has now lost a 
stunning 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't that make many of the stocks screaming buys? After all, most of the 
companies probably won't cut their dividends. And with the yields the stocks 
now are sporting, it may be hard to imagine that there isn't a decent long-term 
payoff here. Houston Industries shares, for example, yield 9.8% now: a 
$3-a-share annual dividend on a stock priced at $30.75. Pacific Gas & 
Electric's yield is 8.5%; New York's Con Ed yields 7.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Abramson, a veteran utility analyst at Prudential Securities in New 
York, agrees that the yields look tempting. But he is advising clients to stay 
away from virtually all of the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Abramson says the stocks' declines so far have been almost exclusively 
the result of the rise in market interest rates. To stay competitive with bond 
yields, utility stocks have had to fall 14% for every one-point rise in 
long-term bond yields. With bond yields up 1.75 points since October, Abramson 
figures that 25 points of the 31% drop in the Dow utility index since is 
rate-related. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that the fundamental concerns dogging the industry -- specifically 
regarding deregulation -- have shaved only 6% from the average utility stock 
price. That isn't enough to reflect the risks involved, Abramson argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if bond yields stabilize or decline from here, he says, buyers won't 
automatically come back to utility stocks because of looming deregulation. 
California regulators started the clock ticking in April, when they opened for 
discussion the issue of unfettered competition. 
</P>
<P>
 While real competition is years away, FPL's decision to make a "preemptive" 
dividend cut was a powerful sign that utility managers are already preparing 
for what might come, Abramson says. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Abramson sees it, most utilities are backed into a corner on their 
dividends, because they already pay out 80% (on average) of earnings in 
dividends. If earnings decline even slightly at some utilities because of rate 
cuts related to new competition, there may be little profit left after paying 
stockholders their dividends. Hence, the choice becomes starve the company of 
profit -- or cut what you share with stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still too early to say for sure which companies' dividends are safe, 
Abramson says. But if your utility is paying out more than 80% of earnings in 
dividends, think about how you'd feel if the dividend were cut, he says. If you 
couldn't handle the drop in income, it may be time to move into fixed-rate 
bonds or other, safer investments. 
</P>
<P>
 What about utility stock mutual funds? Thanks to their diversification, you 
don't have the same risk of a sharp decline in dividend income, overall, as you 
would with an individual stock. Moreover, many utility funds own not only 
electric companies but phone and gas companies as well. Many of the funds also 
have diversified into foreign utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 While hanging on to utility funds may not carry severe risk, however, you 
should also realize that the salad days for these funds are over. With interest 
rates more likely to rise than fall in the years ahead, and with electric 
utility dividend growth all but halted, returns on the funds may be 
disappointing at best for several years. Utility Funds' Dive How some of the

CABLE TV REGULATIONS APPEALED; COMPANY TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days before new cable TV rules are to take effect, the industry's main 
trade group challenged them in federal court Thursday. The National Cable 
Television Assn. asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to review the regulations, 
which are designed to cut rates another 7% on average.The regulations are to 
take effect Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The association did not lay out its arguments in the court brief, but it said 
the Federal Communications Commission's plan violates the First and Fifth 
amendments of the Constitution. The association also said the FCC, in writing 
the rules, overstepped its legal authority. The 1992 Cable Act authorized the 
FCC to craft cable regulations. In previous arguments, the industry has said 
the rate regulations affect cable systems' ability to "publish" -- provide 
entertainment and information programs and services to the public -- and 
constitute a restriction on free speech. The industry also has argued the 
regulations are confiscatory, violating the Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Time Warner Inc. appealed the rate regulations on the same 
grounds as those identified by the cable association. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's appeal was expected. It joins challenges to the FCC's first set of 
rate regulations. Those rules, issued last year, were intended to cut cable 
rates by 10%.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; FESTIVAL STARDUST: EASTWOOD MAKES THE DAY 
</P>

<P>
 In this year of trade tensions and other challenges to Hollywood's hegemony, 
Clint Eastwood demonstrated the enduring power of celebrity at Thursday's 
opening-night festivities for the 47th annual Cannes Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 A dense crowd of spectators went into pandemonium as Eastwood, who is 
presiding over this year's jury, emerged in front of the Palais des Festivals. 
French actress Catherine Deneuve, the jury vice president, had to nudge him 
gently up the steps to get him inside in time for the welcoming ceremonies. It 
all ended with a saxophone group serenading the veteran actor-director, who's 
known to be a jazz buff. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the talk here is about Hollywood's recent exclusion from the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and whether that accounts for its 
relatively low profile at the festival, the official posture of both sides 
Thursday was friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival director Gilles Jacob warmly greeted a Hollywood contingent that 
included producer Joel Silver and much of the creative team behind "The 
Hudsucker Proxy," which opened the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the background of the cavernous Palais, strains of "Hooray for Hollywood!" 
could be faintly heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hudsucker," which died in the United States, got a polite reception from the 
Cannes audience. Afterward, while a large crowd still pushed against the 
barriers to the Palais, the stars and others gathered for a formal dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In another trade-related development that raised eyebrows here, the respected 
French newspaper Le Figaro published an editorial Thursday harshly criticizing 
the French film industry's protectionist policies.  
</P>
<P>
 Le Figaro noted that Cannes comes only six months after France succeeded in 
excluding American entertainment interests from GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 "But here's the cold shower," the paper added, and it went on to make the case 
that France's film business is basically a failure under current policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial also lampooned French officials who have accused Hollywood of 
polluting their culture with movies such as "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What do you get when you cross a bankruptcy lawyer, a workout specialist and a 
producer? In Hollywood, you get a new entertainment financing company.  
</P>
<P>
 Producer Mark Damon on Thursday announced the formation of IMMO Finance Corp. 
to back his films. IMMO will raise $25 million for interim financing and as 
much as $300 million internationally over the next five years -- if all goes 
according to plan -- through Baraban Capital Corp. of Century City.  
</P>
<P>
 While financing deals are routine in Hollywood, IMMO has an unusual genealogy. 
Two of its primary consultants are executives usually associated with troubled 
companies -- bankruptcy lawyer Stephen Chrystie and workout executive John Hyde 
-- who both happen to be longtime friends of Damon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrystie, who joined Damon and Baraban President Robert C. Wilson at a hotel 
news conference here, said he and Hyde are using knowledge gained from other 
companies' failures to reduce IMMO's risk. 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically, the attorney said, IMMO will operate virtually without 
overhead costs and will invest only in those movies it deems likely to draw 
substantial pre-sale deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially high on IMMO's wish list are action movies with major stars that 
have carry-over potential for the video game market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen most of the troubled companies," Chrystie said. "The challenge for 
us is to make suggestions that will eliminate the kind of risks that caused the 
downfall of those companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrystie represents creditors that have been trying to collect money from 
Cannon Pictures, a film company now reorganizing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. He 
also represented creditors against MGM when the studio was owned by Italian 
financier Giancarlo Parretti. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde consulted on the MGM case, and he is currently chairman of MCEG Sterling 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon heads MDP Worldwide, an independent production company, and previously 
ran Vision International. MDP's current projects include a live action version 
of "The Jungle Book," which Walt Disney Co. will distribute in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 IMMO, which plans to back two to six Damon movies a year, will have an equity 
stake in whatever it finances. Damon will continue to make projects 
independently of IMMO. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When the Festival International du Film was begun after World War II, a young 
American entertainment executive named Norman Katz was there on behalf of a 
French film company. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 47 years later, Katz can still be found at his regular table overlooking 
the Mediterranean at the Carlton Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who went on to work for United Artists, Seven Arts and Warner Bros., 
mostly in foreign distribution, says Cannes really hasn't changed much. "It 
always had glamour," he said, "and it still does."  
</P>
<P>
 Katz retired in 1973 after he helped launch the American Film Marketing Assn. 
At the age of 74, he still works as an independent consultant and unofficial 
historian of the evolving scene at Cannes.

better teacher-student relationship." Robert Apodaca, 16 sophomore, Fountain 
Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't assign homework." Tom Chang, 17 senior, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "Bribery should be allowed. In order to bond with teachers, we should get 
bonds -- you know, like money." Karen Velton, 15 freshman, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be better if both teachers and students could communicate 
their frustrations and problems openly with one another." Shelia Nagaraj, 15 
sophomore, Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers need to help break down the communication barriers, as well as 
paying more attention to students' needs and teach around them." Jamie Nelson, 
16 junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Smaller classes. Rather than one teacher to 40 students, there needs to be 
more of a one-on-one atmosphere." Nickie Parchan, 17 junior, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "If the teachers and staff respected students more and treated us like 
adults." Anila Rad, 17 senior, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
 "Better attitudes. Teachers should be more of a friend to their students. 
Stuents need to care more about their education." Pieter DeBrunn, 19 senior, 
Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if the teachers were a little more understanding, and if they would 
remember that they were kids once too. The students should try as well to 
understand their teachers more." Laura Fauteux, 17 junior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers treated everyone with respect instead of assuming everyone is 
bad." Cyndi Danna, 15 freshman, El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 "Student-teacher relationships would flourish if teachers did not expect 
students to know as much as they do and if students spent more time reading the 
encyclopedia, Science Digest and the World Almanac." Takako Tajima, 18 senior, 
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers would come out of their shells and be willing to get to know, and 
not be afraid of, their students. It means so much more to know they understand 
where we are coming from instead of treating us like another number." Don 
Francis, 17 senior, Dana Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Students and teachers need to respect each other. Teachers need to understand 
that students try their hardest but still cannot always learn the material." 
Diane Spillan, 17 junior, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers would have more patience and understanding about what teen-agers 
go through." Hila Roth, 16 sophomore, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers and students should have more quality time together. Maybe they 
should do something together to better understand each other." Sedric Co, 17 
junior, University 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers: Don't flirt with the kids. Stop favoring the guys over the girls." 
Nancy Ann Troia, 17 junior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "Realize that we have other classes and other responsibilities." Debi 
Finestone, 15, sophomore, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers treated students as peers and allowed more freedom of expression 
and opinion, students could relate and respect the teacher because (the 
student) would view them on the same level rather than as an authoritarian 
figure giving instructions." Kathy Wu, 17 senior, Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers would give homework outside of the book." Pier Ibe, 17 senior, 
St. Michael's 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers need to be more sensitive and understanding, while students should 
treat teachers with respect as they deserve it." Jennifer Maresh, 16 junior, 
Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers shouldn't only be authority figures, and students should go into 
class with a more open mind." Gloria Olamendi, 16 junior, Dana Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "Get ones that know how to teach." Tracy Gardner, 16 junior, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "Communication." Isabel DeAnda, 15 freshman, Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers need to spend more time out of class helping the students to 
understand the material if they have a problem with it." Brad Thomas, 17 
junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that students should respect the teachers because they've tried hard 
to help us, and we should appreciate their hard work." Kevin Tran, 17 junior, 
Santiago 
</P>
<P>
 "If students and teachers formed stronger student-teacher relationships and 
communicated more, I believe both groups would benefit. Students also need to 
realize that they are not in a prison but in a place where they can expand 
their minds and learn more than just what is in the book." Lisa Lindstrom, 15 
sophomore, Rosary 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers would see what it's like from a student's point of view, things 
would be better." Ben Winnick, 17 senior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "More respect from both sides: The students need to respect the teachers as 
well as the teachers need to respect the students." Michelle Johnson, 16 
junior, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "If during the beginning of the year, during one class period, each student 
tells about him or herself and the teachers talk about themselves. That way 
everyone will be more relaxed and comfortable with their teachers and peers." 
Mee-Mee Thomas, 17 junior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "If they give students more feedback and explain how they feel." Torrey 
Parker, 15 sophomore, Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "I think teachers should give students breaks in between lectures -- to 
improve the understanding. And possibly students should jointly plan the 
curriculum, so students would learn about teachers and vice versa. Some 
students are so stressed out that teachers should encourage a less competitive 
atmosphere, which would be beneficial." Emi Kojima, 15 freshman, University 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, teachers and students get along fine here at Los Amigos. I 
don't think we would need to change anything." Michael Doss, 16 sophomore, Los 
Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers should get more involved with what their students do in the 
classroom and outside of the classroom, to try to motivate students into 
enjoying and trying in the classroom." Greg Dobhen, 14 freshman, Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers approach their students on a more personal level, the students 
will be more apt to learn and participate in class discussions." Noel Shull, 17 
junior, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "If students and teachers had more interaction, instead of teachers just 
dictating and lecturing to the students." Gina Runjzel, 17 senior, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could break down the image that teachers are superhuman. Both teachers 
and students need to make the effort to accept each other." Amanda Miller, 16 
sophomore, El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers would be examples of school spirit and teach their students how 
to be responsible citizens." K.C. Wolbert, 18 senior, Huntington Beach

AFRICAN HISTORY, PRODDED, REWRITES ITSELF; ART: RE-EVALUATION IS PRODUCING MORE 
EXHIBITIONS SUCH AS 'ANCIENT NUBIA' AT THE BOWERS IN SANTA ANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Pan African Art Studio in Long Beach, artist and art historian 
Akinsanya Dawud Kambon teaches inner-city youths about the culture and history 
of Africa. He does much of that through discussions of the continent's art, 
because it encompasses all aspects of society in a way that most Western art 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Kambon recently took a group of his students to the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana 
to tour an exhibit of items from the Tishman Collection. Seeing great works of 
African art was a revelation to many of the students, he said; the depth of 
their reaction was a revelation to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that really impressed me about the kids is that they were 
so inspired after seeing the Tishman Collection," Kambon said. "It's really 
refreshing for me. You take a lot of kids with no hope, and they can identify 
with this work. They have more of a will to live and a will to succeed than 
they did before." 
</P>
<P>
 Building the self-worth of disenfranchised youth by educating them about the 
richness of their culture is a movement that's been growing in recent years, 
but not without meeting resistance -- witness the debate over Afrocentrism in 
school curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public schools, they give history the same way they've been doing it for 30, 
40 years," Kambon said. "It doesn't do justice to people of color." 
</P>
<P>
 Concurrent with the rise of Afrocentrist thought -- and sometimes tied to it 
directly -- has been a new scholarly interest in African civilizations. 
Sometimes this has led to a major re-evaluation of past views, as has been the 
case with the ancient Nile civilization of Nubia, Egypt's neighbor to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ancient Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa," a traveling exhibition opening today 
at the Bowers, is one of the fruits of the burgeoning scholarly interest. When 
it opened at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, it was part of a 
confluence of museum exhibits about the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Also opening in 1992 was a permanent display at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts 
and a long-term exhibit at the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of 
Chicago. Another permanent installation opened in 1991 at the Royal Ontario 
Museum in Toronto. The Nubia show at the Bowers is the only traveling show, and 
this is its only West Coast stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily Teeter, assistant curator of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, said 
the confluence of Nubia shows results from several factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge archeological salvage operations in the mid-1960s, conducted before the 
completion of the Aswan High Dam inundated many sites, resulted in staggering 
volumes of material that have only now been completely catalogued and 
appraised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally know enough about the materials to be able to put them out," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But also, "There's certainly a new interest in African culture" among the 
public, she said. In fact, the show in Chicago has been so popular that the 
closing date was extended from last September to Dec. 31 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really interesting history, which virtually nobody knew about," Teeter 
said. The show has drawn a diverse audience, and reaction among African 
Americans has been particularly encouraging. "Many people ask, 'Why weren't we 
taught about this?' It's a glorious, wonderful civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nubia show at the Bowers will make nine stops in all, traveling through 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the exhibit is making the public aware of Nubian civilization 
and culture in a way that wasn't possible before, unless you happened to live 
near one of the big permanent collections," O'Connor said. "This the most 
impressive way people can learn about (Nubia). It just makes a very tremendous 
impression that can't be equaled by even the most beautifully illustrated art 
book." 
</P>
<P>
 By viewing the works, he added, "you realize that you're looking at a very 
different culture than Egypt," which has often overshadowed scholarly and 
public appreciation of Nubian culture. O'Connor is curator-in-charge of the 
Egyptian Section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and 
Anthropology, and a professor of Egyptology. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching for almost 900 miles in what is now southern Egypt and northern 
Sudan, Nubia was long seen by scholars as peripheral to ancient Egyptian 
civilization, dependent on it for cultural stimulation and inferior to it in 
political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Ancient Nubia" show "emphasizes the fact that civilizations were 
flourishing in sub-Saharan Africa, and those civilizations were on a par with 
anything in the north," said Armand Labbe, director of research and collections 
and chief curator for the Bowers.  
</P>
<P>
 Bringing the exhibit to the Bowers is "in line with our long-range plans to 
expose people to the totality of African cultures," Labbe said. "We can only do 
it a piece at a time, but this is an important piece of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars are now finding that Nubia had a much more sophisticated culture than 
was earlier presumed and deserves to be evaluated as a civilization on its own 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ancient Nubia" supports that view by exhibiting exquisite objects from more 
than 3,500 years of history, reaching back to the early Bronze Age (about 3,100 
BC), up through the collapse of the Meroitic empire in about AD 400 and the 
Nubian people's subsequent conversion to early Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of factors coloring earlier views of Nubian culture. The 
region is remote and not as well-explored as Egypt, for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about ancient Nubia, Egyptologists tended to take their 
view from ancient Egyptian literature, which tends to depict all other 
civilizations as dependent on Egypt," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was an implicit racism at work as well. Even academics, after all, 
are a product of their time and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 "For quite a long time, scholars tended to think that Africa couldn't really 
produce substantial civilization or substantial culture," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 By that reasoning, Egypt was seen as more of a Mediterranean culture than an 
African one. In fact, however, there were influences running north and south 
between Nubia and Egypt throughout the development of both cultures. Although 
his claims are controversial, University of Chicago Nubia specialist Bruce 
Williams even believes that the institution of kingship developed first in 
Nubia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Places like Nubia were kind of a halfway house between Egyptian and 
sub-Saharan culture," said Joseph Nevadomsky, an anthropology professor and 
Africa specialist at Cal State Fullerton. Africa, he said, is finally being 
recognized "as the source of some sophisticated ideas and notions." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, most attention to Africa has focused on so-called "primitive" 
African cultures, including hunting and gathering societies (the !Kung bushmen 
and Pygmies), and pastoralist cattle cultures (such as the Masai). 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, African societies were thought of as "somehow devoid of any 
contributions to material culture," Nevadomsky said. "This (exhibit) is an 
attempt to look a little bit behind that." 
</P>
<P>
 Old notions die hard, though. Nevadomsky recently lived for a year in 
Zimbabwe, site of another great civilization that produced elaborate stone 
structures (including the Great Zimbabwe). 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, there were a number of theories as to their origin, but up 
until the time of independence for the former Rhodesia, scholars who proposed 
that the structures were built by Africans were ostracized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Nevadomsky's white neighbors in Zimbabwe still refused to believe (as 
historians now do) that the structures were African; he preferred to think they 
were built by space aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 That the evolution of scholarly thought on Africa is now resulting in more 
museum shows is wonderful news to Kambon, as it gives him more ways to expose 
his students to the newly appreciated richness of African culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely encouraged," said Kambon, who also teaches African art history 
through UC Irvine Extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Such exhibits, he said, provide a real connection that is otherwise elusive. 
"You can find (the art) in books, but it's a lot more African, and a lot more 
interesting, when you can see the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ancient Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa," opens today and continues through 
Aug. 15 at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 2002 N. Main St. in Santa Ana. 
Museum hours are Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Thursdays until 9 
p.m.). Admission is $4.50 for adults, $3 for seniors and students, $1.50 for 
children age 5 to 12 (under 5 free). (714) 567-3600.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: IS ANYONE FOOLED BY TV'S SELF- PROMOTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Happiness is watching television during ratings sweeps. Take this week, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 I really loved NBC's "Heart of a Child," but what I loved even more was 
meeting the "real people" behind that docudrama on the KNBC-TV Channel 4 news. 
</P>
<P>
 I really swooned over the CBS movie "Getting Gotti," but an even bigger hoot 
was meeting the real mobster-bashing lawyer and the actress who played her on 
the KCBS-TV Channel 2 news. 
</P>
<P>
 I really felt terror while watching a fictional epidemic on ABC's "The Stand," 
but even scarier were the unrelated virus stories dredged up on the KABC-TV 
Channel 7 news, to say nothing about a companion feature on the show's makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 I really enjoyed the rerun of "To Catch a Killer" on KTLA-TV Channel 5, but 
even more stimulating were Channel 5 reporter Ron Olsen's live reports from 
outside Joliet State Prison, where the real John Wayne Gacy was being executed. 
The only thing recently comparable was Channel 4 anchor Paul Moyer boldly 
crashing "The Big House." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I have really been laughing at "Late Show With David Letterman" on CBS, but 
even more hilarious are Channel 2 entertainment reporter David Sheehan's 
several-times-nightly chats with Letterman and others in celebration of his 
week of tapings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy hype and hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 Television's self-promoting is so pervasive in newscasts that it's become 
routine, a familiar part of the environment, probably desensitizing many 
viewers to its ugly implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad enough is the relatively benign practice of anchors gratuitously patting 
newscast colleagues on the back: "Great story. . . ." A truer measure of a 
newscast's corruptness, though, is its tendency to embellish and even 
manufacture stories, in effect using its news hole to promote favored topics 
that benefit itself or its corporate parent. The Los Angeles Times equivalent 
would be the Metro section doing a gushy story about entertainment reporting, 
using only Calendar as its model. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping it in the family is a crucial component of this practice. There are no 
stories related to the competition's entertainment programs, only those airing 
on the newscast's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-promotion comes in a variety of categories. How sordid are some of these 
tactics? This sordid: 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 5's TV Times ad for its Monday movie announced: "At 10:01 tonight, 
history's most notorious serial killer is scheduled to die in an Illinois state 
prison. Now the true story of how convicted murderer John Wayne Gacy was 
brought to justice. Brian Dennehy in his Emmy-winning performance, 'To Catch a 
Killer.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, his story ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was it macabre rerunning this 1991 docudrama to coincide with the 
execution of a serial killer -- as if this were some kind of entertainment -- 
but also, for good measure, Channel 5 dispatched reporter Olsen to the prison 
to provide a human tie-in between the movie and the 10 p.m. newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 The execution was a legitimate story, one given epic coverage on all of that 
evening's newscasts. Yet it's doubtful that Channel 5's usually low-key 10 p.m. 
newscast would have flown a reporter to the scene if not for the station's 
simultaneous airing of "To Catch a Killer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Olsen/Gacy pairing served its purpose. Several times during the movie, 
Channel 5 headlined Olsen in promos for its coming newscast. Said anchor Hal 
Fishman in the last of them: "The execution of John Wayne Gacy is scheduled to 
take place just a few minutes from now. We'll have a live report coming up." 
There were several live reports from Olsen, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer newscast cynicism, though, nothing this week has topped Channel 2's 
electrifying "Dave on Dave" reports. The format: Letterman speaks, Sheehan 
laughs.  
</P>
<P>
 A "Dave on Dave" highlight: 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman: "It's hard work entertaining America night in and night out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan: "Ha ha ha ha ha." 
</P>
<P>
 Setting a modern record for calling Letterman "the new king of late night" in 
consecutive newscasts, Sheehan hasn't been this effusive since his week's worth 
of self-praise touting his own NBC special in his previous life as 
entertainment reporter for Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 After somehow persuading the "new king of late night" to talk about his mother 
in advance of her appearance on Wednesday night's show, Sheehan gave viewers 
the kind of candid advice that he's known for: "So be there then!" 
</P>
<P>
 Showing his versatility, Sheehan this week has also interviewed Letterman's 
behind-the-scenes personnel and bandleader Paul Shaffer. When Shaffer said he 
was proud of his career, Sheehan's response was swift and merciless: "You 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Give KCBS credit. Any 11 p.m. newscast that manages to squeeze in both "Dave 
on Dave" and a searing profile of "The Sex Criminal Next Door" is certainly 
eclectic. Ethical is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one can only speculate wildly about the exotic tricks that KNBC is 
planning for its own 11 p.m. newscasts in conjunction with next week's New York 
tour by "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." Or about what Sheehan would bluntly 
say about that show were he still at Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Be there then!

CANNES REPORT; GLITTER, GLAMOUR AND SILICONE GREET FESTIVAL-GOERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's a coincidence, but just as the 47th Cannes Film Festival was taking 
over the Carlton Hotel, the city's flagship location, the International 
Symposium on Plastic Surgery was headed out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 As elegant-looking surgeons (or maybe they were patients) said their goodbys 
in the lobby, up went the usual massive signs for "Beverly Hills Cop III" and 
"The Flintstones." Even in a year when the signs would have to substitute for 
the films, when studio blockbusters were noticeable by their absence, the 
glamorous images of Hollywood made their presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
 One image was especially evident, that of Clint Eastwood, the president of the 
Cannes jury this year, and an icon treated with ever-increasing reverence by 
the French. Eastwood's chiseled face was on several magazine covers and the 
local newspaper, Nice-Matin, even put a photograph of him stepping off his 
plane and onto French soil on its front page, poetically informing its readers 
that the actor had arrived "on board a Grumman/Gulf Stream, the Rolls of 
business planes for the prince of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever press coverage was not given over to Eastwood or Brazilian Grand Prix 
driver Ayrton Senna (whose recent death remains a big story over here) was 
devoted to applauding the home country's strong showing in the festival, which 
by one count included three films all its own in the official competition as 
well as a co-producing hand in nine others. 
</P>
<P>
 "France in Force," proclaimed one cover line; "France Wakes Up," insisted 
another. Both featured photos of always-popular Isabelle Adjani in the most 
elaborate of the French films, "Queen Margot." A historical drama set in the 
16th Century and based on a typically massive Alexandre Dumas novel, "Margot" 
has the poor woman contending with court intrigues, three potential lovers as 
well as the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre. No wonder it's two hours and 44 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the industry didn't supply any blockbusters, American film is weighing 
in with well-placed films. Thursday night's opening film, "The Hudsucker Proxy" 
(known as "Le Grand Saut" or "The Big Leap" in French), and the festival's 
closer, John Waters' "Serial Mom," are of indisputably U.S. origin. 
</P>
<P>
 So too are Alan Rudolph's "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," starring 
Jennifer Jason Leigh as the tart-tongued writer; "Pulp Fiction," the latest 
from pulp-meister Quentin Tarantino, and Mike Figgis' remake of "The Browning 
Version" (technically a British co-production), starring Albert Finney, Greta 
Scacchi and Matthew Modine. And when it comes to the sidebar events, there are 
five American films in Un Certain Regard, two in the Directors' Fortnight and 
even one (Sundance favorite "Clerks") in the Critic's Week. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from France, the other European country well-placed here is Italy. 
Especially anticipated are "A Simple Formality," a two-character psychological 
drama directed by "Cinema Paradiso's" Giuseppe Tornatore and starring Roman 
Polanski and Gerard Depardieu (which agreed to postpone its release date for 
two months to be eligible for the festival) and "Caro Diario," a potential 
breakthrough film for writer-director-star Nanni Moretti, who is generally 
referred to as the Italian Woody Allen for reasons that are never made 
completely clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Italian is the inspiration for this year's official festival poster. A 
tribute to the late Federico Fellini, it features one of his production 
drawings for "La Strada," showing Giulietta Masina as the waif Gelsomina facing 
the ocean with her top hat and her drum. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from respect for a great director, that poster indicates the auteur 
orientation of Cannes, this being France after all. Among the critically 
celebrated directors with pictures on display in the festival are China's Zhang 
Yimou ("To Live"); Taiwan's Ang Lee, whose "Eat Drink Man Woman" is his first 
since "The Wedding Banquet," and Kryzsztof Kieslowski, whose "Three Colors: 
Red" is the last of his trilogy and, if press reports are to be believed, 
possibly his last film ever as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the festival has barely begun, several films are already being 
touted as potential sleepers. Included in this group is "Muriel's Wedding" from 
Australian director Paul J. Hogan, "Burnt by the Sun" by Russia's Nikita 
Mikhalkov (whose brother, Andrei Konchalovsky, also has a film in competition), 
and two American films by female directors that deal with difficult romantic 
relationships: Darnell Martin's "I Like It Like That" and Kayo Hatta's "Picture 
Bride." 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on everyone's list is a rather unexpected film, a family saga from 
unknown Cambodian director Rithy Panh with the no doubt self-explanatory title 
"People of the Rice Paddies" that apparently knocked everybody out when it was 
screened recently in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad the plastic surgeons couldn't have stuck around for that.

FESTIVAL PUTS OCC IN CLOSE-UP; FILM/VIDEO: WORK FROM STUDENTS AT 'ORANGE 
COUNTY'S FILM SCHOOL' IS BIG ON VARIETY, REPUTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of the top film schools, like USC or New York University, and Orange 
Coast College probably doesn't complete the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of their hotshot graduates, like Steven Spielberg or Spike Lee, and such 
names as Ric Carter or Erik Spikard don't fill out the picture either. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who run OCC's film/video department know theirs isn't one of the 
big boys, but that's OK. They believe the program is big enough around here to 
warrant describing it as "Orange County's film school," pointing to such grads 
as Carter and Spikard as examples of the department's quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has been working in Hollywood as a special-effects whiz since receiving 
a degree from OCC in 1988, said department chairman Bill Hall. Carter has 
worked with director David Lynch on a few projects, including Lynch's 1990 
movie "Wild at Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Spikard, his studies at OCC led to directing commercials and music 
videos for Warner Bros. The 20-year-old alumnus, who left OCC two years ago, 
most recently helped make a video for the Stone Temple Pilots rock group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some really good people go on to really good things," said Hall. 
"After two years here, they have the production skills they need to land work 
in movies, videos or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have the name of a USC or Loyola (another Southland university 
with an established film school) but our students do some excellent work, (and 
that) indicates we're teaching them the right things." 
</P>
<P>
 The department has been around since 1970, which was also the first year for 
its annual Student Film and Video Festival. This year's showcase, expected to 
run about two hours and featuring film, video, television, animation and 
computer-graphics projects, will be presented tonight in the campus' Fine Arts 
Recital Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC picked its offerings from team projects created during the past year by 
more than 400 students, Hall said. He added that about 200 hours of films and 
videos were submitted. Judges pared down the best of the entries to series of 
one- to 10-minute presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of projects, some good, some bad, but I think what goes into 
the festival is interesting," said Hall, who also teaches film/video techniques 
at OCC and runs the festival. "I think we have some this year that show some 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also variety. "We have projects that run the gamut, from comedies to 
dramas to (those with) Christian themes to public service announcements on 
drunk driving. They go from conservative to liberal -- just like our student 
body." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the program can be traced to various factors, including the 
students' commitment. Hall said that although OCC provides all the equipment, 
from cameras to editing and sound apparatus, the students have to buy all the 
film stock they use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have the money for that, so it's up to them," he said. "There's 
one guy who's making a 10-minute film that's eventually going to cost him 
$7,000. That's a good amount for a student." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is the Hollywood experience of many of OCC's instructors. Hall, 
for instance, worked in movies and television for several years, helping to 
produce "The Dean Martin Show" and "Little House on the Prairie," among others. 
The teachers provide students with hands-on experience, both in learning the 
craft and in working on projects, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the technical expertise, Hall and others try to educate 
students on what to expect when looking for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also teach them the mind-set, the work ethic of Hollywood that they need 
to be aware of," Hall explained. "It's a lot of long hours, very demanding, and 
they need to know that. We're pretty hard here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an attrition rate of about one-third," he said. "Those (who complete 
the program) are looked up to because the other students know they've gone 
through a difficult apprenticeship." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said the program's success can be measured in a couple of ways. There are 
dozens of graduates who are now working in the industry in jobs from sound 
editing to directing. And many more have moved on to better-known, four-year 
film schools, including USC. 
</P>
<P>
 He said professors at those schools frequently tell him and other instructors 
that OCC graduates arrive both motivated and prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sell ourselves as the stepping-stone to USC or Loyola, but it's 
gratifying to know that (OCC grads) can continue their studies with an 
advantage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about that claim to the title of "Orange County's film school"? 
Chapman University in Orange, which also has a respected movie and video 
production department, might disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Chapman's program is a good one and getting stronger every year," Hall 
said, then chuckled. "But that's what we call ourselves. What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange Coast College's Student Film and Video Festival begins tonight at 8 
in the Fine Arts Recital Hall, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. A $3 donation is 
requested. (714) 432-5922.

RITES FOR OCC THEATER TEACHER HOLLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held Sunday for Jack Holland, a longtime teacher at 
Orange Coast College who had been a figure on the Los Angeles and Orange County 
theater scenes since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland was 81 when he died April 18 of pneumonia. He retired in 1991 after 26 
years in the speech and drama departments at OCC, where he also directed 
numerous student productions. After moving to Orange County in 1965, he 
continued to work occasionally as an actor; he was in South Coast Repertory's 
productions of Eugene O'Neill's "Ah, Wilderness!" in 1982 and Bertolt Brecht's 
"Galileo" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like I've known him forever," said SCR's Martin Benson, who directed 
him in both shows. "He was just a great, warm, benign spirit, and we all loved 
him. I think he was really a seminal influence on any number of drama students 
in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland started his show business career writing celebrity profiles for 
Screenplay and other fan magazines in the '40s. "He interviewed, I would 
venture to say, all the stars of the Golden Era," said his widow, Jodi Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s, he returned to UCLA to earn a graduate degree in theater. He 
later started an acting studio at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles 
(where his students included David Janssen and Hugh O'Brian) and directed 
productions at the Music Box Theater in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 After joining OCC, he also became a stage critic for Dramalogue and other 
publications and was a member of the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, son Bruce, daughters Jacqueline Holland-Radell and 
Jodi Lynn Holland-Schmaltz, and three grandchildren. Sunday's service will be 
at 1 p.m. at St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church, 3233 Pacific View 
Drive, Corona del Mar. For more information, call (714) 644-0463. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations can be made to the Jack Holland Memorial Scholarship Fund in care of 
the Orange Coast College Scholarship Foundation, P.O. Box 5005, Costa Mesa, CA 
92628-5005.

'STUTTERING JOHN' READY FOR ROCK WORLD; POP MUSIC: WHILE KEEPING HIS RADIO JOB 
WITH HOWARD STERN, JOHN MELENDEZ RELEASES AN ALBUM AND PLAYS CLUB DATES, 
INCLUDING TWO TONIGHT IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Melendez -- better known as "Stuttering John," a supporting player on 
Howard Stern's popular radio show -- says he truly likes to harass and annoy 
celebrities with outrageous questions in the name of humor and 
pseudo-journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in what I'm doing. I really think it's something funny, and a lot 
of times these questions are what people really want to ask," said Melendez, 
whom Stern hired specifically because he stuttered. "It's great radio." 
</P>
<P>
 But now Melendez, 28, has taken on a new challenge that has nothing to do with 
his faltering speech or his willingness to ask whatever irreverent or insulting 
question Stern and his staff write for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's released an album of hard-driving rock -- called, not surprisingly, 
"Stuttering John" (although, like country singer Mel Tillis, he doesn't stutter 
when he sings). 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Melendez has been playing guitar in a host of bands since his high 
school days, and Stern has regularly plugged Melendez's club gigs at the end of 
his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was 5, I've been writing songs," Melendez said in a phone 
interview from his home on Long Island. "I got my first guitar for my 
confirmation, then I formed my first band in high school. We won a battle of 
the bands in 11th grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in large part to the notoriety he has achieved on the Stern show, 
Melendez landed a record deal with Atlantic Records and, with the release of 
"Stuttering John," has begun striking out beyond the New York area for club 
dates. He'll be performing at the Roxy and the Viper Room in Los Angeles 
tonight and is scheduling appearances in many of the 16 cities where Stern's 
syndicated radio show is broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His role as Stern's whipping boy -- the one who ventures out with a tape 
recorder to ask brazen questions and then gets ridiculed for his stuttering 
while Stern plays the tapes on the air -- has not only opened doors for 
Melendez in his recording career but also has provided the musician with a 
venue that few, if any, fledgling artists could ever get: Stern has played cuts 
from Melendez's record and has praised his music on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Howard has definitely helped me, given me this platform," Melendez 
said. "Where else could you write a song and the next day have millions of 
people listen to it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Call it loyalty, gratitude or self-promotional smarts, but don't expect 
Melendez to forgo his "Stuttering John" persona in favor of "Rocking John." He 
has no plans to leave his day job. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, that is, some superstar rockers were to call and ask him to open for 
them. "Obviously if Aerosmith asks me to go on tour with them, I'm going to 
go," he said. "I think Howard would understand." 
</P>
<P>
 But given Melendez's penchant for asking irritating questions and ticking off 
famous folks, including the likes of Lou Reed, Eddie Van Halen and Cher, the 
music world may not be clamoring for his company. He's even been banned from 
covering the Grammy Awards (might that change if he's up for one someday?) 
because of a comment he made about one of the members of the pop group Wilson 
Philips eating the Grammy statuette.  
</P>
<P>
 Hired 5 1/2 years ago as an intern, Melendez initially worked on Stern's radio 
show without pay, in exchange for free plugs about his club dates. Now he gets 
paid $20,000 a year for his work interviewing celebrities. On Wednesday, for 
example, he was on the air playing tapes of questions he had asked a group of 
ABC stars the day before, including, "What dead animal do you think it is that 
Ted Koppel wears on his head?," "Why are there no blacks on 'Home 
Improvement'?" and "Are there any lesbian shows being planned for ABC's 
schedule?" 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez got considerable national coverage in 1992 following Gennifer 
Flowers' press conference in which she discussed her alleged affair with 
then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked Gennifer Flowers if Clinton wore a condom, and the whole place busted 
up in laughter," Melendez reminisced. "I also asked her, 'Will you be sleeping 
with any other presidential candidates?' Every news show covered it, even 'The 
McLaughlin Report.' They referred to me as Mr. Melendez, which made my mom real 
happy."  
</P>
<P>
 Some of Melendez's more unconventional questions include asking Chastity Bono 
if she had ever French-kissed her mother, Cher, and inquiring of the Dalai Lama 
if people addressed him with "Hello, Dalai." "Some celebrities have a great 
time with it, but some people just don't know how to laugh at themselves and 
it's a shame," Melendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez does possess the ability to laugh at himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Though his stutter has been with him since he was 5 and has made him the butt 
of many jokes over the years, Melendez speaks candidly about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it if people say, 'You stutter. How come?' My answer is usually, 'I 
don't know why I stutter, but it really sucks,' " Melendez said. "It breaks the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people laugh at it and people are able to deal with it and ask questions 
about it, it makes it easier," he continued. "It's when people don't, and hold 
in laughter and treat it like it's a special thing -- that's the wrong thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern certainly doesn't hold in his laughter, but Melendez believes he's 
actually helping other stutterers, rather than encouraging listeners to join 
Stern in ridiculing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, Howard makes fun of me. It doesn't really bother me," he said. "I think 
by Howard putting me on the air and goofing on me, it really helps the whole 
situation out. I really believe that. I got a letter from a stutterer recently 
saying, 'Thanks a lot. Now people know what it's all about.' Stutterers feel 
that people will think that because they stutter they're stupid. But people see 
I'm a normal guy who has a speech impediment and it just kind of makes it 
easier for me and for stutterers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Melendez will perform with his band Stuttering John at 10 tonight at the 
Roxy (9009 Sunset Blvd.), and about midnight at the Viper Room (8852 Sunset 
Blvd.). "The Howard Stern Show" is heard weekday mornings on KLSX-FM (97.1).

DRIVER DIES WHEN CAR HITS PARKED TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was killed after her car hit a truck and caught fire, and another 
motorist apparently escaped serious injury when a high-speed chase ended with 
his smashing into a freeway's center divider in separate San Fernando Valley 
traffic accidents early Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first crash, a 31-year-old Los Angeles woman driving on the Foothill 
Freeway near Sunland apparently fell asleep and drifted off the roadway about 
2:40 a.m., a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When her 1989 Ford Probe slammed into the rear of a parked tractor-trailer 
rig, the car's fuel tank ignited and the woman was trapped inside the burning 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's name has not been released pending notification of relatives.  
</P>
<P>
 The truck's driver, Castro Majais, 45, of Mexicali, Mexico, who had pulled 
over to sleep, was unharmed, said CHP spokesman Rich Obregon. Majais might be 
charged, Obregon said, because sleeping in a vehicle on a freeway shoulder is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 minutes later, on the Ventura Freeway in Sherman Oaks, a suspected 
drunken driver in a stolen Mustang tried to outrace pursuing CHP officers in a 
chase that approached speeds of 120 m.p.h. After the man crashed the car into 
the back of another vehicle and the center divider, he got out and escaped by 
dashing across four northbound lanes of traffic before police arrived, said CHP 
Officer David King. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was saved because the car had an air bag," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man whose vehicle he rear-ended, Gabriel Torres, 22, of Pico Rivera, 
suffered a scalp cut and a facial fracture, King said.

TODAY'S NOT THEIR DAY; FRIDAY THE 13TH PUTS CRIMP IN PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Friday the 13th -- when even those people who are not super superstitious 
think twice about getting on an airplane or making an important business 
decision. And for Curt Lyon, the day already is doomed to go up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 His Newport Beach company, Lyon Studios, produces commercials. And today's job 
stars a Gremlin slated for a date with dynamite after its fictitious owner wins 
a new Camaro -- an explosive contest sponsored by the Circle K convenience 
store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm freaking out," Lyon said. "It'll be a dangerous undertaking. I tried to 
think of everything possible not to shoot it on Friday the 13th. But they told 
us they needed the commercial by Saturday, and we were booked the rest of the 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt Haupt, assistant manager of Mail Boxes & More in Irvine, said that fewer 
people entrust the U.S. Postal Service with critical documents on the Friday 
that gets no respect. "They come in here and say, 'What's today's date? Oh, 
Friday the 13th! I better not mail this today -- it might get lost,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, people often take pleasure in signing some documents -- especially 
divorce papers -- on Friday the 13th, said Haupt, a notary public: "They say, 
'This is an appropriate day to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sky divers also take morbid delight in the day, said Chris Graham, office 
manager of Perris Valley Sky Diving School. "It's a busy day for us -- people 
specifically schedule jumps," she said. "Diving on Friday the 13th makes the 
experience all the more daring." 
</P>
<P>
 But less-daring souls want to keep their feet solidly on the ground. "I have 
to be on a plane Friday, and I'm not happy about it," said David Willis, 
president of Corporate Real Estate Advisors, an Irvine firm that helps 
companies make site selections. "If my seat was on aisle 13, I think I'd 
cancel." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, aisle 13 is the last to go on airplanes, said Sonja Lockshaw, a travel 
agent with Alpha Omega Travel in Irvine. "If someone wants an aisle seat and 
only aisle 13 is left, they'll say, 'Give me a window seat somewhere else,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers make comments about the day, Lockshaw said, but they seldom actually 
back out of flights. Pragmatism won out over superstition with one customer 
this week. "He realized he was on a prop plane to Las Vegas on Friday the 13th, 
and asked me to switch him to a jet," she said. "But when he found out how much 
the additional air fare was to change to another airline, he stayed put." 
</P>
<P>
 Rieva Lesonsky, editor of Entrepreneur in Irvine, said that every day is 
Friday the 13th for her, but the real thing amplifies her fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a superstitious lot in the editorial department. We're constantly 
knocking on wood," she said. "On Friday the 13th, I'm even more paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
 She will put out their smaller monthly magazine, "Business Start-Ups," today. 
"I was once told that anytime something crucial is happening, I should wear 
red. So I will have red somewhere on my person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Triskaidekaphobia: fear of the number 13. More than black cats and broken 
mirrors, more than stepping on cracks or walking under ladders, it is probably 
the most prevalent superstition among otherwise reasonable people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it goes back to witches' covens in pre-Christian times, when 13 was 
the accepted number in the group," said Gerald Larue, who teaches religion at 
USC. "In Christianity, it's associated with Jesus and the 12 disciples, which 
makes 13. And Friday was the day Jesus was killed."

 People cling to superstitions because they are prone to "magical thinking," 
Larue said: "As children, we believe we have certain powers -- that if we wish 
something, it will come true. And sometimes things we wished for did come true, 
reinforcing the idea. Sometimes we stepped on a crack and Mom did get a 
backache, or something bad did happen on Friday the 13th. Then we carry these 
beliefs into adulthood."

<P>
 Rational or irrational, Phil Adam knows this: "I will not go anywhere near an 
airport on Friday the 13th, I will not sign contracts, and I typically don't 
even set up meetings on a Friday the 13th." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam is vice president of business development for Interplay Productions Inc., 
a computer and video game maker in Irvine. As such, he acquires products and 
signs off on new business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to start out on the right foot," he said. "And in my 
book, Friday the 13th is not the day to get anything off on the right foot."

ACTIVISTS SAY INSURERS DENY COVERAGE TO BATTERED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the nation's largest insurers routinely deny life, health and other 
insurance coverage to women who have been beaten by their husbands, women's 
rights activists and a lawmaker said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They estimated the practice has affected thousands of women and discouraged 
others from reporting beatings and other abuse to their doctors and the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurers say their practices are designed in part to protect battered 
women and not give their attackers, who could be the beneficiaries, a financial 
incentive to kill the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the insurance companies to end the 
practice voluntarily, and said that if they did not he would introduce 
legislation requiring them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "These policies not only discriminate, they help perpetuate the myth that 
victims of domestic violence, unlike victims of other violent crimes, are 
somehow responsible for their injuries," said Schumer, chairman of the House 
criminal justice subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige Nielsen, the head of the support group Domestic Violence Services in 
Carlisle, Pa., told of one woman who reported an attack by her husband to her 
doctor and a month later applied for health, life and mortgage disability 
insurance from State Farm Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm declined to issue the policies, citing the history of domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have further victimized that woman, who through no fault of her own, was 
battered" in a relationship, Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm spokeswoman K.C. Eynatten said the company does not ask applicants 
about domestic violence, but considers it if medical records list it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the individual who's applying appears to be subject to a physical risk we 
don't want to provide a financial incentive to the batterer, especially if it's 
life insurance. In most cases the batterer is also the beneficiary," she said. 
"You don't want to make someone profit from that." 
</P>
<P>
 If the woman moves away from her assailant, the company will issue the policy 
if she is otherwise healthy, the spokeswoman said.

 Heydon Building Systems: The start-up company, which designs components for 
home builders, said Thursday that it is in the process of moving to 
Tucson.Heydon's four employees will make the move from Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Heydon spokesman Peter A. Beher linked the move to "the general economic 
climate in California and the complete indifference to the small businessman in 
this state." 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get a level of cooperation (from local government agencies), but 
nobody would ever help us," he said. "It was either not their problem or not 
their department." 
</P>
<P>
 Heydon is developing a component system with which houses can be assembled on 
site "quickly and easily" without heavy lifting, Beher said.

WIRELESS CABLE FIRM ONCE BASED IN IRVINE SUED FOR FRAUD BY SEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday that it has filed a 
lawsuit against a former Irvine wireless cable company, alleging that its top 
executives defrauded investors of as much as $27.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit against La Jolla-based Continental Wireless Cable Television, filed 
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, effectively shuts down the 
company's operations, said SEC spokesman Kelly Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers said that under the direction of company executives Robin J. McPherson, 
Jay R. Bishop and Gene R. Cardenaz, Continental Wireless raised almost $34 
million from investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The executives were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The company told investors that the money would be used to develop and market 
wireless cable television systems in Nashville, Tenn., and in New Orleans, 
Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators claim that only $6.85 million of investors' money was 
actually used to build the company's wireless cable system. They believe that 
at least $15 million was misappropriated and an additional $11.9 million is 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $11 million of the misappropriated funds accounted for were used to 
pay sales representatives and executives, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most was used to sell the investment itself rather than to build the system," 
Bowers said. "We're trying to account for the rest of the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was the latest action against what regulators say is an industry 
increasingly rife with financial and legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the liquidation of Vision Communications, 
an Irvine wireless cable company. Regulators allege that company officers at 
Vision Communications were illegally selling securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Wireless has had earlier problems with the SEC. A year ago, it and 
two out-of-state wireless cable companies were ordered to cease operations in 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say we have seen a proliferation of problems with the wireless 
offerings," Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cautioned investors to study investment proposals carefully before 
making any decisions or reacting to promises of quick returns in an industry 
that is still in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As with any investment, they should invest with caution and become fully 
informed about the nature of the investment," Bowers said.

LATINO MARKET IS VIVAHEALTH'S MEDICAL SPECIALTY; INSURANCE: THE HMO, WHICH 
HOPES TO EXPAND INTO O.C., PROVIDES CARE TAILORED TO THE UNDERSERVED ETHNIC 
GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For a tiny health care plan, finding a spot in a Southern California market 
ruled by giant corporations isn't easy. But Ruth Lopez-Williams hopes to tap 
the area's "best-kept secret" by serving a population -- lower-income Latinos 
-- that the big guys have ignored for years. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped start VivaHealth Plan, a health maintenance organization recently 
licensed by the state. VivaHealth says it can offer something the Kaiser 
Permanentes and PacifiCares can't: an HMO that provides medical care specially 
tailored to an ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven years of arduous effort to sell its idea to doctors, hospitals, 
business people and state regulators, VivaHealth last week kicked off its 
marketing campaign as the first HMO in the state -- and probably one of the 
first in the nation -- to target Latinos exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Monterey Park-based health plan is successful in the Latino communities 
of Los Angeles, it will be rolled out in Orange County as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But VivaHealth will have to move fast to seize the moment. Lopez-Williams, 
VivaHealth's chief executive, concedes that the "secret" she speaks of is 
slowly getting out: A few large HMOs are seeing the same opportunity and making 
inroads into predominantly Latino communities in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FHP International, for example, has linked up with White Memorial Hospital and 
a medical group of mostly Spanish-speaking doctors in East Los Angeles to try 
to expand its business in that area, said Elayne Bendel, a spokeswoman for the 
Fountain Valley-based HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the demographics of the region we serve, and we'd be very foolish . . 
. to write off this whole population," Bendel said. "We're taking some special 
steps to make FHP attractive to Hispanic consumers." The company also has 
special marketing programs for the Cambodian, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese 
communities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP spokeswoman Janice Atzen said that the HMO has had bilingual doctors at 
its hospitals in Fountain Valley, Santa Ana and Garden Grove for years and that 
Latino patients can also ask for bilingual directories. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added that a new marketing plan, aimed at Latino radio and print 
media, is being developed to further tap into the growing Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth also hopes to expand into Orange County, Lopez-Williams said. The 
HMO is studying the idea with an eye toward Santa Ana, which has the county's 
largest Latino population. But, she cautioned, the study is not complete and 
she could not say when the company would offer health benefits to the county's 
Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely all of Southern California is of interest to us, wherever there 
are strong pockets of Latinos," Lopez-Williams said. "Orange County is our next 
phase." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Shield of California believes the Latino market has "tremendous 
potential," company spokesman Mike Odom said. "It's been a segment of the 
population that perhaps hasn't been directly marketed to by HMOs and other 
health plans." 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth has assembled a network of 1,300 physicians -- many of them 
Spanish-speaking -- in East Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley. It has also 
affiliated with several Southland hospitals -- including Downey Community 
Hospital, which provided $3 million in start-up funds in exchange for part 
ownership of VivaHealth's state license. 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth's fortunes will depend on its success at portraying itself as an 
alternative to "plain vanilla" health plans. It will stress the idea that 
Latinos have unique needs that are best met by bilingual and "culturally 
sensitive" doctors and nurses, Lopez-Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of VivaHealth's doctors are Latinos or have years of experience 
practicing medicine in Latino communities. Lopez-Williams said that makes them 
more sensitive to cultural factors that can affect medical care, such as the 
frequent use of home remedies by Latino immigrants to treat minor illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hector Flores, a Boyle Heights primary care physician, agrees: "There is 
no substitute for a physician being able to communicate directly with the 
patient, not just in making diagnoses, but also in handling 
psychological-social issues." 
</P>
<P>
 VivaHealth was founded by Lopez-Williams and her brother, Dr. John Thropay, 
who runs a cancer treatment center in Montebello. Lopez-Williams, who holds a 
master's degree in business administration from Pepperdine University, has been 
chief executive of the center since the early 1980s. Thropay is chairman of 
VivaHealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Through years of work at the cancer center, Lopez-Williams and Thropay became 
convinced that an HMO tailored to that community could be a financial success. 
From a health plan executive's standpoint, Lopez-Williams said, the Latino 
market has a strong but not widely recognized appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos "have a high proclivity of family formation, family support, high 
participation in the private work force and are one of the fastest-growing 
small-business segments in Los Angeles County," she said. "It's also a very 
healthy community, and that's a well-kept secret." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Prof. David Hayes-Bautista, who is an adviser to VivaHealth, said the 
perception of the traditional medical community is that health care for ethnic 
groups "is very expensive, very high-trauma with lots of noncompliance, and 
that it's a money-loser. Therefore, one should not rush to provide coverage for 
minority patients." 
</P>
<P>
 But just the opposite is true, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latino population, in general, is younger, healthier, stable and 
employed," said Hayes-Bautista, director of the UCLA School of Medicine's 
Center for the Study of Latino Health. Latinos are only one-fifth as likely to 
die from heart disease, stroke or cancer as the general population. They have 
lower overall rates of cigarette and alcohol use. And Latino members of HMOs 
spend one-third less time in the hospital than others in their plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statistics suggest that Latinos are a good risk for health insurers. 
Because HMOs typically receive a flat monthly fee for each member enrolled, 
regardless of how much medical care those members receive, HMOs strive to 
enroll the healthiest populations they can. Simply put, the lower a health 
plan's costs per member, the greater its potential profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Williams said VivaHealth will try to keep its members healthy by 
emphasizing routine preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 But her company faces a difficult struggle in trying to market its plan to 
small or family-owned businesses. Many such businesses offer skimpy health 
benefits or none at all because of the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Williams believes she can appeal to such companies by emphasizing cost 
-- she says premiums will be about 10% below the lowest in the market -- and 
tailored coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latino businesses are primarily family businesses," she said. "When I go to 
these employers, this isn't just about their businesses, it's also about their 
families." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's likely to take more than an appeal to family concerns to woo Latino 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming late to the market, and there are major players already there 
who are well-funded and who will continue to dominate," said one East Los 
Angeles doctor who is part of VivaHealth's network but didn't want his name 
used. "Viva will really have to appeal on pricing to business, and . . . it 
will have to have some major financial backers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if VivaHealth cannot survive on its own, it may make an attractive 
acquisition for a larger health plan trying to grab a bigger piece of the 
Latino market. It might also serve as a market test for the effectiveness of 
preventive health programs, which President Clinton is stressing in his health 
care reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a population for whom all this talk about primary care and family 
care might actually work," Hayes-Bautista said. "But the providers will have to 
understand how to work with Latino caseloads, and not a lot is known about 
that."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PCC GETS ROBBERY CLAIM PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PCC Group Inc. said Thursday that it has received a $2.45-million insurance 
payment to cover losses from an armed robbery at its Brea computer parts 
manufacturing plant 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer chips worth about $2.2 million were taken in the February, 1993, 
robbery.The company later linked the robbery to a 70% drop in earnings for the 
quarter ended Dec. 31, 1993. The company was unable to replace the stolen 
merchandise on a timely basis and was forced to cut back operations and close 
six branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The robbery and insurance claim process have been a nightmare," said Jack 
Wen, PCC's president. "Notwithstanding the seriousness of this setback, we 
firmly believe that the company will once again thrive while pursuing new 
directions." 
</P>
<P>
 PCC used the payment to pay off a loan. The payment was part of a settlement 
ending a lawsuit that PCC had filed against its insurance companies last 
August. The lawsuit also included a $900,000 business loss claim.

 GB Foods Corp.: The Anaheim operator and franchiser of Green Burrito 
restaurants said it lost $384,935, or 8 cents a share, for the first quarter, 
contrasted with a profit of $23,612, or less than 1 cent a share, for the first 
three months last year. Quarterly revenue decreased 7% to $1.3 million from 
$1.4 million. The company attributed the decline to the sale or closure of two 
company-owned restaurants in April, 1993.

MORE MIDDLE-AGED MEN FACE PERMANENT LAYOFF, STUDY SAYS; UNEMPLOYMENT: ALL 
WORKERS ARE NOW MORE LIKELY TO HAVE TO LOOK FOR A NEW JOB RATHER THAN WAIT FOR 
RECALL, BUT THE INCREASE HAS BEEN MOST PRONOUNCED FOR MEN 35 TO 54. 
</P>

<P>
 Middle-aged men are twice as likely to lose their jobs in a permanent layoff 
as they were 13 years ago, a development with a profound impact on American 
families, a study released Thursday said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase has been particularly pronounced for men between the ages of 35 
and 54, according to the study, written by Harvard University economics 
professor James Medoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 1 million men a year suffer this devastating midlife job crisis at a 
time when their financial and family responsibilities are the greatest," said 
Joseph Cooper, president of the National Study Center, which published the 
paper. "Millions more face the threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Study Center is an offshoot of the liberal congressional 
Democratic Study Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent recession, 86% of workers who lost their jobs were on 
permanent layoff and 14% expected a recall. In the previous four recessions, 
just 56% of the job losses were permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Male workers in their prime earning years accounted for a substantial 
majority of this increased unemployment due to permanent layoff," the study 
said. "They experienced a greater increase . . . than any other group." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, when overall unemployment was 7.1%, fewer than 5% of that total 
consisted of middle-aged men whose old jobs had been permanently eliminated. In 
1992, when the jobless rate was a comparable 7.4%, 11% were middle-aged men on 
permanent layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a comparison of what Medoff called the permanent unemployment rate from 
1967-71 and from 1987-92 shows that "males have become much more vulnerable to 
unemployment due to permanent layoff than have females," said the paper, titled 
"The Midlife Job Crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers and males 16 to 34 are still more vulnerable to permanent layoff 
than middle-aged men, but the rate of occurrence for the older men has been 
increasing faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-aged men are becoming more likely candidates for permanent layoff 
because they are paid significantly more than other workers: 20% more than 
women of the same age in the same occupation, 21% more than men 16 to 34, and 
4% more than men 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) said the trend documented in the paper "is 
especially disturbing because of the impact on American families when the 
principal breadwinner loses his job." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Medoff, wives of men who are permanently laid off are 24% more 
likely to be working outside the home. And the ramifications for families of 
women pushed into the labor force by economic necessity are quite different 
from those for families of women choosing to work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In particular, the need for both parents to work solely to make ends meet is 
likely to have deleterious effects on their children's well-being," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Martin Regalia of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that the trends 
noted in the Medoff paper reflect the decimation of middle-management jobs in 
recent years and are not likely to change soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fewer managers are managing more people and processes with today's modern 
computer equipment," he said. "That is a basic fact of life, and it's not going 
to change."

MENENDEZ RECORDING IS SOUGHT IN VIRGINIA; COURTS: WOMAN WHO TALKED TO LYLE THE 
DAY HIS JURY DEADLOCKED SAYS HER HOME WAS SEARCHED. THE RECORDING, IN WHICH HE 
ALLEGEDLY TALKS OF FOOLING JURORS, WAS NOT FOUND.

 A Virginia woman said Thursday that authorities unsuccessfully searched her 
house this week for new evidence in the Menendez brothers' murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by a Beverly Hills police detective, the chief prosecutor in the 
Menendez case served warrants on Martha (Marti) Shelton, 30, of Falls Church, 
Va., and searched her house Tuesday and Wednesday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The search, she said by telephone, was fruitless -- and left her aggravated. 
"They tore the hell up out of my house and my storage bin," she said, "and my 
family's not too happy with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to Virginia underscores the prosecution's focus on new evidence for 
the Menendez brothers' retrial. At their first trial, separate juries 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges for Lyle Menendez, 
26, and Erik Menendez, 23, the Beverly Hills brothers who shot their parents to 
death Aug. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A new trial date is scheduled to be set June 27 in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The older brother's jury deadlocked Jan. 28. That night, according to a court 
affidavit filed for the warrant, Lyle Menendez allegedly told Shelton, with 
whom he had been talking by phone for months, "I snowed half the people this 
time. . . . All I have to do is snow the other half the next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn and Detective Les Zoeller 
also searched for other tapes and letters showing Shelton's relationship with 
Lyle Menendez, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said they did leave with three tapes -- but not the one they wanted. 
Conn and Zoeller declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said Thursday that the Jan. 28 conversation did take place, that it is 
on tape and that she has a number of other taped conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked where those tapes are, she replied, "I'll tell you this much. They're in 
the state of Virginia."
