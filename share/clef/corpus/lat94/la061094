INK: ROMANCE REIGNS -- IN BOOKS, ANYWAY

 What author is about to claim more bestsellers since 1992 than Michael 
Crichton and John Grisham combined? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Quick, who also writes under her real name, Jayne Ann Krentz. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick's new romance, "Mistress," released last week by Bantam Books, finished 
its first week on the shelf as the No. 4 hardcover fiction seller in the 
Waldenbooks chain and the No. 5 hardcover novel at Barnes & Noble Inc.'s 
stores. Once "Mistress" takes its place on various bestseller lists, as seems 
all but certain in the next few days, the output of Quick / Krentz will total 
11 hit novels, compared with 10 for Crichton and Grisham. 
</P>
<P>
 That Krentz and her pen-named self should remain relatively obscure despite 
having more than 20 million books in print offers ample evidence that the 
romance genre, which accounted for nearly $1 billion in sales last year, lacks 
respectability outside its dedicated following. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anonymity doesn't bother me," Krentz says, "but I sometimes find it 
irritating because I find elitism irritating. People should keep in mind that 
they would not slander readers of horror fiction, for example, but for some 
reason they think they can make an assumption about the romance readership -- 
that it's blue-collar and uneducated, when in fact it's squarely the middle and 
upper classes who are reading these books." 
</P>
<P>
 As Amanda Quick, the author writes regency romances, so named because they are 
set during the period 1811-1820 when George IV, while still the Prince of 
Wales, served as the regent for his father, King George III. In "Mistress," 
Quick again mines the frothy excitement of the era, the time of glittering 
balls and Lord Byron's passionate liaisons, to tell the story of a woman who 
passes herself off as the lover of a mysterious earl in order to unmask a 
blackmailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her own name, Krentz, who lives in Seattle, turns out contemporary 
romances for Pocket Books, such as the recent "Grand Passion," a tale of 
opposites attracting at a country inn in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In book after book, the prolific writer says she knows exactly what is 
expected of her. "I believe that in all genres of popular fiction, whether it's 
romance, science-fiction or Westerns, you kind of know where you're going 
before you open up the book. That's part of the pleasure for the reader, to sit 
back and enjoy the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the invariables to romance is that sex, although steamy in modern 
romance novels, "always culminates in marriage, a commitment, a relationship 
that escalates," Krentz says. "For women, that's the way sex ought to be. The 
romance genre holds particular appeal for women because it celebrates female 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 Krentz, who holds a master's degree in library science, has also compiled and 
edited for the University of Pennsylvania Press a collection of essays, 
"Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women," in which she and other romance writers 
address misconceptions about their trade and highlight the empowerment of women 
in their books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to overcome the resistance to the culture of the romance 
novel," Krentz says. "You have to start at the university level -- but change 
takes a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterwords: With a look and a feel reminiscent of the now-defunct Memories 
magazine, the bimonthly Remember has bowed with a June / July issue that looks 
at the Beatles' invasion of 30 years ago, the love affair between Laurence 
Olivier and Vivien Leigh, and the lunar landing of 1969. Remember comes from P. 
M. Publications of Norwalk, Conn. . . .

 Those animated TV characters known as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are so hot 
in the world of kidvid Welsh Publishing, which serves the youth market, is 
planning a magazine to cover the craze. Look for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
Magazine in the fall. . . .

 Meg Greenfield, editorial page editor of the Washington Post, and Burl 
Osborne, editor, publisher and CEO of the Dallas Morning News, have been 
elected co-chairs of the Pulitzer Prize Board, succeeding New York Times 
columnist Russell Baker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The sleeper hit film of recent months, "Four Weddings and a Funeral," makes 
emotional use of the poem "Funeral Blues," written by W. H. Auden ("Stop all 
the clocks, cut off the telephone. . . ."). Quick as you can say (almost) 
instant book, Vintage Books has brought out a slender $6 paperback, "Tell Me 
the Truth About Love," which contains "Funeral Blues" and nine other verses 
previously found in Auden's "Collected Poems." The new book was compiled by 
Edward Mendelson, literary executor of Auden's estate.

BOOK REVIEW; A MIXED BAG OF MOSTLY GAY FICTION IS EVOCATIVE, GENERIC; DANGEROUS 
DESIRES, BY PETER WELLS (VIKING; $20.95, 220 PAGES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Timing is important, even in telling a story that happens all over the world 
every moment: a young man's discovery that he is gay. For too long, this story 
couldn't be told at all, or had to be disguised. Then, a generation ago, there 
was a brief, golden moment when a gay writer's personal struggle coincided with 
the larger story of gayness going public. Telling it, then, was an act of 
courage; the social significance of the story enhanced its literary value or, 
in some cases, compensated for its flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. Even in New Zealand, where Peter Wells sets these three novellas 
and five short stories, openly gay lives and the ravages of AIDS are old news. 
This doesn't mean that Wells' subject matter is any less suitable for fiction 
than it was before. Who would object to heterosexual love stories just because 
they have been written for centuries? But it does mean that, once again, 
literary value is the only kind that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wells, a filmmaker best known for his 1986 adaptation of James Agee's 
novel "A Death in the Family," this is his first book of fiction. Though 
"Dangerous Desires" won prizes, including the New Zealand Fiction Award, it's a 
mixed bag. Wells' prose is sometimes subtly evocative, sometimes only mannered; 
he deals intelligently with serious issues but often without fully rendering 
them into stories -- assuming a margin of error that no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the shorter stories are linked. In the first, a 38-year-old Auckland 
food writer named Eric finds that his old friend Perrin -- whom he had met on 
his first tentative visit to a gay bar -- has AIDS. In the second, he cares for 
the ailing Perrin while trying to relate to his current, much younger lover, 
Matthew. In the third, with Perrin dead and Matthew gone, Eric consoles himself 
with anonymous gropings in "that dark zone of pleasure known as a sex club." 
</P>
<P>
 The vain, crotchety Perrin is a good character, but Eric is gen eric. Wells 
eloquently mourns AIDS' "savage hewing down of men who had just climbed out of 
the darkness" of the closet, and celebrates, even in the face of death, "the 
grid of sexual desire, which lit up the entire globe in great flames of energy 
. . . a kind of life force," but the stories themselves, as distinct from the 
ideas they express, are static. 
</P>
<P>
 Things get even slower in one of the novellas, "Bum to You, Chum." A 
34-year-old newspaperman named Nick Burns finds evidence that "Aunty Tizz," the 
woman who lived next door to the grandparents who raised him, had actually been 
his mother. He travels to Sulphur City, a volcanic resort area, to find someone 
who knew Tizz and can shed light on her life of pretense, which he compares to 
his own life as a gay man. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting idea, surely. Add a colorful setting, good dialogue (though not 
enough of it) and a brave affirmation that even pickup sex in public toilets 
need not be sordid, and the story should work. But it doesn't. Too much of it 
consists of Nick brooding over old photos in his motel room and drinking gin; 
and Wells' description, like steam from the sulfur pools, blurs more than it 
reveals. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two novellas, in contrast, show Wells at his best. "One of THEM!" is 
the basic gay coming-of-age story, told with the drama and individuality that 
each retelling needs. Two teen-age boys -- slim Jamie and fat Lemmy -- don't 
yet know they are gay, though we know and their parents and teachers have 
suspicions. Jamie tells the story, but it's Lemmy who first identifies the fate 
that has been bearing down on them all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of conflicts here, against a backdrop of schoolboy pranks, popular 
music and dreams of Swinging London, epicenter of hipness for the 
English-speaking world. Plenty of scenes -- this is what we miss in Wells' less 
successful stories, in which the characters tend to slip by one another rather 
than collide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of Memory and Desire" is a twofold departure: The lovers are heterosexual and 
Japanese. A young executive, Keiji, marries an older, lower-class woman, Sayo, 
against his mother's wishes. He is a virgin; she is sexually experienced. On 
honeymoon in New Zealand, they struggle to communicate in erotic, savage scenes 
that recall D.H. Lawrence or Yukio Mishima. The foreignness of his characters 
forces Wells to make them act as much as they think. And, as in the gay 
stories, their fringe status only emphasizes the human ordinariness of most of 
what they feel.

 McAnuff to Direct Jimmy Dean Film: La Jolla Playhouse artistic director Des 
McAnuff will make his feature film directing debut on Warner Bros.' 
high-profile James Dean biography, industry sources confirmed Thursday. 
Leonardo DeCaprio, Johnny Depp and Ethan Hawke are the actors most frequently 
mentioned as contenders to play Dean in the film, which will be produced by 
Marvin Worth ("Malcolm X") and may begin production as early as November. The 
next theatrical project for McAnuff, who won a Tony for directing "The Who's 
Tommy," is "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," which will star 
Matthew Broderick and play in La Jolla Oct. 30-Dec. 4 before moving to 
Broadway. McAnuff also has another film project on tap with Worth, an untitled 
Disney musical with Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken ("Beauty and the 
Beast"). STAGE

MOVIE REVIEW; 'RAPTURE' TRAVELS DOWN A LURID ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the years British playwright-screenwriter David Hare has taken grand 
passions with increasing seriousness, a dangerous development when his plots 
have come to resemble nothing so much as '40s melodramas. Under Howard Davies' 
ham-fisted direction, "The Secret Rapture," Hare's adaptation of his own play, 
swiftly descends to the level of lurid soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you think you've had a bad day, consider the plight of Juliet 
Stevenson's Isobel Coleridge. First, she's informed that her wanton, 
manipulative, alcoholic, recently widowed young stepmother Katherine (Joanna 
Whalley-Kilmer), who sits on the board of her London graphic design firm, has 
gone spectacularly off the wagon in public and has stabbed a potential client 
when he tells her he has passed on her company. 
</P>
<P>
 Isobel then catches Patrick (Neil Pearson), her live-in lover and business 
partner, cheating on her; then she's told off by her rich, cold, bitchy, 
jealous, obtuse older sister Marion (Penelope Wilton) for failing to control 
Katherine. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that it was Marion, in order to escape any responsibility for 
Katherine, who enlisted Patrick to help her pressure Isobel into accepting the 
idea that her -- Marion's -- husband (Alan Howard) should buy Isobel and 
Patrick's small but successful business and expand it greatly so as to give 
Katherine something to do -- she's supposed to drum up business. All this and 
much, much more is every bit as ludicrous as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that Hare wants to show us how a seemingly solid romantic and 
professional partnership such as Isobel and Patrick's can be undone by her 
blinding sense of duty to the reckless Katherine and by his vulnerability to 
the temptation of potential riches offered by Marion's buyout plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The big trouble is that all the constant shifting in allegiances and attitudes 
is breathtakingly abrupt and seems imposed from without by Hare rather than 
coming from within his characters. For example, we can conceive how Patrick 
could be enthusiastic about Marion's infusion of capital, but not when it 
includes Katherine's sure-to-be-disastrous involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 To pull off "The Secret Rapture's" escalating Sturm und Drang would require 
the mastery of an R. W. Fassbinder or an Andre Techine, expert in playing 
against the old women's picture melodramatics with an affectionate bemusement 
while taking their heroines seriously and finding meaning in their plights. But 
this requires a sense of humor, something that in this instance neither Hare 
nor Davies possesses. 
</P>
<P>

includes destructive adult behavior and some violence as well as sexual 
situations. 'The Secret Rapture'

SCREENING ROOM; 'THE SERENGETI' GETS THE IMAX TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flawless, 40-minute "Africa: The Serengeti" (opening today at 11 a.m. at 
the IMAX Theater in Exposition Park) makes superb use of the five-story-high 
screen to capture the awesome beauty and grandeur of the annual migration of 
1.5 million wildebeests across the vast, unspoiled plains of the Serengeti 
National Park. To his credit, director George Casey does not skirt the 
survival-of-the-fittest aspects of the journey nor does he overlook the need to 
protect endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "Africa: The Serengeti" was an awesome undertaking logistically, requiring an 
18-week shooting schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The film will screen at 11 a.m. and 1, 3, 5 and 8 p.m daily through July 28. 
Continuing to screen are "Beavers," "The Dream Is Alive" and "Chronos."

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GRANT LEE BUFFALO STAMPEDES FANS WITH PASSION AT WHISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As self-descriptive album titles go, Grant Lee Buffalo's "Fuzzy" is right up 
there with Aerosmith's "Rocks." The L.A. trio's '93 debut introduced an 
intriguing if unfocused blend of evocative, hazy poetics and cutting 
commentary, framed in a sort of folk- and jazz-flavored bohemian swing sound. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Whisky on Tuesday, where much of the show was given over to new 
material (the band's second album is due this summer), that flavorful approach 
gave way to a frontal assault, with leader Grant Lee Phillips hell-bent on 
getting through each song's preliminaries so he could frantically strum his 
12-string to produce blistering, wall-rattling storms of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern repeated too often to stay interesting -- Grant Lee Buffalo's 
undeniable and admirable intensity would gain dimension if it were balanced by 
some of the lightness and intimacy the band could obviously command. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, their passion has made Phillips, drummer Joey Peters and bassist Paul 
Kimble local heroes, and the spirit at the Whisky was reminiscent in a way of 
Counting Crows' pre-hit appearances, where such drawbacks as derivativeness 
mattered very little in light of the clear, vital link between band and 
audience. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; COLE BRINGS SLY EARNESTNESS TO ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lloyd Cole was all smiles as he embraced his acoustic guitar at the Roxy on 
Wednesday -- surprising behavior for an artist whose newest album is fittingly 
titled "Bad Vibes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cole has long enjoyed a laugh or two over his darker thoughts, and the 
English rocker's performance of such newer songs as "So You'd Like to Save the 
World" reflected that winking, good-natured sarcasm.This time Cole has 
unplugged the electric guitars and planted his lyrics of love gone wrong amid 
the earthier rhythms of an acoustic concert tour. The result was a 90-minute 
set that added a cheerful earnestness to the night, without sacrificing the 
sly, dynamic tension of Cole's best music. 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined at the Roxy by guitarist Neil Clark (formerly of Cole's defunct 
band the Commotions), who limited his own fine instrumental fireworks to some 
brief solo flourishes between lyrics. Cole picked up an occasional 
mood-enhancing cigarette as the duo glided through a long list of rockers and 
lullabies, cascading the chords and snapping guitar strings while the crowd 
shouted endlessly for favorite titles from Cole's 10-year recording career. It 
was a potent mixture, rooted in Cole's ear for dramatic melody, and in his 
happily bleak view of the modern world.STEVE APPLEFORD

THEATER REVIEWS; MASTERFUL PERFORMANCES IN 'OLD BUSINESS'; JOE CACACI'S PLAY AT 
THE COURT THEATRE FINDS A NEW ANGLE IN THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN FATHER AND SON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father-son conflict is such old business in the American theater that the 
prospect of yet another play about it may inspire yawns. But Joe Cacaci has 
come up with a fresh angle in "Old Business" at the Court Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Cacaci's got Harold Gould and Alan Rosenberg in his play. These 
masterful actors make you feel as if you, too, are a member of their Fleischer 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Be careful, though, if you're thinking of this show as a Father's Day present. 
It's funny but bitter. This father and son are not ready to be immortalized by 
Hallmark. Inviting Dad to the Court could end up as an embarrassing joke. 
</P>
<P>
 As the play opens, 76-year-old Manhattan real estate magnate Abe (Gould) is 
edging toward retirement, totally unhappy about his doctor-ordered exit. With 
much trepidation, he's supposedly handing over the business to his 37-year-old 
son, David (Rosenberg), who at least isn't a drunk like his younger brother. 
Abe plans to monitor it from afar in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Cacaci's twist is that Gould and Rosenberg are never on stage together until 
the curtain call. In the first act, Gould's Abe prowls around his stately 
hand-tailored office (designed by Richard Meyer), working the phones, smoking 
cigars, pausing to dictate his memoirs. In the second act, set four months 
later, Rosenberg's David has finally taken over the office. He has banished 
smoking from the premises and he's trying to cope with his father's baggage, 
aided by emergency calls to his therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after a second intermission, Abe decides to return to New York for 
closer supervision. It's not a pretty picture. But Cacaci still refrains from 
uniting his two actors; the play ends in a series of four one-person scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes playwrights write one-person scenes simply because it's easier than 
bringing the actors together. That's not the case here. The fact that these men 
are kept apart, even though their lives are so closely bound, is emblematic of 
their relationship. Furthermore, Cacaci makes their solo turns seem perfectly 
natural, even as the tension rises in the play's last act. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould is a grinning barracuda. His Abe knows how to succeed in business while 
being really trying, especially to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 David isn't as much of a high-stakes player (watch him relax with a toy sports 
car), but he doesn't fold when faced with his father's obstinacy. He learned 
the old man's lessons too well. We see Rosenberg -- who has an irrepressible 
mensch quality -- gradually turning the corner, becoming more like Abe. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Cacaci's direction, both actors make and take their many phone calls 
with a fine balance -- the action doesn't bog down while they listen, nor does 
it seem fake when they don't allow the people on the other end of the line to 
take more time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Business" deserves to do great business.

THEATER BEAT: 'HIS-PANIC BREAKDOWN' A SENSITIVE ROMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Place a man on the edge of an abyss, staring down into the unknown. Make his 
past checkered, his future uncertain. Heap the opprobrium of society upon him. 
In short, push him to the verge, and what do you get? Drollery. Raillery. 
Whimsy. A fair degree of poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in how you look at things, as playwright Guillermo Reyes demonstrates 
in "Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown" at the Celebration. A series of 
sketches based on the experience of gay Latino immigrants in America, Reyes' 
play is a romp with a sensitive core, caustic without being mean-spirited, 
outrageous without lapsing into stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix A. Pire plays all the various characters. We meet an irrepressible young 
newcomer, with stars in his eyes that can't be poked out by harsh reality. An 
aging West Hollywood "kept boy," thrown out by his serial seducer "sugar 
daddy," now faces life on the streets. A Phoenix-based Cuban restaurateur 
recalls his days in Castro's homosexual concentration camps. Near death, a drag 
queen flamenco star suffering from AIDS prepares for her grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
 An actor of formidable range, Pire is a human buzz saw whose over-the-top 
comic gusto complements Reyes' flamboyant artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-man show, it's often difficult to determine where the performer's 
personality ends and the director's input begins. Director Joseph Megel's 
contribution is palpable, particularly in the amusing transition sequences 
between monologues. Leonard Pollack's ingenious set and costumes are 
showstoppers in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown," Reyes and Pire push us over 
the brink but cushion our fall with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown," Celebration Theatre, 7051 Santa 
Monica Blvd, Hollywood. Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends June 28. 
(Dark this Sunday . ) $10. (213) 660-TKTS. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. 
Karen Black's Offbeat 'View' 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Black's one-woman show "A View of the Heart" at LunaPark is an unleashed 
onslaught of song and monologue badly in need of a choke chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the show's lack of discipline and theme, Black herself displays a raw 
power and charisma that makes one wonder why she hasn't been seen more 
frequently in recent films and on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it wanders offbeat at intervals, Black's voice is a revelation. Her 
renditions of the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby," David Bowie's "Time" and the 
sweetly sad folk song "Noah's Dove" are particularly assured. Musical director 
Marty Buttwinick heads up the tight little combo that backs Black. 
</P>
<P>
 The monologues are drawn from a wide variety of sources, including such 
classics as William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying" and Katherine Anne Porter's 
"Pale Horse, Pale Rider." Black herself penned much of the material, including 
a couple of original songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robin McKee could have guided Black's desultory ramblings to more 
purpose, but the actress's quirky eclecticism prevails over lack of form. A 
whirligig, Black may spin all over the place, but she is pretty in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A View of the Heart," LunaPark, 665 N. Robertson, West Hollywood. Tonight 
at 8; expected to return for a longer run in September. $15. (310) 652-0611.

THEATER BEAT: 'HOUSE?': WITTY LOOK AT QUAKE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did the Northridge earthquake shatter our spirits as well as our crystal? 
That's one of the questions posed by "Where Is My House? Where Is My Home?," a 
witty and provocative new performance piece by the Dark Horses Collective at 
First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we have a meditation on how things fall apart, during and after temblors. 
What's remarkable is that director Kate Noonan and her fellow players have 
created a vivid, highly dramatic show about a downbeat, abstract topic: the 
post-quake blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Strung out by catastrophe, the show's seven Angelenos confront their shared 
sense of alienation in a series of interlocking monologues. But they also 
remember what made them fall in love with Southern California in the first 
place. That love-hate tension reverberates throughout the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles grows on you," says a gay man (Kirk Wilson) who harks back to a 
pre-AIDS utopia. "It starts in a dark, quiet booth at Musso & Frank and pretty 
soon you find yourself defending Angelyne to outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not all are blessed with such self-awareness. Take the fluttery suburban 
housewife (Nancy Taylor) who kids herself into thinking that the riots and 
fires did not affect her but that the earthquake was a different matter. "Stop 
it!" she recalls shouting as the ground shook. "I don't want to die in Reseda! 
I want to die in Rome!" 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the monologues are wrenching and poetic. An earthy senior (Louise 
Ramsdell) delivers a plain-spoken but deeply moving reminiscence of how she 
lost her virginity to a sex-starved G.I. one night at Hollywood's old Studio 
Club. After exiting the show, the blue taffeta dress she lovingly describes 
wearing that long-ago night lingers in the memory, an emblem of an extinct Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the show leaves one hungry for a little more development. There is an 
odd sensation of anticlimax, of the whole winding up as somehow less than the 
sum of the parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Where Is My House?" is the perfect show to shake those aftershock 
jitters. The supremely gifted actors, several of whom have trained with 
performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, use but a few props and a time-weathered 
church stage to summon up a state of mind that all of us are perhaps dimly 
aware of but rarely discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 It's beyond fear -- it's that nameless dread that maybe stable ground is just 
a comfortable illusion, in life as in seismology. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Where Is My House? Where Is My Home?," First Unitarian Church of Los 
Angeles, 2936 W. 8th St. Fridays - Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends June 18. $8-$10. 
(310) 285-6746. Running time: 1 hour , 10 minutes. AIDS Heartbreak in 
'Language' 
</P>
<P>
 The lasting image of "A Language of Their Own," at the Celebration Theatre, is 
that of a man holding the body of his ex-lover who is in the final moments of a 
two-year battle against AIDS. "I want to fly, fly," the dying man murmurs, his 
arms outstretched toward the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 This heartbreaking Pieta -- actually one character's deathbed fantasy -- forms 
the climax of Chay Yew's latest work, a promising but ultimately frustrating 
look at a love affair undone by AIDS and cultural difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is in fact two one-acts. In the first, "Learning Chinese," Oscar 
(Dennis Dun) and Ming (Chris Tashima), a gay Chinese American couple, decide to 
break up after Oscar's recent HIV-positive diagnosis exposes the couple's 
deeper schisms over Chinese identity and American assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second part, "Broken English," they agonize over the breakup, this time 
with Ming's new lover Robert (Anthony David) and Oscar's new lover Daniel (Noel 
Alumit) along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tim Dang has flawless timing and a sure visual sense; he can 
powerfully evoke a Boston flat or a Hollywood bath house with just two 
high-backed chairs on a black-box stage. And it's hard to imagine another 
quartet of actors better-suited to Yew's razor-sharp, urbane dialogue. Dun is a 
special treat as the irrepressible Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the play itself, which sometimes recalls Robert Chesley's phone-sex play 
"Jerker," touches too lightly on too many expansive subjects -- commitment, 
sex, death, the relative merits of Boston versus Los Angeles -- to really 
satisfy. One wishes that Yew had chosen to dramatize completely just one issue, 
rather than trying to depict the death of a relationship in what amounts to 
speeches and clever one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, though, those one-liners are pretty darn clever. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Language of Their Own," Celebration Theatre, 7051-B Santa Monica Blvd . , 
Hollywood. Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends July 10. $15-$20. (213) 660-8587. 
Running time: 2 hours , 10 minutes. Taking High Road With 'Three Sisters' 
</P>
<P>
 Acting teacher Natalija Nogulich formed the Grace Players late last year, and 
the troupe has already taken the high road. Its first production, mounted at 
the Egyptian Arena Theatre, is Anton Chekhov's classic "The Three Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's David Mamet's adaptation of the play, though how this version 
has improved on previous translations remains unclear. Nogulich, for her part, 
studied with Mamet at the playwright's now-defunct St. Nicholas Theatre in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nogulich herself directs and leads the cast as Masha, the disillusioned sister 
in a provincial Russian family that's still reeling from the death of its 
patriarch a year before. Masha's stunning second-act declaration of her 
adulterous love for the weak but dashing battery commander Vershinin (Bernard 
White) counts as this production's high point. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fine work comes from Eric Siegel as the family's benighted brother and 
Earl Carroll as a doctor nursing a dark secret. Among the rest of the cast, 
ability ranges as much as it would in a typical acting class. Some actors had 
an unfortunate tendency, at least on opening night, to rush through lines and 
miss crucial nuance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody said Chekhov was easy. But this new troupe showed grace under pressure 
just by trying. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Three Sisters," Egyptian Arena Theatre, 1625 N. Las Palmas Ave., 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends June 26. $10-$12.

TV REVIEW; 'GOING': TRANSPORTATION, AMERICAN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best place to watch PBS' three-part series "Coming and Going" is on a 
monitor in a plane, or a train, or even in an automobile. This sometimes 
serious, sometimes off-kilter exploration of American transportation passions 
and problems is as much in motion as its subject. Being sedentary, in your 
living room, is not the place to be for this show. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Craig Perry assembles the series' various pieces with intelligence, 
if not always with care. It's the mark of a different TV program on transport 
issues when you hear from peripatetic musicians Willie Nelson and Kris 
Kristofferson or novelist Robert Stone. A compelling cast on paper, but the 
talking heads do not always have something worth hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming and Going," unlike much of the U.S. interstate highway system, refuses 
to move in a straight line. Except in the final and most important hour, "Road 
to the Future," the first two segments zig and zag like a plane in a turbulent 
air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the Long Haul," a sometimes loving depiction of the human and cybernetic 
aspects of freight transport, and "Coast to Coast," which reflects on travel by 
train, car and plane, flash back and forth across history via archival and new 
footage. Sometimes, only narrator Scott Simon's quietly assertive voice keeps 
matters together. 
</P>
<P>
 Along this video road, countless fascinating facts whiz past us like so many 
funky Route 66 signs. The internationally standardized container, created in 
the 1960s, has revolutionized commercial freighting. Once, longshoremen had to 
worry about tarantulas creeping out of shipped fruit; now, the fruit is in 
containers. Later, we learn that Chicago happened by an accidental coming 
together of land routes and then became a kind of land port. Portland, we 
learn, has solved its public transit problems by killing freeway projects and 
bulldozing parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry attends to the personal experience of travel too, and does it best with 
Washington Post sports writer Mike Wilbon, who vividly describes the pressures, 
patterns and headaches of very frequent flying. (He also tells us, that for 
this black kid growing up on Chicago's South Side, travel was the best 
education of all.) 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the first two hours, though, is familiar stuff -- the American romance 
with the road (Brando in "The Wild One": "You just . . . go!"), the national 
spirit of restlessness rooted in personal reinvention and improvement, the 
cowboy ethic of the wildcat trucker. In "Road to the Future," however, we get 
down to the cutting issues that prominently concern Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Joel Garreau convincingly explains why "edge cities" (our own Irvine 
and Warner Center are examples), built at the metropolitan fringe and for the 
car, are social dead-ends. Portland's reinvention of a pedestrian-dominated 
downtown core is a humane alternative, while architect Andres Duany's 
village-like developments are another. L.A.'s Metro Rail and commuter programs 
receive a few minutes here (along with jolly restaurant critic Merrill 
Schindler cruising down the Santa Monica Freeway). 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, though, is said about telecommuting. Take it from this writer working 
at home: Nothing keeps the car off the freeway better than a computer modem. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Coming and Going" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and continues 
June 17 and 24.

 NEW ROUTE: Every Fourth of July for the past 68 years, Santa Clarita has had a 
parade -- and it has followed the same route. But there's nothing like Mother 
Nature to break tradition. Thanks to the Jan. 17 earthquake, the parade will 
take a slightly different route this year (B9). . . . Still, it has a glorious 
past. Ex-grand marshals include Hoyt Axton, Montie Montana, Claude Akins and 
Cliffie Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 FEELINGS: The quake, of course, affected psyches as well as parades. At 
Tarzana Elementary School, for instance, students expressed their feelings in 
therapy groups. On Thursday, more than 100 celebrated their "graduation.". . . 
"It's the responsibility of the adults to help the child understand what's 
transpired," said Suzanne Silverstein of the Psychological Trauma Center at 
Cedars-Sinai (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 NEW CLOTHES: There will be a definite fashion statement this fall at La Mesa 
Junior High School in Santa Clarita, and everybody will be making it. The 
school will become the first in the area to require uniforms (above). . . . 
Paula Olivares, head of the school district's board of trustees, says research 
shows that students in uniforms have "increased learning and better test 
scores" (B9). 
</P>
<P>
 HOLY COW! Forget about Billy Crystal and Jack Palance. "City Slickers II" 
opens today (F1), and that means the return of Norman. He's the adorable cow 
who certainly knew how to milk every moment of his screen time in the original. 
. . . Norman, who lives in Canyon Country, apparently hasn't let fame go to his 
head. "He's the same Norman," said his trainer, Carol Sonheim. 
</P>
<P>
 EMMYS: The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood started 
mailing the ballots Thursday for this year's 46th Emmy Awards. Nominations will 
be announced in July, and the awards will be handed out in September. . . . The 
top all-time winners are: "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" (29), "Cheers" (27), and 
"Hill Street Blues" (26). Michael Arkush

20TH CENTURY INSURANCE TO END QUAKE POLICIES; BUSINESS: THE DECISION, MADE 
AFTER COMPANY WAS HIT BY $600 MILLION IN CLAIMS, AFFECTS 240,000 CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a move certain to shake up the Southern California insurance market, 
earthquake-battered 20th Century Insurance Co. said Thursday that it will stop 
selling earthquake policies immediately and phase out all homeowner coverage 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The big insurer's exit increases fears that consumers -- especially in the Los 
Angeles Basin -- will have trouble finding earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also prompted renewed calls for a national catastrophe insurance 
program such as the Natural Disaster Protection Act now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based 20th Century said it will take no new customers in either 
homeowner or earthquake insurance, but will concentrate on the cut-rate auto 
policies that form the bulk of its business and have fueled its 30 years of 
fast growth and high profits. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's action, negotiated last month with Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, directly affects 240,000 homeowners and condominium policyholders, 
about 4,700 of whom are Ventura County residents. The majority of the company's 
policyholders live in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our customers have already suffered the disrupting effects of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake," Neil H. Ashley, chief executive, said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize this is one more inconvenience, but it is the right thing to do," 
he added, citing about $600 million in quake claims that wiped out two-thirds 
of the insurer's surplus, or cushion against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Disruption aside, it will cost policyholders money. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi granted the company an immediate 17% increase on its homeowner 
rates, which will bring the average annual premium to $365 from $317, based on 
$117,000 of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 That is still cheap compared with the average of $441 in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. However, existing homeowner policyholders will be allowed only 
two more annual renewals before they are forced to shop elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer's 90,000 earthquake policyholders must find another carrier by 
their next renewal date. More than 1,700 of those policyholders live in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said in a statement that he did not expect consumers to have trouble 
finding replacement coverage, but others have predicted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he says the market will absorb 20th Century (customers) no problem, I say, 
well, who?" said Stephen L. Young of the Independent Insurance Agents and 
Brokers of California, a trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, insurers have moved to curtail the growth of 
new earthquake and homeowner coverage in Southern California, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will be especially difficult for customers with quake-damaged homes 
to find new coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the state's largest carrier with 20% of the market, recently began 
a "managed growth" program for its California homeowners line, limiting the 
amount of new business it accepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking steps to limit our exposure," spokesman John Millen of No. 3 
Farmers Insurance Group said Thursday. "It's the prudent thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers recently raised the deductible on its quake policies to 15% from 10% 
and is "seriously reviewing the need for increased rates," Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millen said the real answer would be enactment of the Natural Disaster 
Protection Act, whose passage this year is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation would create a national pool for disaster coverage 
with a disaster insurance component built into all homeowners' policies. The 
premiums would be adjusted for regional risk of quakes, hurricanes, wildfires 
or other catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of 20th Century -- the eighth largest homeowner insurer 
statewide and believed to be the fourth largest in Southern California -- also 
may put upward pressure on homeowners' insurance rates over the long term, 
since 20th Century has been the low-price leader for the 12 years since 
starting that line of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, Garamendi noted that no other carriers have sought rate 
increases in homeowner insurance since January. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's withdrawal was forced by its shocking, $340-million 
first-quarter loss, brought on by more than 41,000 earthquake claims. On the 
day of its annual meeting two weeks ago, company directors voted to suspend the 
company's dividend for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was about to grant 20th Century's application to triple its 
earthquake rates, Deputy Insurance Commissioner Richard D. Baum said Thursday, 
but the company suddenly changed its mind and decided to stop selling all 
residential coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the disruption to policyholders, Garamendi negotiated an orderly 
withdrawal over two years, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century spokesman Rick Dinon said that between the time it applied for 
the rate increase and changed its mind, the estimated quake losses had 
ballooned by several hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street loved Thursday's move. The stock of parent 20th Century Industries 
jumped $2 a share, or 13%, closing at $17.75 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has ordered 20th Century to raise its surplus to $250 million by 
June 30, from the current level of $188 million. Analysts said the low-debt 
company could easily achieve that by bank borrowings.

 SMART GENES: Like mother, like son . . . . Brandon Savage will address 
Thousand Oaks High's graduating class next week as valedictorian -- an honor 
his mother held 21 years ago. Jeanie Mortensen Savage, who rose to the top of 
her class at Thousand Oaks High in 1973, marvels at her son's success at 
juggling academics with the wrestling team, student government, and a part-time 
job. "We don't talk much about the academics," she said. "Most of the 
dinner-time conversation is trying to coordinate his schedule."

 FINAL FRONTIER: "Star Trek" disappeared from Prime Time a quarter-century ago. 
And "Star Trek: The Next Generation" is now in re-runs too . . . . But on 
Sunday, the authorized biographer of Star Trek visionary Gene Roddenberry will 
sign copies of his "Star Trek Creator" at the Phantom Bookstore in Ventura. 
Store owner John Anthony Miller can't predict the turnout of fans, who call 
themselves Trekkers. Don't call them Trekkies, he warns. "I used the word 
Trekkie and I got scolded for it."

 DRUG CZAR: William J. Bennett has worn many hats. He was Secretary of 
Education under President Reagan. He was the nation's drug czar to coordinate 
President Bush's drug-control policy. And, he's even considering a bid for 
Presidency . . . . But this Saturday, Bennett will don a mortarboard as the 
commencement speaker at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula. Bennett, who 
has a Ph.D. in philosophy, embraces the college's great books program. Reading 
Plato's Republic , he once wrote, forever "altered my life."

 PEDDLE PATROL: High-speed chases are out . . . . Yet Simi Valley police 
quickly found their new mountain-bike patrols can penetrate some places their 
cars cannot -- down narrow alleys, through apartment complexes and along dirt 
trails. In just a few nights, bike-riding officers have made several felony 
drug arrests and dozens of traffic stops. Said Officer Dave Livingstone: "We 
found out we've been able to do the same thing on bicycles we've been doing in 
cars."

AND STILL ANOTHER PHONY PEACE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During President Clinton's recent visit to France, the United States renewed 
its commitment to a peace plan assigning 51% of Bosnia-Herzegovina to its 
Muslim-Croat majority and 49% to its Serb minority. Inconveniently, the Bosnian 
Serbs now hold not 49% but 72% of Bosnia's territory, which leaves one-fifth of 
the country in dispute. The Serbs are not going to give the disputed territory 
back. The French and Americans are not going to take it back. So much for the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tense meeting this week in Geneva, the belligerents agreed to a one-month 
cease-fire. This is inconsequential. Real forward movement is not likely to 
come either in wrangling over the details of the partition map or in the making 
and breaking of cease-fires. 
</P>
<P>
 In a daring economic move, Serbia has made its dinar convertible with the 
German mark. Some predict that after a brief boom, Belgrade -- which has only a 
few months' hard-currency reserves -- will face a devastating economic 
collapse. Others, however, claim that this move coupled with a weakening 
European will to maintain the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations 
on Serbia has made the sanctions moot. If the latter view is correct (and the 
next few months will tell), then the threat of lifting the sanctions is also 
moot as a form of pressure on the Muslims and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. congressional pressure for a unilateral U.S. breach of the 
arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republics continues to grow. On Thursday, 
ignoring pleas from the White House, the House of Representatives voted by a 
strong 244-178 margin to lift the embargo. The Senate has already voted 50-49 
for the same action. Neither chamber is likely to override a Clinton veto, but 
Clinton may find the political cost of a veto prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 If both the sanctions and the embargo are abandoned, the Balkans war may 
evolve into a new kind of civil war pitting Serbia against a rearming alliance 
of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and, unofficially, Slovenia -- with a fifth 
column of ethnic Hungarians and Albanians within Serbia. "The Geneva agreement 
is merely a one-month calm before an unprecedented storm and a prelude to total 
conflict," the Bosnian Serb leadership's SRNA news agency said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been urged as the best possible 
outcome under the circumstances. But since no coalition of major powers intends 
to impose the partition, this outcome becomes as moot as the sanctions and the 
embargo. In short, the war is overwhelmingly likely to escalate. And in that 
case, an unpleasant question could begin to become inescapable: Which side 
should the United States support? The current paradox is that all the major 
powers, by refusing to intervene and insisting on negotiations, have made 
negotiations virtually meaningless and neutrality increasingly difficult to 
maintain.

THE BOND VOTE QUAKE: WHAT TO DO NOW?; THIS TIME REAL LEADERSHIP -- AND 
BIPARTISANSHIP -- IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson concedes he had no plan to fall back on if Proposition 1A, 
the $2-billion earthquake repair bond issue, failed at the polls. It was not a 
wise gamble. As everyone knows, Proposition 1A did indeed fail, not narrowly 
but resoundingly, in a regional split that saw voters in earthquake-hit Los 
Angeles and San Francisco areas approving the measure while almost everywhere 
else it went down to defeat. In the wake of that failure no rainbow has 
appeared in the California sky pointing the way to a pot of gold, no buried 
treasure has been unearthed on the Capitol grounds in Sacramento. No redemptive 
substitute has turned up, and that's why a bold act of political will has now 
become indispensable if California is to get the earthquake relief money it 
must have to complement federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's response to date isn't the answer. The best he can offer is a plan to 
juggle gasoline tax revenues so that money will be diverted from road repairs 
to strengthening highway bridges, certainly an urgent priority given the 
devastation and disruption that the collapse of even a few such structures on 
key freeways could cause. But to focus on this single priority will require 
delaying for years other highway repair projects that are of key importance to 
protecting and expanding the state's economy. Additionally, of course, Wilson's 
manipulation of fuel tax revenues would do nothing to provide for other vital 
repairs, especially to badly damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic impact of not making these repairs would be severe and 
far-reaching. The state, for example, was prepared to become the lender of last 
resort for those who could not otherwise get earthquake-related housing repair 
loans from banks or the Small Business Administration. Proposition 1A would 
have made $575 million available for that purpose. But the governor's post-1A 
program offers nothing, because a state budget already facing a deficit of 
billions has nothing to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such loans it's all but certain that hundreds of residential 
properties in Los Angeles will simply be abandoned by their owners, producing 
instant neighborhood blight, costing nearby commercial areas their customers, 
driving down property values and slicing into tax revenues for the city and 
county. Southern California, as it begins at long last to emerge from the 
recession, simply can't accept that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for the politicians to stop trying to bamboozle the voters, and for 
the voters to stop kidding themselves. We can meet the state's bill for 
earthquake repairs and retrofitting of hazardous structures, and we can do it 
at reasonable cost. How? By a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the sales 
tax, which would produce about $750 million a year. In less than three years 
revenues equal to those 1A would have provided would be raised. The tax hike 
could then disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson must take the lead in seeking such a tax. He deserves -- he must have 
-- the responsible support of Kathleen Brown, his Democratic opponent in 
November, and of both parties in the Legislature. There simply is no feasible 
alternative to paying for the work that must be done. And there can be no 
acceptable excuse for failing to act.

OPEN-SPACE BATTLE LOST, WAR GOES ON; SETBACK AT POLLS CALLS FOR EVEN MORE 
DETERMINATION AND CREATIVITY AMONG CONSERVATIONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recession made it more difficult for developers to get money to build 
houses and made them more willing to sell their land to groups wanting to 
preserve it as open space. However, this same economic slowdown made voters 
unwilling to incur more debt to buy the fields, lakes and canyons. That is 
wholly understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Tuesday's rejection of Proposition 180, the California Parks and 
Wildlife Initiative, was an especially hard blow to Laguna Beach and the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy. But neither should throw in the towel on 
worthwhile projects because of the setback at the polls. It is time again to 
approach private donors and to look even harder for federal and state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's defeat cost the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy more than 
$85 million sought for the acquisition of open land in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. Now its executive director says it and a sister agency will have to 
lay off workers and put property purchases on hold. The conservancy also will 
have to come up with nearly $6 million to complete its purchase of Canyon Oaks 
Estates in Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 And Laguna Beach was counting on Proposition 180 to provide $25 million, the 
bulk of a $33-million final payment due the Irvine Co. next year for a 
marvelous 2,150-acre property known as Laguna Laurel. About 1,500 local 
volunteers, an impressive number, gathered signatures to get the initiative on 
the ballot and worked to solicit voter support. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Laurel would be part of a wilderness park stretching several miles 
inland from the coast. Laguna Beach already has paid most of the $78-million 
purchase price but needed help from the initiative to buy the final 189 acres, 
which still conceivably could wind up as the site of 1,500 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the specific plots of land for these two major projects are of course 
most accessible to residents of Laguna Beach and Topanga, they and similar 
parcels are assets to the entire region. Hikers from San Bernardino trek in the 
Santa Monica Mountains; San Diego residents and tourists enjoy the Laguna Beach 
coast and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for initiative backers to huddle with property owners to see what 
can be worked out. An Irvine Co. executive accurately labeled Laguna Laurel 
proponents "resourceful and determined people." So are Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters may have felt tapped out in the face of a $2-billion initiative, but 
this is no time for supporters of parks and wilderness to just fold their 
tents.

U.S.-INDIA RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "A New Light on India," editorial, May 29: From your perspective, the two 
issues that are not smooth in the United States' relationship with India are 
nuclear weapons development and Kashmir. The U.S. Administration was aware of 
nuclear weapons development in Pakistan since the time of U.S. involvement in 
the Afghanistan war, yet failed to take any measures to stop it.  
</P>
<P>
 On the second issue, Islamic fundamentalists from Afghanistan to Algeria, with 
active military and other logistics, support Pakistan. These countries are 
engaged in driving out minorities -- the worst ethnic cleansing -- from Kashmir 
and have declared jihad against India. India has more Muslims than Pakistan and 
is a secular country. Kashmir has a distinct tradition, and has a significant 
number of Hindu and Buddhist minorities. Kashmir Muslims do not have any ethnic 
affinity with eastern Pakistan Muslims, and the unification of Kashmir with 
Pakistan could be as volatile as that of the former East and West Pakistan. 
Furthermore, if the Islamic fundamentalists succeed in Kashmir, the impact will 
be very serious on secular India and its large Muslim population.

 * When India became independent, its leaders wanted the country to occupy its 
rightful place on the world stage. For, though India is a poor country, it has 
been fortunate to have a visionary and intellectual leadership for most of the 
past 47 years. I submit that it is the failure of successive U.S. 
administrations to see that what India wanted is to be treated as an equal that 
caused the U.S. to view India with suspicion. Accustomed to dealing with 
adversaries and supplicants, the U.S. never apparently figured out how to deal 
effectively with the largest democracy in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 While the failures of the Indian government and society got ample coverage 
both in India and abroad, the real story of India's achievements has not been 
told in the West until now. It is ironic that the achievements of the Indian 
system (strong democracy, an independent judiciary, a free press, a highly 
trained scientific/engineering work force) are getting noticed only when 
American businesses realize that a buck or two can be made in India.

 I read with considerable interest and agreement Steven Sample's column on the 
region's hidden economic engine -- its colleges and universities (Opinion, May 
22). 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that the 175 accredited institutions are attended by over 1 
million students and support 120,000 full-time jobs.I also agree that these 
universities and colleges should keep us a forward-thinking region. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, as chairman of the Central City Assn.'s Transportation Committee, 
permit me to suggest a forward-thinking idea. To relieve congestion on our 
freeway system and at the same time reduce air pollution, how about the 
colleges and universities altering their regular class hours so that all those 
commuting students and staff are off the road during peak traffic periods? 
</P>
<P>
 Have you noticed how the freeway flow improves in June and congests again in 
September? As a close friend paraphrased it, "Let the students sleep." Whoever 
enjoyed those 8 a.m. classes anyway?

<P>
 I agree with Dr. C. Richard Arena that it is disgraceful that the oral history 
tapes on the early years of Richard Nixon compiled by him for Whittier College 
during the years 1971 to 1973 have been kept from public scrutiny for over 20 
years (letter, May 30). While "red tape" at the National Archives Annex in 
Laguna Niguel may well be partially culpable for this predicament, the 
material's inaccessibility is also due to the late President's lamentable 
penchant for confounding public with private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there exists a cache of some 200 oral histories (transcribed, 
edited, and indexed) on the pre-political years of Nixon that is available to 
all researchers at the Oral History Program at Cal State Fullerton. Transacted 
simultaneously with the Arena tapes, this collection was assembled by CSUF 
students under the direction of Harry Jeffrey, a history department colleague, 
and processed by CETA workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the "official" Whittier project, the Fullerton one was achieved without 
the Nixon Administration's funding and endorsement. During the past two 
decades, it has been extensively used by a veritable parade of Nixon scholars, 
while its priceless contents have reached the general public via a 1978 OHP 
publication, "The Young Nixon: An Oral Inquiry."

CALIFORNIA ATTITUDE

 Marc Reisner's "Handicapped by Our Attitude," (Commentary, May 23), said it 
all, and very well; if we don't stop looking to Washington every time 
California burns up, dries up, drowns or falls apart, tomorrow's headline will 
be: "Congress to California: Drop Dead."

 Big Daddy Washington subsidizes our transportation, our water supply and our

DEBATE OVER SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "EPA Blows Smoke on Risk of Breathing It" (Robert Scheer, Column Left, May 
29): 
</P>
<P>
 Scheer hit the nail right on the head regarding the hidden agenda of the 
"secondhand smoke" doomsayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking the books or massaging the test data to support a predetermined 
conclusion on the part of the EPA is illustrative of why the government's 
credibility is almost nonexistent. The government would rather shift the burden 
of ensuring "clean air" to individuals than to the corporate polluters who 
manufacture cars and trucks that foul our environment far more than the 
(relative) handful of smokers could ever do. 
</P>
<P>
 More notable, however, is the hypocrisy of the militant nonsmokers who make a 
matter of personal inconvenience or distaste into a point of principle. Thus, 
the same liberals who arrogate to themselves the moral high ground on the 
smoking issue are conspicuously absent from the anti-smog fight, having failed 
to support -- with significant time and money contributions -- myriad citizen 
organizations dedicated to eradicating smog over the past 30 years.

 * Responding to "Blow Away All the Smoke" (June 4), I thank The Times for the 
editorial about Tony Miller and his efforts to expose Philip Morris for its 
deceptive telephone campaign to get signatures for their so-called 
"anti-smoking" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I was among those who were duped. The question posed to me on 
the phone was "Do you support statewide anti-smoking laws?" I was never told 
that the proposed legislation would wipe out strong local anti-smoking laws. 
Nor was I told that the sponsor of the initiative was Philip Morris. I signed 
the petition, fully unaware that I was lending support to the very cause I so 
strongly oppose.

<P>
 * Your editorial implied that signers of a petition for a tough anti-smoking 
plan were deliberately misled. What this petition is trying to do is to have a 
statewide regulation regarding smoking, rather than have a patchwork of 
different ordinances in some cities and counties. Under present conditions, 
many restaurant owners are at an unfair disadvantage, and others are favored, 
depending how each municipality handles their situation. You would not stand 
for each community to have their own seat belt law or helmet law, would you? 
</P>
<P>
 As for signing a petition, it is up to the voter to inform himself of its 
complete contents before signing it. Furthermore, if you find out later that 
the petition you signed is not what you thought it would be, you can vote 
against it when you go to the polls. The petition is only the vehicle to get 
there.

 * I am one of the individuals who made a formal complaint to the secretary of 
state about flagrant deception in the gathering of signatures. Several times in 
front of a very busy local market, I witnessed the same affable, elderly 
gentleman egregiously misrepresent this measure as simply an effort to increase 
penalties to vendors selling cigarettes as distracted signers put their name to 
petitions that would do the very opposite of what these folks seemed to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not, as suggested by the measure's paid consultant in a Times article, an 
anti-smoking fanatic, individuals he states he suspects simply fear putting 
this measure to a statewide vote. I say to him, fairness and money, not fear, 
is the issue. My firsthand observation indicates that many voters signed these 
petitions believing that the measure in some way tightened cigarette 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, to the measure's hired political consultant who denies duplicity and 
obviously hopes to divert attention from the facts by making his own charge of 
harassment by a few anti-smoking nuts gone over edge, I ask, if you believed 
this initiative has merit and would be widely supported, why have you felt 
compelled to intentionally deceive to gather a sufficient number of signatures?

CAPRIATI'S FAULT: IN THE PUBLIC EYE; CELEBRITY: ONCE AGAIN, THE PUBLIC 
PILLORIES AN ICON WHO PROVES MERELY MORTAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GUCCIONE JR., Bob Guccione Jr. is editor and publisher of Spin magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 18-year-old Jennifer Capriati was arrested last month in a seedy Florida 
motel for marijuana possession, along with two companions accused of using 
crack and heroin, the mainstream media dubbed the tennis star a "grunge kid," 
part of an "ever-shifting group of grunge punks." That seemed to say it all, in 
that uniquely American media way of saying nothing: the sound bite reduced to 
the word-association bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Grunge -- as music, as fashion that never was, as nebulous and exaggerated 
culture -- is not the problem in Capriati's life. But it's a convenient cover 
for the real culprits. When Kurt Cobain killed himself, that gave grunge its 
evil patina. Now, if we don't like the way something turns out in the complex, 
difficult world of young people, we can sweep it under the grunge carpet. 
Instead of looking at Capriati as the Judy Garland of tennis, which is what she 
really is, we tag her a grunge casualty and, comfortable in our immunity, shake 
our heads and wag our fingers at her fall from idolhood and consider the matter 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain had his problems -- real and finally overwhelming demons -- but no one 
put the shotgun to his head. He took himself off the job. Capriati was mugged 
by her own people: her driving parents, coaches, managers and everybody making 
a buck (20 million bucks, actually) off of her. They beat the golden goose into 
a coma. From the press reports, it's glaringly obvious that all the signs of an 
emotional breakdown were there -- along with the hints of a drug problem. She's 
now in rehab, reportedly for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Where was the press when she began to look and act like a disturbed teen-ager? 
Even if the same reporters now sermonizing over America's fallen tennis 
sweetheart couldn't see her cracking under the strain, which they added to by 
covering her obsessively, why, after the fact, were they nosing through her 
record collection and marking down that she listened to Nirvana and Ice Cube? 
It's not just ignorance, although, hey, let's not underestimate that 
possibility; it's also a reflex of our culture to admonish the fallen 
charioteer racing at breakneck speeds for our amusement. Because Capriati's 
real sin, unspoken though it is, is not that she had a weekend binge with a 
bunch of other kids, but that she declined the prize of an ongoing opportunity 
to make incalculable wealth. Sports Illustrated lamented, "Now all that promise 
had gone to pieces," primarily meaning her gifted athletic future, but also 
Capriati as a business -- in any case, with absolutely no thought to the damage 
done to her as a person. At the end of the article, the writer listed all the 
lost endorsements with a gravity that intimated this was the real dimension of 
the tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
 We blame our cultural victims for what we perceive as the barbarism of 
repudiating the American Dream. But it is we who are barbaric, who drive 
18-year-olds to an emotional scrapheap so that we can dress our walls with 
larger-than-life super-heroes, collecting them like pieces of art, discarding 
broken ones like rubbish, forgetting, or maybe never even caring, that they are 
human.

TIME TO LAY DOWN THE TRADE WEAPON; CHINA: FLEXIBILITY IS NOT A WEAKNESS IN OUR 
NATIONAL LEADERS. PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIMMY CARTER, Jimmy Carter, U.S. President from 1977-1981, chairs the 
Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation at the Carter Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of us shared President Clinton's dilemma regarding trade with and human 
rights in the People's Republic of China; he was in a no-win position. His 
campaign promises were in direct conflict with a responsible reaction to 
important strategic factors. In my opinion, he made a correct and courageous 
choice to continue China's most-favored-nation status. 
</P>
<P>
 I first visited China as a young sub-marine officer, operating with Allied 
ships along the coast in the springtime of 1949, during the last few months 
that forces of Chiang Kai-shek controlled the major seaports. From the deck of 
our ship moored in the harbors of Shanghai and Tsingtao (now Qingdao), we could 
see the campfires of Mao Zedong's forces in the hills. I developed a lifetime 
interest in China. 
</P>
<P>
 As President, I inherited a dormant and timid U.S. policy based on the 
Shanghai communique of 1972 that acknowledged there was only one China but, 
because of the influence of Republican conservatives and the Taiwan lobby, 
failed to say which one. I initiated secret talks designed to normalize 
relations with China, which culminated in the announcement of mutual diplomatic 
recognition, effective on the first day of 1979. With China's tremendous 
influence in Asia and its immeasurable potential as a trade partner, I saw this 
decision as beneficial to our country and its policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving office, I have visited various parts of China, including Tibet, 
and have observed the remarkable opening of the society as far as free 
enterprise is concerned, with increased freedom for people to move from one 
place to another and to make economic decisions. I have had numerous 
discussions, mostly fruitless, with Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders 
about extending similar political rights. Their response has been that they 
also honor human rights, but with emphasis on the rights of every citizen to a 
home, employment, health care and an education. 
</P>
<P>
 China's leaders are not yet willing to accept the risks of political 
destabilization that became evident to them at the "democracy wall," where 
activists posted criticisms of the government, and at Tian An Men Square with 
the massive student demonstrations. The government's excessively harsh reaction 
was a tragic mistake that brought on continuing confrontation with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not inconsistent with my role as a human-rights advocate to believe that 
political freedoms will be encouraged best in China by maintaining harmonious 
relations between our countries. Perhaps contrary to the expectations of 
Chinese leaders, economic freedoms will lead inexorably to other personal 
liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that our President and Congress made the best effort 
possible to encourage human-rights progress in China through the threat of 
withholding favored trading status and other economic punishments. Since the 
United States seemed absolutely alone among nations in this threat, sustaining 
our position was becoming patently counterproductive. Furthermore, the public 
excoriation of China's leaders made it almost impossible for them to modify 
their policies. The Chinese are especially sensitive to the appearance of 
yielding to criticisms or threats from foreigners and despise intrusion in what 
they consider to be internal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was President, many foreign leaders reacted defensively when I 
criticized human-rights abuses of their citizens. But I insisted that their 
professed commitment to the United Nations charter, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and other agreements provided legitimacy to the discussion of 
these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 We Americans have not abandoned our determination to support human rights in 
China, including the protection of Tibetan customs and culture. As a private 
citizen, I have made efforts to consummate commitments made in 1978 by Chairman 
Deng Xiaoping to approve direct talks between Beijing leaders and the Dalai 
Lama, with the proviso that the independence of Tibet would not be on the 
agenda. So far, Tibetan and Chinese leaders have not accepted this proposal, 
but we must continue pursuing this and other human-rights goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps now, even more than 15 years ago, China's cooperation with us is 
crucial in addressing such strategic challenges as domestic conflicts in 
Cambodia and Burma and the impending development of a nuclear arsenal in North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who criticize President Clinton for modifying his position should 
remember that the ability to be flexible in dealing with changing circumstances 
and to abandon unworkable policies is not a weakness but an attribute of strong 
leadership.

'RACISM' MIGHT COME FROM RUDENESS OR IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest the First Person article by Elaine Tassy in the May 24 
Times in which she described what she felt was racist treatment she had 
received since she moved to the "frontier" of Orange County in January. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she describes "strange" experiences such as "some white Orange 
Countians reacting to black people with looks, body language, comments and 
actions (that my friends) felt were racist." She continued, "I heard about 
other black reporters who felt unwelcome or uncomfortable here and moved away 
because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who has lived in Orange County off and on since 1958, I feel 
qualified to respond to her comments. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the reactions she and her friends elicit in Orange County can be 
explained in five ways. 
</P>
<P>
 First, of course, some people down here are just plain racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise! There are racists in Orange County. Just as there are racists in 
every other spot on Earth that has been trampled by humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 So does it make sense to obsess on the 10% of the population who are racist or 
to make the best of our relations with the 90% who are not? 
</P>
<P>
 Second, I'm sure that some of the reactions she elicited (such as from a 
cafeteria worker who "asked if she could touch my hair and immediately reached 
to fondle my braids") are due not to racism per se but rather to old-fashioned 
ignorance and rudeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Tassy even describes as "rude" an incident when a chiropractor "picked up a 
braid and marveled, 'Ooh, did you do this yourself?' When I told her I did not 
want her to touch my hair, she said, disappointed, 'Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me? She went to a chiropractor for "an adjustment" on her body and then 
was disgusted when the chiropractor wanted to touch her hair and then 
complimented her on it? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course such behavior by others may be boorish and rude, but instead of 
reacting with an anger, why not take it as an opportunity to educate other 
people about the culture and heritage of African Americans?  
</P>
<P>
 I think a third possible reason for the reactions Tassy and her friends elicit 
is that the reactions are based more on the characteristics of the "reactor" 
than anything about the characteristics of the "reactee." 
</P>
<P>
 Let me give an example: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a particular store that I frequent that has four clerks who work at 
the cash registers at various times. I have learned by experience that three of 
these clerks are very friendly and helpful while one of them is always brusque 
and unhelpful. So I naturally try to avoid this grumpy clerk if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 What if I were a member of a minority group and I walked into this store for 
the first time without knowing anything about the personal characteristics of 
these four clerks? I'd have a one-in-four chance of being served by Mr. Grumpy. 
And if he treated me in an unhelpful way, I might assume, incorrectly, that I 
was being treated that way because of my being a member of a minority group 
rather than because of his own personality. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, some people treat us badly because they treat everyone badly, 
not because of anything they feel personally against us as individuals or 
members of a particular group. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible explanation for the way minorities are treated in the Big 
Orange is the old "fish out of water" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years I lived as a gaijin in Japan, a status that probably comes as 
close as anything to qualifying a white person to understand, at least to some 
extent, what an African American must experience in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 As a gaijin (literally, "person from the outside"), I had the daily experience 
of eliciting initial reactions from Japanese people that were based more on my 
appearance than on who I was as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese people would seem terrified if I tried to speak to them (even if 
I tried to speak to them in their own language) while others would approach me 
as though I was a free-English-language-lesson-giving machine. 
</P>
<P>
 And this treatment often enraged me. Why? Well, as Tassy explained: "Because 
such treatment makes me feel like an object, a mannequin or statue, rather than 
(like) someone with feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 And this brings me to the last reason. Minority group members in Orange County 
and the U.S. in general have become so used to anticipating a racist reaction 
in every encounter with a person who is outside their group that they bring 
great resentment and anger to every such meeting. And this negative attitude 
has the self-fulfilling result of eliciting a negative reaction from the other 
person, creating an evil but hopefully not unending cycle of mistrust, 
resentment and hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess what I'm saying is that we all aren't so bad down here. Just give us a 
chance to get to know you as an "individual with feelings." All that we ask is 
that you make an equal effort to do the same to us.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'SLICKERS II': SEARCH FOR SEQUEL GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "City Slickers," Billy Crystal's Mitch Robbins was instructed by his wife 
to join a cattle drive and "go and find your smile." Mitch did more than that: 
He bonded with everything in sight and delivered a calf. 
</P>
<P>
 So you have to wonder -- what could "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's 
Gold" do to top that earlier film's huggy buddy-buddy bathos? Will Mitch 
deliver twins this time? Will the film go sci-fi and have Jack Palance's Curly 
return from the dead to be delivered of a mewling infant? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so baroque, alas. With several years to ponder a way to honorably 
recycle "City Slickers," the filmmakers responsible for the sequel -- director 
Paul Weiland and scripters Crystal, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel -- have come 
up with a buried-treasure plot that would barely pass muster as an old Republic 
Pictures Western. The only things missing are the singing cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch, having located his smile, sets out to locate a cache of hidden gold 
outlined in an old treasure map he accidentally uncovers in the brim of Curly's 
hat. (He's been keeping the hat as a keepsake of his cattle-driver chum; he's 
also held onto the calf he delivered, now a full-grown steer.) Accompanying 
Mitch into the valleys and buttes are his depresso buddy Phil (Daniel Stern), a 
repeat offender from the first film, and his loafing black-sheep-of-the-family 
brother Glen (Jon Lovitz), who, at the drop of a Stetson, mimes scenes from 
"Godfather II." (Now there was a sequel.) Curly, inconveniently dead, is 
resurrected -- sort of -- in the person of his twin brother Duke (Palance), who 
is also on the gold trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The real gold chasers are the filmmakers, who keep pilfering moments from the 
first film to garland the sequel in order to repeat their success. There's 
something a bit unseemly about the way "City Slickers II" keeps fluffing our 
memories of "City Slickers," as if that film was some great classic worth 
recapping. It was far less than a classic -- a sitcom on the range with a heavy 
helping of midlife-crisis sensitivity jags. It turns out that all that 
bonding/birthing stuff, more than the jokes, was probably what made the film a 
smash. It played out the audience's desire to chuck their boring jobs and get 
up on a horse and yell, " Yee-Ha ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "City Slickers II" has its own variation on that film's squishiness. Mitch and 
his brother rediscover their love for each other, although Crystal in his 
"sincere" mode is enough to spook the cattle, and Lovitz on the level resembles 
nothing so much as his "Saturday Night Live" character The Liar. As if this 
weren't enough, Mitch and Phil rediscover their friendship, which is put to the 
test when Mitch is required to suck rattlesnake venom from Phil's posterior 
butte. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the comedy is on this level, which makes you long -- well, almost -- 
for a few more midlife mouthings from the first film. With most of the film 
taken up with these city dudes, "City Slickers II" has a skimpy, arid feeling, 
despite the Utah vistas. Only Palance returns with a flourish. He's as gnarled 
and critter-like as ever, and he gives his dumbest lines an orotund looniness 
that makes them hang in the air. Palance would be great playing Long John 
Silver in a newfangled "Treasure Island." He's a tall tale in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 What "City Slickers II" is really all about is movie stars play-acting 
cowboys. It's a boy's fantasy we're asked not so much to applaud as anoint. The 
first film roused a few laughs by showing how inept its city boys were on the 
range, but narcissism seems to have kicked in for the sequel. Crystal, who also 
produced the film, likes the way he looks on a horse. He likes the way he gazes 
steely-eyed at the horizon. He can be a highly inventive comic actor but, as 
long as he's being bathetic and legendary, is it OK if we don't come out to 
play? 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'SPEED': A WILD RIDE TO THE END OF THE LINE; NOTHING THIS FILM 
PUTS ON SCREEN HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE, BUT DIRECTOR JAN DE BONT AND COMPANY 
MANAGE TO MAKE IT FEEL FRESH AND EXCITING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Action directing is a put-up-or-shut-up game, a skill that can't be faked or 
finessed; even a 10-year-old can tell if you've got it or not. And on the 
evidence of the invigorating "Speed," Jan De Bont has definitely got it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this story of a mad bomber versus the LAPD's stalwart SWAT team is De 
Bont's first film as a director, he has not exactly come out of nowhere. A 
cinematographer for more than 30 years, De Bont has worked frequently with 
fellow Dutchman Paul Verhoeven and has been behind the camera on such big-time 
action pictures as "Die Hard," "The Hunt for Red October," "Black Rain" and 
"Lethal Weapon 3." 
</P>
<P>
 De Bont's newness does show in the pro forma nature of some of the 
characterizations as well as the film's uninspired dialogue and overall 
derivativeness. But "Speed" moves too fast for any of that to matter much, and 
where pure action is concerned, De Bont and his team have turned in a visually 
sophisticated piece of mayhem that makes the implausible plausible and keeps 
the thrills coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Making "Speed" involving is the premise of Graham Yost's script, which does a 
neat twist off the traditional action premise of coping with machines that are 
going too fast. Here the problem is not, as might be expected, restraining a 
runaway bus on a crowded freeway, but just the opposite: making sure it doesn't 
even come close to slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the diabolical madman (a smooth Dennis Hopper) that no action film can 
exist without has rigged up a deadly explosive device that will detonate if the 
bus is allowed to go under 50 m.p.h. Quite a dilemma for leap-before-you-look 
hero Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his SWAT team pals. 
</P>
<P>
 Centering action on familiar items like one of Santa Monica's friendly Big 
Blue Buses and its load of drab citizens (plus Sandra Bullock as the inevitable 
attractive and available woman) is a proven way to make tension personal to an 
audience. And screenwriter Yost has helped things out by coming up with a 
surprising variety of problems that can bedevil an ungainly vehicle attempting 
to keep up speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with director of photography Andrzej Bartkowiak, editor John Wright 
and veteran stunt coordinator Gary Hymes, De Bont has taken great pains to make 
these crises exciting on screen. For the bus sequences, for instance, he had 10 
identical vehicles on call and routinely used four to six cameras to film them, 
moving up to as many as a dozen when recording the most challenging stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this work would have mattered, of course, if De Bont didn't also have 
an understanding of the mechanics of on-screen movement and a fine sense of the 
visual possibilities action presents. Nothing "Speed" puts on screen, from 
fiery explosions to mayhem on the freeway, hasn't been done many times before, 
but De Bont and company manage to make it feel fresh and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 De Bont's talent is visible not only in the bus sequences but also in 
"Speed's" nervy opening sequences involving a bomb in an elevator, shot in a 
specially constructed fully operational five-story shaft. It's here that we 
first meet the forceful Jack Traven,his slightly saner partner Harry Temple 
(Jeff Daniels) and Capt. McMahon (Joe Morton), their no-nonsense superior. 
</P>
<P>
 With a brush-cut hairdo and an intense game face that is anything but 
Buddha-like, Reeves not only gives "Speed's" strongest performance, his 
unexpected intensity is crucial in giving the film its drive. Playing Traven 
with an appropriate edge of take-charge surliness, Reeves is surprisingly 
believable as a barely human law enforcement machine that even his pals view as 
"deeply nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves' co-stars, however, haven't been given very much to work with in the 
way of dialogue or directorial help in building character. As a result, "Speed" 
has a ways to go before it can equal what "The Fugitive" and "In the Line of 
Fire" accomplished in matching drama to action. 
</P>
<P>
 But if no one is going to leave theaters raving about acting and 
characterization, it will probably matter little. Tension and release is the 
name of "Speed's" particular game, and so far this summer no film has played it 
so well. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for violence and language. Times guidelines: It includes 
extreme tension, frequent explosions and crashes and an especially violent 
ending.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'WOLVES' DANCES AGAIN AT GREATER LENGTH; SPECIAL FOUR-HOUR 
EDITION OF KEVIN COSTNER'S FILM ALSO INCLUDES A BEHIND-THE-SCENES DOCUMENTARY 
AND BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought there was no more footage of the 1990 Oscar winner 
"Dances With Wolves," here comes director-star Kevin Costner with more. 
</P>
<P>
 He's now assembling a new four-hour edit of the Western that earned him a best 
director Oscar. It's due from Orion on Aug. 31 at $80 on two tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently this movie is such a favorite with fans that they don't mind 
watching various versions. First there was the original three-hour movie and 
then came the ABC-TV miniseries, which included about 50 minutes of added 
footage. But Costner is adding even more, about 10 minutes that supposedly 
further illuminates the action and fills in gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest version, called the "Limited Collector's Edition," also includes a 
22-minute, behind-the-scenes, never-before-released video, "The Making of 
Dances With Wolves," and a book, "Dances With Wolves: The Illustrated Story of 
the Epic Film."  
</P>
<P>
 The package is definitely aimed at collectors and film buffs because it 
features a widescreen version of the movie. Much of the mass audience doesn't 
like widescreen because the picture, while in the original theatrical aspect 
ratio, looks so tiny on a 20-inch (or smaller) TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
 There'll be a laser version too, on Image Entertainment, coming out at about 
the same time, priced at $125, also including a CD of the soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Orion Video is calling this the final edit -- but with Costner you never know. 
Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 Packed with illuminating footage, "Israel: A Nation Is Born" is a 
comprehensive documentary examining that country's formation just after World 
War II and includes highlights up through last year's Palestinian peace pact 
with Palestine. Five hours on five tapes, from SISU at $149, (800) 223-7478. . 
. . HBO's "Schindler," a fine English documentary about the hero of the movie 
"Schindler's List," is due out June 29 -- but only as a rental. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS-Fox is already preparing a video of the NBA championship series now in 
progress between the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets. Priced at $20, it 
will be rush-released for July 19, about a month after the series ends. . . . 
If you're looking for a simple video that explains how to protect your back 
from undue stress in everyday situations, try "It's Your Back: Volume 1" from 
Family Experiences Productions, a half-hour tape priced at $25, (512) 338-1318. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of Jackie Onassis videos continues. CBS Video will have one in the 
stores Wednesday, "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Remembered," priced at $15. In 
addition to original material, this CBS News package includes some interesting 
'60s TV footage of a tour of the White House and a TV interview with her and 
John Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Music Videos 
</P>
<P>
 "New Order Story," an hour video on Warner-Reprise at $20, following the band 
from its Joy Division roots to the present, with music clips and assorted 
interview footage. One of the year's better music videos and a must for New 
Order fans. . . . Though best known as Carrie Fisher's dad, Eddie Fisher was a 
major-league crooner in the 1950s. A video showcasing his talents, "Eddie 
Fisher: A Singing Legend," is due June 22 on A*Vision Entertainment at $20. . . 
. "Toni Braxton: The Hit Video Collection" is just out, including interviews 
and vidclips from the pop-soul singer's first album. On Arista at $13. . . . 
The No. 1 selling video, according to the Billboard chart, is Ray Stevens' 
"Live" (Curb, $17). 
</P>
<P>
 What's New 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne's World 2" (Paramount). Spoofing brainless heavy-metal heads, the 
original had some hilarious bits and infused some catch phrases into the pop 
lingo. In a plot too thin to mention, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana 
Carvey) return in a sequel that isn't as clever or funny as the original. But 
if you're a fan of the first one, there's enough good low-brow humor in the 
sequel to make it a worthwhile rental. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Life" (Columbia TriStar). A successful executive (Michael Keaton) with a 
pregnant wife (Nicole Kidman) finds out he has terminal cancer and sets out to 
shoot a video of his life so his unborn son will know something about him. Very 
grim, packing an emotional wallop in places but sinking to TV-movie 
sentimentality in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The War Room" (Vidmark). An absorbing, behind-the-scenes documentary about 
Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. What makes it so fascinating is the 
rampaging charisma of its dominant figure -- campaign manager James Carville, a 
high-spirited, likable oddball. Assembled by D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, 
it's one of last year's best documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex Is . . ." (Water Bearer, $40, 800-551-8304). To get a good sense of the 
impact of AIDS on gay men and what it's like being gay these days, check out 
this melancholy, no-holds-barred, often jolting documentary. Featuring 
interviews with men of various ages, ethnic groups and walks of life, it ranks 
with the finest films about the gay lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ghost in the Machine" (Fox-Video). It's a great idea -- a high-tech villain 
creeping into electronic circuitry and attacking a victim (Karen Allen) by 
turning innocent home appliances into death machines. But the story is so full 
of holes it's hard to take it seriously. Still, the special effects are great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deception" (LIVE). Don't be deceived by the glamorous stars -- Andie 
MacDowell and Liam Neeson -- of this international adventure. It's not a very 
good movie. MacDowell plays a wife tracking a missing husband with the help of 
an organizer of hunger-relief efforts. Beautiful scenery but a snail's pace and 
little excitement. FILMS ON VIDEO 
</P>
<P>
 Recent films coming out on video: Warner has moved the release date of "The 
Pelican Brief," starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, from June 29 to 
Wednesday. Also coming out: "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" (Tuesday); "The

RANGERS CAN'T CLOSE SHOW ON BROADWAY; HOCKEY: CANUCKS PULL AWAY IN A WILD THIRD 
PERIOD, 6-3, AND CUT NEW YORK'S ADVANTAGE TO 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vancouver Canucks weren't ready to give up the ghost, and the ghosts 
responsible for 54 years of New York Ranger failures weren't ready to give up 
their hex on the 1994 team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers lost a chance to close out the Stanley Cup finals in five games 
when they collapsed in the third period Thursday night, giving up five goals in 
a 6-3 loss before 18,200 disappointed fans at Madison Square Garden. Some fans, 
eager to see the Rangers win their first Cup since 1940 -- and win at home for 
the first time -- paid up to $2,000 for the privilege of watching the Rangers 
bumble through their worst defensive effort of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had something to do with looking to the future as opposed to staying in 
the present," Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said of his team's failure to live up to 
newspaper headlines that proclaimed, "The Cup Stops Here" and "Tonight's the 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rangers pulled even at 3-3 when Mark Messier converted a clever 
back pass from Glenn Anderson with 10:58 to play, they wilted under a 
persistent Vancouver attack. Depleted by the first-period ejection of 
defenseman Jeff Beukeboom, the Rangers couldn't push the Canucks off rebounds 
or keep them from going to the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Babych put Vancouver ahead to stay with 10:29 to play, when Ranger goalie 
Mike Richter couldn't slide to his right fast enough to stop the shot from the 
right faceoff dot. The Canucks added two more goals within a 44-second span in 
the wild final period to send the series back to Vancouver for Game 6 Saturday 
at the Pacific Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of being overzealous and trying to hit the knockout punch," 
Keenan said of his team's surge and backslide. "We swung and missed and 
somebody TKOd us in the meantime." 
</P>
<P>
 A seventh game, if necessary, would be played Tuesday in New York. The 1942 
Toronto Maple Leafs are the only team that has rallied from a 3-1 deficit in 
the finals, but the Canucks did overcome a 3-1 Calgary lead in their 
first-round series this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the momentum is in our favor, no doubt about it," goaltender Kirk 
McLean said. "We contained their big guys, Messier, (Brian) Leetch, (Sergei) 
Zubov and (Alexei) Kovalev and we were getting everybody back defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only natural that their fans were expecting to win it tonight. It's a 
good feeling for us, but we know we haven't accomplished anything yet.' 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pavel Bure, who scored twice and set up Babych's game-winner: "The 
pressure was on those guys because they wanted to win the Cup at home. It was 
our game plan to get the rebounds tonight, because we've got the size." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, in part, because of Beukeboom's early exit. He was ejected at 10:06 
of the first period after jumping into a scrap that followed an apparent Ranger 
goal by Esa Tikkanen. The goal was disallowed because linesman Randy Mitton 
thought Stephane Matteau was offside on the right wing and had blown his 
whistle to stop play. Replays indicated Matteau's foot was on the blue line, 
but offside calls are not reviewable under NHL rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "That might have hurt," Vancouver center Cliff Ronning said of Beukeboom's 
loss. "He's a big, strong kind of guy. He's tough to get by." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks scored the game's first goal at 8:10 of the second period, when 
Ronning slid a pass behind his back to defenseman Jeff Brown for a shot from 
the top of the right circle. Geoff Courtnall, who had not recorded a point in 
the first four games, scored the first of his two goals Thursday on a second 
effort 26 seconds into the third period for a 2-0 lead. Bure made it 3-0 at 
2:48 on a shot from the point that deflected off Leetch's skate. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans, who roared throughout the first period and fell silent in the third 
period, came to life when the Rangers rallied. Doug Lidster, Steve Larmer and 
Messier scored within 5:35 to tie it, but Babych scored 29 seconds later and 
the Canucks pulled away again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third period was free-lancing," Tikkanen said. "That was open-ice 
skating. We let them play their style and we can't do that. We have to keep 
hitting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ranger General Manager Neil Smith: "Being at home in front of our fans 
created some pressure. I noticed statistically, a lot of teams win 
championships on the road, especially in the NHL. Before last year, the last 
team to win at home was Edmonton in 1988. I wouldn't be real concerned. I 
certainly would rather be where we are than where Vancouver is." 
</P>
<P>
 He has other things to be concerned about, such as persistent reports Keenan 
will depart for a coach/general manager job in Detroit. Keenan didn't deny 
having spoken to the Red Wings, fueling further guessing as to his future. 
Smith said he didn't know what was happening but said Keenan does not have an 
escape clause in his five-year Ranger contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of speculation and I haven't spent any time thinking about it," 
Keenan said of the rumors. "These things happen in the game and you understand 
that they do happen. But certainly my focus right now is to concentrate on this 
team winning the Stanley Cup. I haven't even thought that much about it." 
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks' five-goal third period tied a final series record for most goals 
by one team in one period. The teams' eight goals tied another final series 
record. . . . Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn successfully jump-started his offense 
by breaking up the high-scoring Greg Adams-Trevor Linden-Pavel Bure line. He 
inserted Murray Craven as their center and put Linden on right wing with Geoff 
Courtnall and Nathan LaFayette.

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN IT COMES TO SPORTS, WOMEN HAVE WRITE STUFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 So, read any good books lately? I have -- four of them. The good news is, not 
one of them includes a ballad by Robert James Waller. 
</P>
<P>
 None of them involves Oprah Winfrey's lunch.  
</P>
<P>
 None of them is "AA is for Aardvark," which will be Sue Grafton's 27th novel. 
</P>
<P>
 None of them is Michael Crichton's new project about a sexually harassed 
dinosaur. And none of them is on Rush Limbaugh's shelf beside books by Rush 
Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming soon to your local "Sports" aisle: 
</P>
<P>
 "A Kind of Grace: A Treasury of Sportswriting by Women," edited by Ron 
Rapoport. (Zenobia Press, $14.95). 
</P>
<P>
 This edition of Femi-Tough is brought to you by Ron Rapoport, who is, even he 
cannot deny, a guy. Yet Ron recognizes, as do I, that women simply cannot write 
as well about sports as men can. 
</P>
<P>
 They write better. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence exists to support this theory. Much of it can be found in this fine 
anthology, a cornucopia of women writing on women, on men vs. women, on men vs. 
men, on a variety of subjects from Lyle Alzado to Zola Budd. 
</P>
<P>
 Jocks galore, from 66 of the top women in the trade.

 Some of these stories come from a woman's specific perspective: Betty 
Cuniberti writing about Heather Farr's breast cancer, having fought this battle 
herself; Sonja Steptoe viewing the arguments and verdict of the Mike Tyson rape 
case, from a woman's vantage point as well as a journalist's; J.E. Vader 
eyeballing the swimsuits of Sports Illustrated, after being exposed to the 
hidden motives of the magazine's men with whom she once worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapoport, who writes insightful (for a man) columns for the Daily News of Los 
Angeles, came to this not-so-sudden realization: "The changes they have brought 
to the sports pages often reflect experiences and perceptions men cannot 
share." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, women deliver the plain old, everyday who, what, when, where, why 
and by how much. My own newspaper, for example, presently employs three 
full-time professional hockey writers -- all of them women. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust me, they don't get to cover much women's hockey.

 My new friend Kristine from Newport Beach wants to become a sportswriter. 
Kristine is 13. She sent me a recent interview she did with goalie Robb Stauber 
of the Kings. The way I figure, around the year 2004, my friend Kristine will 
be covering the Kings for the L.A. Times.

 Ah, but not brother Tom and brother Dave. The good news is, they did go too

 "Strike Zone," by Jim Bouton and Eliot Asinof. (Viking, $21.95).

 What a keystone combo. Bouton and Asinof, whose most famous works each dealt 
with scandalous baseball, have co-written a novel about a goofy Chicago Cub 
pitcher (this could be redundant) and a crooked umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouton continues to do it all. He pitched in a World Series, wrote the 
best-selling "Ball Four," played a louse in a Robert Altman film, dabbled in 
shredded bubblegum and vanity trading cards -- in short, did everything I could 
have expected from somebody who went to my high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Asinof authored "Eight Men Out," the definitive look at the 1919 "Black Sox" 
scandal. Shoeless Joe Jackson would have enjoyed this new book, if only he'd 
known how to read.

STRUGGLING FINLEY CLUELESS AS ANGELS COLLAPSE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have no answers. Really, they've run out of clues. All they know is 
that this shouldn't be happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Finley, considered one of the finest left-handed starters in baseball 
and coveted by virtually every contender, should not be losing games. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it can be explained by bad luck. Some by bad defense. And some by bad 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley wasn't sure which was most responsible for his demise in the Angels' 
7-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Thursday night before 20,963 at Anaheim 
Stadium, but he's getting tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Here he is, the man who's supposed to carry the pitching staff, and he has won 
only four games this season. Finley, 4-5 with a 4.61 earned-run average, has 
the same amount of victories as Tiger reliever Joe Boever (4-0), the winning 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disturbing is that the Angels (25-35) are 4-9 in his 13 starts in a 
season quickly fading away. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the year that the Angels believed they could win the American League 
West title, particularly given the dismal play of their peers, but they 
suddenly find themselves a season-high 5 1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't watch Texas or Seattle, or Oakland for that matter," Finley said. 
"We have to get ourselves straightened out. We've got our own problems here and 
we're not playing very well right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had opportunities to score with runners on second and third and less 
than two out. . . . The pitching has been up and down. We're just not playing 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Said third baseman Spike Owen: "It's frustrating to know the situation we're 
in, because of the opportunity we have to win the division. We just have to 
play better baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels need someone to start rolling off victories. Finley figured he 
would be the man, particularly after winning four consecutive starts May 8-24, 
but he hasn't won since. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley's troubles this night actually occurred swiftly, and really, without 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels built a 4-2 lead through six innings, and Finley was breezing 
along. The only mistake he made after the first inning was yielding a solo 
homer to former teammate Junior Felix in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley opened the seventh inning by inducing Cecil Fielder into a weak ground 
ball. Well-aware of Fielder's power, Finley took a deep breath, and perhaps 
subconsciously, momentarily relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Trammell hit a single to left field. Mickey Tettleton followed with a 
broken-bat single to left. No problem, Finley felt as if he was in complete 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no reason for him to worry, he said, until Felix singled to left, 
loading the bases. That brought pitching coach Chuck Hernandez to the mound, 
who told Finley to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, pitching to Juan Samuel, Finley threw a wild pitch that bounced in 
front of the plate and hopped onto the backstop, scoring Trammell. Samuel hit 
the next pitch just inside the third-base line for a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, the Tigers were winning, 5-4, and Finley was wondering how 
everything could go wrong so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I pretty much had the game in hand," said Finley, who gave up 
eight hits and six earned runs in eight innings. "But that one inning, I left a 
pitch up to Felix, and the one that Samuel hit, he kind of rolled over it and 
put it down the line. It all came down to those two at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, who have scored at least seven runs in six of their last nine 
games, compounded the Angels' misery when Travis Fryman hit a solo homer in the 
eighth off Finley, and Samuel hit a run-scoring single off reliever John Dopson 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels tried to rally off closer Mike Henneman in the ninth. Owen and Chad 
Curtis drew one-out walks. Tim Salmon then hit a sinking line drive to left. It 
appeared that it would score one run, and at the least, load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony Phillips dived to his right and snared the ball just before it hit 
the ground. Henneman then struck out Chili Davis, ending the game.

 Bernie Lincicome of the Chicago Tribune writes that he isn't emotionally 
involved with the World Cup: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no use. I can't hate Switzerland. Or Romania or Colombia. Though France, 
now that's another matter. Too bad France isn't in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could do my patriotic duty easily if the U.S. soccer team were opening 
against France. I could get me some of that Cup fever for France. But I'm 
completely neutral on Switzerland."

a shaved head is the current NBA style.

 Terminal: Vernon (Mad Max) Maxwell of the Houston Rockets, commenting on his 
on-court behavior to USA Today:  
</P>

 "People think I'm crazy, wild, a lunatic. And sometimes I am. It's because of 
the T's (technical fouls) and the way I carry myself on the floor. I've been

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: SOCCER'S CANTOR DIDN'T MAKE THIS A ' GOOOOOOAALLLLL! 
' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if you don't follow soccer, you've probably heard the Spanish language 
announcer who yells, "Gooooooaalllll!" whenever a goal is scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The man behind the voice is a native of Argentina named Andres Cantor. He is 
well known among viewers of Miami-based Univision, the Spanish language 
network, for which he has worked since 1987. But to most English-speaking 
viewers, he is simply that guy who screams, "Gooooooaalllll!" 
</P>
<P>
 We reached Cantor by phone in Miami the other day, not knowing quite what to 
expect. He figured to be a bombastic, hyperactive, fast-talking sort -- 
soccer's version of Dick Vitale. 
</P>
<P>
 He was anything but. Cantor, 31 and the father of a 7-month-old son, was 
soft-spoken and polite. If anything, he was reserved, even a bit understated. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his "Gooooooaalllll!" call isn't really a trademark, and not even 
unique. That's the style of the announcers he listened to as a youngster in 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantor seemed a little uneasy talking about himself, but we learned that he 
lived in Southern California for 12 years before moving to Miami 3 1/2 years 
ago because his job took him there. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from San Marino High, where another Los Angeles announcer, KABC 
radio's Jorge Jarrin, son of Jaime, preceded him by a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Cantor studied journalism at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, David, and mother, Alicia, still live in San Marino. His father is 
a doctor, his mother a psychologist. David Cantor is the head of 
gastroenterology at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. Alicia Cantor has 
a private practice in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Cantor had hoped that his two sons, Andres and Gerardo, 27, would become 
doctors. Now both work in television -- Gerardo directs commercials -- but Dad 
isn't complaining. "I am very proud of both of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres fell in love with soccer after his father took him to a game at the age 
of 4 in Buenos Aires, where the Cantor family lived. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cantor came to the United States in the mid-1970s, teaching at UC Davis 
for a year before taking the job at Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres was 16 and entering his senior year of high school when the family 
settled in San Marino. At the time, Cantor's goal, if you'll pardon the 
expression, was to become a print journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 He was soon on his way. At 16, he landed a job with Editorial Atlantida, an 
Argentine magazine publishing company, as a soccer correspondent. At 19, he was 
assigned to cover the 1982 World Cup in Spain. He also covered the 1986 World 
Cup in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 His first broadcasting job was filing radio reports for an Argentine network 
during the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, and he was retained as a 
correspondent. But writing continued to be his main occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his lack of broadcasting experience, friends recommended that he try 
for a job at Univision in February of 1987. Formerly the Spanish International 
Network, Univision had new ownership and was undergoing a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantor went to the network studios in Laguna Niguel for an audition, which 
consisted of announcing two taped soccer matches, the first as a commentator, 
the second as a play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 He had never worked a soccer match in either capacity, and doesn't remember 
much about the audition. But he must have done something right. He got the job, 
which not only calls for soccer announcing but also anchoring daily sports 
newscasts and a three-hour Sunday show, "Domingo Deportivo." 
</P>
<P>
 "Announcing soccer is a small part of my job," he said. "I work six, seven 
days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, he worked in Laguna Niguel. That's where he and partner 
Norberto Longo called the 1990 World Cup -- which was being played in Italy. 
They worked the games off a monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been impossible to announce all 52 games had we gone to Italy," 
Cantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January of 1991, Univision consolidated its studios in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flew to Miami the day the Persian Gulf War started (on Jan. 17, 1991)," he 
said. "I got on the plane not knowing if we would be at war when we landed. We 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Because this World Cup is in the United States, the Univision team of Cantor, 
Longo (a 50-year-old fellow Argentine) and Jessi Losada, a onetime 
Spanish-language announcer for the Rams who has been added to the World Cup 
crew, actually get to attend two games. They will be at the opener between 
Germany and Bolivia next Friday in Chicago and the championship game July 17 at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 They will call the rest from the Univision studio in Miami, with millions 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup might not draw viewers to American television, but it's a boon 
for Spanish television. An estimated 40% of the audience doesn't even speak 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 These soccer fans watch the World Cup on Univision out of loyalty, since the 
Spanish-language network has been bringing them World Cup games since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 And they watch Univision because they prefer the Spanish coverage, even if 
they can't understand the commentary. Among other things, they complain that 
American coverage is aimed at those uneducated in the nuances of the sport and 
this insults their intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Arbitron figures, Channel 34, the L.A. Univision outlet, averaged 
118,000 households during the first round of the 1990 World Cup. TNT averaged 
42,000 L.A. households. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship game on Univision got a 10 rating in all households and a 33 
share. (The share in Hispanic households was an 87.) TNT got a 3 rating and a 
10 share. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Univision's viewers don't understand Spanish, but there's no mistaking 
Cantor's "Gooooooaalllll!"

 "Sometimes she would say, 'I don't want to practice this week.' But I would 
insist that she prepare for the next tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she was 15, I shouldn't have made her play all those exhibitions, but I 
didn't know how good she was and wanted to see how she did against stronger 
players. Maybe I made a mistake."

Martinez, who was pitching like another, in a 9-0 rout in which Gooden (2-2) 
was removed after facing three batters in the fifth inning. He gave up six runs 
and six hits while striking out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have to build my arm strength and get better command of my pitches," 
Gooden said. "No way do I consider this a setback." 
</P>
<P>
 His chief tormentor was Moises Alou, who had four hits in five at-bats, 
including two homers, and drove in five runs for the second time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's counterpart, Pedro Martinez (5-3), yielded only three hits in his 
first major league shutout and complete game. Martinez struck out nine and 
walked one in winning his fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed in the game in the late innings, in part because Manager Felipe Alou 
has been reading the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew his brother (Ramon) had pitched a shutout for the Dodgers two nights 
ago and that they keep in touch with each other constantly, so I let him go," 
Felipe Alou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard Felipe talk to Joe (Kerrigan, the Expo pitching coach) in the seventh 
inning, and I figured that I might come out. But the bullpen has been used 
recently and needed a rest," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was special for me, since this was my first shutout and first complete 
game. Yes, I talk to Ramon very much but we usually discuss family problems and 
not our pitching. The next time, I will talk about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, St. Louis 2 -- The Phillies spotted the Cardinals a 2-0 lead 
in the top of the first inning, then scored five runs in the bottom half, 
including homers by Ricky Jordan and Jim Eisenreich. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth victory in a row for the Phillies (30-30), who reached .500 
for the first time since April 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Munoz (1-2) recovered from a poor start and lasted six innings, giving 
up two runs and three hits in his first National League victory. Paul Quantrill 
pitched the final three innings for his first NL save. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, Colorado 1 -- Jose Rijo won his third game in a row and the Reds 
took advantage of an error in the first inning to win at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 A misplay by center fielder Mike Kingery and left fielder Howard Johnson -- 
Colorado's first error in four games -- set up a four-run first inning that 
kept the Rockies winless in eight games at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo (5-3) scattered four hits over seven innings -- two each by Kingery and 
Dante Bichette -- and struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati led, 1-0, when Tony Fernandez hit a fly ball to left center for 
what should have been the third out. But Kingery cut in front of Johnson at the 
last second, distracting him so that the ball went off his glove for an error. 
Two runs scored on the play, and Bret Boone followed with a run-scoring single 
that made it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, Florida 1 -- Orlando Merced broke out of a slump with a two-run 
double and Zane Smith and two relievers worked out of a succession of jams at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (6-5) gave up nine hits in 6 2/3 innings and allowed at least two 
runners to reach in five different innings, but got out of trouble in all but 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miceli retired four hitters in relief of Smith before Alejandro Pena, out 
for more than a year after elbow surgery, pitched the ninth inning for his 
first save since August 17, 1992, when he was with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times I didn't know if I would get another save," Pena said. "It's 
good to be back. It makes me feel good to be able to come back and do it again 
and survive in the big leagues and be a pitcher again. It's nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin starter Charlie Hough (4-4) got the first two batters in the third 
inning before walking Andy Van Slyke and Brian Hunter. Merced, in a one-for-17 
slump, doubled to score both runners.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; FINALLY, THE WEST HAS A LEADER THAT'S WORTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since April, the rap on the American League West has been that its leader had 
a sub-.500 record. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. The West's bid for legitimacy in baseball's realignment has been 
bolstered by the Texas Rangers, who have won nine of their last 11 games, 
including a 7-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Thursday night at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers (29-28) went over the .500 mark for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals had won three of their last four and had a five-game road winning 
streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers won his sixth in a row and Juan Gonzalez broke a 26-game 
homerless streak, with his seventh, for the Rangers, who have won three in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Esteban Beltre led off the third with a single against Mark Gubicza (4-5), 
stole second and scored on Doug Strange's double. Jose Canseco's bloop single 
scored Strange, making it 3-0, and Canseco scored on Gonzalez's single. Rusty 
Greer's groundout gave the Rangers a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas made it 6-0 in the fourth on Strange's run-scoring single and 7-0 in the 
sixth on Beltre's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers (8-3) yielded eight hits and two runs in eight innings. He is 8-1 in 
his last 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to win when you have the run support," Rogers said. "It always 
helps getting seven or eight runs a game when you're on the mound. I know our 
offense can get runs. When you get a big lead, you're able to get guys out 
without having my best stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, the two-time defending major league home run champion, had a solo 
homer in the second inning. It was his first since May 4, ending a homerless 
streak of 99 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know," he said of the possibility of a third consecutive AL home 
run crown. "I could be hitting 50 in one month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling more comfortable and being more patient. There's still a little 
pressure. I'm still working hard. I'm looking for a hot month." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, New York 5 -- While the West goes up, the East goes down, including 
the division-leading Yankees, who have lost three in a row and nine of their 
last 11. They are 1-7 in June, including four one-run losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter helped the Blue Jays stop the Yankees in Toronto with three RBIs, 
which increased his league-leading total to 62. Woody Williams pitched five 
innings of scoreless relief for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (1-1) relieved in the second after starter Juan Guzman left because 
of a sore right shoulder. Williams immediately loaded the bases on a single and 
two walks but struck out Mike Gallego and got Pat Kelly on a grounder to second 
to preserve Toronto's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 8, Chicago 4 -- Kirby Puckett had two home runs, a double and four 
RBIs at Minneapolis in a game that had eight runs, 13 hits and three lead 
changes in the first two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Leius of the Twins, who hit only eight home runs in his first three 
seasons, hit his ninth of the season in the second inning off Scott Sanderson 
(4-1), tying the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett had solo homers, his eighth and ninth of the year, in the fifth and 
seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
 His four RBIs give him 59 in 55 games, 50 in his last 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett had been in a mini-slump with only seven hits in 35 at-bats during the 
five previous games. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 4, Cleveland 3 -- Jose Valentin's bases-loaded single capped a 
ninth-inning rally at Milwaukee and denied Jack Morris his 250th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland led, 3-2, entering the ninth, but Dave Nilsson drew a one-out walk 
and Brian Harper doubled off Paul Shuey (0-1). John Jaha was walked 
intentionally to load the bases. Derek Lilliquist relieved and walked Matt 
Mieske to forced in the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin followed with soft liner to left field that ended the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ignasiak (2-1) got the victory with two innings of relief, striking out 
four and walking none. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, the winningest active pitcher in the major leagues, gave up six hits 
in seven innings, walked one and struck out seven.

TABASCO CAT LOOKS TO STOP THIS STREAK; BELMONT: HE GETS ANOTHER CHANCE TO BEAT 
BROCCO AFTER LOSING THEIR FIRST THREE MEETINGS BY A COMBINED 11 LENGTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they first met, in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita last 
November, Brocco won by five lengths. Tabasco Cat was third, 6 1/2 lengths 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 When they met again in April in the Santa Anita Derby, Brocco won, beating 
Tabasco Cat by three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last month, in the Kentucky Derby, Brocco overcame a terrible start to 
finish fourth, with Tabasco Cat two positions and 3 3/4 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
 So in three meetings, Brocco has outfinished Tabasco Cat every time, 
establishing his superiority by a combined 11 lengths. But on Preakness day at 
Pimlico three weeks ago, while Tabasco Cat was winning by three-quarters of a 
length, Brocco was 200 miles to the north, taking an easy gallop around Belmont 
Park in preparation for Saturday's 126th running of the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it hurts a little," said Brocco's trainer, Randy Winick, who is 
campaigning the most important horse of a 20-year career. "We've beaten Tabasco 
Cat three times, and he wins the Preakness and we don't. But I'm not going to 
cry about it. I've made a judgment call, about skipping the Preakness, and I'm 
still not second-guessing myself. But I'll feel a lot better if we win at least 
one Triple Crown race." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Triple Crown sweep no longer possible after the Kentucky Derby, the 
44-year-old Winick turned to his next goal for Brocco, November's $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens Saturday, Brocco will get a rest. His next race will be 
in August, against 3-year-olds in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga or against 
older horses in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar. Winick will probably use the 
Super Derby, at Louisiana Downs in October, as a prep for the Breeders' Cup 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the feeling that the Breeders' Cup is going to be won by a 
3-year-old," Winick said. "I'm not that impressed by the older horses this 
year. Look at what Holy Bull did to them in the Metropolitan Mile here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wait! Wait! Wait!  
</P>
<P>
 This was Gary Stevens, Brocco's jockey, yelling to a Churchill Downs assistant 
starter while his colt gawked around in the gate a few seconds before the start 
of the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Stevens' pleas, Tom Wagoner, a starter with a quick-on-the-trigger 
reputation, pressed his button and sent the 14 horses on their way, about half 
of them in various forms of distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if they had waited a second or two, we would have been all right," 
Winick said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the No. 10 stall, Brocco was one of the last horses to be loaded. Ulises, a 
horse on the inside, was reluctant to enter his stall and gave the assistant 
starters a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse was standing well at first," Winick said. "But then there was a 
delay and he started looking around. He broke flat-footed. We were supposed to 
be fourth or fifth early. Instead we were ninth, 10 to 12 lengths behind. He 
had to be used quite a bit to catch up. His run stopped at the quarter pole. He 
didn't collapse, but he just wasn't able to sustain his drive." 
</P>
<P>
 For Holy Bull, the favorite, the Derby was even worse. He was squeezed leaving 
the gate, never recovered and wound up 12th. Trainer Jimmy Croll ruled out the 
Preakness and ran Holy Bull in the Metropolitan, which produced a 5 1/2-length 
victory in a solid mile time of 1:33 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll considered the Belmont for a couple of days, then told disappointed 
Belmont Park officials that Holy Bull wouldn't be coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that decision had more to do with the trainer than the horse," New 
York trainer John Veitch said. "Explaining what happened in the Derby wore Mr. 
Croll out, and I don't think he wanted to be subjected to all that again. 
Besides, he got the horse as a gift (an inheritance, actually). He's already 
way ahead. The rest of us, we'd be running because of the money involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The precise amount of money on the line at 1 1/2 miles Saturday is $658,800, 
with $395,280 going to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seven horses were named when entries were drawn for the Belmont Stakes 
Thursday, and Donald La Place, the Belmont Park linemaker, had difficulty 
making Strodes Creek the favorite, as some handicappers had suggested. La 
Place's morning line lists Go For Gin, the Kentucky Derby winner who was second 
in the Preakness, as the 9-5 favorite, with Strodes Creek the second choice at 
5-2. Brocco and Tabasco Cat are next at 3-1, which makes sense to Winick. 
</P>
<P>
 The field, in post-position order, with jockeys and odds: Go For Gin, Chris 
McCarron, 9-5; Tabasco Cat, Pat Day, 3-1; Signal Tap, Jose Santos, 20-1; 
Amathos, Mike Smith, 15-1; Ulises, Craig Perret, 30-1; Strodes Creek, Jerry 
Bailey, 5-2, and Brocco, Gary Stevens, 3-1. All carry 126 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Breeders' Cup started in 1984, no Juvenile winner has won a Triple 
Crown race, a string of 29 races. And since 1919, when Sir Barton became the 
first of 11 horses to sweep the Triple Crown, no horse that started in the 
first leg of the series has won the Belmont without a race in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Winick is unfazed by these statistics. "I can't worry about the stats," he 
said. "All I know is that my horse has done very well since he's been here. 
He's eating good and feeling really well. If we'd have run him in the 
Preakness, I don't think I'd have the same horse now. There are some wide turns 
on this track. The way this horse strides out, he should appreciate them."

GOLF; REID BOUNCES BACK WITH 65 AT WESTCHESTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Reid, struggling to return from a wrist injury he sustained playing table 
tennis in 1992, eagled his last hole Thursday to take the lead after the 
opening round of the Buick Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid's six-under-par 65 put him one stroke ahead of Dillard Pruitt, Steve 
Brodie, Steve Pate, Bob Estes and Wayne Levi.David Frost was another shot back 
at 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid hit a driver off the tee and again from the fairway on his last hole of 
the day, the 505-yard, par-five ninth at the Westchester Country Club. He then 
rolled in a 10-foot putt to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just takes a tremendous amount of luck," Reid said. "I just happened to 
drill it (the second shot) into the hill and that took all the fire out of it 
and it trickled up there to 10 feet from the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid hurt his right wrist in Japan in the fall of 1992 and missed virtually 
all of 1993, when he underwent surgery to reattach a tendon. This year, he has 
missed five of 12 cuts and made $53,722. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite, Ernie Els and Jay Haas were among seven players at 68. Fred Couples, 
in his first tournament in three months since injuring his back, shot a 70.

 CUP RUNNETH: After watching the U.S. soccer team train for 18 months in its 
back yard, the Mission Viejo community will bid formal farewell to the World 
Cup-bound team at a black tie-optional dinner at the Mission Viejo Mall on 
Saturday. . . . "We're trying to say 'Guys, we appreciated you being here, we 
love you, best of luck,' " says Bill Irvine of its local Soccer Foundation. 
Most of the U.S. team will be at the $35-per-plate dinner, with food from 25 
local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 SOCCER ROMANIA: Other soccer teams are making a home around here: This week 
the Swedish team arrived in San Diego and the Romanian team in Newport Beach to 
open their World Cup training camps. . . . The Romanians, who will train at UC 
Irvine for two weeks, even brought their own chef to the Hyatt Newporter, so 
their players would be used to home cooking. The two countries square off 
Sunday at 4 p.m. at Trabuco Hills High -- the last exhibition match in Orange 
County. Tickets: $15. 
</P>
<P>
 SPLASHDOWN: In their debut seasons, the Mighty Ducks turned pro hockey on its 
ear, and the Bullfrogs won the Roller Hockey International title. Tonight, 
Anaheim gets its third professional sports franchise to play at The Pond (C1). 
It's Splash, an entry in the Continental Indoor Soccer League -- complete with 
Finley the dolphin as mascot, an all-woman dance team called -- what else -- 
the Mermaids. Tonight's ceremonies include a pyrotechnic show, baton twirling, 
and 75 dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 BUSY SCOREKEEPER: Splash coach George Fernandez promises high entertainment. 
In indoor soccer, for example, total scores average more than 14 goals per 
game, unheard of in regular soccer. "Even a boring game is exciting," the coach 
insists. There's too much action going on for it to be boring." . . . Pond 
spokesman John Nicoletti predicts Splash will be a winning team: "We can't give 
Orange County people a second-rate product. They won't stand for it."

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; QUESTIONS ARISE ON AIR 
TRAFFIC NOISE POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noise pollution from commercial jets, private planes and helicopters operating 
out of Van Nuys and Burbank airports has prompted some San Fernando Valley 
residents to distribute flyers with telephone numbers residents can call to 
lodge complaints. Changing flight patterns and schedules are among suggestions 
residents have made, while pilots and airlines insist they are doing everything 
they can to minimize noise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should the flight patterns of airlines and independent aircraft operating out 
of Burbank and Van Nuys airports be changed to reduce noise pollution in the 
San Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lucente, president, Studio City Residents Assn.:  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, absolutely. It's time for them to realize that while the Glendale, 
Burbank and Pasadena area has its own authority outside the city of Los 
Angeles, we live in a major city and the airport does impact communities like 
Studio City and Sherman Oaks. Any responsible viewpoint would include 
considerations of the impacts on these communities. The community 
overwhelmingly supports the presence of Burbank and Van Nuys airport 
operations, but we urge them to adopt the solutions that are available to 
provide a win-win situation. Specifically, this means 'share the noise' using 
east-bound take-offs for Burbank and adopting helicopter flights over 
industrial corridors versus residential areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, president, Homeowners of Encino: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, pilots should be required to fly in and out of both Burbank and Van Nuys 
over wholly industrial property. Every effort should be made to avoid 
residential neighborhoods. With respect to Van Nuys, that is much more 
feasible. The Stagg Street route allows planes to egress and ingress without 
going over any residential areas . . . That's quite safe to do, but what they 
often want to do is take the more expedient route which is often the most 
economical. With respect to Burbank, there's no reason they can't depart to the 
east. That would, of course, take them over far fewer residential neighborhoods 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Turner, president of Heli USA, a Santa Monica-based helicopter service 
that also operates out of Van Nuys Airport:  
</P>
<P>
 "The major thing is that safety ought to come first whether you are for or 
against changes. Airspace over the San Fernando Valley is very complicated . . 
. To change airspace is very difficult, but there are ways to improve, 
particularly with changing altitude to alleviate the noise . . . Airlines 
coming into Burbank have to fly over Van Nuys, and the (other) flights coming 
into Van Nuys have to be lower than those planes and helicopters have to be 
even lower. One possibility that we're working on is to produce a helicopter 
corridor along the Ventura Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandor Winger, chairman of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, everything is not roses, but the regulations we have at Van Nuys are 
pretty good. The problems that we run into are with individual pilots who might 
turn in a little early at take-off or with helicopters that fly too low. . . . 
The biggest problem we have is the fact that once the wheels leave the ground 
it becomes the problem of the FAA, but that's not to say we can't do something 
to regulate them. We can say if you cannot abide by recommended policy, we 
won't let you stay here at Van Nuys Airport, which leads to a host of legal 
issues."

STOCKS, BONDS MIXED AHEAD OF PRICE DATA

<P>
 Stocks and bonds closed Thursday's session on a mixed note after trading 
narrowly in anticipation of May wholesale price data due out today. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar fell against major currencies amid heightened tensions between 
the United States and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 After trading in a 15-point range all day, the Dow Jones average rose 3.69 to 
3,753.14. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues narrowly led advancers by 1,081 to 986 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where Big Board volume totaled 252.94 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's 256.01 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also traded in a narrow range as the market moved cautiously ahead of 
today's report. The key main 30-year bond yield fell to 7.27% from 7.28% on 
Wednesday, while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, finished up 
1/16 point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Short-term Treasuries fell 
1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to down 1/32, the 
Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect the May producer price index to reflect a rise of 0.2 
percentage points, or a rise of 0.3 percentage points when volatile food and 
energy prices are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 If the figures come in much higher than expected, meaning that prices are 
rising too fast, that could signal that inflation is a problem and "wallop 
stocks and bonds," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market won't get much of a boost if the number is unexpectedly 
low, Goldman said. A big drop in Nasdaq stocks this week has put a "slight bias 
to the downside" in the market, he said. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller issues fell 0.91 to 728.88. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks did not get much direction from bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Food, beverage and restaurant stocks fell sharply after PepsiCo said its 
second-quarter earnings will be about even with last year's $427 million, or 53 
cents per share, after taxes. Analysts were looking for a profit increase of 
about 15% for the April-June period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pepsi dropped as much as 4 5/8 before recovering part of those losses, 
ending the session down 3 at 31 1/2. Other food and restaurant chains fell 
sharply. Coca-Cola fell 1 to 40 5/8. In a move to reassure investors, Coca Cola 
reiterated earlier statements that its full-year earnings per share will grow 
"in the upper teens to 20%." McDonald's fell 1 3/4 to 60 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snapple Beverage fell 2 to 24 after the Wall Street Journal said the company 
is suffering under competition from Lipton iced teas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmaceutical stocks rose after Cowen & Co. upgraded several issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merck rose 1 to 31 3/4; Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 7/8 to 55 5/8; Eli Lilly 
advanced 2 to 57; Schering-Plough added 1/2 to 65 1/8; Mylan Labs climbed 3/8 
to 21 3/8; Pfizer rose 1 1/8 to 63 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer stocks, which pulled Nasdaq issues lower on Wednesday, were stable. 
IBM rose 3/8 to 62, while Apple advanced 7/8 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electronics company Varian Associates gained 1 1/8 to 33 1/2. Paine Webber 
upgraded the stock to "attractive" from "neutral," citing strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. Stocks posted wholesome gains in Tokyo for the 
third straight day. The Nikkei 225-share average ended up 140.83 points at 
21,402.78. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average ended 15.88 points lower at 2,129.32, 
while London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 9.30 points to 3028.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index rose 3.38 points to close at 2,413.36. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar rose in European trading. However, it 
closed unchanged at 103.95 Japanese yen in New York and at 1.669 German marks, 
down from 1.670 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, gold prices advanced on the New York Comex to $383.10 an ounce, up 
$1.40.

AROUND TOWN: THE LITTLE PUBLISHER THAT COULD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The economy's rotten. No one of sound mind would stake their savings on a 
publishing venture, right? And with an anthology of stories by former Peace 
Corps volunteers -- a concept that sounds about as sexy as shredded wheat? 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Kennedys of Santa Monica -- Geraldine and Jim, publisher and managing 
editor of the infant Clover Park Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been warned by the pros that a Peace Corps book would be the kiss of 
death, the Kennedys -- who met as Peace Corps teachers in Liberia in 1962 -- 
chose to bet their publishing future on "From the Center of the Earth: Stories 
Out of the Peace Corps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people just have to swim upstream," Geraldine says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1990, they filed papers announcing the birth of Clover Park 
and set about gathering writers for this first book. 
</P>
<P>
 They had no overhead -- their spare bedroom and converted garage are 
headquarters -- and took no salaries. Still, they had risked $25,000, including 
start-up and printing costs, by the time the paperback came out the following 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 They braced for the worst, but within 18 months it sold all 5,000 copies and 
is now in a second printing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had a bad review," Geraldine says. A glowing critique in the 
Washington Post -- hometown paper to a number of ex-Peace Corps-types -- 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a book of letters-to-the-folks-back-home but short fiction and 
nonfiction by 13 writers, many of whom have been published by major houses. For 
this project, they settled for modest fees. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the book had paid for itself, and for some new computer software, 
the Kennedys began thinking maybe they really belonged in this business. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Jim says, "This is an adventure that happens evenings and 
weekends." Geraldine has a day job as a principal planning analyst at UCLA. 
Jim, a former news director at KCET, is Clover Park's chief salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did a brash little press come to have a bucolic name like Clover Park? 
Well, in the '70s, Geraldine the activist led a victorious citizens' drive that 
resulted in the creation of Clover Park in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 At the American Booksellers Assn. convention in L.A. over the Memorial Day 
weekend, the Kennedys passed out cards trumpeting Clover Park as publisher of 
"great books about life's wonders and wanderings." 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine chose one of her own wanderings for Clover Park's second book, 
"Harmattan: A Journey Across the Sahara," published in hardcover last January. 
The introduction, by Peace Corps founding director Sargent Shriver, counsels: 
"Get it. Beg, borrow or steal it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Geraldine's riveting account of crossing the forbidding Sahara in 1964 
from the Ivory Coast to Algiers, a journey of 4,000 miles and seven weeks by 
train, bus, car and truck, with four other Peace Corps women. 
</P>
<P>
 In a land where women were all but invisible, they became known as " 
Desmoiselles formidables ." Life, the New York Times and Newsweek made them 
minor celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, "during periods of unemployment," she'd talked about writing the 
book. The success of the first one gave her the courage. Jim convinced her that 
it was time "to get this thing out of here." Chapter closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harmattan" has sold more than 1,000 of the printing of 5,000. They're on 
target for having it pay for itself by late July and "the company is now 
running on its own steam," Geraldine says, having earned back their total 
investment of $50,000 in the two books. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Book three. Geraldine wants to do books on multicultural topics and 
literary travel. And, as one who researches even a hangnail, she'd like to 
publish a series "for lay people who have chronic illnesses -- questions they 
don't ask the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Can tiny Clover Park compete with the big guys for top writers? 
</P>
<P>
 That's an issue, she knows. The Kennedys hope to attract writers who need TLC 
and a publisher that will respect their work. 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of small presses, from the precious literati types to the 
how-to-ers. To succeed, she says, Clover Park will have to lead, not follow. 
"The 25 Ways to Save the Environment has been done. We have to be nimble and 
anticipatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Queries from literary agents are starting to come in, as are unsolicited 
manuscripts. "Somebody actually sent us pornography," she says. Not for Clover 
Park. Nor are computer books, which "wouldn't hold my passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Are there investors in their future? Not now. "Having our own money at risk 
kept us in tune to our decisions," Geraldine says. Besides, "I like having 
control. . . . We have a line of credit and right now we're able to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to publish six books a year. "Journeys to the Center of the 
Earth," the sequel, is a distinct possibility. Long Live the Ballroom King 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The King of the Stardust Ballroom is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 friends gathered at the Mayflower Ballroom in Inglewood to say 
so long to Mike Johns, 80, who had danced his way into their hearts during 50 
years as a regular at Myron's Ballroom, the Ventura Club in Van Nuys and 
Ginsburg's Waltz Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven nights a week you could see Mike dancing," recalls his brother, Ralph, 
of La Habra. "During intermission, there he would be, all by himself, twirling 
on the dance floor for 15 minutes until the band returned." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a cake inscribed to the king. And Ralph Johns brought a scrapbook of 
photos -- Mike with bandleader Orrin Tucker of "Oh, Johnny!" fame, Mike with 
bandleader Freddie Martin. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tucker had placed the crown and velvet robes on Mike when patrons chose him as 
king of Tucker's old Stardust Ballroom at Sunset and Western in the late '70s. 
Lola Cole of San Pedro, his frequent dance partner, was the first queen of the 
Stardust Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker opened the Stardust after playing a bandleader in the 1975 TV movie 
"Queen of the Stardust Ballroom." In the movie, shot at Myron's at 10th and 
Grand (now the Shark Club), Maureen Stapleton played a 50ish widow who met a 
lonely mailman at the Stardust. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these ballrooms are gone now, these places where men and women would 
find partners for a few innocent hours dancing the waltz, the fox trot, the 
samba. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd always dance the Latin numbers," says Cole, 71, who's now into swing 
dancing. "We were just buddies. He went through a few girlfriends during that 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Their last dance together was at Johns' 80th birthday, May 6, 1993, at the 
Mayflower. "After that," Cole says, "he'd come on his crutches and just sit 
there. All his friends would come up and chit-chat. He liked that." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, doctors diagnosed cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 By most measures, Mike Johns was an ordinary man. He quit school at 16 to work 
in the Pennsylvania tin mills, helping support a family of seven. In L.A., he 
made a living buying clothing wholesale and selling it from his car. (He's 
remembered as a snappy little dresser.) He never married. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his life, dancing," Cole says.

 Although "Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau refers to the Catholic church as 
blessing same-sex unions, most, but not all, of the claims of such unions point 
to rituals and practices of Catholics who later came to be identified with the 
Eastern Orthodox Church. Church spokesmen dispute the claims made in a book by 
Yale University professor John Boswell.

 Reader Marci Martin of Encinitas recalls the time her father and mother were 
waiting for a bus on a busy street corner in Dallas: 
</P>
<P>
 Mom held onto Pop's arm, watching the passing traffic. After awhile, she 
wandered away, distracted by the sounds of children playing across the street. 
Soon, she returned and resumed her position. A stranger, whose arm she now 
held, gazed down at her with a startled expression. Mom quickly responded:

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: RUSTLIN' UP SOME L.A. SLICKERS

 The Scene: Wednesday's premiere of Columbia and Castle Rock's "City Slickers 
II: The Legend of Curly's Gold" at the Motion Picture Academy. Four blocks of 
red carpet went from the theater to the party in an enclosed lot at Wilshire 
and Palm. With 1,700 guests marching, this was a Beverly Hills-style cattle 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Will There Be a Third? In his speech before the screening, Billy Crystal joked 
that he was considering two sequels: "When Harry Left Sally," and "City 
Slickers III: Beating a Dead Horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars -- Crystal, Jack Palance, Daniel Stern, Jon 
Lovitz and Patricia Wettig -- and director Paul Weiland; plus guests including 
Rita Rudner; James Coburn; Carl Reiner; David Spade; Ron Silver; James Woods; 
Castle Rock's Alan Horn, Martin Shafer and Rob Reiner; Columbia's Peter Guber 
and Mark Canton. Also on hand were co-screenwriters Babaloo Mandel and Lowell 
Ganz. "For those who ask if that's his real name, it's not," said Crystal. 
"It's Al Ganz." 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statement: To go with the film's Western setting there was a 
sprinkling of cowboy boots, blue jeans and bolo ties. Although one woman from 
New York said, "Fashion? What fashion? Cowboy boots are not fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack's Been Around a Long Time: When asked what was the best part about doing 
the movie, Palance replied, "Getting paid." The Oscar winner doesn't like 
seeing himself on screen, so he slipped away to have a turkey sandwich and 
mashed potatoes at Kate Mantilini's during the screening. When it was mentioned 
that Palance hadn't seen either of the "City Slicker" films, Crystal said: 
"Listen, he hasn't seen 'Shane' yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of the Start of the Summer Movie Season: Stars clutch bottles of Evian 
water as they enter screenings. And studio execs talk despondently about the 
competition: "It's a blood bath," said one. "There's going to be a few big hits 
and a lot of slaughter." Of course, he was one of the more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: The party was free for guests, but Castle Rock made a $25,000 
donation to Comic Relief. And two $180,000 checks (part of the $7.8 million 
raised at Comic Relief VI) were presented to the Venice Family Clinic and 
Homeless Health Care L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Why It Was Good to Have an Outdoor Party: A screenwriter rhapsodizing on what 
is rapidly becoming the semi-illicit joy of smoking: "It's your best friend. It 
picks you up, it calms you down. You only have sex because a cigarette tastes 
better afterward."

 Ben Garner's birdie on the 17th hole helped the South defeat the North, 13-11, 
in the Southern California PGA Orange County All-Star Golf match Thursday at 
Newport Beach Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner, from El Toro, made a six-foot putt to move into a tie in his match 
with Esperanza's Chris Berry and put him and Santa Margarita's Ben Bost 1-up on 
Berry and Ryan Henderson, also of Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead held and Garner and Bost won five of six possible points. Kevin 
Walden of Corona del Mar and Kevin Rodgers of Trabuco Hills also totaled five 
points for the South, defeating Ryan Chavez of El Dorado and Bret Yunker of Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The South has won the tournament, which features the top 16 seniors in the 
county, in each of the six times it has been held. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's Dave Searle and Huntington Beach's Greg Uberuaga gave the South an 
early 6-0 lead, closing out Estancia's Chris Sandro and Dana Hills' Matt 
Johnson after the 12th hole. The other foursome -- the South's Aaron Smith of 
Dana Hills and Kellee Booth of Santa Margarita vs. the North's Bryon Bell of 
Western and Mike Peterson of Brea-Olinda -- split the six points. MARTIN BECK

TEXACO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MAJOR SPILL, STUDY SAYS; ENVIRONMENT: STATE 
OFFICIALS ARE CONFIDENT COMPANY IS AT FAULT FOR 200,000-GALLON LEAK NORTH OF 
VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 New information from a study funded by Texaco supports the oil company's 
contention that it is not responsible for the worst pipeline spill ever in 
Ventura County, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the so-called fingerprinting tests were disclosed at Texaco's 
School Canyon production plant, where water quality and Fish and Game officials 
joined local prosecutors Thursday for an on-site inspection of the cleanup in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 But state investigators said they remain confident that Texaco is responsible 
for the 200,000 or more gallons of gas condensate that leaked into a natural 
ground-water basin 50 feet beneath the surface in School Canyon just north of 
the Ventura city limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were pointing the finger at Shell, but we took samples and they came 
back matching Texaco," said Holly Ethridge, the state Fish and Game warden 
leading the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Oil leases an oil field immediately west of where the spill was first 
discovered, but Ethridge said the Fish and Game fingerprinting exonerates 
Texaco's neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco attorney Robert Fuller, who toured the cleanup site with state and 
local officials Thursday, said the Fish and Game analysis is based on "bad 
science" and therefore is inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a just-completed study funded by Texaco proves that the toxic 
petroleum byproduct could not have come from the company's facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating because the chief suspect is a Texaco pipeline, but we know 
with certainty it wasn't that pipeline," Fuller said. "There is no match 
between the Texaco condensate, which runs through the pipeline, and any of the 
condensate" found in School Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 300,000 gallons of a gas-like mixture was discovered after Fish and Game 
wardens noticed a sheen of oil in School Canyon Creek, a seasonal stream that 
flows into the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rains over the 1993 winter apparently raised the ground-water table and 
pushed the toxins into the creek, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 houses are clustered within a mile of the site, although Fish 
and Game officials said the spill probably does not pose any threat to 
residents or surrounding habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco is in the midst of what will become a years-long cleanup effort that so 
far has recovered more than 64,000 gallons of the condensate. Company officials 
estimate there are still at least 208,000 gallons of the gasoline-like liquid 
left in the underground basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company has installed seven recovery wells that pump the solution from 
50 feet beneath the surface to nearby storage tanks, where it is later refined 
into a usable fuel such as butane. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other wells will be added to the cleanup effort later this month, Fuller 
said, citing a work plan imposed on the company by the Regional Water Quality 
Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game investigators have been quietly collecting information 
about the toxic spill for more than a year. It was first reported by Texaco in 
January, 1993, but later discovered by state regulators to be much larger. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until this past March, however, that Fish and Game investigators 
convinced a judge to issue a search warrant for the Texaco offices that the 
spill became public. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspecting that Texaco had covered up evidence of the spill, dozens of 
investigators converged on the School Canyon plant and confiscated thousands of 
pages of records related to the leak and the company's operations.  
</P>
<P>
 Ethridge said she still is several months from making a recommendation about 
criminal or civil charges to the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gaining ground on it," she said of the probe. "We've been going through 
the documents and we're condensing the materials we feel are pertinent to our 
investigation."

EVIDENCE OF ARSON NOT FOUND IN OAK VIEW FIRE; INQUIRY: OFFICIALS SAY 
INVESTIGATORS ARE PURSUING POSSIBILITY THAT BLAZE WAS CAUSED BY SOMEONE SMOKING 
IN HOME OF BLACK FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite statements by members of a black Oak View family that they were the 
target of a deliberate attack, fire and sheriff's officials said Thursday that 
they have been unable to find any evidence of arson in a fire that destroyed 
the family's home early Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no physical evidence to suggest there was an arson," said Lt. Craig 
Husband of the major crimes division of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fires frequently consume a lot of the evidence," Husband said. "But generally 
speaking, if there is an arson there is evidence to identify it as such." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials have not ruled out the possibility of arson despite the 
lack of supporting evidence, Husband also disclosed Thursday that investigators 
still are pursuing the possibility that the fire was caused by someone who was 
smoking inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that a cigarette started the fire was among the early avenues 
of investigation, officials said. Investigators initially thought the blaze 
might have been caused by someone smoking in the living room where the fire 
originated. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview after the fire Tuesday at Ojai Community Hospital, 
13-year-old Shuwana Stanford, who suffered facial burns in the fire, told 
inspector William O'Bryan Hager that she did not smoke and was not smoking 
before the blaze broke out. She has said she was asleep on the living room 
couch when the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Husband said he is not aware of evidence of smoking burns anywhere 
inside the house, he said Thursday that it is still too early to rule out 
smoking as a possible cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely within the realm of possibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members have said from the beginning that the fire must have been 
deliberately set. They have told investigators that they heard a "pop" before 
the blaze started and saw a single stream of fire moments before the 
three-bedroom home was engulfed in flames, suggesting to them that some 
flammable liquid had ignited their modest house. 
</P>
<P>
 One family member, Lonnie Stanford, told investigators he saw a hole in the 
living room window moments before the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, however, a trained arson dog was unable to identify any 
flammable liquids in the fire-gutted structure. Investigators also could not 
confirm whether there had been a hole in a window because all the windows of 
the house were blown out by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no evidence to suggest any sort of incendiary device was thrown 
into the house, fire investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three fire investigators sifted through the charred remains of the house most 
of Tuesday. But fire investigator Peter Cronk said they could not uncover 
enough evidence to determine what caused the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just keep digging until something turns up," Cronk said. "It can take a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stymied by the discrepancies between witness accounts and the lack of 
evidence, investigators re-interviewed family members Thursday. But Husband 
said Thursday afternoon that no new or different information was garnered from 
the additional interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Although family members have spoken freely about the fire and their beliefs 
that it may have been racially motivated, a family member said Thursday that 
the Stanfords did not want to discuss the continuing investigation anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Fire Chief Richard Perry said the department hopes to have the 
investigation completed by the end of the weekend. He said fire investigators 
have not ruled out any possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's apparent the minute the investigator walks in," Perry said. 
"But sometimes you really have to sift through the ashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there are differences between the witnesses' accounts and the evidence, 
Husband said he doesn't think that any member of the family has lied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that they are truthfully reporting what they believe happened," 
Husband said, adding: "Being involved in a structure fire is stressful and that 
has to be taken into account." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwana Stanford suffered first- and second-degree burns to her face as a 
result of the fire. Two other family members were treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Stanford family, and the NAACP, have said they think the fire 
was deliberately set in an act of racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe that that was not an accident," said John R. Hatcher III, 
president of the Ventura County chapter of the NAACP. "Accidents don't just 
happen -- somebody makes them happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher contacted the FBI after the fire, calling for a federal investigation 
into possible civil rights violations -- probes that are routinely launched by 
the FBI whenever there is a high-profile incident involving possible racist 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI agent met with Lonnie Stanford, a 30-year Navy veteran who works for 
the federal Department of Veteran Affairs, for nearly an hour Wednesday at the 
charred home, and officials have said that the FBI is closely monitoring the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, head of the FBI's Ventura County office, would not disclose any 
details of the agency's involvement in the investigation, saying only that the 
FBI might become more actively involved only if local officials determined the 
fire to be an arson. 
</P>
<P>
 While refusing to discuss any specifics about the Oak View case, Auer, 
responding to a question, said false statements made to federal investigators 
can result in criminal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, there is always a distinction between someone expressing a thought, 
a belief, an opinion, which may or may not be accurate," Auer said. "Before any 
criminal actions take place, the government has to show a knowing criminal 
intent."

TALE SPINNERS; PUPILS WEAVE YARNS AT STORYTELLING FESTIVAL IN OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kyle Pinkard likes to tell tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Not fibs, but stories. And not simple stories, but drawn-out, complicated 
tales, such as the saga about a lazy boy named Jack that Kyle told this week 
during the annual storytelling festival at Oxnard's Fred Williams School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a good way to get attention," the bespectacled 8-year-old said. 
"You get to sit up front in a chair and be listened to by other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the youngsters who told stories in this year's festival approached the 
event with a bit more trepidation than Kyle. But they did it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its third year, the Fred Williams School storytelling festival drew 400 
participants -- half of the school's kindergarten through sixth-grade students. 
It is the largest event of its kind at any Ventura County school. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age of Nintendo and video arcades, the ancient art of storytelling still 
appeals to children because it fills a basic human need, said Ladell Bohn, a 
speech therapist at Fred Williams School who founded the storytelling festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all storytellers, really," said Bohn, who will give a talk about her 
school's program at a national storytelling convention in Texas next month. 
"It's pretty much the most natural form of communication and of passing things 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "We don't sit around on the porch and listen to stories like we 
used to. We're so busy, we're so technologically advanced that that kind of 
personal thing is missing in our society. And I think kids still hunger for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-week festival that ended this week, about 30 children at a time 
got out of their regular classes to take turns telling and hearing each others' 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 They had gleaned their tales from books, from yarns told by parents or 
grandparents, or even from some of the professional storytellers who perform 
occasionally at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stories had a moral, such as the yarn titled "A Friend in Need." 
Stressing the importance of loyalty, it told the tale of a fox that slyly 
prevented a leopard from killing a turtle. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stories were merely fanciful, such as Kyle Pinkard's folk tale about the 
misadventures of Lazy Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kyle told the story, poor Jack was not so much lazy as witless, always 
applying his mother's advice a day too late. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, for instance, Jack's mother told him to always use a leash on the 
family dog. The next day, as Jack was bringing home a slab of beef, he 
wondered: "Now what did mother tell me?" as Kyle recounted it. "Ah, yes. Use a 
leash." And so Jack dragged the meat home on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kyle said he chose his story because it was long, some of his 
classmates seemed less comfortable in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Many sat on the edge of their chairs and spoke so softly they could barely be 
heard, even with a microphone. Others rushed through their tales as if eager to 
reach the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohn said she is careful not to emphasize how well the children perform. 
"There's no better way to turn kids off to something than to make it have to be 
too perfect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some students, she acknowledged, seem to be naturals. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-grader, 6-year-old Alex Nerayan had never participated in any previous 
storytelling festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 When he had his turn at the microphone this week, however, Alex spoke clearly, 
gestured with his hands and skillfully embellished his African American folk 
tale of why dogs hate cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogs and cats used to love each other," Alex said. But one day a cat stole a 
piece of ham from a dog, and not just any ham, but "the juiciest, the biggest 
hunk of ham," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the story had come from a book, the words were Alex's own. He had 
heeded Bohn's warning not to memorize. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who memorize, if they miss one word, they're lost," Bohn said. "If 
you tell it in your own words, you can add, you can subtract." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this ability of storytellers to make tales their own that gives the oral 
tradition an edge over Nintendo-like games with their ready-made plots. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, Bohn said, is the confidence that children gain from 
telling their tales in front of audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for these kids," she said. "They're scared. It's hard for a 
first-grader to speak in front of a sixth-grader. But they love it so much and 
they get such self-esteem from it that they are willing to do it."

MOTHER GUILTY OF ABUSING HER DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wealthy Westlake mother Charlotte Russo was found guilty of one count of 
abusing her teen-age daughter Thursday, reacting first with tears and then an 
attack on a news photographer as she rushed from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the misdemeanor conviction in Ventura County Superior Court, 
Russo, 52, faces up to six months in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury on Monday will continue deliberating an additional count of 
felony child abuse, which accuses the registered nurse and stockbroker's wife 
of biting her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased they came back guilty on the misdemeanor," Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee 
Corona commented. "I think they are validating some of (the victim's) concerns, 
where nobody else ever believed her." 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles Times photographer Alan Hagman snapped a picture of Russo 
outside the courtroom, she charged him and swung her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There!" she said. "Are you happy now?" 
</P>
<P>
 The purse became caught with the camera before Russo yanked it free, breaking 
several accessories on the camera in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 After the confrontation, Russo exited the Hall of Justice through a back 
stairwell surrounded by her husband and six other children. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, now 16 and living in foster care, was the only one of Russo's 
seven children not to attend Thursday's verdict hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley expressed hope the jury will acquit Russo of 
the felony charge, which could bring a six-year prison term if she is 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the easy one to find, even though I don't believe the evidence 
supports it," Farley said, downplaying the misdemeanor conviction. "I believe 
the other will be more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley also said Russo does not deserve jail time for the misdemeanor 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been punished enough," he declared, saying her husband, Richard, has 
lost many clients since news of the case broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said Russo's nine-bedroom house is in foreclosure and that the family 
probably will file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo pleaded guilty in November to misdemeanor child abuse and served 
a 30-day jail term. He also was placed on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Charlotte Russo with one count each of felony and 
misdemeanor child abuse. The felony charge accuses Russo of severely biting the 
girl on the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor charge accused her of forcing the girl to sleep in a back-yard 
racquetball court for long periods and of clawing and hitting the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the jury is still under an admonishment not to discuss the case, it 
was unclear Thursday which actions resulted in the misdemeanor conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts surrounding the misdemeanor were overwhelming," Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the emotional six-week trial, several neighbors testified about 
witnessing the defendant attack the girl, either in the family's garage or back 
yard on different occasions during the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified for five days, saying she had been banished to the locked 
environs of the family's $75,000 racquetball court as punishment for not doing 
her homework. She also testified that she was pinched, punched, scratched and 
roped around the wrists by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo denied most of the accusations. She said she bit the girl in 
self-defense. And she said she slapped her occasionally as a form of discipline 
when the girl talked back. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor conviction came on the jury's second day of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict was read, Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
replaced a juror on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The man said personal business would not allow him to continue his jury work 
next week when deliberations resume. Farley objected, but Campbell agreed to 
excuse the juror after questioning him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm satisfied if he could have stayed, he would have," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo and her husband were arrested May 24, 1993, after a 
neighboring couple called the Sheriff's Department and reported seeing the girl 
being beaten by her mother in the family's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same neighbors and others testified for the prosecution. Russo testified 
in her own defense, as did most of her children, who called the victim a liar 
and a thief who refused to follow their parents' orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was adopted by the Russos at the age of 1. She has had five heart 
surgeries and suffered from seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical problems required the girl to receive extra attention, which 
frustrated Russo, prosecutor Corona said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MURAL WARNS LATINOS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A brightly colored mural depicting the consequences of drinking and driving 
was unveiled Thursday in Oxnard, with community activists lauding it as a 
beneficial step in curbing Latino alcohol usage. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the mural is a red stop sign with the words, Si Toma, No 
Maneje. In English, the words translate to "If you drink, don't drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Four panels depict aspects of drinking and driving, said artist Ray Valadez.  
</P>
<P>
 One shows a car accident with paramedics on the scene; a second shows a man 
behind jail bars; a third depicts a family snapshot with two young teen-agers 
torn away, dramatizing the trauma on families of alcohol-related tragedies; and 
the fourth shows the hand of one person turning over car keys to a sober 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard community leaders decided to put up the mural after learning that 
Latinos account for 81% of all drunk-driving arrests in Oxnard, yet represent 
just 54% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides passing out pamphlets warning about drinking and driving and holding 
occasional seminars on its possible consequences, community leaders decided a 
mural would be a good way to reach their intended audience and pound home their 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murals are part of the Mexican heritage," said Jesus Rocha, a co-director of 
El Centrito de la Colonia, a nonprofit group serving La Colonia residents. "And 
they tend to stick in people's minds. The more that people drive by this mural, 
the more it will stick in their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-foot-high mural stands on an auto-repair shop's wall at 161 N. Harrison 
Avenue in La Colonia, one of Oxnard's poorest neighborhoods. Leaders of El 
Centrito were instrumental in getting the painting made. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jorge Alvarado said the painting is a good example of Latinos working 
together to solve community problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work as best we can to heighten awareness of this problem," 
Alvarado said. "Something obviously needs to be done about this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most dramatic moments of the 90-minute unveiling ceremony came when 
Ricardo Melendez reached into a black tote back and pulled out a prosthetic 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Melendez, 40, was hit by a drunk driver in 1988. One leg was amputated and 
another severely injured, Melendez said. The crowd of about 40 grew silent as 
Melendez openly displayed the remaining physical scars of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it takes, people need to know that drunk driving causes of lot of 
heartache and pain," Melendez said. "I hope somebody hears this message." KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JUDGE SCOLDS TWO FOR EAVESDROPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Thursday condemned two members of the Ventura County district 
attorney's office for eavesdropping, but delayed ruling on whether to dismiss a 
criminal charge against the burglary defendant who says his privacy was 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any question that what occurred is not OK," Superior 
Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. said, though the eavesdropping charges had 
been dismissed Wednesday. "I think the message is clear that this type of 
conduct is highly inappropriate and is going to have a significant impact on 
anyone" who engages in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said he would rule in a hearing this morning on whether to dismiss a 
burglary charge against Robert Lee Morrow, 30, who is accused of breaking into 
a room at a Port Hueneme motel last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner and investigator Katherine Smith were charged 
with felony eavesdropping May 20 after they listened in on a conversation 
between Morrow and his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mary Fielder, in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were dropped Wednesday by a judge who said the eavesdropping law 
is ambiguous. Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch ruled that Ratner and Smith 
do not have to stand trial in the case because they did not use an electronic 
device to eavesdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Thursday to determine whether the charges against Morrow would 
also be dropped, Ratner and Smith both took the stand but refused to answer 
questions under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielder argued that Morrow's right to a fair trial had been prejudiced because 
the prosecution learned part of his trial strategy by eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the conduct of Ratner and Smith "extremely outrageous, if not 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Meyers said the eavesdropping gave the prosecution 
no insights into Morrow's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant lost nothing with this incident, and the prosecution gained 
nothing," he argued. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 The Camarillo City Council has approved spending a little more than $2 million 
for the renovation of the Bill Esty Center on Las Posas Road so it can house 
the city's police force.  
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 Wednesday to award a bid to Camarillo-based HMH 
Construction for $2,018,065 for the conversion of the recreation and community 
center near the intersection of Las Posas Road and Ponderosa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Stan Daily was absent from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently housed in a cramped former bank building on Palm Drive, the city's 
police force -- contracted Ventura County sheriff's deputies -- hope to occupy 
the building sometime next spring, city officials said. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY LAUNCHES FIGHT ON ILLEGAL SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard officials today will launch a citywide campaign to rid roadsides and 
walkways of thousands of bootleg signs erected on the weekends to direct home 
buyers to new housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of planning, Paul H. Brown Advertising of Westlake Village on 
Thursday unveiled the new program, which will group together directional signs 
on single billboards 6 feet tall by 2 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising agency will place 36 of the billboards at strategic locations 
throughout the city. The billboards will be taken down each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weekend directionals work so well and are so cheap that it is difficult 
for the city to stem the tide," said Paul Brown of the smaller roadside signs. 
"But we think we've come up with a program that works better and looks much 
nicer." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the new campaign will be stepped-up enforcement of city codes 
outlawing the smaller directional signs that spring up by the thousands in 
Oxnard each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Home builders who continue to erect the roadside placards will have them 
removed and could face fines, Community Development Director Richard Maggio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have already been informed," Maggio said of the city's new home 
builders. "It's not going to be a surprise to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, homeowners began complaining about the proliferation of illegal 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, individual developers were erecting as many as 600 signs on a 
given weekend. City planners reduced that number by fixing a cap of 50 signs 
per developer. Still, thousands are planted each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Some home builders think that the new program is a necessary step in ending 
the proliferation of roadside signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should accomplish the same thing with less confusion," said Karen 
Van Winkle, marketing manager for Standard Pacific of Ventura, developer of the 
Summerfield and San Miguel tracts. FRED ALVAREZ

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: T.V. SHOW TO FOCUS ON COUNTY BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A television show debuting June 19 will focus on the business community in 
Ventura County and its interaction with government and the community, producers 
at Santa Barbara-based KEYT-TV announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, scheduled for Sundays at 9 a.m., will "provide a positive 
dialogue" for the county, according to executive producer and host O.C. 
Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to be Rush Limbaugh," Jenkins said. "We don't want to attack. 
You sit down to watch at 9 a.m., you feel good about yourself, and you're 
reminded that the American Dream is still alive in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour show will feature guest panelists and address topics such as 
"Improving Our Environment" and "New Business Opportunities for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our shows are designed to be provocative," Jenkins said. "If I'm talking, the 
show is not working." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Gov. Pete Wilson has agreed to appear on one of 13 upcoming 
broadcasts. The date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to be political," Jenkins said. "I'm not interested in 
hearing about Kathleen Brown. Regardless of who is in the driver's seat after 
the election, what are the realities, what do we in the county need to look 
ahead to?" 
</P>
<P>
 The show will include a segment on viewer opinions from a toll-free telephone 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins previously hosted a cable show, Ventura Today, and interviewed local 
leaders in daily radio spots for the Ventura Chamber of Commerce. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAYOR STRATTON PLANS TO SEEK FIFTH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton announced Thursday that he will seek a fifth 
term in the November election, and Planning Commissioner Dean F. Kunicki, 49, 
said he would announce today his plans to run for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, who was first elected to the City Council 15 years ago, has served 
as mayor since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the 47-year-old Stratton tried to run for county 
auditor-controller, but the state Supreme Court ruled that he did not have the 
proper credentials to fill the post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I clearly thought there was another place that could use my talents, but 
unfortunately the judge decided that wasn't to be," Stratton said. "I hope the 
citizens of Simi will appreciate my talents as their mayor again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the mayoral seat, the terms of the City Council seats held by 
Judy Mikels and Sandi Webb are up for election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels has surrendered her seat to run for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunicki, a 14-year Simi Valley resident, said he hopes to fill that post. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunicki is president of a Thousand Oaks company that helps businesses 
establish self-insured health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as a Neighborhood Council chairman for eight years and set up a 
Neighborhood Watch program in his Bridal Path neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently appointed chairman of the Simi Valley chapter of the Ventura 
County Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected to the council, Kunicki said he would work to maintain Simi 
Valley's reputation as a safe city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been pegged as the safest city of our size in the nation," Kunicki 
said. "It is not the time to fall back on our laurels, or we'll find ourselves 
battling the crime that overflows from the San Fernando Valley." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; 3-HOUR SEARCH FINDS BOY SAFE WITH MOM

<P>
 A report that a 6-year-old Moorpark boy was missing sent more than 15 
deputies, a helicopter and a police dog on a three-hour search Thursday morning 
before the boy was found safe with his mother, a Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Darabi was reported missing about 8:30 a.m. after he did not show up 
at Mountain Meadows Elementary School in Moorpark.His grandmother contacted 
police after receiving a call at the family home from the boy's teacher, said 
Sgt. Keith Parks of the Sheriff's Department Moorpark division. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said the grandmother was not told that the boy was accompanying his 
younger brother on a preschool field trip to Ventura. It took police three 
hours to locate the mother and her two sons at the Ventura Harbor, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a situation like this, we pull out all the stops," said Lt. Geoff Dean, 
commander of the Moorpark division. "Our policy is to call in all the resources 
we possibly need. We can always send them back. When you have a child of 6 or 
7, it's just too critical to put it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The search was called off a little after 11:30 a.m. when the boy was found, 
Dean said. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 More than 100 Ventura Avenue area residents crowded a local seniors' center 
Thursday night, clamoring to volunteer in a renewed effort to improve and 
beautify the aging community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get a group together that can hold the politicians' feet to the 
fire, we'll never get anything done," James Davison, a resident of Ramona 
Street, exhorted his neighbors."Let's get acquainted. That's what we've got to 
do is get acquainted." 
</P>
<P>
 After debating for an hour about how and when to organize, the group broke up 
into smaller clusters based on the problems they were most interested in 
solving. The topics they will tackle include troubles with families and schools 
and rebuilding the neighborhood's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 People exchanged telephone numbers and ideas and vowed to meet again, in their 
groups, within the month. Residents also organized a steering committee to 
oversee the smaller groups. The committee will meet on June 23, from 6 to 8 
p.m., at the Ventura Avenue Adult-Senior Center at 550 N. Ventura Ave., where 
Thursday's meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Officer Jim Cubitt also called for volunteers to build and 
staff the neighborhood's new police storefront, behind the Vons shopping center 
on Main Street and Ventura Avenue, which will open in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's from the neighborhood," he said. "And it's for the neighborhood."

OXNARD APPROVES PERMIT FOR CLUB WITH TOPLESS DANCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 Persistence has paid off for an Upland businessman seeking to open a club that 
features topless dancing in an industrial area of northeast Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 On his fifth try, John Gray won permission this week from city officials to 
establish the club at 630 Maulhardt Ave. His first four applications were 
denied because of inadequate parking, said Assistant City Atty. Paula Kimbrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray solved that problem this time by working out a deal to share parking 
spaces with neighboring businesses, Kimbrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's approval of the adult business permit has triggered protests by 
some area business owners, including the owner of an Oxnard-based television 
station that has threatened to move out of the city if the dance club moves in. 
</P>
<P>
 "From time to time, communities have to dig in and stand up on certain moral 
issues," said John Huddy, owner of KADY-TV. "It became very obvious to me from 
the beginning that this wasn't going to happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Huddy said he is worried that the club will attract a rough crowd that could 
threaten the safety of his employees. He said he has already held preliminary 
discussions with two Ventura County cities -- one in the east county and one in 
the west -- about possibly relocating the television station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is if the city of Oxnard is going to permit this to happen and 
treat us and the others on our street like this . . . this is not the kind of 
place I want to run a business," Huddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the proposed adult businesses is protected by the First 
Amendment and that rejection of the adult business permit would not survive a 
legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit is not subject to City Council review. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city adopted an adult business ordinance that allows adult business to 
operate in certain areas of the city," Kimbrell said. "The site was in this 
area that the city allowed adult businesses to use." FRED ALVAREZ

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PRINCIPALS REASSIGNED DUE TO 
RETIREMENTS 
</P>

<P>
 Two veteran Simi Valley principals will be reassigned next year to lead the 
district's largest elementary schools as part of a shake-up among 
administrators, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were prompted by the retirements of two principals -- Charles F. 
Bock at Berylwood elementary and Sheila Robbins at Vista Fundamental School -- 
and the decision by Hillside Junior High Principal James Stevenson to return to 
teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Susan Parks said Stevenson asked to teach special-education 
students at Royal High School after serving for several years as junior high 
principal -- a position made more difficult by recent budget cuts that 
eliminated one assistant principal at the junior high level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very demanding job and sometimes you just need a break from 
administration," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill the vacant positions, district officials on Thursday named Ronda Oster 
principal of Berylwood, the district's largest elementary school, with 850 
students. Oster is currently principal at Crestview School. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Marino, now principal of Township elementary, was named principal of 
Vista elementary school, the district's second-largest elementary campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Webb, assistant principal at Sequoia Junior High, will take over 
Hillside Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Other appointments include: Dee Pekrul as principal of Township elementary, 
Mary Aguilar as principal of Crestview elementary and Ann Eklund as principal 
of White Oak elementary. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON DEVELOPMENT 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen years of wrangling over a parcel in Newbury Park will continue for at 
least six more weeks after the Thousand Oaks City Council agreed to delay 
voting on a plan to sharply limit development on 44 acres owned by Nedjatollah 
Cohan.  
</P>
<P>
 The city-proposed zoning change was rescheduled for July 19.The move, if 
approved, would eliminate plans for a gas station and all other commercial 
development, drastically reduce the number of houses allowed and ban 
construction in wetland areas on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan has said the rezoning would be a major setback in his battle to develop 
the property near the corner of Reino Road and Kimber Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also delayed voting on a proposal to prevent Reino Road from being 
widened from two to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she believed it would be "more cohesive to 
consider (the road issue) on the same date as the Cohan changes." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to rezone Cohan's land followed the council's 1992 rejection of a 
plan for a shopping center and nearly 200 homes on the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 That rejection prompted Cohan to sue the city. If he prevails in his appeal of 
the ruling against him, the zone changes the council is considering will have 
no impact on his ability to develop his land. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: EAST COUNTY; VANDERKOLK AIDE BAGGERLY LAID OFF 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk has laid off her chief of staff 
because she no longer needs an environmental planning specialist and must trim 
her office budget, the aide said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Baggerly, 50, said his last day of work will be June 30, although 
VanderKolk does not leave office until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a slowdown of work, and I've been laid off," Baggerly said. 
"There's another budget shortfall coming up, and Maria wanted to do something 
about her budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Baggerly works on long-range planning issues at the county Hall of 
Administration and not in VanderKolk's district office, he was most expendable, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She obviously felt that the long-term environmental review that I'm good at 
is something she's not going to need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggerly denied a rift with VanderKolk. But county sources said the two had a 
recent disagreement over office policy. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk was in New York on county business and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggerly, an Ojai Valley environmental consultant before joining the new 
supervisor's staff in 1991, said he will return to consulting and will probably 
focus on air quality issues. DARYL KELLEY

SIMI POLICE BICYCLE DETAIL PEDALS TO EARLY SUCCESS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: BARELY A 
WEEK OLD, THE FIVE-MAN SQUAD HAS MADE FELONY DRUG ARRESTS, TRAFFIC STOPS AND 
COUNTLESS FACE-TO-FACE CONTACTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Lurking near a shiny mini-truck with a claw hammer in his hand, the would-be 
burglar did not even hear Simi Valley Police Officer Dave Livingstone cruise up 
behind him in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, whatcha doing there?" Livingstone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning lazily, the suspect suddenly found himself gaping into the helmeted 
cop's gun muzzle and his mountain bike's blazing halogen headlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, well I. . ., " he struggled. "Someone's been breaking into my friend's 
car, I've been watching his car, someone's breaking into cars around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the hammer, Livingstone frisked the man and grilled him for a few 
minutes, then told him to get lost and flung the hammer into the brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Car burglars have been hitting this string of parking lots along the Arroyo 
Simi and slipping away on footpaths where police cars cannot go. Maybe, 
Livingstone said as he rode away Wednesday night, the bikes will change that. 
</P>
<P>
 With its new five-man bicycle squad, Simi Valley joins Ventura, Oxnard, West 
Hollywood and Venice in putting officers on bikes to bring them closer to the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a week old, the program here is surprisingly successful, said 
Livingstone's colleague, Officer Bo Stephenson of the department's Special 
Enforcement Detail. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is used to working on gang and drug cases from unmarked cars. Yet in 
just a few nights, two-man teams of bike-riding officers have made felony drug 
arrests, dozens of traffic stops and countless face-to-face contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a pretty aggressive unit, and we thought, 'Aww, bike detail -- it'll be 
more of a P. R. shot,' " Stephenson said. "But we found out we've been able to 
do the same thing on bicycles we've been doing in cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The customized 21-speed Giant ATX mountain bikes can go quickly where bulky 
cruisers cannot -- down narrow alleys, through apartment complexes and along 
the Arroyo Simi trails that stretch the length of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 They can easily sneak up on lawbreakers who are conditioned to watch for 
police cars but never consider bicycles a threat -- people smoking dope, 
throwing gang signs or just driving dangerously through Simi Valley's strip 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're out here in the open, and you can smell things, you can hear things 
people are saying," Livingstone said, rolling through Sycamore Plaza. "People 
riding by in a car might be talking about drugs, and they don't think that you 
might be a cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Proving his point, a Chevy Blazer roared up to a stop sign directly in front 
of Livingstone and chirped to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey!" Livingston shouted, "Pull over!" 
</P>
<P>
 Astonished, the 16-year-old driver complied, sitting still for a stern lecture 
before Livingstone let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Livingstone cruised through Rancho Simi Community Park and stopped a 
teen-ager clad head to toe in baggy black Raiders' gear. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager identified himself as a member of a Pomona gang, just hanging 
out with his friends -- enough for Livingstone to fill out a field interview 
card that will help police track the youth in any future gang conflict in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name's Officer Livingstone," he said, scoping the boy's pupils with a 
flashlight for signs of drug use. "I'm in charge of gangs out here, and I don't 
want you causing any trouble out here." 
</P>
<P>
 After patting him down for drugs or weapons, Livingstone moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikes, the officers concede, are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedal-pushers must send for a cruiser to pick up anyone they arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 They cannot race to a crime scene more than a mile or two away. 
</P>
<P>
 And high-speed chases are out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bicycles give the officers the mobility to patrol more than 20 miles a 
night, and an intimacy with the public that seemed to vanish in many 
departments decades ago with the advent of patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great, I love the personal touch," said Jim Marx, a midtown 
resident whom Livingstone met on patrol Wednesday night. "It's like it was when 
the cops used to walk a beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The bike is also a kid magnet, and Livingstone doles out dozens of DARE 
stickers and pencils to the littlest ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a bad-ass bike," said one teen-ager outside a video-game parlor. After 
quizzing Livingstone on the bike's Japanese cranks and shock-absorbing forks, 
the youth said admiringly, "Smoooooth." 
</P>
<P>
 At a total cost of about $1,000 apiece, the department has fitted off-the-rack 
bikes with dual rechargeable headlight systems, mileage computers and first-aid 
kits. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers also carry 9-millimeter service pistols with extra ammunition, 
pepper spray and collapsible steel batons that won't tangle in a rider's legs 
the way full-length nightsticks would. 
</P>
<P>
 In 40 hours of bike training at the Los Angeles Sheriff's Academy, they 
learned everything from curb-hopping and repair techniques to special nutrition 
and ways of using the bicycle as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 They also learned how to maximize stealth and mobility, gliding quietly on 
narrow rubber tires and well-oiled gears along paths only a few inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we drop down to the granny gears and feather the brakes, we can pretty 
much ride into apartment complexes," Livingstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Livingstone used that method to search for an Alzheimer's patient who 
had been missing for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the man had disappeared before, he was always found close to home. So 
while cruisers prowled the streets, Livingstone threaded his way along the maze 
of sidewalks and driveways crisscrossing Simi Valley's densest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was not reunited with his family until the next day, but Livingstone 
had searched territory in less than an hour that would have taken far longer on 
foot.

OPPONENTS OF HOUSING PROJECT WARN OF FAULT LINE; THOUSAND OAKS: RESIDENTS CALL 
THE HUGE DOS VIENTOS DEVELOPMENT 'ILL-CONCEIVED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Punching up their battle against the huge Dos Vientos development, Thousand 
Oaks residents on Thursday called city leaders immoral for considering allowing 
homes to be built near an earthquake fault line. 
</P>
<P>
 The local branch of the Sierra Club added 200 pages of equally fiery 
criticism, in a hefty analysis challenging Dos Vientos' most recent 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the residents and the Sierra Club claimed the Dos Vientos project -- up 
to 2,350 houses on a rugged ranch north of Potrero Road -- will endanger the 
health of nearby residents by creating unacceptable traffic, noise and air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 And they blasted a consultant's proposal to safeguard Dos Vientos houses from 
potentially dangerous electromagnetic fields by moving power lines across the 
street to Broome Ranch, a 640-acre wilderness park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the whole project is ill-conceived," said Michelle Koetke, a 
spokeswoman for the group Residents to Preserve Newbury Park. "The land should 
not be built on." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has already approved a contract guaranteeing developers the right 
to build 2,350 houses on the rolling foothills of Dos Vientos. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the developers will pay the city $12.6 million, along with the 
standard fees for parks, schools and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract gives the council flexibility to shift up to 10% of the houses 
from one portion of Dos Vientos to another, if the transfer would help preserve 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials have shown little inclination to swerve from the contract's 
outline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me, when you have a contract with someone, you're obligated to 
stay within the confines of that contract," Councilman Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had a chance to wipe 136 homes from the project last fall, 
when Courtly Homes, one of the project's two developers, defaulted on a payment 
required under the contract. Instead, city leaders chose to mediate the 
financial dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months later, they still have not selected a mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will get yet another opportunity to review Dos Vientos on July 
12, when they hold a public hearing on a tract map detailing the location of 
220 houses along Potrero and Lynn roads. Although the contract guarantees the 
developer the right to build those homes, the city must still approve the 
placement and design of each unit. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report analyzing the 220-house tract concludes that 
construction would carry only two significant ill effects: extra noise along 
Wendy Drive and the loss of wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those don't seem to be blockbusters," Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut noise along Wendy Drive, Councilwoman Judy Lazar suggested installing 
speed bumps to slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents are pushing for more. 
</P>
<P>
 They want the city to consider canceling the development contract and slashing 
the number of houses to be built on Dos Vientos. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the development agreement was signed in 1990, when environmental 
information was incomplete, residents contend that the contract cannot be 
legally binding. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are definite health and safety issues here that can't be slipped under 
the rug," Sierra Club leader Cassandra Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for developer Operating Engineers, Wayne Jett, rejected that 
theory outright. "The development agreement is certainly binding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Councilman Frank Schillo, who helped negotiate the agreement, said he 
would consider revisiting the contract "if new information came to light about 
(environmental) effects that could not be mitigated." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the contract contains a clause allowing the city to govern Dos 
Vientos "to the extent reasonably required in order to prevent a condition 
dangerous to the health and safety of residents of the project or adjoining 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 In their environmental impact report, the most recent in a series of analyses, 
the city's consultants argue that building on Dos Vientos "poses no hazard" 
because it appears to be inactive. As a safeguard against possible shaking, 
they recommended that all homes remain at least 20 feet from the fault line.

HIGH HOPES GREET OUTLET MALL'S GRAND OPENING; OXNARD: SHOPPERS ANTICIPATE 
BARGAINS, OFFICIALS LOOK FORWARD TO NEW SOURCE OF SALES-TAX REVENUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard College student Maria Garcia has filled out a dozen applications for 
retail jobs at the city's new outlet mall. With a job at the mall -- preferably 
at a children's clothing store -- she hopes to get an employee discount she can 
use to dress her 2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard city officials also have high hopes for the Oxnard Outlet Mall, a group 
of sand-and-maroon colored buildings near the Rice Avenue exit of the Ventura 
Freeway. For them, it represents a chance to boost sales-tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's three-day gala opening begins today, with 29 stores ready for 
business, including Max Studio, Corning, Geoffrey Beene and Carters, a 
children's clothing store. Ten more are expected to open next week. But 
shoppers in search of the Gap will have to wait two weeks for that store to 
open, the developers said. 
</P>
<P>
 For shoppers like Donna Schulze of Santa Paula, the Oxnard Outlet Mall is a 
candy-apple temptation. Even though she worries about its impact on longtime 
merchants in the area, many of whom are still struggling to recover from the 
recession, she admits she is eager to see what the Gap Outlet has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 From discount shoppers to traffic experts, eyes are on the much-touted mall to 
see what effect it will have on Ventura County, as well as on Oxnard, which 
with its auto center, Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, is rapidly turning into one of 
the busiest retail centers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is that it will improve our sales-tax situation and that we'll be 
able to generate much more revenues from it," Mayor Manuel Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's developers, US Outlets and St. Louis-based Fru-Con Development, 
have spent $400,000 promoting the grand opening. Keith Kennon, of US Outlets, 
said his company already has plans for expansion -- they hope to double the 
mall's size by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Transportation Director Samia Maximous said the city's concerns over 
increased traffic on the Rose and Rice Avenue exits had been resolved by 
developers, who paid to widen some lanes and install new traffic signals. But 
she said city engineers would monitor the area for problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For this weekend's grand opening, developers said they expect 30,000 shoppers 
a day.  
</P>
<P>
 The expert shoppers came early, dropping by several days ago when about a 
dozen stores were open for business. They prowled suspiciously, carefully 
inspecting for bargains and quality but making few purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just curious," said Collette Jones of Camarillo, who was shopping with 
a friend. "Today we'll kind of get a pulse for what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was unfortunate that Camarillo did not beat Oxnard in the race to 
build the area's first outlet mall. "We sure could have used the sales-tax 
boost," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jones didn't buy anything, saying, "The prices are a little steep," 
she said she would be back. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlet malls are an irresistible temptation for many Americans, said Roy 
Adler, a professor of marketing at Pepperdine University in Malibu. "Everyone 
loves to think they're getting a bargain," he said. "It's factory-direct so 
it's got to be a great deal, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 He described the classic outlet mall customer as middle to upper-middle class 
and most likely a woman. They are treasure hunters, willing to travel great 
distances to save money, and they measure every purchase by what it might cost 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulze, the Santa Paula shopper looking for the Gap, said outlets can provoke 
a frenzy of perhaps unnecessary spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good in some ways to have all this stuff," she said. "But it's a little 
like going to the Price Club. You buy more than you need. I do feel sorry for 
the local merchants though, because it's tough to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials said local merchants reacted with more fear to Wal-Mart, 
which opened last year. They said the city hopes to start a shuttle service 
between the outlet mall and stores across the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time a new business comes in, that's a concern for someone," Councilman 
Michael Plisky said. "But it just means everybody sharpens their pencils and 
starts doing better to compete. Competition is healthy."

NAVY DETONATES 'SHIP SHOCK' BLAST; ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS SAY THE OFFSHORE TEST 
OF NEW DESTROYER DID NOT HARM MARINE MAMMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of debate and legal maneuvering, the Navy on Thursday detonated a 
10,000-pound underwater explosive in the first "ship shock" trial of a new 
class of destroyers about 85 miles southwest of Point Mugu, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said the 11:45 a.m. blast apparently caused no deaths or injury 
to marine mammals in the area, which environmentalists have described as 
teeming with sea life. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Frank Thorp said a Navy tugboat towed the 10,000-pound charge a 
short distance away from the John Paul Jones, a new Aegis-class guided missile 
destroyer. The explosive was detonated at a depth of about 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this test was a complete success," said Thorp. "I think it proves 
that we can conduct these kinds of operations safely and that we were being 
honest when we talked about our concern for the marine environment and mammals 
who live there." 
</P>
<P>
 Thorp said the test had been delayed almost two weeks because of bad weather 
or encounters with marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a 
nonprofit environmental group that had fought in federal court to restrict the 
testing, said he was relieved to hear that no marine mammals were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to be concerned about potential impacts of ship shock testing," 
Reynolds said. "We are relieved that this test was conducted off of the 
continental shelf and away from the Channel Islands and in very deep water. But 
obviously, extensive post-test monitoring will be essential." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a federal court settlement made public May 2, the Navy was allowed to 
conduct four 10,000-pound "ship shock" tests while it prepared a full 
environmental impact report on the testing program. Initially, the Navy 
proposed as many as 270 underwater detonations over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's detonation, the program will be on hold for at least nine 
months while the EIR is being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the defense council in the lawsuit against the Navy was Save the 
Whales, American Oceans Campaign, the Humane Society of the United States and 
Heal the Bay. The National Marine Fisheries Service approved the testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Godley, a Ventura-based environmental activist, said he doubted the 
Navy's claim that no marine mammals were injured or harassed by the detonation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because the Navy is saying that no damage occurred doesn't mean that it 
didn't happen," Godley said. "It could take weeks or months or longer before we 
know what kind of damage this explosion caused." 
</P>
<P>
 The testing program, which was mandated by Congress, is intended to test the 
strength of ship hulls and internal electronics packages, and ability of crews 
to survive in simulated battle conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorp said that neither the John Paul Jones, its crew nor an estimated 180 
civilian scientific and environmental observers were harmed by Thursday's test. 
As a precaution, the group of marine biologists and veterinarians will stay at 
the test site until late today to watch for any dead or injured marine mammals 
that may not have been initially observed.

SHERIFF'S MOORPARK DIVISION GETS NEW LEADER; PERSONNEL: LT. MARTIN ROUSE, 37, A 
16-YEAR VETERAN OF THE DEPARTMENT, WILL REPLACE LT. GEOFF DEAN IN HEADING THE 
20-MEMBER TEAM. 
</P>

<P>
 A lieutenant for the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, promoted just a 
month ago from sergeant, was named Thursday to take control of the department's 
20-member Moorpark division. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Martin Rouse, 37, will take over from Lt. Geoff Dean, who has headed the 
Moorpark law enforcement team since August, 1991. Dean is moving to a new 
assignment as an administrator at the new county jail on Todd Road near Santa 
Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, a 16-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, has worked in Moorpark 
for more than four years. During that time he has served as patrol sergeant for 
the Moorpark division and last year was put in charge of the three detectives 
working in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was looking forward to taking charge of the Moorpark division on 
Monday, but as yet was not planning any new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It already is a well-run department," Rouse said. "I would like to sit back a 
little and see how it's working before I try and change anything. I don't want 
to change just for the sake of changing."  
</P>
<P>
 Rouse had high praise for his former commanding officer -- the two attended 
the police academy together -- saying Dean was an innovative commander who 
worked well with the community and the deputies under him. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dean) has a lot to be proud of here," Rouse said. "He accomplished a 
tremendous amount. He's been an effective leader and a personal friend to a lot 
of the deputies here, which not many commanders can do. I think the team spirit 
he developed here has made Moorpark a popular place (for deputies) to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse said one of his most important tasks will be to continue the good 
working relationship Dean established with the Moorpark City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 The city contracts with the Sheriff's Department, which staffs the 20-member 
Moorpark enforcement team. Rouse said the city has made law and order a top 
priority, allocating more than 60% of the city's operating budget to law 
enforcement. The city is now considering increasing the amount spent on law 
enforcement to more than 70% of the budget, or $2.6 million, to maintain the 
existing level of services next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and City Manager Steve Kueny, who interviewed Rouse for the 
job, approved of the new appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an excellent choice," said Mayor Paul Lawrason. "He's sat in for Dean at 
several City Council meetings, and while he served as patrol sergeant he was 
the person I spoke with if I had any questions about any incidents that 
occurred in the city. He's a very bright professional. I'm really pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, who grew up in Santa Monica, said he loves Moorpark, where he has lived 
for nine years with his wife and two children. He said he planned to continue 
his community involvement, which includes volunteering for Moorpark's annual 
Country Days celebration and for his local church.  
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what made (Dean) successful were the relationships he developed in 
the community," Rouse said. "I'd like to see that continue. We want people to 
know that we have an open-door policy. Working out in the community, I feel, is 
the best crime prevention of all."

PANEL OKS $5 MILLION TO PURCHASE PARKLAND; APPROPRIATIONS: THE FUNDS ARE 
EARMARKED TO BUY PROPERTY IN THE SANTA MONICAS. THE AMOUNT IS FAR LESS THAN 
REQUESTED BY PARK ADVOCATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An influential House panel approved $5 million Thursday to purchase land next 
year for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area -- the same amount 
included by President Clinton in his budget proposal but far less than park 
advocates had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), the park's leading advocate, had 
asked the Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies for $15 
million last month. This was the same figure recommended by a coalition of 39 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5 million is nearly 10% of the $49 million approved for park purchases 
nationwide -- a smaller percentage than the sprawling Southern California park 
has received previously. In addition, the recreation area was not given the 
largest sum of any unit of the national park system; the subcommittee included 
$6.5 million for Saguaro National Monument in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monicas, the National Park Service is seeking funds to acquire 19 
properties, totaling 500 acres along the Backbone Trail, which are estimated to 
cost $10 million. The 43-mile trail winds along the spine of the Santa Monica 
Mountains from Will Rogers State Park to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, nonetheless, sought to cast the subcommittee's decision, the first 
in the annual congressional budget process, in a positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased that the subcommittee continues to place a high priority on 
acquiring more park land in the Santa Monicas," Beilenson said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson had noted that the lingering California real-estate recession has 
created temporary buying opportunities. He also pointed out that, given the 
vulnerability of the mountainous land to wildfires and mudslides, buying 
property for open space could save large sums in future disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for the second consecutive year, the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation 
Area appears to be positioned to win a smaller share of the scarce parkland 
acquisition funds than it has in many earlier years. If this occurs, it will 
fare worse during these two years under Democrat Clinton than it generally did 
under Republican President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monicas received $4 million last year, which was far less than it 
had received for any fiscal year since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure approved by the Appropriations subcommittee becomes the figure 
adopted by the full House. The Senate generally approves less money than the 
House; the two sums are then reconciled in a conference committee of lawmakers 
from each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The key House panel's action came two days after voters rejected a $2-billion 
bond proposal to buy parkland that would have directed more than $85 million to 
the Santa Monicas Mountains Conservancy, a state agency that buys and manages 
land in the national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the bond measure's defeat, the conservancy and a sister agency, 
the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, will be forced to lay off 
more than a third of their employees and postpone significant property 
acquisitions, officials said.

MIKE PENNER: THE SPLASH DIPS INTO CUP FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in this soccer wonderland of ours, the Colombian national team fancies 
its footwork at Cal State Fullerton, Romania works out the kicks at UC Irvine, 
Sweden pounds some sweet balls at Loyola Marymount and Team USA undergoes 
survival training in Mission Viejo, all in preparation for a World Cup 
tournament that will be decided July 17 in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Anaheim, ancient burial ground of the unlamented California Surf, 
another feet-first entity springs to life tonight, whether we want it or not, 
giving us the opportunity this summer to watch soccer in every format 
imaginable -- day or night, indoor or outdoor, in front of 90,000 riotous 
foreigners or 5,000 Orange County thong-wearers who came mainly to check out 
the cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Anaheim Splash of the Continental Indoor Soccer League opens its 1994 
season tonight when it hosts the Las Vegas Dustdevils at The Pond, followed by 
Saturday and Tuesday night matches against the San Jose Grizzlies and the 
Houston Hotshots. 
</P>
<P>
 (The date I'm circling on my calendar is July 19 -- Washington Warthogs at 
Anaheim.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (pay attention here) used to be the Los Angeles United, not to be 
confused with the Los Angeles Lazers, and they now play in the CISL, not to be 
confused with the NPSL, although several of their league rivals, such as the 
San Diego Sockers and the Dallas Sidekicks, used to play in the MISL and later, 
the MSL. 
</P>
<P>
 But definitely not the NASL, APSL or USISL, the best that I can tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden Facility Management bought the United from Jerry Buss -- or, in the 
words of Splash "Co-Governor" Tim Orchard, "We transferred the debt" -- and 
moved it to The Pond, which is not so much an athletic arena as is it a theme 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks play at The Pond. So do the Bullfrogs. The Anaheim United simply 
wasn't going to cut it. The Pond only accepts puns, so a name change was 
needed, although it's still a mystery why Ogden said no to the Scum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Roughies were considered. The team mascot, according to public 
relations manager John Nicoletti, was to be "a tough little fish wearing boxing 
gloves." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, because "traffic is obviously a concern at The Pond, we considered the 
Anaheim Traffic and the Orange Crush, " Nicoletti says. "Although with the last 
one, you needed to get a certain sponsor to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 There was some support for the Anaheim Inferno, "but that was no good," 
Nicoletti says, "because there was a Phoenix franchise named the Inferno that 
folded mid-year and every indoor soccer player there is knows the problems they 
had. Bad karma." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Splash was it, and another pundora's box had been opened. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerleaders, of course, are the Mermaids. 
</P>
<P>
 The mascot is Finley the Dolphin, who may or may not be named after the Angel 
pitcher but is, judging from the media-guide photo, a first cousin to Barney 
the Annoying Dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 The gimmickry is nonstop. Billing itself as "the coolest team in town," the 
Splash will hold promotions nearly every home game. There will 4-For-$40 Night 
-- four tickets, four hot dogs, four popcorns and four sodas for $40. There 
will be Mermaid Poster Night. When Houston comes to town, there will be Country 
Kick Night -- everyone wearing a cowboy hat gets $2 off the normal ticket 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Shue, who plays Billy Campbell on "Melrose Place," has also been 
enlisted to play at least two games with the Splash as a "protected amateur." 
According to the Splash media guide, Shue has "an extensive soccer background," 
which includes earning four varsity letters and scoring eight goals in four 
years at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard says the idea is to appeal to the non-soccer fan of Southern 
California, which is keen marketing strategy, considering the legions of 
non-soccer fans living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you're not a soccer fan, you can enjoy yourself at one of our games," 
Orchard says. "The true soccer fan, most likely, is going to find the outdoor 
game more appealing. At an indoor crowd, you find more mothers and families . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this building we're playing in. You could sit here and enjoy yourself 
without even watching the game. People come here to get out of the heat, for 
the food, for the beer and the sodas, to look at the cheerleaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Or to look at the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to nail down who the prototypical indoor soccer fan is," Orchard 
says. "It could be a 6-year-old girl. It could be an 8-year-old boy. Or it 
could be a 35-year-old woman who loves to watch young soccer players run around 
in shorts." 
</P>
<P>
 And on the off-chance that a real soccer fan, exhausted from hooligan activity 
at the Rose Bowl, might want to kick back one evening with the Splash, he won't 
be stopped at the door. The Splash hopes to draft off the World Cup, capturing 
the addicted as well as the curious who happened to watch Cameroon tie Sweden, 
0-0, and now want to see what a goal looks like. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the World Cup leaves," Nicoletti says, "people are going to ask, 'Where 
can I go to see some more soccer?' Our hope is that they come to the indoor 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying, 'We're soccer, too -- only a faster-paced, harder-hitting, 
higher-scoring version of that. If you liked what you saw, come out and see 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you didn't like what you saw, come out and see this, too, the Splash 
also implores. 
</P>
<P>
 The scantily clad Mermaids will be here. And the overly clad Finley the 
Dolphin. And, next month, the Washington Warthogs.

IF STARKS STAYS THIS COLD, KNICKS MAY AS WELL BAG IT 
</P>

 Spill on Aisle 6, John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's you. 
</P>
<P>
 The former supermarket box person, still greeted at some road games by fans 
holding up brown bags, put the eggs on the bottom Wednesday night. He made 
three of 18 shots, including two of eight from behind the three-point line, as 
the flag bearer of the four-man New York backcourt that went a combined 10 for 
41. He had three assists and four turnovers. He gave Vernon Maxwell about 10 
open shots, the Rocket shooting guard figured, though Maxwell missed 12 of his 
16 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 1 of the NBA finals was a night off in general for decent basketball, but 
Starks was off, period. No shot was more symbolic than his three-point attempt 
with 1:40 left, after the Knicks had used a 13-4 rally to close within 79-76. 
It was an airball, which allowed the Rockets to regain the momentum and hold on 
for an 85-78 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I could have played a much better game, both offensively and 
defensively," Starks said Thursday before practice at the Summit, site of Game 
2 tonight. "As a player, you can't accept those types of games if you're going 
to be out here in those types of situations." 
</P>
<P>
 This situation was supposed to be a culminating moment of sorts for Starks, 
who had lived the playoff anguish with the other Knicks, but had also endured 
so much more. 
</P>
<P>
 No other Knick (and few in the NBA) had taken his career path, which included 
four colleges in four years and stints in the Continental Basketball Assn. and 
something called the World Basketball League before his success as an All-Star 
guard. He has even come back from March arthroscopic surgery for torn cartilage 
in his right knee, far enough back to counter Indiana's Reggie Miller for at 
least one night when he scored 26 points with New York facing elimination in 
Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks says the knee is fine. Teammates and his coach, Pat Riley, say it 
isn't. In the meantime, perhaps unable to get the same leg push behind his 
jumpers, he is a streak shooter who keeps heading in the wrong direction in the 
playoffs, having gone 36.8% against the Bulls and 39.2% versus the Pacers. Then 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so frustrated after Game 1 that a public relations assistant pulled 
sentry duty in front of him and told reporters there would be no comment from 
anyone in this locker stall. Starks, to use his day-after description, was too 
hot to talk. He was frustrated at a missed opportunity for a victory, but 
mostly he was hot about being so cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I have to start knocking down my shots," he said. "These are 
shots that they are going to give us, and we all have to step up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riley: "John is still coming back. He had one truly great game in the 
playoffs, Game 6 against Indiana, and he had a couple of great moments in some 
other games. But there has been inconsistency to his game, and I think a lot of 
it is (because) he's continually trying to come back and gain everything he 
lost with the injury. But I expect him to be in a better frame of mind 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks need him to be, mainly because they can't count on any other guard. 
On a team where the two biggest threats from the perimeter, when Starks 
disappears, are center Patrick Ewing and power forward Charles Oakley, his 
success is not a luxury but a necessity. So when he heads into tonight's Game 2 
shooting only 36.8% in the playoffs, below his 42% for the regular season and 
only slightly better than Maxwell's percentage on three-pointers in the 
postseason, the problem becomes much bigger than a shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The defenders seize on this opportunity, play off the guards and collapse 
inside to focus on Ewing and Oakley. At that point, the notion of a Knick 
offense is reduced to a rumor, certain to result in doom unless Starks, Derek 
Harper (three for 10 in Game 1), Greg Anthony (three for seven) and Hubert 
Davis (one for six) can keep the Rockets honest by hitting from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 History proves it. In the two regular-season games, both Rocket victories, 
Starks shot 40.5%, Davis 42.9%, Anthony 33.3% and Harper, in his one game after 
being traded, 37.5%. The Knicks scored 85 and 73 points, then got 78 Wednesday.

 "We missed 22 consecutive shots in Game 1 in New York," Riley said of the 
regular season. "We had a drought down here in the second game. We had a 
miserable drought (Wednesday). Now, their defense has something to do with it, 
but we go through some horrendous shooting spells, when they're doubling and 
taking away our paint game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a professional player that gets paid a lot of money, you make those 
shots. You make them. You make your free throws. . . . We were two for 27 (in 
one stretch) with 20 dead-open shots. You either make them or you miss, so 
going out here (in practice) and working on shooting for an hour ain't gonna 
make a damn bit of difference. You either make them or you don't."

ARM & HAMMER; MONDESI'S THROWS GET A LOT OF THE ATTENTION, BUT HE ALSO DOES 
DAMAGE WITH HIS BAT 
</P>

<P>
 He's built like a minivan with the power of a Mack truck. Just ask Delino 
DeShields, who had the unfortunate experience of colliding with Raul Mondesi 
one night. It knocked DeShields cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi's arm is rated by scouts as one of the top three in the National 
League, and for confirmation of that, ask first baseman Eric Karros, who 
practices self-preservation by keeping an eye on right field. "If I'm not 
looking all the time, I'm liable to get a ball in the back of my head," Karros 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi stops at nothing in his quest to throw a runner out, especially if 
it's at first base, a feat he accomplished in spring training. He leads NL 
outfielders with 12 assists, though his reputation took a while to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they keep running on me," Mondesi said about a month into 
the season, "they know I'm going to throw them out." 
</P>
<P>
 When he hits the ball, Mondesi simply keeps running, often turning singles 
into doubles and, on occasion, doubles into triples. His .336 batting average, 
.574 slugging percentage, 16 doubles, five triples, 75 hits, 22 multi-hit games 
and 30 extra-base hits rank him among the top seven in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers playing video games to giving interviews, partly because he is not 
comfortable with his English, but he is starting to get used to the attention, 
and that's fortunate. Because if Mondesi, 23, keeps this up, he will be the 
Dodgers' third consecutive NL rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel any pressure," Mondesi said. "A 
</P>
<P>
 lot of people are talking about it, but I just go and play hard and see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda has raved about the virtues of the 
young player from the Dominican Republic, calling him a five-point player -- 
"He can run, hit, hit with power, field and throw," Lasorda said.  
</P>
<P>
 But there were many who questioned Mondesi's dedication, believing that he was 
too flighty, too moody, too stubborn and too inconsistent to be an impact 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to kick him in the shins and slap him in the face," said Ralph 
Avila, Dodger vice president, who has been instrumental in the discovery and 
development of many of the team's Dominican players.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's not an easy guy, he's tough. He was too aggressive on the field, and off 
the field he was the same, chasing too many girls, staying out too late. I have 
to give him credit, he doesn't drink, smoke or fool with drugs, but he liked to 
be that macho type; we Latin players are all this way. When we get some 
recognition from the fans, we get pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila was so concerned about Mondesi's off-the-field activities that a couple 
of winters ago, he had him tailed for two months. "Everywhere I went, there 
were these same guys," Mondesi said, smiling. "I realized later what he had 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 When Avila received the report, he was relieved to find that even though 
Mondesi was partying, he wasn't abusing any substances. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would play in the game, then go out every night until 3 or 4 in the 
morning," Avila said. "I would tell him that he could not keep up that pace, 
that even though he was 18 and as strong as a mule, he would destroy his body. 
He would listen, then five minutes later he was at it again. So I sat him down 
in front of Tommy (Lasorda) and said, 'This is your last chance. You have to 
shape up.' I knew he wasn't drinking, but what if he gets in a fight in a bar? 
I told him he was being selfish, that he wasn't thinking of his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage seems to have calmed Mondesi down somewhat. He and his wife, Ada, 
have an 18-month-old son, Raul Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 He has even cut down on his eating. Former Dodger Pedro Martinez delights in a 
story about Mondesi eating 22 pieces of pizza one night while they were both in 
the minor leagues. Mondesi explained that he was hungry. "I still like to eat, 
but not that much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi started working harder, playing harder and smiling more. He was able 
to put behind a much-publicized incident that occurred during the 1992 season 
when he pouted after outfielder Tom Goodwin got the call to Los Angeles instead 
of him, and he reacted by purposely missing an Albuquerque Dukes game. He was 
immediately demoted to double-A San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me after the Dukes' plane left and knew he'd made a mistake," Avila 
said. "He was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the demotion, Mondesi injured his wrist, which required surgery. 
Then he hurt his left knee and underwent more surgery but still managed to 
record 14 assists in only 53 games. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the 1993 season at Albuquerque, then made his major league debut in 
July, one of two stints with the Dodgers last season. By October, though, the 
Dodgers still weren't sure whether Mondesi, a center fielder, was ready to 
replace Brett Butler, so they picked up Butler's option for 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 It was during the Caribbean World Series that Mondesi convinced the Dodgers of 
his readiness, earning most-valuable-player honors while playing in front of 
Executive Vice President Fred Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, Mondesi hit about 150 curveballs after every exhibition game. 
He was one of the last Dodgers out of the clubhouse, just ahead of Lasorda, who 
had thrown the curveballs, and the clubhouse attendants, who had to wait until 
they were finished. But Lasorda had told Mondesi during the winter that he had 
a good chance to become a starter, and Mondesi was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts have long contended that Mondesi's swing has too many holes in it and 
that he isn't patient enough at the plate. Lasorda still reminds him every day 
not to swing at bad pitches, and those swings are diminishing. Mondesi is 
batting .377 during a current 13-game hitting streak, with six multi-hit games, 
including three home runs and 10 runs batted in. He had a 14-game streak 
earlier this season. In his last 29 games, he has raised his average 44 points 
from .292. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he hits strikes, he hits the ball as hard as Mike Piazza," said Reggie 
Smith, the Dodgers' hitting instructor. "The more at-bats he gets, the more 
confident he gets. He is progressing faster than I thought he would." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the Dodgers, Mondesi started the season in an offensive slump, 
and it was coach Manny Mota who persuaded him not to worry about it, simply to 
play his game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous about the year, and he told me to just go play hard every day," 
Mondesi said. "I won't rest until I play 10 years in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 One of seven children, Mondesi is the only member of his family who is 
athletic. "Since he was a little kid, I knew he was going to be good in the 
major leagues someday -- he had natural talent," said Mondesi's brother, 
Francisco. "We were poor growing up and we all worked, but Raul just went to 
school and played baseball. Things are much better for everyone now with Raul 
in the majors." 
</P>
<P>
 The first day Avila saw Mondesi hit, he couldn't sign him fast enough, paying 
him a bonus of $2,000. "He was 15 and with raw tools as green as the grass," 
Avila said. "But he hit balls (at the Dominican Academy) over the bank in 
left-center field about 385 to 400 feet. He ran the 60 yards in 7.1 seconds and 
had better-than-average arm strength. I signed him immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi was skinny then, weighing about 150 pounds. Now, he has has bulked up 
to 210 pounds on his 5-foot-11 frame.  
</P>
<P>
 Al LaMacchia, a scout for 38 years and a vice president of the Toronto Blue 
Jays, compares Mondesi to the Montreal Expos' Larry Walker and the St. Louis 
Cardinals' Mark Whiten. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and Larry Walker are the two best right fielders in the game today," 
LaMacchia said. "Mondesi's arm is a little stronger, but Walker may have a 
quicker release. Whiten has a great arm, but he takes a little longer to get 
rid of the ball. I don't know if there have been three right fielders of this 
caliber before in the same league, playing at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 LaMacchia remembers a Dodger spring game against the New York Yankees when 
Daryl Boston singled to right field and, as he made the turn toward second, was 
thrown out by Mondesi on a perfect one-hop strike to first base. During that 
game, Mondesi also saved a run when he charged a single and threw out a runner 
at the plate. "I also saw him charge a ball and make a perfect throw to second 
base to get the runner," LaMacchia said. "It was a Roberto Clemente type of 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The comparisons to Clemente come more often now. Mota, who played with 
Clemente, said Clemente believed he could throw anybody out, and so does 
Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent game, after Mondesi made an exceptional backhanded catch on the 
run, he was puzzled at the fuss being made about it. "You think that was a 
great catch?" Mondesi said. "I have made much better catches than that. They 
will come."

WORLD CUP '94 / 7 DAYS AND COUNTING; JUST ERNIE; DUTCH-AMERICAN ACHIEVES 
IDENTITY AS U.S. STRIKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As promised, Ernie Stewart has arrived, punctually, to retrieve a reporter 
from the central train station on a misty fall day. Negotiating the narrow 
streets with expert speed, Stewart drives to the grounds of his soccer team, 
Willem II, then ushers his guest through a maze of dark rooms and corridors 
leading out to the green field. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundsman shouts hello. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Stewart's home, but it isn't. When he returns the man's greeting in 
Dutch, he's not speaking his native tongue. The next time he leaves the 
country, he may use either his Dutch or his American passport. He speaks of 
having an American family and a Dutch family. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 25, has always been a man in the middle, caught between two cultures. 
Perhaps that's why, when he's playing as the lone striker on the U.S. World Cup 
team, he's so comfortable. There's no tugging one way or another, no conflict. 
He's alone and he can establish his own identity. Just Ernie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A mixed-race child is fortunate to grow up in the Netherlands, where tolerance 
is bred into the national character. Stewart's American father, a senior master 
sergeant in the Air Force, met and married his Dutch wife, Annemein, and the 
couple was never bothered by comments about race or Ernie Sr.'s military 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple created a home environment that meshed American and Dutch cultures, 
and Ernie Jr. grew up going to English-language schools and playing American 
sports such as softball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't picked on in school, maybe because I was so good in sports," Stewart 
said. "Everything I got in my hands or touched with my feet, I could do right 
away, instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe because of that, I got a little more respect from the kids. I didn't 
start soccer until I was 11 years old. For the Dutch, that's real late." 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Stewart left the American school and started attending Dutch 
school. His new friends played soccer, so Stewart did, too. He took to the 
sport immediately and progressed through the Dutch youth system at twice the 
normal speed. By 17, Stewart was asked to join the reserve team for a 
professional club. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience was not a good one, except for what Stewart learned through 
assimilation. He knew right away that the club wasn't right for him, and made 
the remarkable decision to leave the pros and return to his amateur club for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he had done in the youth ranks, Stewart rose quickly. His name and 
exceptional speed came to the attention of VVV in Venlo, where he played for a 
year, starting on the reserve team. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later he moved to his present club, Willem II. The club is not one of 
the Dutch league's best, nor is it among the worst, and both the club and 
Stewart got comfortable right away as he scored 17 goals in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said he likes to keep busy, but his schedule for the next few years 
went well beyond that. He decided to go to an intensive school to get a degree 
in physical education. To combine school and professional soccer is normally 
unheard of. But Stewart's parents acted as a voice in the back of his head, 
asking: "What happens if you get injured and can't play? How will you support 
yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting demands were difficult. Stewart lived on campus and went to 
classes from 8:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. Then he took a train to practice, which 
ran from 4:40 to 6:30 p.m. Often, he fell asleep while riding the train home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to make that school, that was my dream," Stewart said. "That 
was everything to me. (But) I didn't want to sit on the bench. I started 
getting burned out. My coach told me to take a rest. It was to wake me up. At 
that time, I went on to the field as if it was my work, as if it was my job. I 
didn't have any fun, everything was school. It exhausted me. It was too tough 
at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I finished my school, I never gave up on my school. There was a time when 
I thought, 'What do I do? Do I go for soccer and try to earn a living there? Or 
do I try to keep my soccer and try to go to school with it?' I chose for the 
last one, with my parents. I'm thankful to them for telling me to prepare a 
career to fall back on." 
</P>
<P>
 His career was a curious thing. No sooner did Stewart make the starting lineup 
than a new coach was hired, and Stewart found himself back with the reserve 
team. In his three years with Willem II, there have been three coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite breaking his left foot before the start of 1992-93 competition, 
Stewart managed to score eight goals that season and eight goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the U.S. team was qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, a coach told 
Stewart to write a letter to the U.S. Soccer Federation, letting them know he 
was an American. He got called up for one game, against Poland in Portugal, and 
that was it. Stewart said, in retrospect, it was naive to think that he might 
make the team, since no one had been paying attention to him before. 
</P>
<P>
 His first sustained chance came last summer in the U.S. Cup. After his injury 
and disappointing club season, Stewart's performance was heartening: He set up 
a goal in the U.S. victory over England and scored against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all that had happened that season, it was a turning point for me," he 
said. "After that, I said to myself, 'I'm not going to think about last season 
or the seasons before that. I'm going to start all over and see where I end 
up.' I'd say the U.S. Cup was a turning point on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that I ever gave up on what I could do, but in that U.S. Cup, 
everything worked out for me again. When you finally see that everything you 
know you are capable of doing is coming back to you, it's a beautiful thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's father saw him play for the American team for the first time during 
the U.S. Cup. It was his father's family in Texas that made Stewart feel at 
home when he visited at 15. Stewart said he was amazed to see a house fill up 
with boisterous aunts and uncles and cousins, and the table suddenly fill with 
food. When he has been with the U.S. team, playing anywhere near them, his 
Texas relatives have often driven through the night to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so his Dutch relatives, whose reserve, he said, prevents them from 
expressing their feelibngs about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, predictably, is an amalgam of both. He's naturally reserved and 
quiet, but when drawn out, he's as loud as any typical American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never look back and I never look too much in advance," he said. "I live day 
to day and see what happens. I am optimistic. I just hope everything works out 
the way it's working out right now. If that happens, I could look at a sunny 
future." World Cup

 Stevens slapped and bunted her way to a .542 average and scored 24 runs in 20 
games for the Pacific Coast League champions. She also had 10 RBIs to 
complement her 16 stolen bases. Her value? A collision knocked her out of six 
games and her team lost five of them.

 Walsh, a second baseman, batted .475 with 11 RBIs and scored 22 runs for the

 Though Wilson was out of position as a pitcher, she was among the leaders with

play both for Pacific.

NORTHRIDGE ADDS LEFT-HANDER TO DEPLETED STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge baseball team took a big step toward solving a 
daunting problem this week when pitcher Erasmo Ramirez signed a letter of 
intent to play for the Matadors in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, a left-hander from Saddleback High, should bolster a staff that was 
decimated by injury last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the Matadors, who finished 25-30 for their worst record in six 
seasons under Coach Bill Kernen, did not have a left-handed pitcher on their 
1994 roster. 
</P>
<P>
 During the regular season, Ramirez was 7-2 with an earned-run average of 2.54. 
In 80 innings, he struck out 82 and walked 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got a chance to become a real good college pitcher," Kernen 
said. "He's a good athlete with a good arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge signed another high school pitcher, right-hander Carlos Velazco of 
Sylmar, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of Northridge's original three-man pitching rotation were 
sidelined because of season-ending arm injuries this year and the staff 
finished with an ERA of 6.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior college players who have signed with Northridge are infielder Grant 
Hohman of Harbor, catcher Robert Fick of Ventura and right-handed pitchers Rob 
Crabtree of Cypress and Chris Romero of East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kel Watrin of Santa Rosa College, the state junior college champion in the 
men's javelin, has made a commitment to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Watrin, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Canada, has a 
personal best of 218 feet 2 inches. He finished second in the 1993 state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 His addition should give the Matadors a solid one-two punch next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Mike McClintock threw a personal best of 221-0 this season.

SCYPHERS REINSTATED AS SIMI VALLEY COACH; FUTURE UNCLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers was reinstated as Simi Valley High baseball coach Thursday, but 
he remains unsure if he will be rehired for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who was cleared of accusations of financial and disciplinary 
improprieties Wednesday by the Ventura County District Attorney's office, is on 
a one-year coaching contract, as are all coaches in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 School principals submit the names of coaches to the school board for approval 
each fall, and the board typically approves whatever recommendations the 
principal makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Simi Valley Principal Kathryn Scroggin renew Scyphers' contract for next 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Six-Million-Dollar question," Scyphers said. "She hasn't given me 
any indication." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Scroggin nor Supt. Mary Beth Wolford could not be reached for comment 
Thursday night. But both have declined to comment on Scyphers' situation 
because it is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin has submitted a letter reprimanding Scyphers to the district, said 
school board member Doug Crosse. The letter contained no recommendation of 
whether Scyphers should be back as coach, though, Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school year ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended from coaching May 3, when police, at the request 
of the district, began an investigation into his financial and disciplinary 
practices as baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has coached the Pioneers for 16 seasons, admitted to improperly 
accepting money for use of the Simi Valley High baseball field, circumventing 
district channels. Scyphers also admitted to using some of the field rental 
money to pay his assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under investigation was a team disciplinary practice called "the block," 
in which players bid small sums of money for the right to paddle teammates who 
violated team rules.

DUCKS WON'T OFFER LOACH NEW CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks will not make a contract offer to former King forward Lonnie 
Loach, who had 91 points last season for the Ducks' minor league affiliate, the 
San Diego Gulls, but appeared in only three games with the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Loach was playing out the option year of his contract, and although Duck 
General Manager Jack Ferreira has until July to make an offer, he says he will 
not do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of five Duck players who were playing out their options is expected 
to be offered a contract -- center Jarrod Skalde, who spent most of the season 
in San Diego but provided a spark with the Anaheim team after an injury to 
Anatoli Semenov. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said he will not offer contracts to minor league forwards Trevor 
Halverson, Robin Bawa or Joel Savage.

KINGS CLOSER TO A POSITION FOR TAYLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kings are moving closer to finding a specific role for retired right wing 
Dave Taylor in their revamped front office. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who announced his retirement in April after 17 seasons with the Kings, 
spoke with new owner Joseph Cohen last week and had a meeting with General 
Manager Sam McMaster on Thursday at the Forum.Taylor, 38, said he was pleased 
with the tone of both meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster said: "On the management side, there's a tremendous amount of things 
he can do in the hockey and business aspects. I'm sure we'll be able to make 
everybody happy. There are a lot of duties -- communicating with Phoenix, 
working with some of our younger players, advance scouting and helping Mr. 
Cohen with the new building. There's a lot to do here." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, McMaster said the Kings will probably have training camp this fall 
at their practice facility, Ice-o-plex, in North Hills. They have been at Lake 
Arrowhead for the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We travel so much, why take them away for another five days?" he said. "I 
think they tried it (away), and I'm not sure it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are also completing arrangements for another three-year deal with 
their minor league affiliate in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide the Roadrunners with some scoring punch, McMaster has signed left 
wing Jeff Shevalier, who helped lead his junior team, the North Bay 
Centennials, to a berth in the Memorial Cup tournament. Shevalier, 20, was a 
sixth-round pick in the 1992 entry draft. The Kings did not offer a contract to 
goaltender Sandy Allan, a third-round selection in 1992, who will go back into 
the draft.

USC FOOTBALL RECRUIT WILL ANSWER ASSAULT CHARGES BEFORE GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antione Simpson, the USC football recruit charged last week with sexual 
assault, will testify before a grand jury in Houston later this month or in 
early July. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Schaffer, Simpson's attorney, said all "eight or nine" people at a May 29 
party where a 15-year-old girl says Simpson and a friend took turns restraining 
and assaulting her will testify on Simpson's behalf."Everyone who was there, 
except for the girl, supports Antione's version of the events, not the girl's," 
Schaffer said. "No witness supports the girl's story." 
</P>
<P>
 The possible prosecutor in the case, Harris County (Tex.) attorney Jane 
Waters, did not return calls Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, a 6-foot-2, 280-pound defensive end at La Porte High, was named the 
greater Houston area's defensive player of the year last season by the 
Touchdown Club of Houston. EARL GUSTKEY

 Jim Gott suffered through Wednesday night's game in Miami with what he thought 
was food poisoning. But Thursday in Chicago, his conditioned worsened, and 
within a few hours he was undergoing an appendectomy at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital.There were no complications, and he was put on the 15-day disabled 
list. He will be replaced in the bullpen by right-hander Rudy Seanez, who was 
called up from triple-A Albuquerque.  
</P>
<P>
 Gott was struggling and had been scored on in 10 of 27 games. He has a 5-2 
record with a 5.13 earned-run average and one save.  
</P>
<P>
 Seanez was originally acquired by the Dodgers before the 1992 season from the 
Cleveland Indians for Dennis Cook and Mike Christopher. A back condition 
sidelined Seanez for the season. That November, he was traded to the Colorado 
Rockies for Jody Reed. The Rockies released him in the middle of last season 
and, after playing for San Diego, he signed a Dodger minor league contract last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Seanez was 2-1 with nine saves and a 5.32 ERA in 20 games at Albuquerque. He 
struck out 26 in 22 innings. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; THIS WAS A PICK THEY HAD TO TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have been ridiculed for drafting high school center fielder McKay 
Christensen as the sixth pick in the country, but Thursday night, they had one 
simple explanation for selecting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if we didn't pick him then, we'd lose him," said Bob Fontaine, 
assistant vice president for scouting and player personnel. "And we weren't 
going to take that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels originally planned to draft Christensen in the second round until 
they heard on the eve of the draft that another club would draft him later in 
the first round. The Angels decided it wasn't worth the gamble to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man can play ball," said Fontaine, who signed Christensen to a $700,000 
bonus. "This was the right move for the Angels. This was the right player for 
us. You're going to be hearing about this man for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of the Angels' selection stems primarily because of 
Christensen's immediate plans. He is going on a two-year mission for the Mormon 
Church in August and won't be playing baseball again until he returns in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people thought McKay would use the mission as a bargaining chip," said 
Steve Christensen, McKay's father. "The mission was not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, we had one team who asked if they could talk to the church and 
have him play for their team in Australia. He said, 'We'll make sure he can 
preach to the guys in the dugout each week. Would he go for that?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I don't think so.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners have informed the Angels that they are interested in 
acquiring catcher Greg Myers when he returns from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, who's in the first year of a two-year, $1.5-million contract, has 
become expendable because of the play of rookie catcher Jorge Fabregas.

managing partner Tom Werner had reached a tentative agreement to sell the team 
to Glazer for $82.5 million.

<P>
 German defender Thomas Strunz will miss the opening game of the World Cup on 
June 17 in Chicago against Bolivia because of a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Strunz was injured during Wednesday's 2-0 victory over Canada, Germany's last 
tuneup before it begins defense of its title. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always miracles but I can't imagine I'll be able to play," Strunz 
said Thursday. "You really prepare for the opening game, you concentrate hard 
on it, and then unfortunately something like this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to play in the second game, against Spain on June 21.

 Brazil continued to draw criticism back home despite an 8-2 rout of Honduras 
on Wednesday night in a World Cup warm-up at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil Blows Out Honduras, But Makes Many Mistakes," read a front-page 
headline in O Globo, a Rio de Janeiro daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily Jornal do Brasil reported that Brazil "didn't control the game. We 
have serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer writers were merciless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rai hasn't woken up," O Globo said. "He tried to run but his legs didn't 
obey. He missed simple passes, was afraid to create plays, was not daring." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Noronha, a Rio sports columnist, wrote: "We still have no creativity at 
midfield. Rai -- despite his goal -- was a complete zero."

THE TIMES 1994 SPRING ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; SPEED PUTS JOHNSEN AHEAD OF THE PACK; 
PLAYER OF THE YEAR: WOODBRIDGE STANDOUT FINISHES PREP CAREER WITH A SOUTHERN 
SECTION-RECORD 196 STOLEN BASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Alison Johnsen's season turned on a short fly ball to left-center field. She 
charged in and shortstop Carrie Brown charged out. After the collision, Johnsen 
had a concussion and Brown a broken leg. Woodbridge's softball team had a 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen missed two games, and when she returned, she did not go back to center 
field -- never mind that she's the best outfielder in Orange County -- but to 
shortstop to replace Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The best athlete on the field was handed the toughest position to play. She 
made an error in her debut -- on her very first throw. It was her only error of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Her batting average suffered only slightly, dropping from .639 to .619. Hardly 
anything to get worked up over, really. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of talent that makes Johnsen the choice as The Times Orange 
County player of the year. She was selected based upon her regular-season 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Johnsen's talent as a fielder and a hitter, it is her speed that 
scares -- and impresses -- most opposing coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
 In 26 regular-season games, she stole 53 bases. She shattered the Southern 
Section career record for stolen bases by 19, and likely would have topped her 
personal goal of 200 had she not been injured and missed two games -- which 
Woodbridge (21-9) lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen, a four-year starter, finished with 196 steals and a lifetime .469 
average. She is first and fifth in the Southern Section record book for 
single-season steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK that I didn't break 200," she said. "But I'm disappointed I didn't, 
because I always think back to the games when I went one for three, thinking 
that if I got on base one or two more times I could have broken it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen will play next year for NCAA champion Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 A natural right-hander, she made the transition to the left-hander's side of 
the batter's box as a freshman, which makes her career average all the more 
stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 That Johnsen can also drive the ball (two home runs, 12 RBIs) -- in addition 
to bunting and slapping the ball through the infield -- makes her the most 
dangerous player in the county.

THE TIMES 1994 SPRING ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; HE'S STILL THE ONE TO BEAT; PLAYER OF 
YEAR: OCEAN VIEW'S PIETROWSKI WAS TOPS LAST YEAR DESPITE SOME FLAWS. THIS 
SEASON, HE ELIMINATED THEM TO RETAIN HIS LOFTY SPOT.

<P>
 Last season, you could beat Ocean View's Jakub Pietrowski by beating him to 
the net or by taking advantage of his erratic serve. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, those options were taken away, and, so too, were opponents' 
chances of defeating Pietrowski, who was named The Times Orange County player 
of the year for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing in the Southern Section semifinals last season to Palos Verdes 
Peninsula's Loren Peters, Pietrowski was unbeatable this season. He didn't drop 
a set during the regular dual-match season or the Southern Section individual 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's Ryan Hollis had the misfortune of running into Pietrowski at the 
section tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so fast and he gets to everything," Hollis said after losing, 6-3, 6-2, 
to Pietrowski in the round of 16. "He has no technical flaws." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pietrowski, who moved to Huntington Beach from Poland when he was 6: 
"It's nice to have people say that. It's nice to see hard work pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski's biggest payoff has been a full-ride tennis scholarship to Notre 
Dame, where he hopes to play Nos. 3 or 4 singles next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, who is coached by his father, Wojtek, will compete in the Olympic 
Festival in St. Louis, the U.S. Junior National Hard Courts in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., and the National Grasscourts in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in between, Pietrowski also will fit in a couple of pro satellite 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking about playing pro tennis after four years, so I want to get a 
better insight into what pro tennis would be like," he said.

 With one week to go before the opening game between Germany and Bolivia, 
rickety old Soldier Field in Chicago was spruced up and tightly secured 
Thursday. There were banners everywhere, as well as a tall chain-link 
fence.Only officials were being allowed anywhere near the playing field. One 
member of the yellow-jacketed security force standing guard outside, Marie 
Hayes, said: "The old place never looked so good as she looks now. Not even for 
Bears games." 
</P>
<P>
 Security is expected to be even more evident for the opener. One law 
enforcement official estimated that there will be 50 medical and paramedic 
personnel in the stadium next Friday for the game. When asked how many are 
normally on hand for a Bear game, he said, "about two or three." BILL DWYRE

 The United States will relax its ban on Nigerian flights to allow soccer 
players and their fans to attend the World Cup, the official news agency said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy in Lagos, which announced Wednesday that Nigeria Airways 
could not fly to the United States, said it was unable to confirm the Nigerian 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more complicated than that," embassy spokeswoman Arlene Jacquette said. 
She said she could say no more about the matter until today. 
</P>
<P>
 News Agency of Nigeria said the United States was permitting six Nigeria 
Airways flights to carry the Super Eagles and their supporters to soccer's 
premier competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the United States banned the airline from flying to New York and 
U.S. airlines from flying to Nigeria. Lagos' international airport is notorious 
for its crime and corruption.

 If an attack comes from left side (1), the goalkeeper moves to the right end 
of the goal box.If an attack comes from the center (2), the goalkeeper moves 
up. And when the attack comes from the right side (3), the goalkeeper slides 
over to the left end of the goal box. On corner kicks, a defender (4) is 
positioned at each post to help the goalkeeper. On penalty kicks, the keeper is 
positioned in the center of the goal and dives to whichever side he guesses the 
kick is going. He might also remain stationary.

SPLASH BACKERS HOPING TO MAKE A BIG WAVE AT THE POND; INDOOR SOCCER: TEAM OPENS 
SEASON, ITS FIRST IN ANAHEIM, TONIGHT AGAINST LAS VEGAS DUSTDEVILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's not outdoor soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who were born with that inherently U.S.-only feeling that all soccer 
is low-scoring, boring and induces snoring, there is an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Continental Indoor Soccer League, the CISL. Phonetically, that's 
"sizzle," and when the Splash introduces indoor soccer to Orange County tonight 
at The Pond of Anaheim against the Las Vegas Dustdevils, it's hoping to lay the 
groundwork for a following somewhere between the well-attended Bullfrogs and 
the mighty well-attended Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, a CISL primer with a splash of information about Anaheim's newest 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The CISL used to be the Major Soccer League, which used to be the Major Indoor 
Soccer League. When the MSL folded in July, 1992, with only seven teams, some 
joined the National Professional Soccer League, the NPSL -- while the most 
prominent MSL teams, the Dallas Sidekicks and San Diego Sockers, became charter 
members of the CISL. 
</P>
<P>
 There were seven teams in the inaugural season -- including Portland, 
Monterrey (Mexico), Sacramento, Arizona and Los Angeles -- and five averaged 
more than 5,000 spectators per game. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-team league with each team playing 28 games has everyone involved excited 
about 1994. Said one team representative: "It feels like we're back -- we're 
not playing the Wichita Wings every other night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's the Splash? It was formerly the Los Angeles United, which was owned by 
Jerry Buss, who also owns the Lakers. The United was purchased by Ogden 
Facility Management, the company that manages and operates The Pond, and the 
company changed the name to the Splash. 
</P>
<P>
 There 14 teams in the league. The Splash, Arizona Sandsharks, Las Vegas 
Dustdevils, Portland Pride, Sacramento Knights, San Diego Sockers and San Jose 
Grizzlies are in the Western Division. The Carolina Vipers, Dallas Sidekicks, 
Detroit Neon, Houston Hotshots, Monterrey La Raza, Pittsburgh Stingers and 
Washington Warthogs are in the Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Most soccer people think the Splash is going to be the CISL's most improved 
team. The last-place United lost its final 12 matches and finished 6-22. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of forward Dale Ervine, who once scored 62 goals in a season 
in the MSL, and defender Ralph Black, who played for third-place Portland, 
makes the Splash formidable. It also returns midfielder Rod Castro, the 
United's leading scorer (22 goals, 12 assists, despite playing only 17 games). 
Rookie forward Armando Valdivia scored 17 goals in 20 games for Cal State 
Northridge and was protected by the Splash as a local amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 This team will win more than it loses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think winning cures all ills," co-governor Tim Orchard said. "Our goal is 
to draw fans in to experience one of the finest buildings in the entire country 
and to win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which teams will make the playoffs? The top two teams from each division 
advance to the playoffs, and the Splash is one of four Western Division teams 
that is not an expansion team. The others are San Diego -- the favorite -- 
Portland, which lost its leading scorer, Dick McCormick and defenders Ralph 
Black, Neil Megson and Billy Crook, and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tournament in Las Vegas over Memorial Day weekend, the Splash finished 
3-1-1, including a 6-3 victory over San Diego, which both teams considered the 
championship game. Twenty minutes later, the Splash used primarily its younger 
players and lost to well-rested Las Vegas in the championship, 14-10. The 
Splash had beaten the Dustdevils earlier in the tournament, 5-3, with its first 
team.  
</P>
<P>
 Who are the good players? As a general rule, anyone with only one name is 
pretty good. That would include Dallas' Tatu, the CISL MVP who led the league 
with 117 points; Detroit's Drago, an explosive and creative scorer; Monterrey's 
Zizinho, the league's third-leading scorer (65 points); Pittsburgh's Kia, an 
11-year indoor veteran and the Stingers' top scoring threat; and San Jose's 
Preki, a seven-time MSL all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular guys with two names to drop include Dallas' David Doyle, the 
second-leading scorer (93 points), and Joe Papaleo, the goalkeeper of the year; 
Houston's Nebo Bandovic, who scored 87 goals in 87 games in the MSL; 
Monterrey's Marco Lopez, the rookie of the year with 65 points; Las Vegas' 
Branko Segota, ranked among the top 10 scorers in 10 of his 11 MSL seasons; 
Sacramento's Sean Bowers, the defender of the year, and Mark Thomas, who scored 
42 goals, including a record seven in one game; and San Diego's David Banks, an 
All-CISL defender, and Waad Hirmez, a staple of the Sockers' domination of 
indoor soccer in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The team's co-governors, which is kind of like co-presidents, are Tim Orchard, 
also the director of player personnel, and Brad Mayne. Tim Ryan is the general 
manager. George Fernandez is the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, 32, has won four indoor championships as a player, and is coming 
off an NPSL championship with the Cleveland Crunch. He won three titles with 
San Diego in the MISL, and was the league's all-star game MVP in 1990. He 
played in the CISL last year with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the TV guy? Andrew Shue, the affable Billy from Fox's "Melrose 
Place," was one of two local amateurs the Splash protected. Shue, the cover boy 
of last week's TV Guide, signed a contract Wednesday to play two games for the 
Splash. He played one game last year for the United. 
</P>
<P>
 It's expected he will play July 19 and 21, and he could play more if his 
schedule allows, though that would be unlikely. Shue is less of a stretch as a 
soccer player than Michael Jordan as a baseball player -- Shue competed at 
Dartmouth Collegeand for a year in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How permanent is this league? The ownership groups are solid, so the CISL 
should be around awhile. Eight of the 14 teams that will play this summer have 
owners with NBA or NHL ties and are using the CISL as a way to keep their home 
arenas filled. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Ogden, a Fortune 500 company, team ownership groups include 
Houston and the Interfin Corporation, Blockbuster and Camino Real Hotels; 
Portland and the Tournament of the Americas; and powerful Mexican companies 
like Grupo FEMSA/Televisa (Monterrey) and Delimex International (San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas' ownership group is affiliated with the Arena Football's Las Vegas 
Sting. A 15th team, Seattle, will begin play in 1995 and is affiliated with the 
NBA Supersonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City is also hot to join the league. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is this going to be any fun? The competition for the entertainment dollar is 
steep, but here's one perspective on the Splash: An average 14.6 goals were 
scored per game last year. The United averaged 5.8 goals. The Rams scored 25 
touchdowns. Quick conservative math: Even a bad Splash team (and it's not) 
should score as many times in four games as the Rams did in 16. That's 
something to cheer about. 
</P>
<P>
 All but three games will be broadcast on radio station KORG 1190-AM. Fifteen 
of its 25 broadcasts will be live, including the three matches on this home 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has a modest television contract with Prime Network; it will show 
seven Sunday night regular season games and a minimum of five playoff games on 
Prime Ticket. The Splash home game against Arizona on Sept. 3 will be telecast; 
it's the Splash's only regular season appearance.

SCYPHERS REINSTATED BY DISTRICT; BASEBALL: SUSPENSION OF SIMI VALLEY HIGH COACH 
ENDS, BUT HE IS GIVEN NO INDICATION HE WILL BE RETAINED NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers was reinstated as Simi Valley High baseball coach Thursday, but 
he remains unsure if he will be rehired for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who was cleared of accusations of financial and disciplinary 
improprieties Wednesday by the Ventura County District Attorney's office, is on 
a one-year coaching contract, as are all coaches in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 School principals submit the names of coaches to the school board for approval 
each fall. The board typically approves what recommendations the principal 
makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Simi Valley Principal Kathryn Scroggin renew Scyphers' contract for next 
season?  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the Six-Million-Dollar question," he said. "She hasn't given me any 
indication. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Scroggin nor Supt. Mary Beth Wolford could be reached for comment 
Thursday night. Both have declined to comment on Scyphers' situation because it 
is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin has submitted a letter reprimanding Scyphers to the district, said 
school board member Doug Crosse. The letter contained no recommendation of 
whether Scyphers should be back as coach, though, Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, was suspended from coaching May 3, when the police, at the 
request of the district, began an investigation into his financial and 
disciplinary practices as baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has coached the Pioneers for 16 seasons, admitted to improperly 
accepting money for use of the Simi Valley High baseball field, circumventing 
district channels. Scyphers also admitted using some of the field rental money 
to pay his assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under investigation was a team disciplinary practice called "the block," 
in which players bid small sums of money for the right to paddle teammates who 
violate team rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The police concluded their investigation May 27 and submitted their findings 
to the Ventura County District Attorney's office, which announced Wednesday 
that there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 At school Thursday afternoon, Scyphers was hand-delivered a letter from 
Wolford informing him that his administrative leave had been lifted. Scyphers 
had continued as a full-time teacher at the school during his suspension from 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 But the baseball season is over, and the school year ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said the primary coaching duty that remains this year is the team's 
awards banquet. Scyphers said he told administrators that he would not organize 
the banquet if he was not the baseball coach. The banquet is now scheduled for 
June 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banquets are very important to administrators," Scyphers said. "I hope that 
was not their ulterior motive (for the reinstatement). I would like to think 
that I've been exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who said he has lost 15 pounds and has had trouble sleeping since 
the investigation began, said he wished Scroggin could have dealt with the 
matter within the district, rather than involving the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't want me to be their coach, then just fire me," Scyphers said. 
"Don't drag me through this six-week mess."

DESPITE TAKING DIM VIEW OF STARR, TAFT GOES LIGHT ON HIM; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: 
COACH KEEPS HIS JOB BUT IS CENSURED BY PRINCIPAL FOR VIOLATING A STATE 
RECRUITING RULE. 
</P>

<P>
 Taft High football Coach Troy Starr was granted a reprieve Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, whose program was put on probation by the City Section after he 
violated a state recruiting rule, will not be dismissed as coach, Principal Ron 
Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mistake was made and we addressed the issue," Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr's status was jeopardized when Taft last month received an anonymous 
letter that detailed improper contact between Starr and Dante Clay, a junior 
high running back from Sherman Oaks. Berz ordered an internal investigation and 
the charges proved true. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter was brought to the attention of the City athletics office, which 
placed the program on probation for one year. Any further violations could 
result in forfeitures or sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Berz said he aired his grievances with Starr during a lengthy meeting 
Wednesday, considered his options overnight, and decided to retain the 
32-year-old coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hired the coach," Berz said. "I have confidence that he'll move forward 
with the youngsters and the program in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr could not be reached for comment.

 Starr was roundly criticized by rival coaches on two occasions last year for 
running up the score. Taft is 19-7 in his two seasons as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Berz declined to elaborate on what punishment he would mete out if Starr again 
violates CIF rules.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Section is only permitted to issue sanctions against programs, not 
individuals. Berz made it clear, however, that the rules and regulations 
governing open enrollment and undue influence have been spelled out -- at 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the rules and regulations," Berz said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But the proof in the pudding is that the mistake isn't made again." 
</P>
<P>
 City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said Thursday that the program will not be 
subject to further sanctions.  
</P>
<P>
 Clay, however, has been ruled ineligible to participate in athletics at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay, who attends Reed Middle School in North Hollywood, is eligible to play 
at other City schools, she said.

SOUTHERN SECTION MOVES CLOSER TO FOOTBALL PLAYOFF REGROUPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Southern Section this week moved closer to modifying its divisional 
playoff groupings in high school football for the fall season, which likely 
will result in realignment for two prominent area leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden League, which includes 1993 Division I semifinalist Antelope 
Valley, would drop to Division II for the 1994 and '95 seasons.The Del Rey 
League would be the lone area entrant in Division I under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission League -- which includes area private schools Chaminade, Notre 
Dame, St. Francis and Harvard-Westlake -- would move from Division IV to 
Division III. The Channel and Marmonte, the strongest leagues in Ventura 
County, will continue to play in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 No other area leagues were affected by the proposal, which was based on 
geographic considerations. Travel costs will be reduced, among other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's money-driven for the districts and schools," Commissioner Dean Crowley 
said. "That's what we're hearing. If schools can play football games closer to 
home, more fans travel to the games and there's more money to be made at the 
gate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Playoff Groupings Committee recommended to the Southern Section Council on 
Tuesday that the changes be implemented for a two-year cycle while more 
long-range adjustments are considered. Final appeals to the proposal will be 
heard Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said the section this week heard 14 appeals regarding divisional 
alignment, including one from the Tri-Valley League, which sought relief from 
Division IX. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said Tri-Valley representatives dislike playing in the same division 
with the Los Padres League, which sent three teams to the Division IX 
semifinals last fall. The appeal was denied.

RUNNING / JOHN ORTEGA: MARION JONES COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH TOUGHEST OPPONENT -- 
HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Carolina Coach Dennis Craddock figured that big things were expected 
from Marion Jones during her freshman season, yet he failed to realize the 
enormity of those expectations until last week's NCAA championships at Boise 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a nine-time state champion at Rio Mesa and Thousand Oaks highs, earned 
All-American honors in four events -- 100 and 200 meters, long jump and 400 
relay -- in the meet, but most reporters posed the same questions to Craddock 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Jones? 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't her times in the 100 and 200 measure up to those she ran during 
high school? 
</P>
<P>
 "For a freshman to be an All-American in four events is just super," Craddock 
said. "I'll take that any day, but a lot of people have asked me why she didn't 
perform better." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer can be summed up in one word: basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 As the starting point guard on the Tar Heel team that won the NCAA women's 
championship, Jones was unable to take her first track workout until April 7 -- 
four days after the NCAA title game. The late start prevented her from entering 
the NCAA meet in top form. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think basketball did not hurt her that bad in the long jump because 
basketball involves running a lot of short sprints and jumping," Craddock said. 
"But I think it definitely took something away from her in the 100 and 200. Her 
rhythm and timing just weren't there yet in those events. We just ran out of 
time before we could get to that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' performances at the NCAA meet support Craddock's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 She placed second in the long jump with a personal best and Atlantic Coast 
Conference record of 22 feet 1 3/4 inches. She finished sixth in the 200 with a 
wind-aided time of 23.55 seconds and was eliminated in the semifinals of the 
100 with a 11.40 clocking. She also ran the first leg on the Tar Heels' 400 
relay team that finished fifth in 44.49. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' sprint marks would be superb for most freshmen, but they are 
disappointing for someone who ran 22.58 in the 200 and 11.14 in the 100 as a 
high school junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Craddock marvels at Jones' talent, particularly in the long jump, 
an event she took up last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think in time that she could be the world record-holder in the long 
jump," he said. "She has tremendous speed on the runway, great spring in her 
legs and a great feel for the event. She seems to know where the (takeoff 
board) is at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add NCAAs: Jones is one of five former area high school standouts who earned 
All-American honors in the NCAA meet by finishing among the top eight U.S. 
citizens in their events. 
</P>
<P>
 Deena Drossin (Agoura) of Arkansas finished fourth in the women's 10,000, 
Brigham Young's Craig Lawson (Granada Hills) placed fifth in the men's 10,000 
and USC's Chad Danowsky (Simi Valley) was 10th in the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Reed of UCLA, formerly of Canoga Park High and Valley College, was a 
member of the Bruin foursome that finished eighth in the 400 relay. However, he 
was not allowed to run in the final of the 100 after the NCAA rules committee 
determined that he intentionally false-started in the semifinals of the 200 on 
Friday, violating the honest-effort rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State Coach Red Estes filed the protest, maintaining that Reed 
purposely false-started in the 200 -- which disqualified him from that event -- 
so he could save his energy for the 100 final. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Bob Larsen appealed the protest, but the rules committee sided with 
Estes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a highly unusual ruling, but it was called," said Larsen, UCLA's coach 
for 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All-American woman: Kristin Dunn of Cal State Northridge became the third 
Matador to earn Division I All-American honors by placing third in the women's 
javelin in the NCAA meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy Arreola, women's 1,500 champion in 1991, and Garrett Noel, eighth in the 
men's javelin in 1992 and ninth in '93, are the other Northridge All-Americans 
since CSUN moved to Division I in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: Which pair of track coaches at the same area high school 
placed among the top three finishers in their respective events in the state 
high school championships as seniors? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nine and counting: Cathy Prater of Agoura High continued an impressive Charger 
tradition when she placed second in the girls' 300 low hurdles in the state 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater's runner-up performance marked the ninth consecutive year that at least 
one Agoura athlete has had a top-six finish. 
</P>
<P>
 During that stretch, Chargers have won four titles, placed second twice, third 
four times, fourth once and fifth twice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Honor roll: When Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High cleared 7 feet to win the 
boys' high jump in the state championships, he became the 10th athlete from the 
region and the fourth from Ventura County win the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ventura County winners are Millard Webster, who cleared 5-9 1/2 for 
Santa Paula in the first state meet in 1915, Ray Nickleberry of Oxnard (6-8 in 
'58) and Kenny Burke of Westlake (7 feet in '84). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Pete Nelson and Warren Farlow of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson cleared 12-6 in the pole vault to tie for third in the 1953 state 
championships for University High in Los Angeles, and Farlow ran 1 minute 55.5 
seconds to place second in the 880-yard run at the 1958 state meet for 
Hollywood.

GREATER NET WORTH; ALWAYS A FINE SHOOTER, LAUER BECAME COMPLETE PLAYER DURING 
SENIOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Lauer might not be the prototypal gym rat, but he could very well be one 
of the most eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 senior guard is shooting around inside the Thousand Oaks High gym 
most nights, and chances are he'll be alone except for someone he dragged along 
to rebound for him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only sounds will come from the ball and the soles of his shoes. 
There's no chatter, no small talk. He demands absolute silence and seriousness. 
Visitors sporting so much as a grin will find themselves standing outside, 
staring at the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Shannon Rex, Lauer's girlfriend and frequent companion on evening 
shootarounds, found herself when she made the mistake of smiling during a 
recent workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "He messed up and he couldn't make, like, six of 'em," she said. "He asked me 
to walk out for a second." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing against her, of course. That's just the way he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm shooting I don't like anyone saying anything," said Lauer, who will 
play for the South in the Ventura County all-star game tonight at 8 at Ventura 
High. "I don't know why because in practice I'm fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I have Shannon go with me a lot. . . . She doesn't mind. I don't 
mind being there by myself. It's quiet time." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything pierces the silence, he loses his concentration, his jumper and 
sometimes his cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "He concentrates so intensely is really what it is," said his father, Peter 
Sr. "It's a bit of an exaggeration if I said I couldn't talk to him about his 
shot. It's just that when he's really in a groove he concentrates so 
intensely." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lauer, a Times' All-Ventura County selection last season, basketball is 
serious business. Even now, months after he played his last game as a Thousand 
Oaks Lancer, he's constantly preparing for his next opponent, the one he fears 
will beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't impress you with his physical presence, but one of his strong points 
is his conditioning," said Thousand Oaks Coach Ed Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hartman, the Lancers' leading scorer last season, has been impressed 
with Lauer's work ethic since they first were teammates at age 10.  
</P>
<P>
 "He worked his butt off all the time," Hartman said. "Extra after practice, 
before practice, on weekends, whenever. . . . He was in there quite often." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer finished his senior season second on the team in scoring (16.8 points 
per game) and first in assists (3.9). His defense, suspect when he first made 
the varsity as a sophomore, blossomed, as did his ability to drive to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "His whole game has come a long way," Chevalier said. "The offensive end came 
naturally to him. It's his defense that's made tremendous strides because of 
his hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 A day rarely passes when Lauer doesn't think about shooting. He'll skip lunch 
or take an hour out of the night to sneak into the gym for a quick workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he doesn't have to sneak in -- he has a key. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the family goes on vacations, nobody will forget to bring a ball 
along. After all, who knows where you might run into a gym? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be driving along and my dad's all, 'Look, there's a hoop,' " Lauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for skipping a day, forget it. He'd probably break out in a rash.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never went a day without shooting," Lauer said. "Even Thanksgiving, after 
dinner, we go back to the gym to shoot around." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer and his younger brother, Mike, a varsity starter as a sophomore last 
season, have been fed a steady diet of basketball by Peter Sr. ever since they 
can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad set up a regulation hoop when I was 4," Lauer said. "He never wanted 
me on anything lower." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as he was able to manage the weight of the ball, his father taught him 
the "right" way to shoot, and basketball nets have not been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both boys took a liking to it," said Peter Sr. "It honestly pleased me. I 
never pushed them. They just showed a natural interest. My biggest joy was that 
he was so interested because you can't force the kids." Lauer is bound for 
Redlands, a Division III school in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference, where he will face a new set of dilemmas as a freshman. 
He'll have to adjust to college life, earn playing time and adjust to new 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can be certain that the evening shooting will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little gym," he said, "but I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lauer did what he would never do in the gym -- he smiled.

BEHIND THE MASK; A GENE AUTRY WESTERN HERITAGE MUSEUM EXHIBIT ILLUMINATES MEDIA 
STEREOTYPES OF MEXICAN AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening June 18 at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, "The Mask of Zorro: 
Mexican Americans in Popular Media" documents some of the stereotypes about 
Chicanos that have a long, deplorable history in American media. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider just one such image, the ruthless bandito who has been depicted in 
everything from countless Westerns to an ad campaign for corn chips. But the 
upcoming show is not just about negative images. It also documents how members 
of minorities can fight back and turn hurtful stereotypes upside-down. Thus, 
visitors to the exhibit will see the Frito Bandito, with his bandolier and 
drooping mustache. But they will also learn that, during the 1960s, Chicano 
activists decided they weren't going to take it anymore and protested the 
offending Bandito into advertising oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the museum's first bilingual exhibit, according to John P. 
Langellier, the Autry's director of publications and productions. All signage 
for the show will be in Spanish as well as English. The show will also feature 
Post-It stations so that visitors will be able to post comments about what they 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 In Langellier's view, Zorro's mask is the ideal image for a show that examines 
fiction and reality, legend and fact. "What's under the mask is real," 
Langellier says. "The mask is a disguise." The show also reminds that, while 
myths can be dangerous, they can also be undone. He cites the case of the Cisco 
Kid as an example of how images of Mexican Americans have evolved in American 
media. Cisco is one of the most popular Mexican Americans in all the American 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
 As Luis Reyes, author of "Hispanics in Hollywood," points out in a short book 
being published in connection with the show, the Cisco Kid initially appeared 
in a 1904 story by O. Henry (really William Sydney Porter) called "The 
Caballero's Way." In Cisco's first incarnation he was not Mexican American at 
all, nor was he the charming Latino Robin Hood he would become when played by 
Duncan Renaldo in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the original Cisco was an Anglo gunfighter, so cold-blooded he 
tricked a Texas ranger into shooting his faithless girlfriend. It wasn't until 
the first movie version in 1914 that Cisco became Latino. And it wasn't until 
Cesar Romero won the role in 1940 that Cisco was actually played by a Latino. 
Romero wasn't Mexican American, he was Cuban American, but it was an early step 
toward the laudable goal of having Latino actors play Latino roles. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the least offensive depictions of a Mexican American in American 
movies, Cisco became even more sympathetic when the role was taken over by 
Renaldo, who later made Cisco one of the best-loved characters in the new 
medium of television. It was Renaldo who recast Cisco with the idealistic, if 
slightly foolish, character of Don Quixote in mind. Renaldo also gave Cisco's 
knight errant a faithful squire in the Sancho Panzo mold. Called Pancho, the 
sidekick was played by Leo Carillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Carillo's experience as a pioneering Latino actor is reminiscent of some other 
minority ground-breakers such as African-American actress Butterfly McQueen. 
Carillo had had trouble breaking into show business because some Hollywood 
producers looked at him and assumed he couldn't speak English. As Reyes 
reports, the irony was that Carillo was actually from an aristocratic 
Californio family and spoke five languages in addition to English. Carillo's 
career slumped and never fully recovered in the '60s when Chicano activists 
condemned his Pancho as perpetuating the stereotype of the Mexican peasant as 
slow and lazy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Autry curator James Nottage, artifacts in the show include guns 
and a photographic portrait of Tiburcio Vasquez. Hanged in 1875, Vasquez was a 
well-educated Californio who fled respectability and took up a life of crime 
after he was involved in the killing of a sheriff during the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nottage compares Vasquez to Joaquin Murietta, another Mexican-American outlaw 
who may or may not have actually existed (many historians think Murietta was a 
composite figure). Depicted as wild-eyed criminals in the Anglo media, Vasquez 
and Murietta were regarded as courageous defenders of their people by many 
Mexican Americans. "To one group they are bandits," notes Nottage. "To the 
other they're folk heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 The tension between the two views of Vasquez is currently being explored on 
stage in "Bandido!," a new musical by Luis Valdez now playing at the Mark Taper 
Forum in Downtown Los Angeles. The Autry is cross-promoting its "Mask of Zorro" 
exhibit with the theater, offering anyone who buys a ticket for one show a 
discount on a ticket to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 A film series that features screen versions of Zorro and other movies with 
Latino protagonists begins July 7 at the Autry and continues throughout the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Raven-haired senoritas on orange-crate labels and Latin lovers in the movies 
are among the images of Mexican Americans featured in the show. The exhibit 
also includes a number of the costumes worn by the various men, starting with 
Douglas Fairbanks Sr., who swashbuckled their way through film and TV versions 
of Zorro. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly evocative group of costumes is from the Disney TV series that 
starred Guy Williams and was a huge hit in the 1950s. Visitors will be able to 
see how Disney gussied Williams up for the scenes where Zorro doffs his black 
mask and cape and assumes his non-superhero identity as Mexican-American dandy, 
Don Diego de la Vega. One wonderful artifact in the group: a pair of trousers 
worn by one of Zorro's foes, with a sword-cut Z in the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorro is one of the most persistent Mexican-American images in American 
culture, and the character has given rise to at least one other powerful icon. 
Spiffily clad all in black, Zorro inspired a young comic-book artist named Bob 
Kane to create his own sharp-dressing crime-fighter. Look closely at Douglas 
Fairbanks, say, in his Zorro costume. As Langellier points out, "All you have 
to do is take off the black hat and you've got Batman!" Where and When What:

 Weber's Place boasts some of the biggest hamburgers in the San Fernando Valley 
and a full menu, and every Thursday night crabs are the featured attraction -- 
but not as an appetizer. Weber's Crab Races attract a regular crowd of about 75 
cheering people, with some taking a chance at the grand prize -- three days and 
two nights in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 CRAB CRAZY: The races are free to enter and everything, including crab, is 
supplied. All you need is a unique name for your crustacean and enthusiasm. 
Employees choose the winner of the best name contest -- Diogenes won this night 
-- but the winner of the race depends on the luck of the draw. A recent winner, 
34-year-old firefighter Lance Schoeman, said he could tell his crab, Lance, was 
a good athlete. "I picked him out because when he was in the cage, he was 
crawling all over everything and constantly moving. The other crabs were just 
sitting there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The small bar has two levels. The bottom houses the bar, food 
service counter, pinball machines and a sometimes-dance-floor seating area and 
two sections, one for seating and the other for the stage and DJ platform. The 
top floor has foosball tables, a dartboard and a few video games. The decor is 
an interesting collection of old movie props.  
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The pub attracts all kinds, ranging in age from 21 to 40, with a 
large college student following. "It's kind of a CSUN hangout," said student 
Mark Geyer, 26, of Northridge. Jeans, shorts and T-shirts mix with after-work 
attire, but the overall look is casual. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: DJ Art Lopez spun the records and played the CDs for the crab races 
on a recent Thursday, playing a bit of everything, including Van Halen, Pearl 
Jam, Ace of Base and, of course, "Rock Lobster" from the B52s. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Weber's has a neighborhood bar feel, where the bartenders chat with 
patrons, and the crowd is friendly. "I like it because it's not too trendy," 
said 24-year-old Elaine Pableo of Northridge. "And even though there is a 
diversity among the people, you still feel comfortable." Geyer had different 
reasons for being a regular. "It's the only place in the Valley with a young 
crowd, and it has the cheapest beer." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Depending on where they sat, some people felt as if they were in a 
sauna, while others chilled -- literally. Andrew Lim, 24, of Van Nuys said: 
"I'd tear out a wall. It's a nice, cozy place, but it could be a little bit 
bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: Despite the great vintage decor, one man complained, "They need new 
porno pictures on the roof of the men's bathroom. Those are at least 20 years 
old. I saw Barbie Benton up there." 
</P>

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: QUALITY FAKES; DYNASTY HANDBAG COLLECTION OFFERS LOW-COST 
DESIGNER COPIES WITH TOP-NOTCH WORKMANSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prices for top designer handbags are so incredibly high that it's no 
wonder that so many look-alikes are manufactured and priced to sell for a 
fraction of the originals. 
</P>
<P>
 When the copies first came on the market, many were definitely not of high 
quality; some were downright bad imitations. 
</P>
<P>
 But now there are some sources for high-quality copies that are made of good 
Italian leather and exhibit fine workmanship. The Dynasty Collection is as good 
as it comes with look-alikes of handbags by Donna Karan, Versace, Bottega 
Veneta, Judith Leiber, Chanel, Ann Turk and Dooney & Bourke. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, the stitching, the quality of the leather and the general 
conformity to the original design are all excellent. It would take an expert to 
determine that they are not the originals. In most cases, the only way to be 
sure is to check the inside of the bag for a label or the outside for 
identifying initials or patented logos, which are not permitted on the copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless your friends check the inside of your handbag, you'll fool almost 
everyone with any bag from this collection -- and spend a fraction of the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dooney & Bourke pouch bag -- great in summer colors of brown and white, 
reminiscent of the old saddle shoes and just about as traditional -- sells for 
about $295 in the stores; the look-alike is $125. 
</P>
<P>
 A new design has been introduced this year in the Bottega Veneta woven bags. 
Now reds, blues, greens and a lovely opalescent shade are interwoven with basic 
black, brown or white. A medium-size clasp or pouch bag in the real thing is 
priced at $750 to $800, depending on where you purchase it. The look-alike is 
$105. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the best copies are the Judith Leiber evening bags. The animal 
designs are still hot, and the newest is the snow leopard, the original of 
which sells for $3,200. In silver and topaz Swarovski crystals, the copy is 
priced at $445. A black lion's head is dazzling, and the copy of the $3,500 bag 
is $495 -- the most expensive handbag in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the designers' styles are available in the copies, but there are 
enough to satisfy most. As far as wearability is concerned, we'd have to carry 
one of the originals and one of the copies for the same period of time and 
under the same conditions to prove that the expensive model lasts longer, but 
chances are it does. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also find some nice costume jewelry at the Dynasty showings, and many 
of the pieces are copies of major names such as Bulgari and Cartier. Long 
(40-inch) necklaces are in this season, and religious-type adornments are also 
high on the fashion list. A copy of a Bulgari necklace with a Russian-type 
cross is $52.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no store for the Dynasty Collection. It is a traveling trunk show 
that sets up wares at Southland hotels. Upcoming San Fernando Valley shows are 
listed below, but if you can't make those, the sale is held from 10 a.m. to 6 
p.m. the first Friday and Saturday of each month at the Marina del Rey Hotel, 
13534 Bali Way.

SMOOTH SELLING; DESPITE THE LACK OF CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THIGH CREAMS 
REALLY WORK, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS ARE BUYING THEM. DOCTORS SAY THE 
PREPARATIONS DON'T APPEAR TO DO ANY HARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray, a 
registered nurse, writes regularly for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ads are everywhere -- but the jury is still out. 
</P>
<P>
 Thigh creams are being touted by distributors and manufacturers as the easy 
panacea to unsightly bulges and dimpled skin. And Southern Californians -- 
longing for firm, smooth thighs in a seemingly endless shorts season -- are 
buying them. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketed with such names as Smooth Contours and Skinny Dip, the cosmetic 
creams sell for about $25 a jar and are typically recommended for twice-a-day 
use on the upper thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 But some dermatologists and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are hesitant 
to endorse them as effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Lewinski, 35, a registered nurse who works in a dermatologist's office 
in Westlake Village, figured she might as well try a thigh cream and see for 
herself if it worked. She has been using one brand regularly for the last few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 She tested the cream on just one thigh -- for comparison purposes -- and also 
on both hips. She said she has found that it works better on her hips. "They 
look firmer," she said. "Even my husband thought I had been exercising." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the creams contain aminophylline, an asthma medication that some 
research suggests could be slightly effective in reducing thigh size. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the creams are classified as cosmetics, they do not have to be 
proven effective, only safe, said Mike Shaffer, an FDA spokesperson in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "They appear to be relatively safe, but we're not aware of any conclusive 
evidence that they work," Shaffer said. "Of course, people expect a certain 
amount of puffery when it comes to cosmetics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Randolph Capri, a Westlake Village dermatologist, tells patients that the 
thigh creams may work, but adds that there has not been enough research to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise is feasible, he says. The aminophylline could be absorbed through 
the skin and actually shrink underlying fat cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the positive side, the thigh creams don't seem to have any negative 
effects. They seem safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Capri's patients have tried the cream on areas beyond the thighs, such 
as the upper arms, abdomen and even under their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of his employees have used the thigh creams, and a few are convinced 
that their arms or thighs are better looking as a result, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capri warns that although the creams are safe to use on their bodies, they 
should not be used on the face. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Capri said the drive to find a quick and painless way to reduce fatty trouble 
spots is understandable, especially since there are no alternatives beyond 
either diet and exercise, or liposuction, a surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bente Berman, an Agoura Hills dermatologist, is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks the creams probably create the sensation of skin tightening or 
firming, but no measurable effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the only side effect that she has seen has been an irritant dermatitis -- 
a short-term rash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of make light of it. If the creams were such a great thing, everybody 
would be using them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman does have her own jar of cream at home. A patient brought it in for 
her to try. She hasn't tried it -- yet, she said.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; AFFLUENCE AND EXCESS IN ENCINO; DELMONICO'S SEAFOOD GRILLE, 
ANOTHER CLONE OF A WESTSIDE EATERY, OFFERS A LONG MENU, LARGE PORTIONS, 
OVERDONE FOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just look at all the Porsches and Jaguars pulling up to the valet parking 
stand at the new Delmonico's Seafood Grille. This plush, handsome restaurant, 
an Encino clone of the Delmonico's in the Fairfax District, has been 
overflowing with affluence since the minute it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not come as a major surprise. Once again a popular L.A. restaurant 
has come tramping over to our side of the hill, cutting our drive time and 
reinforcing the notion that Valley people no longer want to rely on the 
Westside for dining out. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wonder how many of these clone places would get people to travel the 
opposite direction -- from the Westside to the Valley -- as they do for, say, 
Studio City's Pinot, which serves food they can't get anywhere else. Forgive me 
for saying so, but I can't imagine the number breaking into double digits. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, that's cold. Especially when Delmonico's Seafood Grille has so many 
things going for it: an extensive and creative menu, lush fin-de-siecle decor, 
the ambience of an old-time San Francisco oyster house. But a room rich with 
mahogany and mirrors and shiny brass -- even when it has a major-length menu -- 
is just not enough to make this place really worth a detour. Much of what you 
eat here suffers from excess: too much oil, too much salt, too much time on the 
stove.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one excess no one seems to mind is the restaurant's trademark 
enormous portions. Prices are on the high side, averaging about $16 an entree, 
but no one looking at these plates would dare to say they aren't fair value. 
And the service is outstanding -- knock a glass over and a team of busboys 
races out to change the entire table setting. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm impressed by the mood here, too. This crowd is definitely upbeat, 
providing a noise level that is exuberant without being overbearing.  
</P>
<P>
 You can't go wrong with cold appetizers such as the oysters on the half-shell 
or the cracked crab.The most diverting cold appetizer might be salmon tartare 
-- minced raw salmon with capers and dry mustard mixed in. It is satisfying 
with buttery slices of toasted brioche. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever prepared ours must have a sense of humor, because a Star of David was 
stenciled in mustard sauce on top of the tartare. "Our chef is Jewish," 
explained our waitress, shrugging. No argument, but just for the record, the 
menu gives the chef's name as Tony De La Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among hot starters, there are reliably crisp calamari, an oil-rich saute known 
as mushrooms Delmonico and a bland shrimp cake (beautifully crisped, though, 
fried to a golden brown on all sides). Soups range from the serviceable 
minestrone (mine had one lone bean at the bottom of the bowl) to a coral-pink 
Maine lobster bisque, heady and richly flavored.  
</P>
<P>
 Main course salads are consistently good. The Caesar is crisp and generous 
with the Parmesan, the Cobb is classic, the meat in the warm Maine lobster 
salad tastes as if it was pulled from the shell seconds before it reached the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu's myriad seafood entrees come either grilled or sauteed. Most are 
prepared with imaginative sauces such as crab relish, grilled corn or 
lime-chive. 
</P>
<P>
 We're back in excess territory here. A nice chunk of Pacific swordfish, for 
instance, is glazed with rum, placed atop doughy crab pancakes and ringed with 
spiced apples, producing a flavor like some tropical men's cologne. Delicate 
petrale sole is sauteed and then thrown in the ring with a thick mustard sauce 
that is too strong for it. For monkfish formaggio , this lobster-like fish is 
blanketed with cheese and then doused with a loud chipotle pepper sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 I vote for the Mississippi catfish in a simple cornmeal crust. This catfish is 
light and flaky, and the tartar sauce accompaniment sounds a harmonious note.  
</P>
<P>
 These dishes only scratch the surface of this huge menu. Meat entrees include 
steaks, osso buco , veal Parmigiana , roast duck with brandied peaches. There's 
Sicilian herb chicken, cooked on a rotisserie and served in a light tomato 
sauce with a delicious "pie" of scalloped, fried potatoes and garlic. The long 
dessert list is notable for a white chocolate mousse tort, a dense bourbon 
pecan pie with caramel sauce and a silken creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the bottom of the menu, you may notice the disclaimer, "due to the 
diversity of our menu we are unable to make substitutions." The kitchen is 
happy, however, to leave almost any extra ingredient off. Don't call that 
notion austerity, call it a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh, don't forget to reserve your table well in advance. WHERE AND WHEN

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: STATE'S BUDGET WOES MAKE BOND PROS WARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California faces another major budget battle in the months ahead, and that 
could roil the huge market for the state's tax-free municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, one of the biggest bond-rating agencies, Moody's Investors 
Service in New York, warned that it is re-evaluating its AA rating on the 
state's general-obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp., which rates the state one notch below where Moody's 
does, at A+, also has warned that it views California's trend as "negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately or fortunately -- depending on your perspective -- the problems 
facing the state sound like the same old thing: another year, another budget 
deficit, and another case of California proposing to "roll over" previous 
years' deficits by borrowing billions of dollars short-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year since 1990, some analysts have warned that California muni owners 
could see their bonds slump in value not because of the risk of actual default, 
but because the market would begin to see California (and, by association, its 
cities and counties) as hopelessly incapable of solving ingrained fiscal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the doomsayers have consistently been disappointed. Last year, for 
example, the average California muni bond mutual fund's total return was 
12.48%, slightly above the 12.35% average return on general national muni 
funds. Total return counts both interest earnings and the underlying price 
appreciation or depreciation of the bonds themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and 1992, California muni funds did produce lower average returns than 
general muni funds, but the differences were undramatic and were the result of 
California bonds appreciating less than other states' bonds, not depreciating 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 So why should this year's budget nightmare have any more of an effect on 
California bonds? The risk now, analysts say, is in the sheer magnitude of the 
problems built up over three years of recession -- and the lack of any buffer 
if another natural disaster strikes, or if market interest rates turn up 
sharply again. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the state again rolls over its deficits, it must borrow a record $7 
billion via short-term notes in late July. That would be 35% more than the 
loans required a year ago to close the '93 budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed $38.8-billion state budget for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1 is balanced only if the state gets $3 billion in 
federal aid to cover social services expenses for illegal immigrants. Yet 
almost no one believes Uncle Sam will cough up that sum. 
</P>
<P>
 And to further complicate the budget mess, voters' rejection of $5.9 billion 
in bond issues on the Tuesday ballot has sent Wilson scrambling to find money 
to pay for badly needed earthquake-retrofitting projects that would have been 
paid for with some of the bond proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is making bond pros increasingly nervous about California. Some 
are even drawing parallels to New York City in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 New York back then was playing the same game of rolling over deficits and 
going deeper into debt to pay annual budget expenses. Until finally investors 
decided they no longer wanted to fund New York -- and the city had to be bailed 
out by the state. Gotham's credit became no good overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 California likewise cannot continue the game of rolling over deficits and 
hoping the economy turns up later in the year to close the gap, analysts say. 
"The risk is that financial markets give up on you, and say you're never going 
to solve your problems," says Claire Cohen, analyst at credit rater Fitch 
Investors Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Schroer, manager of the $13.5-billion-asset Franklin California 
Tax-Free fund, puts it more bluntly: "There is going to be a point where you 
can't enter the debt market anymore" at will, he warns the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his fund, Schroer is already shunning new purchases of general-obligation 
bonds and other issues tied to the state's health, such as Public Works bonds, 
because he worries that the rating agencies soon will downgrade California 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 His fear isn't default, because the state Constitution guarantees interest 
payments on general obligation bonds. The issue is how much more investors will 
require the state to pay, in interest, before they'll extend additional credit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market demands higher yields on new California bonds, older bonds will 
fall in price to match current yields. That's how bond fund shares erode -- 
witness this year's broad decline in fund values as market interest rates 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the state's bonds make up only part of the mammoth California muni 
market. Steven Permut, muni analyst at the Benham Group of mutual funds, is as 
negative as Schroer about state general obligation bonds, but he notes that 
many other issues are valued independent of what happens in Sacramento. Local 
"essential service" bonds, for example, like water and sewer issues, still are 
viewed as safe-haven investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some investors may argue that, so long as they get their interest 
payments, they don't care how bonds fluctuate in price. Indeed, that appears to 
be the thinking behind the recent surge in small investor purchases of 
individual California muni bonds, even as mutual fund purchases wane, some 
brokers say. Barring a default, an individual bond will pay you back 100 cents 
on the dollar when it matures. A fund, however, never matures, so there's no 
guaranteed payback in full. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one knows how even confident investors would react if the state's 
budget problems were compounded by another huge earthquake, and/or by another 
jump in market interest rates that frightens more investors out of the bond 
market. California simply has no margin for error now. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, who is challenging Wilson for his job this 
year, offers a partial solution in "bonding out" the accumulated deficit -- 
basically, issuing bonds to turn the short-term accumulated deficit into 
longer-term debt, to be paid off over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonding-out has been used successfully by Connecticut and Massachusetts in 
recent years to solve their accumulated-deficit problems. But in each case, 
analysts say, there was a plan in place to assure investors that the 
longer-term financial problems facing each state would be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now consider California. No doubt many people who voted down the bond issues 
on Tuesday are current muni owners, because we know that older, wealthier 
people are more likely to vote. They probably figured they were protecting 
their investment. After all, any security's value depends on supply and demand; 
too many new bonds could depress older bonds' value. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bond-rating agencies may take another view of Californians' rejection 
of additional bonds for earthquake safety, schools and other projects: It may 
be seen as another sign of government and public unwillingness to confront 
reality, plan for the future and pay for a decent quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 George Leung, analyst at Moody's, notes that California and other states 
increasingly seem willing to OK bonds for only one kind of project: prisons. 
That is hardly the kind of investment that produces a long-term economic 
payoff. Comparing Muni Funds 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the state's fiscal woes since 1990, the average return on California 
muni bond funds has closely tracked returns on general national muni funds. 
Funds that buy insured California bonds, meanwhile, performed better in 1992 
and '93 but also suffered bigger losses in this year's broad bond market 
selloff.

4 TEAMSTERS REGIONAL SECTIONS ARE ABOLISHED; LABOR: THE DIVISIONS WERE ACCUSED 
OF WASTING MONEY. DISSIDENTS SAY THEY'LL GO TO COURT TODAY TO FIGHT THE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As its leaders continued to feud, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters 
on Thursday abolished four regional divisions that have been accused of wasting 
millions of dollars a year on lavish executive salaries and perks.  
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters officials in Washington called the decision a "major step toward 
democratic reform," but dissidents said it was a move to weaken opposition to 
President Ron Carey and his policies. Carey's opponents said they would go to 
federal court in New York today to seek an injunction to prevent enforcement of 
the vote by the union governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's tragic," said Los Angeles union official Michael J. Riley, who 
earned $175,000 a year as head of the Teamsters' 350,000-member Western 
Conference, one of the four area conferences that will be disbanded. "He is now 
operating the most undemocratic union in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over the conferences has been one of several problems that have 
rocked the 1.4-million member union and threatened to undermine Carey and his 
efforts to reform it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Carey suffered a stinging defeat when members voted down 
his proposal to raise dues 25% to increase the union strike fund. The fund was 
depleted after the union launched a strike lasting 23 days against several 
long-haul trucking firms in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters' general executive board, which is dominated by Carey 
supporters, voted 14 to 3 on Thursday to revoke the charters of the Eastern, 
Central, Southern and Western conferences, which have handled regional contract 
talks, organizing and grievance procedures. Board members representing the 
union's two Canadian conferences abstained, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will "provide greater freedom to reform the process for resolving 
members' grievances about unfair firings and mistreatment on the job," a union 
statement said. "Area conference leaders, who were not elected by the 
membership nor accountable for their actions, controlled many of the grievance 
panels." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey has made the elimination of the conferences a priority in the three 
years since he was elected president on a reform platform. Despite a combined 
budget of $15 million, the conferences employed only 13 full-time workers, who 
provided services related to contract negotiations and contract enforcement, 
top union officials said. Much of the money was used to pay administration 
costs and fund "extra salaries and pensions for officials who already had 
full-time jobs as local union leaders," the union statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days of $300,000 salaries, lavish pensions for union officials and luxury 
vacations at members' expense are over," Carey said in a statement. "Our union 
will be stronger without this extra layer of bureaucracy." Carey said he will 
maintain "any worthwhile services that were provided by the area conferences." 
</P>
<P>
 More than $11 million in union money earmarked for the conferences will go 
back to locals. About $3 million the international union paid to the 
conferences will be used in the international's trade divisions and departments 
to improve member services. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional leaders will remain in charge of local and joint union councils. 
Riley, for example, will remain head of the Southern California Teamsters Joint 
Council and Local 986.

SUMMER OF THEIR DISCONTENT; SCHOOL'S OUT, BUT THE STUDENT JOB PICTURE IS NOT 
ENCOURAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Martin Toumaian will make popcorn at Pacific Theatres' Northridge complex. 
Sara Gregory will teach swimming at the East Valley YMCA in North Hollywood. 
And Amy Means will help test roller coasters as part of her duties as a ride 
foreman at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 School's out and thousands of young people like Toumaian, 18, Gregory, 16, and 
Means, 20, have traded their books for the burger flippers, office mail carts, 
theme park costumes, shovels and brooms often associated with the typical 
summer job. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the cost of college tuition, high-tech sneakers and CDs soar, for 
many other youths, this will be a summer of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland economy is improving, but the youth job market is not. Youth 
unemployment, always two to three times the overall jobless rate, is close to a 
five-year high, according to state statistics. The unemployment rate for 
workers 16 to 19 years old was 24% in April; it usually goes up three to five 
percentage points in summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is due to corporate cost cutting, but many young people 
are also finding themselves in competition with older unemployed workers. 
</P>
<P>
 A key government summer program for low-income youth has been retooled to make 
the experience more valuable to students, but the result in some counties is 
that the program can hire fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
 Erick Dominguez, 16, a serious, soft-spoken Reseda High School student, needs 
to work to help support his parents and two siblings. His mother is a 
housekeeper, his father a sewing machine operator. Erick said he would take any 
job, if he could just find one. 
</P>
<P>
 He has applied at several fast-food restaurants. "They say they are not 
hiring, or they don't hire you at 16," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley, in particular, is still feeling the effects of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. For example, most stores in the heavily damaged Northridge 
Fashion Center mall remain closed, wiping out about 2,500 jobs, according to 
Lloyd Miller, the mall's general manager. Many of those jobs were retail posts 
traditionally held by younger workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles High School, only about a third of students looking for summer 
jobs have found one, said Betsy Alkaly, a career adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite news of an economy on the rebound, "we don't see it here in terms of 
job offers," Alkaly said. "But the kids remain pretty optimistic. I don't think 
they're terribly dejected." 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags Magic Mountain and Universal Studios Hollywood 
say they will have about the same number of summer slots as last year, but 
Disneyland took on only 1,000 extra workers this summer -- hundreds fewer than 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are holding on to their jobs longer, so there is lower turnover" and 
fewer summer opportunities for students, Disneyland spokesman John McClintock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the summer job picture looks good in Orange County because 
tourism is generally healthier than last year, said Eleanor Jordan, a county 
labor market analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 For students who do land positions this summer, the jobs may not be relevant 
to their career plans. And the competition for what is available is intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Gordon, senior director of Camp Kinneret Day Camp and Sunny Skies Day 
Camp in Agoura Hills, said he is getting 10 applications for every camp 
counseling and other staff job he adds each summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Johnson, a 22-year-old senior at UCLA who hopes to be a psychiatrist, 
spent a long morning auditioning in a sweltering hotel meeting room with dozens 
of other would-be Universal Studios tour guides last month. She didn't get that 
job but she is still being considered for other positions at Universal Studios. 
"I have to keep working my other jobs, and I thought this one would give me 
more fun," said Johnson, referring to part-time jobs she held during the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bright spots for summer job-seekers are a variety of interesting 
positions that pay more than minimum wage. Josh Seat, 23, of Valencia, a 
graduate student at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, will earn $7 
an hour as a "greeter" welcoming customers at the Magic Mountain restaurant and 
singing to them with the restaurant staff several times a day.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of jobs that would keep my interest," Seat said. "I 
thought this one would." 
</P>
<P>
 And some students who impressed their bosses last summer have been asked to 
return this year. Jon Speier, a 21-year-old Woodland Hills resident, is 
returning to work for Encino-based Bogard Temps Inc. Speier worked in customer 
service, bill collections and fraud investigations for a cellular phone 
company, and it wants him back. Speier, a student and sprinter on the track 
team at Azusa Pacific University, said he tries to earn and save money from his 
summer job so that he doesn't have to work during school and can instead focus 
on studying and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Internships may also be a bright spot in this summer's job market. Mary 
Williams, a Cal State Northridge counselor, said the stronger economy 
nationally means summer internships for college students are up this year. The 
CSUN career center has about three times as many companies advertising 
internships locally and elsewhere this year compared with two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And at UCLA's Placement and Career Planning Center, "the picture on summer 
jobs and internships is actually better than it's been in several years," said 
Tina Oakland, associate director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 students have been placed so far, and more than 1,500 internships 
are still available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of those internships -- especially non-technical ones -- are unpaid. 
However career-oriented college students say the experience is worth more than 
a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do an internship with minimal pay because it's such a good resume 
builder," said Gina Shaw, a UCLA junior from Covina who is studying math and 
applied management. She was hoping to work for a Big Six accounting firm but 
was surprised to learn that those jobs had been filled in February and March.

EFFORT TO REVIVE B-2 BOMBER TAKES WING; AEROSPACE: CONGRESS IS BEING ASKED TO 
BUY MORE OF THE STEALTH BOMBERS. THOUSANDS OF JOBS HINGE ON THE DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the last B-2 Stealth bomber winds its way through the giant assembly hangar 
at the Northrop Grumman Corp. plant in Palmdale and 22,000 B-2 jobs nationwide 
fall into a post-Cold War abyss, the bombers' proponents have embarked on a 
broad campaign to continue production. 
</P>
<P>
 Against formidable political odds, the lobbying effort is attempting to sell 
the Pentagon and Congress on a plan for 20 additional B-2s for $12 billion -- 
cheap by historical B-2 standards but a mountain of gold for the cash-starved 
Defense Department. The first batch of 20 bombers is costing $44 billion, which 
includes research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two key arguments for making more B-2s: The nation must not abandon 
its unique production capability for Stealth bombers, and only the B-2 can 
respond to international crises quickly and without jeopardizing many members 
of the U.S. military. Both assertions evoke bitter dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role of the bomber has been elevated, not diminished by the end of the 
Cold War," said Gen. John M. Loh, the Air Force's combat aircraft commander. 
"Nothing has the range and the payload of the bomber or the sense of immediacy, 
able to strike in 10 to 12 hours anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is for the Air Force to buy B-2 bombers much like the Navy buys 
nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers -- essentially at a slow but nonstop 
pace, rather than in large batches, which inevitably leads to contentious 
political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-2 campaign would be much tougher were it not for the California economy, 
which has loomed large over congressional actions this year. According to a 
UCLA analysis, 30,000 direct and indirect jobs in California supported by the 
B-2 will be lost under the current program over the next six years. But 
additional B-2 orders would preserve about 13,000 of those jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop's success will depend in large measure on the political will of the 
California delegation, which appears this year to be born again on the merits 
of big-ticket military programs that can underpin the state's still-weak 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 California representatives flexed their muscles two weeks ago in a vote to 
increase purchases of the C-17 cargo jets, dealing a harsh setback to Rep. Ron 
Dellums, the Oakland Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have all been hit in the face with the recognition that aerospace in 
California is a real driver of the economic health of the state," said 
Northrop's new B-2 chief, Ralph Crosby, who cites a long list of California 
Democrats who support the B-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, B-2 opposition is stiff. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has charged 
that the B-2 "has been more able to penetrate the Treasury than any enemy 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Selling more B-2s seemed virtually impossible a year ago, so its prospects 
have clearly improved. But the plane, designed to escape detection by enemy 
radar, has avoided any new technical problems in recent years that would have 
doomed further orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairmen of three key military committees in Congress support buying more 
B-2s, and some senior Air Force officials have expressed support for the B-2 in 
defiance of official Pentagon policy against buying more. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted in secret session 
to provide $150 million for future B-2 production by preserving special tools 
at subcontractors.  
</P>
<P>
 Coming up with $150 million is painless compared to the ultimate bill of $12 
billion, however. That would require drastic steps, such as reducing C-17 
production, canceling the Lockheed F-22 fighter or eliminating a Navy carrier 
-- the kinds of sacrifices that would bloody the Capitol or lead to a "real 
food fight," as one House staff member put it. 
</P>
<P>
 B-2 proponents have begun laying the intellectual groundwork for the battle, 
arguing at a Center for Security Policy seminar this week that the B-2 can 
project U.S. power around the globe more forcefully than Navy carrier battle 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-2's ability to carry large conventional bombs and deliver them with 
precision anywhere in the world "is equal to nuclear deterrence and even 
better, because we are likely to use it," said Donald Hicks, a former defense 
official and Northrop consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the United States withdraws from bases in Europe and Asia, its forces will 
increasingly operate from this country. Naval aviation came out of the 1980s 
defense buildup without a single new class of plane, leaving the service with 
an air fleet that will have less range to penetrate inland.  
</P>
<P>
 Loh suggests that the Pentagon pay for the added bombers by reducing spending 
on think tanks, spacecraft and supply depots. He worries that Air Force power 
is eroding below what is necessary to carry out the Clinton Administration's 
avowed mission of fighting two major regional wars simultaneously. At present, 
the Air Force has just 80 operational bombers, for example, Loh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, however, bristle at the idea that the Pentagon should buy more 
bombers. It is facing a funding crisis, taking on too many programs and being 
saddled with responsibility for many non-defense roles, such as spending for 
defense conversion, they say. By some estimates, the Pentagon has $100 billion 
more in commitments over the next five years than it has funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Singer, a defense expert at the Congressional Budget Office, estimates 
that although 20 more B-2s may cost only $12 billion to buy, they would end up 
costing another $88 billion to operate over the next 20 years. That would 
require eliminating three of the Navy's carrier battle groups, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from military power issues, B-2 proponents argue that the nation must 
preserve the unique manufacturing technology for large Stealth aircraft, much 
as it is buying submarines to keep General Dynamics' Electric Boat shipyard 
open in Groton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is a huge departure from historical practice, in which producers of 
fighters or jetliners built bombers as needed. But the technology is different 
today, the B-2 supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't think that's the case, all you have to do is look at the A-12," 
said Hicks, referring to the Navy's disastrous effort to build a Stealth bomber 
using contractors that had no Stealth experience. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bomber seminar this week, former Pentagon officials such as James 
Schlesinger, Caspar Weinberger and Paul Wolfowitz offered ideas that supported 
more B-2 production. And Frank Miller, principal deputy assistant secretary of 
defense, allowed that "bombers may be the system of choice if we ever have to 
cross the nuclear threshold in a regional contingency." 
</P>
<P>
 Such tough issues will take years to debate and evaluate -- long past the 
window for buying more B-2s. Northrop hopes to preserve the option of producing 
more B-2s while the debate goes on.

JOINT VENTURE TARGETS TOKYO FOR U.S.-MADE ELECTRIC TRUCKS; AUTOS: UNDER TERMS 
OF THE DEAL, TRADER ITOCHU CORP. WILL INVEST $15 MILLION IN U.S. ELECTRICAR, A 
CALIFORNIA COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the first deal to market roadworthy American-made electric vehicles in 
Japan, California-based U.S. Electricar Inc. and Itochu Corp., one of the 
world's largest trading companies, have formed a joint venture to target 
Tokyo's market for light delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first models scheduled to be sold by Tokyo-based Itochu, until recently 
known as C. Itoh & Co., will be Grumman Corp. Long Life delivery trucks, which 
are widely used by the U.S. Postal Service, and Chevrolet S-10 pickups -- both 
converted to run on electric batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Electricar is also designing an electric vehicle from the ground up that 
it hopes to eventually sell in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about this just from the viewpoint that a company of our size 
would not (otherwise) have looked at the international market . . . this early 
in our development," said Ted Morgan, chairman and chief executive of U.S. 
Electricar, which has converted more than 200 gasoline cars to run on 
electricity in the last 10 years. The fast-growing firm is headquartered in 
Santa Rosa and has production facilities in Los Angeles, Redlands, Hawaii and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal includes a $15-million investment in U.S. Electricar by Itochu, in 
exchange for a 4.5% ownership share.  
</P>
<P>
 Itochu's automobile group, already an international distributor for Mazda 
Motor Corp. and part owner of the Korean auto maker Kia Motors Corp., will 
market the vehicles in Japan. Another partner in the joint venture, Tokyo R&D, 
an engineering firm that has designed prototype electric vehicles for major 
Japanese auto makers, will evaluate the U.S. vehicles and help get them 
licensed for sale in Japan. 
</P>

 "This strategic alliance . . . (will) increase the global good by supplying 
pro-environmental technology and goods to the world," Motoyuki Katsube, a 
senior officer in Itochu's automobile division, said in a statement issued in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said the joint venture, to be called Japan Electricar Corp., will 
target commercial fleet operators because the infrastructure does not yet exist 
in Japan to support widespread private use of electric vehicles. Fleet vehicles 
generally return to the same facility at the end of the workday, simplifying 
maintenance and recharging. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no estimates yet of what the vehicles will cost in Japan. But U.S. 
Electricar is currently selling converted S-10 pickups and Geo Prisms for about 
$43,000 each. In quantities of 30 or more, fleets pay about $33,000 for the 
trucks and $29,000 for the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan estimated that the vehicles sold in Japan would have a range of 60 to 
80 miles, depending on use, and cost 3 cents a mile to operate, compared to 8 
cents a mile for gasoline-fueled vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Itochu, with 10,000 employees in 865 businesses around the world, has been 
particularly active in the U.S. entertainment industry and owns an interest in 
Time Warner Inc. The firm's 1993 revenue was $149.6 billion, according to the 
Japan Foreign Trade Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the only other significant export to any nation of U.S. electric 
vehicles has been from an older California company based in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor-Dunn Manufacturing Co. has sold hundreds of small electric vehicles in 
Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia, but these have been off-road service 
vehicles for use in airports and similar work sites.

 Mortgage Delinquencies Up Slightly: First-quarter delinquencies edged up 
slightly from January through March, although the percentage of overdue 
payments remained near a 20-year low. Three of the country's four regions had 
increases in late payments, which boosted the national delinquency rate for the 
first time in nearly a year.Only the South saw a decline, according to a survey 
by the Mortgage Bankers Assn. The trade group said the share of homeowners 
behind on their payments rose to a seasonally adjusted 4.12%, from 4.09% in the 
final three months of 1993. The fourth-quarter share was the lowest since a 
3.89% rate in the first three months of 1973. It was the first increase since 
delinquencies rose to 4.31% in the April-June quarter of 1993, from 4.30% for 
the previous three months.

FIRMS SAY THEY'LL SPEND 8.3% MORE IN '94; ECONOMY: CORPORATE EXPANSION PLANS 
BODE WELL FOR A CONTINUING RECOVERY. BUT THE PICTURE ISN'T SO ROSY IN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Thursday that American companies plan to spend a 
robust 8.3% more this year to modernize and expand their businesses, raising 
hopes that the nation's economic revival will continue well into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, the report indicated that Southern California's 
short-term economic outlook remains less optimistic. While spending in a 
variety of industries that dominate the economies of other states -- from auto 
making in Michigan to mining in West Virginia -- will soar this year, spending 
within California's key aircraft business will fall another 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's economy is still moving ahead, but it will remain closer to the 
caboose than it is to the engine," said Adrian Sanchez, regional economist at 
First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "Things are getting better here, but 
we're still playing catch-up with the rest of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The government's forecast that businesses nationwide will spend a healthy 8.3% 
more on new equipment and expansion in 1994 than they did last year surprised 
some analysts, who thought the recent rise in interest rates might force many 
companies to abandon such plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the four-month run-up in rates may have prompted some firms to scuttle 
planned improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 After adjusting for inflation, Thursday's growth estimate is below the 9.8% 
spending increase that the Commerce Department forecast after taking its winter 
survey several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 8.3% the department now expects in 1994 would still be the largest in 
five years, and could provide the fuel needed to keep the expansion rolling 
well into next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,000 U.S. businesses surveyed by the government in April and May said 
they will spend $634 billion this year, up from $586 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spending by consumers has been tapering off, but it looks like businesses may 
be stepping in to pick up some of the slack," said Robert Barr, deputy 
economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending by businesses has a domino effect on the entire economy and accounts 
for about one-third of all economic growth. When a company places an order for 
a new piece of equipment, it creates new business for the firm that must 
fulfill the order, which then must order more material from yet another 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The big jump in corporate spending will be led by the automotive industry, 
where company executives expect to spend 28.3% more on new equipment and plants 
than they did in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Companies in the smaller steel industry will spend 37.5% more, while those in 
the electrical machinery business expect a 12.1% increase, and mining companies 
see a 7.1% jump.

FIRST DATA GETS WESTERN UNION IN A $900-MILLION TRANSACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Data Corp. agreed to buy most of Western Union Financial Services Inc. 
for about $900 million in cash and assumed liabilities, giving it virtual 
control of the worldwide money transfer business. 
</P>
<P>
 First Data will pay $595 million in cash and assume an estimated $261 million 
in pension liabilities and $40 million in other debt of Western Union's parent 
company, New Valley Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will strip New Valley of its primary business, leaving it with 
Western Union's message service, about $800 million in cash and $1.1 billion in 
tax credits that can be used to offset profits in future years. Paramus, 
N.J.-based New Valley changed its name from Western Union in September, 1991, 
and filed for bankruptcy protection in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After the transaction, First Data will control the services of wiring money 
and providing money orders for the estimated 20% of U.S. households that don't 
have bank accounts, several analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 For First Data, part of the attraction of Western Union was its highly 
recognizable brand name, as well as its estimated 90% share of the money 
transfer business. 
</P>
<P>
 "An important part of the transaction was licensing the name," said Gary 
Tobin, a spokesman for First Data. 
</P>
<P>
 First Data shares closed unchanged at 45 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 First Data, a former unit of American Express Co., mainly provides "back 
office" information and transaction processing for the telecommunications and 
financial services industries, among others.

BANKERS SCOLDED OVER THE GAP IN RATES CHARGED AND PAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bankers were raked across the coals Thursday, accused by consumers and a House 
lawmaker of jacking up loan rates while keeping a lid on interest rates paid to 
depositors since the Federal Reserve Board tightened its grip on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 But a close reading of the statistics suggests the opposite is true, one 
analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) charged at a hearing of the banking panel he 
chairs that banks -- through their lending rates -- have passed along to 
consumers the full brunt of the four rate increases engineered by the Fed since 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has boosted short-term rates 1.25 percentage points in a bid to head 
off inflation, and Kennedy said banks are "giving themselves a generous markup 
in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are (consumers) paying more for loans -- they're also receiving less 
on their deposits," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, says rates on certificates 
of deposit -- a popular place for consumers to park money -- have risen faster 
than rates on auto loans, credit card loans and other personal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being from Massachusetts, I don't want to rain on Joe Kennedy's parade. But 
the thesis doesn't compute," he said in a phone interview from his office in 
North Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, the banks have been under pressure to contain personal loan 
rates because of weak loan demand," he said. "When farms can't sell their 
apples, they don't raise prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Heady, whose weekly newsletter tracks bank interest rate trends, said rates on 
one-year CDs are now at 3.85%, up from 3.08% in early February, before the Fed 
engineered its first rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 That 0.77 percentage point rise exceeds the increase in rates on new car 
loans, which have increased to 8.35% from 7.91% -- a gain of 0.44 percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Heady said rates on money market accounts have risen less than CD rates 
because banks are under less pressure to increase money market rates to attract 
funds.

 FCC Adopts Personal Phone Plan: The plan will bring consumers a single 
telephone number that will ring them at home, work or anywhere else in the 
United States.It is designed to boost competition among provider companies, 
resulting in consumer charges well below what cellular phone service costs, FCC 
Chairman Reed Hundt said. The action marks the commission's second attempt in 
less than a year to come up with a licensing scheme for the new service, known 
as broad-band personal communications service. License bidding could begin this 
fall.

 Semiconductor Book-to-Bill Ratio Dips: The closely watched barometer measured 
by the Semiconductor Industry Assn. slipped slightly to 1.14 for May from a 
revised 1.15 for April, with North American orders setting a record for the 
third straight month.It beat the estimate of 1.12 by some analysts who expected 
to see the traditional summer chip market slowdown. The April number had been 
revised from 1.14. A ratio greater than 1 indicates the market is expanding. (A 
book-to-bill of 1.14, for example, indicates that makers had $114 in new orders 
from the North American market for every $100 in shipments.)

approached by other exhibitors about a possible merger, but he said no deals 
are pending. Cineplex, the second-largest North American theater chain, with 8% 
of industry revenues, confirmed that companies are looking at it now that its 
cash flow and earnings have improved. "We have been doing a lot of talking, 
we'll continue to talk, but we are not at the threshold of anything yet," Karp

 Kmart CEO Says He Won't Quit: Joseph Antonini said he still has the support of 
the board, Women's Wear Daily reported.Over the last year, the chief executive 
has faced increasing pressure to revive the nation's second-largest retailer. 
He also denied rumors that Kmart might bring in a chief operating officer to 
help get the company back on track. At Kmart's annual meeting last week, 
shareholders rejected a proposal backed by Antonini to sell stakes in the 
company's specialty chains, including Sports Authority, Waldenbooks/Borders, 
Office Max and Builders Square.

 U.S. Breaks Up Price-Fixing Scheme: The Justice Department broke up a 
conspiracy to drive up the price of plastic cups, glasses and other products in 
a $100-million industry, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said. She said three firms 
and four of their executives agreed to plead guilty to charges of violating 
antitrust laws in the scheme, which began in December, 1991, and lasted a 
year.The companies, which make more than 90% of the plastic dinnerware used 
nationwide, are Comet Products Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass.; Plastics Inc. of St. 
Paul, Minn., and Polar Plastics Mfg. of Allentown, Pa. Executives of the firms 
secretly telephoned and met with each other as part of the conspiracy to set 
prices, the department said.

 Unions Prepare USAir Restructuring Plan: A coalition representing unionized 
workers at USAir Group Inc. expects to submit a restructuring plan to the 
troubled airline's management within two weeks.Union officials representing 
USAir pilots, flight attendants, machinists and dispatchers met in Pittsburgh 
to discuss strategy and review analyses conducted by their financial advisers. 
The proposal will include a complete financial analysis of the Virginia-based 
carrier and a plan to stem its huge losses. The coalition's actions are 
expected to be a crucial part of USAir's efforts to restore profitability as it 
battles financial losses and fierce competition from low-cost rivals.

option for those refinancing mortgages, averaged 7.79% this week, down from 
8.02% a week earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

 Money Supply Drops: For the week ended May 30, the measure known as M2 fell $7 
billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,589.2 billion from a revised $3,596.2 
billion the week before, the Federal Reserve Board said.A broader measure, M3, 
fell to $4,215.7 billion, down $3.8 billion from $4,219.5 billion. The 
narrowest measure, M1, fell $400 million to $1,143.8 billion from $1,144.2

STOCKS, BONDS CLOSE FLAT; OIL RISES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds closed Thursday's session mostly unchanged, after trading 
narrowly in anticipation of May wholesale inflation data due out today. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar weakened against major currencies amid heightened 
tensions between the United States and North Korea. Oil prices jumped again on 
supply worries. 
</P>
<P>
 After trading in a 15-point range all day, the Dow Jones industrials closed up 
3.69 points at 3,753.14. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues narrowly led advancers by 1,081 to 986 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a modest 252.9 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also traded in a narrow range as the market moved cautiously ahead of 
today's inflation report. The 30-year Treasury bond yield edged down to 7.27% 
from 7.28% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect that May wholesale inflation rose 0.2%, or 0.3% when volatile 
food and energy prices are excluded. If the figures come in much higher than 
expected, meaning that prices are rising too fast, inflation concerns could be 
reignited on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, markets were calm Thursday despite another jump in oil prices. The July 
futures contract for crude oil in New York rose 33 cents to $18.67 a barrel and 
is up 92 cents over the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts blamed increasing concerns about surprisingly short oil inventories 
in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Food, beverage and restaurant stocks fell sharply after PepsiCo said its 
second-quarter earnings will be about even with last year's $427 million, or 53 
cents a share, because of strong price competition in soft drinks and slower 
restaurant sales. Analysts were looking for a profit increase of about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 PepsiCo dropped as much as 4 5/8 before recovering somewhat to close down 3 at 
31 1/2. Archrival Coca-Cola dropped 1 to 40 5/8, even though Coke reiterated 
earlier statements that its full-year earnings per share will grow "in the 
upper teens to 20%." 
</P>
<P>
 Other consumer stock losers included McDonald's, off 1 3/4 to 60 1/8; Snapple 
Beverage, down 1 3/4 to 24 1/4; and Cott, off 1 1/4 to 18 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks gained after a Senate panel voted to drop a plan to review 
new-drug prices as part of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Merck rose 1 to 31 3/4, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 7/8 to 55 5/8, Lilly 
surged 2 to 57, Pfizer rose 1 1/8 to 63 3/8 and Amgen added 5/8 to 44 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer stocks, which had tumbled Wednesday on sales concerns, were stable. 
IBM rose 3/8 to 62 while Apple advanced 7/8 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. Stocks posted wholesome gains in Tokyo for the 
third straight day. The Nikkei 225-share average ended up 140.83 points at 
21,402.78. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average ended 15.88 points lower at 2,129.32, 
while London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 9.30 points to 3028.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index rose 3.38 points to close at 2,413.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about North Korea pushed the dollar down to 103.95 yen in New York 
from 104.02 on Wednesday, and to 1.669 German marks from 1.670.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: LITTLE BENEFIT IN KIDS' LIFE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have small children, chances are you've received a pitch from Globe 
Life & Accident Co. of Oklahoma City. The 43-year-old insurer sells what it 
calls the "Young American Plan," life insurance for healthy people up to age 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch hits all the right buttons. A few choice phrases: "Make their future 
secure" and "Start an estate for them." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to forget that the chief purpose of life insurance is to provide for 
dependents. Children don't need life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Globe isn't the only insurance company selling policies for kids. Nonetheless, 
its offer illustrates how consumers are often at a disadvantage when trying to 
assess the worth of insurance policies sold through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer is hard to evaluate. The six-page letter provides few details. We're 
told the annual premium for a $5,000 policy is $20. At age 26, the premium 
leaps to $75 a year because the policy builds "cash values." 
</P>
<P>
 We called a toll-free number provided in the solicitation for more details. A 
Globe representative told us that we could obtain a copy of the policy only if 
we applied for insurance and paid for it. If we didn't like the policy, we 
could cancel it and get a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulations taking effect in November will require insurers to disclose 
important details in mail solicitations to Californians. Insurers won't have to 
provide a policy, though. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globe representative did offer to answer our questions. Here's what we 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy up to age 25 is a term life policy. This means that if you let the 
policy lapse, it is canceled and you receive nothing. Those who cancel their 
policies after age 27 will receive a portion of the premium paid after age 26. 
But don't get excited. The amount is small. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash value at age 27 is $10, though $150 in premiums has been paid. The 
cash value rises to $724 at age 46 after $1,500 in premiums has been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globe representative told us that cash value will never equal or exceed 
total premiums paid. That's stingier than the typical whole life policy. A 
representative from the National Insurance Consumer Organization told us that 
people who hang on to whole life policies usually get back at least what they 
have paid in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globe representative couldn't tell us how many people collect on the 
policy. Chances are few people do. On average, half of all term life insurance 
policies lapse after 10 years, NICO said.  
</P>
<P>
 Globe says it has sold millions of these policies, probably because parents 
figured that at $20 a year, they had little to lose. There is also very little 
to gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Check is in the mail: People from as far away as South Carolina are receiving 
overnight letters from the California Marketing Assn. of Riverside, saying a 
cash bonus of $2,500 awaits them. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters say people have been selected to receive a cash award based on "an 
entry form sent in last September." To get the cash award, people are told to 
send California Marketing $78.50 to cover "overnight express, insurance and 
handling fees." 
</P>
<P>
 We called California Marketing to find out more about the offer, but our call 
wasn't returned. The Better Business Bureau in Cypress reports that it has 
received nearly 70 inquiries about the offer from people all over the country, 
indicating dozens of letters have been sent out. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Better Business Bureau, some people who accepted the offer 
are sorry they did. One person told the bureau that California Marketing did 
not send the bonus check and has not responded to letters and telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal authorities we contacted were unaware of California Marketing Assn. A 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service said that in most cases, it 
is illegal to conduct lotteries through the mail. The spokeswoman said 
consumers should be cautious when asked to pay a fee in order to receive cash 
awards or prizes.

COMPANIES CUT BACK ON MERIT PAY HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with continued pressure to control costs and raise productivity, major 
corporations are expected to increase budgets for merit pay by only 3.8% this 
year -- the lowest such increase in 20 years, according to a salary survey 
released Thursday . 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, bonuses and other forms of compensation tied to productivity and 
performance are continuing to grow in use, according to Towers Perrin, a New 
York-based management consulting firm that conducts an annual salary survey of 
companies with revenues of at least $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of the companies surveyed offer variable pay programs, 
which include lump-sum bonuses to individuals or groups of employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Merit pay increases, which usually have little to do with performance, 
permanently raise an employee's base salary and often include a cost-of-living 
adjustment. Performance-based bonuses, on the other hand, do not raise base 
salary and are given only to employees who meet specific criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Providing employees with a one-time payment instead of a base salary increase 
-- and thus controlling increases in fixed costs -- is becoming more prevalent 
as a mechanism to control costs," said Susan Rowland, a principal in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during a preliminary survey last year, many companies projected that 
they would raise merit pay budgets by 4.1% this year. But after budgets were 
finalized, the rate fell to 3.8% as executives remained cautious about the 
economy, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although relatively small, the increase in merit pay exceeds the estimated 
2.9% increase in this year's cost of living, Rowland said. 
</P>
<P>
 After growing as much as 10% annually during the inflationary 1970s, merit pay 
increases began to shrink in the early 1980s as inflationary pressure eased and 
companies became more cost-conscious.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, workers may no longer depend only on merit pay increases to 
increase their income noticeably, Rowland said. Instead, many must compete for 
bonuses to raise their salaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "For workers to continue to increase their pay, they have to demonstrate that 
they added value to an organization," Rowland said. "It's not going to be 
through the regular process."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SONY AWAITS CANTON AND BERNSTEIN ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may not have the same ring as Woodward and Bernstein, but Sony Pictures is 
said to be razor-close to ushering in the era of Canton and Bernstein. The 
Culver City-based studio expects to announce the long-anticipated hiring of MCA 
Executive Vice President Fred Bernstein within a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein will join Mark Canton in running Sony's Columbia Pictures and 
TriStar Pictures divisions. Sources say he will report to Canton but will 
primarily focus on the management side of the studio operations, while Canton 
continues to concern himself with the creative end. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's negotiations with Bernstein have been an open secret in Hollywood for 
weeks and were recently detailed by the Hollywood Reporter. Sources say the 
talks were nearly derailed several times by MCA's hardball tactics over 
releasing the executive, who has a year to go on his contract. At one stage, 
MCA even suggested trading Bernstein for the TriStar marketing team of Buffy 
Shutt and Kathy Jones, according to several sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt and Jones are staying at TriStar under a new deal. The executives, who 
operate as a team and who received much of the credit for the surprise success 
of "Sleepless in Seattle" and the strong box office opening of "Guarding Tess," 
also had overtures from MGM last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony and MCA declined to comment on Bernstein, who was also unavailable. 
Sources say his title will probably be Motion Picture Group president. He is 
expected to assume the post by early next month. One source described 
Bernstein's expected role as heavily business-oriented. Besides the two 
studios, he will oversee Sony Classics, Triumph Releasing and Columbia/TriStar 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sony has been on the lookout for a top management executive to fill the motion 
picture job since spring, when Jonathan Dolgen left to become chairman of the 
new Viacom Entertainment Group, which includes Paramount Pictures. People close 
to the discussions say MCA did not want to release Bernstein until it concluded 
contract discussions with Casey Silver, who was elevated from Universal 
Pictures production president to president of the studio last week. The reason, 
sources explained, is that Uniervsal did not want to risk losing two top 
executives at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein was largely known as a deal negotiator during his six years at MCA, 
and was said to be instrumental in setting up the Gramercy Pictures joint 
venture between MCA and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. A former entertainment 
lawyer, Bernstein joined the movie business as vice president of business 
affairs at PolyGram Pictures. He went on to work as president of worldwide 
production at Columbia Pictures in 1983 before moving to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bernstein will not be on an equal footing with Canton, as Dolgen was, 
sources say Canton is clearly anxious to re-create the kind of working 
relationship he had with Dolgen as Sony Pictures tries to rebound from an off 
year. Sony Corp. recently reported that its movie-TV division revenue sank by 
7%, to $3.2 billion, for the fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia Pictures, in particular, has come under criticism for releasing only 
two movies during the first five months of this year, compared to seven a year 
ago. Some insiders have blamed the paltry output on executives being overly 
absorbed last year with "Last Action Hero," the big-budget bomb. But studio 
sources insist that Columbia will soon be back on course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The studio has much of its comeback riding on "Wolf," a romantic horror movie 
starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. People close to Columbia 
maintain that "Wolf" is playing extremely well with test audiences. The film 
opens nationally on June 17. In an unusual move for a star of his stature, 
Nicholson will put in an appearance at the "Fangoria Weekend of Horrors 
Convention" at the LAX Hilton on Saturday to promote the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia also hopes to do big business with "City Slickers II," opening today. 
The sequel was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, Columbia's biggest 
outside supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the development side, sources say Columbia is making a strong push to 
acquire the rights to Barbie, the perennially popular doll. Canton is a 
longtime friend of Jill E. Barad, president and chief executive of Barbie 
manufacturer Mattel Inc. Studio executives are said to see franchise potential 
in the doll. "She's hotter than a day at the beach," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stock riddle: Wall Street and Hollywood insiders were at a loss to explain the 
surge in Viacom's stock price Thursday. Viacom Class A shares gained $2.75, 
closing at $33.75 on the Amex in light trading.  
</P>
<P>
 Some speculated that a deal could be at hand for Madison Square Garden and the 
two professional sports teams Viacom acquired in its $10-billion acquisition of 
Paramount Communications. Viacom is also said to be in discussions over the 
sale of Paramount's Famous Music Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 One other theory was that traders were responding to Viacom's recent progress 
in settling its differences with cable giant Tele-Communications Inc.

COMPANY TOWN; WITH 'SCAVENGERS,' FOX TV HUNTS IN NEW TERRITORY; BROADCASTING: 
THE SCI-FI GAME SHOW IS A TRULY INTERNATIONAL EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Although Britain's Pinewood Studios is enjoying a small renaissance this 
spring, with two Hollywood movies being produced there, the most significant 
action at the famous facility is not "Mary Reilly" with Julia Roberts and John 
Malkovich or "First Knight" with Sean Connery and Richard Gere. It's a 20th 
Century Fox International TV show called "Scavengers." 
</P>
<P>
 The first U.S. game show based on a fantasy science-fiction competition may 
point the way to future American TV productions in Europe under the recently 
approved General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: It represents a true 
international effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The European television market is a mature business," said Doug Schwalbe, 
vice president of marketing and co-production of 20th Century Fox International 
Television. "There is no more growth in selling U.S. shows to Europe. With the 
quotas now in effect, we have to find a way to expand. Making European 
productions is the best way to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 American companies have made many programs in partnership with European 
broadcasters. What makes "Scavengers" different is that it has been funded by 
European broadcasters and does not rely on the deep pockets of U.S. production 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scavengers" also represents a case of Fox looking outside Hollywood for 
original ideas to redo. Normally, if Hollywood likes a European idea, it buys 
it and rebuilds it. "All in the Family" was based on the British TV series 
"Till Death Us Do Part," and "Three's Company" was based on Britain's "Man 
About the House." "Scavengers" was conceived as an international production 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is not targeted to any particular national audience. Fox and 
producers Julian Grant and Jean Paul Chapple are bringing in contestants from 
Britain, Spain, Germany and Denmark to shoot their own-language versions of the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 With its $275,000-an-hour budget, "Scavengers" is considerably cheaper than 
most American game shows, not to mention the $1.4-million-per-episode "Star 
Trek: The Next Generation," to which "Scavengers" immodestly likes to compare 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of 'Scavengers' is that you can be in an action movie. People want 
to play at being Schwarzenegger -- that really appeals," Chapple says. 
</P>
<P>
 One look at the $2.3-million third-millenium set and it is easy to see what he 
means. It's dark and smoky, with flashing lights and various alien forms -- 
rather like " 'Alien' Meets 'American Gladiators.' " It represents the inside 
of the Cyclops, an abandoned spaceship whose dangerous interior contestants 
must negotiate to retrieve deadly debris in order to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Each culture has a different approach to the game, though. "The Spanish are 
far less concerned with the fairness of the game, which is very important to 
the British," Chapple says. They are concerned, however, with the amount of 
flesh visible on female contestants. Whereas the British women cover their 
midriffs and sport rubber bra cups on their torso armor to match their knee and 
elbow pads, the Spanish female contestants bare their midriffs and wear 
breast-enhancing foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Action-adventure game shows have had some success in Europe, with "The Crystal 
Maze" in Britain and "Le Fort Boyard" in France, but neither show has made it 
across the Atlantic. Though Fox is not counting on American television picking 
up the show right away, it is hoping to sell a version to the syndication 
market at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 When the idea for "Scavengers" first came to Fox, Fox Broadcasting Co. 
Chairwoman Lucie Salhany put up $80,000 for its development. Half the 
$3-million production cost for the show is covered by the license fees from 
international partners. Fox's $1.5-million deficit on "Scavengers" is typical 
for a write-off on a U.S. pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Fox's current partners order another season, it will cover its costs. 
However, with sales to other world markets such as Japan and Australia, both 
under discussion, and licensing by a U.S. broadcaster, the show is likely to be 
a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Scavengers" works and a market for related products develops, the rewards 
for Fox will be big. There is a video game in development by Fox and Probe, the 
European company that produced the "Aliens" game, which will go ahead 
regardless of whether the show succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also plans for the set to be transported to an airline hangar and 
transformed into a tourist attraction.

confidence after Deloitte & Touche abruptly resigned as its auditors in an 
accounting dispute, named two outside directors to an oversight subcommittee 
that will hire new auditors as well as review the company's accounting systems 
and controls. The Culver City-based company's stock plunged more than 50% last 
week -- triggering shareholder lawsuits -- after the Deloitte resignation was 
made public.The subcommittee will be chaired by Franklin E. Fried, former 
chairman of a seafood distribution company. IDB did not name the second 
director in its announcement, but it later confirmed that it is Joseph M. 
Cohen, who last month joined with IDB Chairman Jeffrey P. Sudikoff in buying 
72% of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. IDB, which transmits TV, radio and 
telephone signals through its satellite communications network, said the panel 
will retain its own accounting consultant and lawyer. JAMES BATES

of the Week Music industry executives are posturing around George Michael as 
the singer awaits the outcome of a British lawsuit against his record label, 
Sony, which could result in his freedom to sign with a new label. Michael is 
contending that his Sony contract is unfair due to its duration and that it 
constitutes a restraint of trade.Though some industry insiders believe that 
Michael has lost the commercial luster he packed in the late '80s -- they cite 
the disappointing performance of his Queen tribute charity project for Disney's 
Hollywood label -- others contend that the right record would bring him back to 
multi-platinum status. Note: Hits magazine is a weekly music industry trade

<P>
 Employers have a lot to say about summer job applicants, and much of it isn't 
good. Here are some tips on making a good impression. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear appropriate clothes. "It doesn't take much to stand out against the 
rest," said Gary J. Vien, director of administration at Six Flags Magic 
Mountain in Valencia, adding that teen-agers sometimes arrive barefoot at his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be on time for the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't chew gum during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't answer questions with a simple yes or no. Employers want you to talk. 
"I don't want to have to probe for answers," said Loren Farell, owner of Regal 
Cleaners in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't call and ask if any jobs are open. Instead, go in person and ask 
during business hours. If the firm advertised a specific time period for 
accepting applications, go near the beginning of it, not the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't bring friends or relatives to the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a resume, include school activities, foreign languages, computer 
training and any courses that may have required special skills. JILL LEOVY

QUAKE RECOVERY PROGRAM CANCELED; FINANCES: WILSON SCRAPS PLAN FOR $575 MILLION 
IN LOANS TO RECONSTRUCT HOUSING IN WAKE OF BOND ISSUE'S DEFEAT. CITY OFFICIALS 
FEAR SERIOUS IMPACT.

 Plans for the reconstruction of nearly 20,000 vacant apartment units in Los 
Angeles are in jeopardy after Gov. Pete Wilson canceled a loan program for the 
owners of earthquake-damaged buildings, a city housing official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of the $575-million California Natural Disaster Assistance Program also 
will gut the city's program to rescue an additional 18,000 apartment units and 
10,000 houses at risk of abandonment because the owners cannot afford repairs, 
said Gary Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our recovery strategy is sort of in disarray right now," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson canceled the program Wednesday in response to the defeat of Measure 1A, 
the $2-billion earthquake-relief bond, on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the governor's announcement, state housing officials had planned to 
unveil the program at a news conference in Chatsworth on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have given out the details and what people would have needed to take 
to the emergency service centers," said John Frith, assistant director of the 
Department of Housing and Community Development. "We were planning on issuing 
and accepting applications next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Frith said the department will work with local and federal officials and 
lenders to try to work out innovative ways to assist earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said, however, that all other means have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a critical part of the resources we need," Squier said. "We have 
resources, but we're going to run out. I estimate we're going to be able to 
take care of 40% of the need." 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said the state loans were a last resort for the owners of 2,750 
apartment buildings, predominantly in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, 
vacated because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have sufficient resources, a percentage of the buildings 
definitely will go unrepaired," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the now-vacant buildings, Squier said, there are 28,000 other houses 
and apartment units that could be abandoned as the owners and tenants lose 
faith that repairs can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 They "are on streets that have become abandoned due to the damage around 
them," Squier said. "The tenants have left because it's just a scary place to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have been unable to obtain federal assistance because the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency makes no loans to apartment owners, and Small 
Business Administration loans do not meet their needs, Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA loans cannot exceed $1.5 million, which is not enough to repair many 
larger buildings. The state loan program that would have been funded by the 
bond issue had no limit for apartment loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Other apartment owners do not qualify for the loans because, with no tenants 
paying rent, they cannot afford to begin making loan payments immediately, as 
required by the SBA, Squier said. The state loans would have offered flexible 
repayment options. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FEMA does lend money to homeowners for earthquake repairs, the 
maximum is $22,000 per recipient, Squier said. The state loans were intended to 
add up to $50,000, enabling the repair of more heavily damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As contemplated, had the bond measure passed, the state loan program would 
have provided $315 million for single-family homes and $160 million for 
apartments, plus a $100-million pool to induce private lenders to make further 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that money, large numbers of property owners can soon be expected to 
walk away from their homes and apartment buildings, allowing whole 
neighborhoods to drift into decay, Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, lenders allowed the owners of damaged buildings to suspend mortgage 
payments for a period after the earthquake but now are beginning to start 
foreclosure proceedings against those who cannot pay, Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Squier said he had planned to begin taking applications from apartment owners 
for state loans this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We . . . were ready to roll," he said. "Now we won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city has $89 million in federal housing relief grants available 
to assist homeowners and apartment owners. An additional $20 million is 
expected from a federal neighborhood reconstruction program, Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to know what the total need is," he said. "We're clearly short $100 
million, probably $200 (million) for rebuilding these apartments and 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Natural Disaster Assistance Program was formed after the 1989 
Loma Prieta earthquake to make up for deficiencies in the federal relief 
effort, said Mary Comerio, professor of architecture at UC Berkeley, who 
studied the reconstruction of Bay Area housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Comerio said the state program, financed by a temporary sales tax in 1989, 
proved ineffective because of start-up problems and insufficient funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provided $43 million for houses and $43 million for apartments, 
Comerio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the inadequacy of federal and state housing relief programs, about 
40% of the 12,000 damaged dwellings in Oakland and San Francisco remain vacant 
because the owners could not afford to repair them, she said.

JUDGE SAYS COUNTY CANNOT BAR PLAYBOY MAGAZINE IN FIREHOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Thursday struck down a Los Angeles County order that forbade 
male firefighters to read or possess Playboy magazine in firehouses, ruling 
that the anti-sexual-harassment measure violated constitutional guarantees of 
free speech and press. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued an order barring the county 
from enforcing its ban on Playboy against Fire Capt. Steven W. Johnson, who 
brought a lawsuit challenging the policy. The judge found that the ban placed 
"severe limitations on Johnson's 1st Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials failed to prove their argument "that quiet reading of Playboy 
contributes to a sexually harassing atmosphere," Wilson announced at a hearing 
in U.S. District Court in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the county said they will probably appeal Wilson's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win for both sides," said Johnson, a 27-year-veteran who was 
represented by American Civil Liberties Union and Playboy attorneys, "because 
now both sides can choose what they want to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a resident of Corona del Mar, said he plans to have a copy of Playboy 
in hand when he returns to work Monday at his station in Lake Los Angeles, in 
the far northeastern corner of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials banned Playboy and other magazines featuring 
pictures of nude or skimpily dressed women from all work locations in 1992, 
saying the measure was needed to prevent development of a "sexually charged 
environment" for the department's 11 female firefighters, who work with about 
2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's trial, one county official testified that the ban would also 
apply to certain issues of Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated 
magazines that contained pictures of nude or partially nude women. Whether 
county fire officials will apply Wilson's ruling to all magazines remains 
unknown, because the judge's order specifies only Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's attorneys argued that the ban violated his constitutional rights, 
and that although the county may have had good intentions, the policy was vague 
and overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department said they didn't want Capt. Johnson reading something they 
didn't want him thinking about," said ACLU attorney Paul L. Hoffman after the 
hearing Thursday. "When you start allowing that kind of thought control, you're 
going down the wrong track."  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters, who were ordered by department headquarters not to comment on 
the decision, had mixed reactions but asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our department was totally wrong," one captain said. "There are nude pictures 
in National Geographic. Will we ban that next?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another firefighter protested that the attention given the dispute will 
mislead the public. "Where I work, we don't have time to read anything. We 
don't just read dirty books, play cards and sit around the station. We 
responded to more than 11,000 calls last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston, executive director of the Southern California chapter of the 
ACLU, declared Thursday's ruling a victory for Johnson and his desire to 
quietly read Playboy at his station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud the county for developing a policy on sexual harassment," Ripston 
said. "But the right to read is something the 1st Amendment protects." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, described Wilson's ruling as "simply wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "What the ACLU and this judge have shown is that living, breathing women's 
rights count less in this system," Bruce said.

URBAN INDIANS SEEK A HIGHER PROFILE; SOCIAL SERVICES: AN L.A. GROUP IS GOING TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE TO URGE INCREASED AID FOR NATIVE AMERICANS WHO LIVE IN 
METROPOLITAN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County could be called the secret capital of Indian America. There 
are an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Native Americans, more than in any other U.S. 
metropolitan area, more than on any reservation -- and yet they are invisible 
to most Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Today a delegation of American Indians from Los Angeles will travel to 
Washington to join a meeting with White House officials aimed at raising the 
profile of urban Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that 60% of Native Americans live in cities, activists from across the 
country plan to lobby the federal government for social services targeted 
specifically at urban Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to make the government "more aware of the fact that Indian people 
are struggling in urban areas," said David Rambeau, a Paiute and director of a 
Skid Row center that serves poor families and homeless people of many tribes. 
"There needs to be an urban Indian policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, urban Indians say, it has been reservation Indians who get 
virtually all public and government attention, as evidenced by the high-profile 
meeting of tribal leaders with President Bill Clinton two months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Urban Indians do not expect their visit to receive the heavy television 
coverage that was given to the tribal leaders. They will not wear 
camera-attracting feather headdresses, and some, because they are of mixed 
ancestry, do not look like people's stereotypical images of Indians. Yet for 
these activists, tribal identity remains central to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has a large Native American population largely because of a U.S. 
government relocation policy in the 1950s and 1960s. Tens of thousands of 
people from scores of tribes were given bus tickets off their reservations and 
were promised help finding jobs in big cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local Indian activists have long believed the government's aim was not merely 
to assimilate Native Americans but to wipe out their Indian identity by 
immersing them in mainstream environments, says Colleen Colson, a Cherokee who 
is a member of the Los Angeles City-County Native American Indian Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously (the policy) didn't work because we're all still here," Colson 
said. "(It) makes us want to fight harder to be close to our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of relocation, the Los Angeles region has one of the most diverse 
Native American populations in the country. Only a small minority of the 
Indians are from Southern California tribes. Because the government discouraged 
Indians from clustering together, they are scattered across the Los Angeles 
Basin, with no predominantly Indian neighborhoods, clusters of shops, or 
community centers. Large numbers live in the Long Beach, Bell Gardens and other 
Southeast Los Angeles County cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some Indians have little interest in their tribal roots and live 
entirely mainstream lives, others are actively trying to maintain or rediscover 
traditions. On almost any weekend in Los Angeles, hundreds of American Indians 
gather at powwows, the pan-tribal community gatherings featuring dance 
competitions, food and fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 Others gather on Skid Row. About 20% of Native Americans in Los Angeles live 
below the poverty level, a reflection of the fact that urban Indians face many 
of the same problems of Indians on reservations, such as alcoholism and low 
education levels, says Colson. They suffer higher rates of diabetes, 
tuberculosis and heart disease than the population as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 They also face the stress of adjusting to a pace of life far faster and more 
competitive than that on reservations and aggravated by the lack of a 
traditional family support systems. In addition, the continuing influx of 
newcomers from reservations and rural areas to Los Angeles burdens American 
Indian-oriented social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Indians say they face identity conflicts on a more regular basis than 
reservation Indians because they are surrounded by people who tend to hold 
images of them formed by Hollywood Westerns.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, Native Americans who look like the popular conception of Plains 
Indians -- tall, dark and Roman-nosed -- are greeted as "Chief" on the street 
and face taunts at work. Indians who are paler or otherwise fail the stereotype 
hear questions raised about whether they are Indians at all. And all struggle 
with the inability of many people to recognize that their many tribes have 
different cultures and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our children don't identify themselves as Indian (in school). They 
don't want the hassle," Rambeau said. They would rather be taken for Mexican 
Americans than be asked about tepees or asked to "play Indian" in Thanksgiving 
Pilgrim plays -- when their own tribes never lived in tents and never were 
anywhere near Massachusetts, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Native Americans also face an onslaught of curiosity 
from spiritual seekers looking for enlightenment in Native American religion.  
</P>
<P>
 "People choose to romanticize American Indians. If we don't meet their 
expectations or their stereotypes, we tend to be discounted as American 
Indians," Colson said.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Los Angeles Indian community includes rap musicians, skateboard 
champions, doctors, teachers and engineers. "People need to realize," Colson 
said, "that we're very much here and very much part of today's world."URBAN

FROM BOOS TO CHEERS; STUDENTS HAIL RETURN OF ARTS HIGH TEACHER AFTER 
CONTROVERSY OVER OUTCRY AT PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Facing a torrent of criticism, the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts 
on Thursday reinstated a dance teacher who lost his job because he booed a 
satirical student sketch that was loaded with racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Don Bondi quickly became a lightning rod in Southern California 
for the often-competing interests of free speech and so-called political 
correctness. It was rooted in a prolonged behind-the-scenes debate at the 
Eastside arts school over how to increase participation of racial minorities 
without tampering with artistic freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 County school officials reassigned Bondi, who is white, to a desk job at 
another school in April after he booed a student Mexican-heritage production in 
which Gov. Pete Wilson was portrayed as a buffoonish racist. The outburst 
occurred when the curtain fell on the hourlong production. A Latina school 
board member, whose son was in the play, immediately chastised Bondi, telling 
him to "control your racism," and transferred him later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Bondi's dance students and other arts students, representing a 
variety of ethnic groups and races, launched a letter-writing campaign, staged 
demonstrations and posted signs reading: "Truth Is Mighty and Will Prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bondi stepped back into the school's dance studio Thursday, students 
shouted and rushed at him, embracing the 61-year-old dance department chairman 
in a group hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's eyes filled with tears as he thanked his students, and the pianist 
burst into a snappy rendition of "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow." 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that you can make a difference, and yes, one person can do it, but 
only when that one person gets the support I got," Bondi said. 
</P>
<P>
 What may have convinced school officials to reverse themselves was the 
American Civil Liberties Union's threat to file a lawsuit Thursday alleging 
that Bondi's 1st Amendment rights as a teacher had been violated.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good lesson for students about the importance of robust political 
debate," said Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU of Southern 
California. "This was a political satire and Mr. Bondi booed; he didn't stop 
the production. It's a lesson that students learned . . . that the 1st 
Amendment protects both popular and unpopular views." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, who reinstated Bondi hours before a deadline set by the 
ACLU, denied the threatened suit influenced them, and declined to explain their 
decision. Frank Kwan, director of communications for the county Office of 
Education, said school officials plan to meet today to discuss "trying to make 
Bondi's transition (back to school) as smooth as possible." Another official, 
Philip Rocha, insisted that the transfer had followed county education 
personnel rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's reinstatement is not likely to end the controversy, which has aroused 
deep feelings about racial issues and, some say, could trigger protests against 
the teacher's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 His reassignment was a blow to the small, close-knit Arts High, which is 
located on the Cal State L.A. campus and draws 480 students from districts 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bondi was like a father to the (dance) department, to us," said Veronica 
De La Rosa, a 17-year-old junior and dance major. "Without him, it was a 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Rosa attended the performance that threatened to derail Bondi's teaching 
career. When she saw him boo, she was not surprised. Bondi had always been 
outspoken, she said, and he had always urged students to voice their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taught that art has to be either criticized or appreciated -- one or 
the other," De La Rosa said.  
</P>
<P>
 The show that triggered Bondi's outburst featured a young actor who, 
portraying Wilson, launched into a rambling monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I am not racist," the Wilson character said. "I love 
Mexicans -- everyone should have one." 
</P>
<P>
 When the character finished, Bondi was part of an audience chorus of boos and 
hisses. Some agreed with the portrayal, and others -- including Bondi -- were 
offended by the caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, county Board of Education Vice President Maria Elena Gaitan 
reprimanded Bondi and accused him of being racist. She did not return phone 
calls seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi said the seven-week ordeal has caused him to reconsider his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The booing really resulted in harm to the very people I didn't want to harm, 
the young people," he said. "Probably what I would do is demand another 
assembly to discuss the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi said he has received more than 100 phone calls and received scores of 
letters from supporters since his reassignment became public in a May 30 Times 
article, including words of encouragement from a high school friend he had not 
heard from in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Several teachers said they were delighted by Bondi's return, though few wished 
to discuss the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy he's back -- he's a valuable person," said Ka-Ron Brown, a 
dance teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi's waiting students were exuberant Thursday as they gathered to greet him 
before class. Most were clad in leotards and sweat pants, ready to dance. But 
several others, like Justin Wheeler, a senior theater student, had no intention 
of joining the class; he merely wanted to welcome Bondi. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are laws, not just legal law but moral laws," Wheeler said. "We are 
artists. We believe in freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Bondi arrived, hugged his students one by one, then scooted into the dance 
studio, where the class had already begun, and took his place at the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just two words," he told them. "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 And with that, the dancing began.

2 TEEN-AGERS ARRESTED IN RACE KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two teen-age members of a Laotian gang have been arrested on suspicion of 
murder in a racially motivated shooting attack last month that killed three 
Latino youths and left three others severely wounded, Long Beach police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the victims -- all males ages 15 to 19 -- were members of dance 
clubs who drove from Los Angeles to attend a birthday party and were unaware of 
the lethal rivalry between Latino and Asian gangs in the Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were identified "through countless hours of running down tips and 
leads," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Jim Bisetti of the task force his 
department formed with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisetti said one of the suspects, 16, was arrested at his home last Friday on 
an outstanding warrant linking him to an unrelated crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was brought in and questioned," Bisetti said. "He made statements linking 
himself and his partner to the shootings." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they spotted the other suspect, 17, near Atlantic Boulevard and 
20th Street in Long Beach about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday and took him into custody 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are absolutely the two shooters in the case," Bisetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very big arrests," said Cpl. Josef Levy, a Police Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their ages, the suspects' identities were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger boy was being held at the Los Padrinos juvenile detention facility 
after his arraignment Wednesday on three counts of murder and three counts of 
attempted murder. The district attorney's office said the older boy, who was 
being held at the Long Beach city jail, will be arraigned today or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the May 15 attack was in retaliation for the shooting 
deaths of two Cambodian American gang members five days earlier and was part of 
a continuing interracial gang war that has raged through several Long Beach 
neighborhoods for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, Justino (Pancho) Rodriguez, 22; Angel Alvarez, 18; 
Juan Luis Figueroa, 14; his older brother, Jose Figueroa, and two teen-age 
friends went to the Latino birthday party near 12th Street and Lewis Avenue the 
evening of May 15 to hand out flyers inviting the party-goers to a dance days 
later in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said an Asian gang member may have telegraphed the attack when he 
drove up to the open-air party, got out of his car with his face masked with a 
bandanna, and waved a handgun at the crowd of about 100 dancers. Although the 
party-goers and the gunman exchanged shouted taunts, no shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the dancers were afraid to leave the party, the six young men 
from Los Angeles were unaware of the violent rivalry between the Asian and 
Latino gangs in Long Beach, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the six young men began to walk to their car, two attackers, clad in black, 
stepped into the street and calmly opened fire, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the old gangster movies with all the bodies lying in the street 
and in the car," said Mariana Richard, who lives nearby. "It was a bloody 
massacre." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, Alvarez and Juan Figueroa fell to the pavement, mortally wounded. 
Jose Figueroa and the two other teen-agers were wounded but are recovering.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMERCE; MAN KILLED, 2 
CRITICALLY WOUNDED BY ABDUCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was killed and two other were critically wounded Wednesday night after 
abductors drove them to a quiet industrial section of Commerce and shot them 
several times, Sheriff's Department officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived at Pacific Way near Oak Street shortly after 10 p.m. and 
found the victims. The motive was not immediately clear and there were no 
witnesses, Deputy Irma Beceirra said. The two survivors were in critical 
condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the three men were kidnaped by four people and were 
taken to Commerce near a railway yard, where there are few people at night and 
the Long Beach Freeway is easily accessible.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
GUARDIAN ANGELS LAUNCH PATROLS ON SEPULVEDA BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they have been inundated by calls from residents frightened by crime, 
the Guardian Angels this week returned to the San Fernando Valley, opening a 
local headquarters and launching patrols on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels set up shop in the Valley once before, in 1982, but pulled out 
three years later to consolidate operations in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 Guardian Angels Southern California Director Weston Conwell said his private 
group, which conducts anti-crime patrols by civilian volunteers who have no 
police powers, has received hundreds of requests for assistance, especially 
after the Los Angeles Police Department released studies of so-called Valley 
crime hot spots.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA BAY; 
CHEVRON WILL BUILD REEF TO RE-CREATE SURFING SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chevron agreed to create an artificial reef in the Santa Monica Bay to make up 
for the surfing spots that disappeared after the oil company built a jetty in 
El Segundo, it was announced today.  
</P>
<P>
 The joint agreement between Chevron, the Surfrider Foundation and the 
California Coastal Commission is the first time a major corporation, public 
agency and citizens group have joined forces to re-create surfing spots, said 
Surfrider Foundation Executive Director Jake Grubb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become fundamental in our society that precious resources such as 
wetlands, forest habitats and endangered species must be preserved and 
restored," Grubb said. "This is the first time in modern history that ocean 
waves have been recognized and valued in the very same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron will help restore surf breaks that were lost when the company built a 
rock jetty to protect tankers docking at an offshore terminal. The jetty, south 
of a popular surfing spot called El Porto, was built after the fierce winter 
storms of 1983-84 hammered the bay.  
</P>
<P>
 The oil company got permission to build the jetty only after agreeing to 
evaluate the impact of the jetty on surf conditions over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider Foundation spokeswoman Michelle Kremer said other artificial reefs 
have been created in the past -- usually by sinking an old ship in shallow 
waters -- but those were created for fishing, not surfing. This marks the first 
time an artificial reef will be built in the United States for the sole purpose 
of creating waves for surfing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ALAMO WED 
MARRIED WOMEN, 15-YEAR-OLDS, PROSECUTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles hearing on child abuse charges was postponed Thursday for 
evangelist Tony Alamo, who remained in jail in Memphis, where a federal 
prosecutor accused him of marrying eight of his followers since 1993, including 
married women and 15-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, 59, was convicted by a Memphis federal court jury Wednesday on tax 
charges.The marriage accusations were made by federal prosecutor Christopher 
Belcher as an argument against allowing him to go free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher said such offenses would fall under state laws against statutory rape 
in Tennessee and Arkansas, but state prosecutors have filed no such charges 
against Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo's conviction in the tax evasion case clears the way for him to return to 
Los Angeles to stand trial on charges that he ordered the beating of a young 
boy at his onetime Saugus commune. A hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court in 
that case was rescheduled for July 29.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAYOR WINS 
BACKING FOR PRIVATE PARKING PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Transportation Commission on Thursday endorsed Mayor Richard 
Riordan's plan to privatize parking ticket-writing operations on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel split on requiring private companies to pay wages comparable to 
Civil Service salaries.Riordan proposed the pilot program as a streamlining and 
revenue-making venture.  
</P>
<P>
 "Efficiency is not achieved through paying people lower wages," Commissioner 
Ryan Snyder said. "That is not an efficiency. That is just done at the expense 
of the workers." 
</P>
<P>
 But some commissioners do not believe the city can legally push that 
requirement. Instead, the panel's recommendation included a statement that "the 
city has interest in employing local residents in good jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Service Employees International Union Local 347, which represents the 
city's 500 parking control officers, echoed the same concern in a public 
hearing in May.  
</P>
<P>
 The commission further recommended that the Department of Transportation be 
allowed to compete for the contract against private companies. In addition, the 
winning contract must promote gender and ethnic diversity on its parking 
enforcement force.  
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials estimate that the pilot program can generate an extra 
$9 million in ticket revenues each year. The program will add 100 officers, not 
contract out existing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan, the city will follow the lead of other 
municipalities, such as West Hollywood. The department already contracts out 
other parking functions, such as ticket collections.

DISTRICT WILL GIVE CLAS TESTS TODAY; EDUCATION: JUDGE SAYS ANTELOPE VALLEY'S 
PLANNED APPEAL OF HER PREVIOUS RULING ON THE EXAMS DOES NOT JUSTIFY DELAYING 
THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER and JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of protesting the state-mandated CLAS tests as being anti-family 
and an invasion of privacy, the Antelope Valley Union High School District was 
ordered Thursday to administer the tests before the school year ends next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne, who had ruled Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court that the 
district could not refuse to give students the tests, issued an additional 
order Thursday saying that a planned appeal could not be used as an excuse to 
delay the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Because students are scheduled to take final exams on all school days next 
week, the CLAS tests -- normally given over four days -- will be administered 
in their entirety today to 3,000 10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really will not be any kind of test at all," said board member Wilda 
Andrejcik, who has been in the minority in her support of the tests and desire 
to give it. "I'm very frustrated that this wasn't resolved earlier. (The test) 
has lost all its validity." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the school district and state Department of Education blamed each 
other for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have given it earlier and under better conditions," said Susie 
Lange, a Department of Education spokeswoman. "They made that choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Redondo Beach school officials said they will refuse to administer 
portions of the tests to eighth- and 10th-graders, despite a recent court 
ruling that state law requires the exams.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to state education officials Wednesday, Supt. Beverly J. Rohrer 
stated that controversy and parental confusion surrounding the exams had 
compromised their validity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many of the district's students have already taken the tests, 
providing the state with a representative sampling of students' abilities, 
Rohrer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Unified is one of six districts in the state to refuse to 
administer portions of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Redondo officials Wednesday, acting state Supt. William D. 
Dawson urged trustees to reconsider, arguing that Monday's court ruling against 
school officials in Antelope Valley also applied to Redondo schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to follow the law is hardly the kind of modeling our society expects 
of public school board members," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, who had not seen the district's most recent letter, would not say 
Thursday whether the state Department of Education would seek a court order 
against Redondo schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to consider their response and make a judgment at that time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo school board attorney David Miller said Thursday that he believes 
Monday's court decision applies only to Antelope Valley schools. He had not 
reviewed the most recent letter from Dawson.

OFFICERS' USE OF FORCE PLAYED ROLE IN MAN'S DEATH, CORONER SAYS; INQUIRY: 
RULING FINDS THAT JOHN BERNARD WILEY JR. ALSO HAD SEVERELY BLOCKED ARTERIES. HE 
DIED AFTER STRUGGLING WITH DEPUTIES IN COUNTY-USC JAIL WARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old former construction worker who died in the County-USC Medical 
Center jail ward after struggling with deputies in March succumbed to a 
combination of the officers' use of restraint maneuvers and severe heart 
disease, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of delay as medical examiners conducted specialized forensics 
tests in the sensitive case, the coroner's office ruled that John Bernard Wiley 
Jr.'s death was a homicide. The coroner identified neck compression as one of 
the restraint tactics causing the death. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying factors listed were a fatty liver, the effects of alcohol and 
multiple traumatic injuries, including a broken rib, a broken nose and a head 
laceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley's death is one of three recent incidents involving either acknowledged 
or alleged use of force against inmates in the hospital jail ward that are 
under review by federal or local authorities. So far, no deputies have been 
disciplined or formally accused of wrongdoing in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wiley case, which remains under investigation by the FBI and the district 
attorney's office, made headlines after county nurses who work in the jail ward 
wrote the County Board of Supervisors asking for a formal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two nurses who said they witnessed the March 4 incident -- Johnnie Blue and 
William Strachan -- said deputies used unnecessary force and contributed to 
Wiley's death. They contended that Wiley was taunted by deputies and shoved off 
a gurney, landing head-first on the floor. They also said Wiley was restrained 
with a chokehold and covered at the face with a prison smock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department says only that Wiley became combative after his 
handcuffs were removed in the jail ward and that he stopped breathing as 
deputies and a Los Angeles police officer tried to restrain him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Sgt. Larry Lincoln, a department spokesman, said the results of 
the autopsy and the department's own three-month investigation have been 
forwarded to the district attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Ferrer, an attorney for Wiley's relatives, said the findings "indicate 
everything we thought about how he died. These deputies should be prosecuted to 
the full extent of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrer said family members will file a wrongful death claim and assert that 
jail ward inmates often are abused. "This finding confirms, in our opinion, a 
pattern of excessive force."  
</P>
<P>
 Department officials disputed that. Noting that the recent cases are all still 
under review, Lt. Taylor Moorehead said: "If they all are legitimate cases, it 
would be terrible to make an assumption (about a pattern of misconduct). If 
there is some guilt there, we'll deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department on suspicion of 
assault on a police officer during a domestic dispute. Wiley injured his head 
falling down a flight of stairs during the arrest, officials said, and was 
taken to the hospital jail ward.  
</P>
<P>
 Once there, Wiley became violent, according to the Sheriff's Department. As 
deputies, who provide security at the jail ward, and the city officer struggled 
with Wiley, he stopped breathing and was pronounced dead a short time later, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two nurses, Blue and Strachan, said Thursday that they were pleased with 
the autopsy findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very glad we brought it forward. I think what they are saying does 
support what we were saying," Strachan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue added: "I feel relieved that is wasn't covered up." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office, cautioned that Wiley's 
case was complex, involving struggles at different times and places with both 
Los Angeles police officers and sheriff's deputies. He said it is unclear how 
the various injuries occurred or whether the neck compression injuries were the 
result of a chokehold by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man had very severe blockage of the vessels of his heart" and had a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.2%, more than twice the legal limit for drivers, 
Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital workers said they were particularly sensitive to the Wiley incident 
because it came on the heels of another, similar death three months earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 In that case, which remains under review by the district attorney's office and 
the LAPD, a 43-year-old transient, Jose Martinez, became violent after arriving 
at the jail ward, according to official accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was arrested by Los Angeles police on suspicion of burglary and being 
under the influence of drugs. After he became combative, deputies struggled to 
restrain him and he stopped breathing, officials said. Martinez never regained 
consciousness and was pronounced dead a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's death was ruled accidental, caused by lack of oxygen to the brain 
and heart failure. Different deputies were involved in the Wiley and Martinez 
incidents, Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating a case involving an 18-year-old mentally 
ill man who relatives say was beaten last September in the jail ward. Laurence 
Jones, who was arrested on charges of assaulting a Baldwin Park officer, says 
he was beaten a few days after arriving in the hospital jail ward, according to 
his mother, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the deputies her son says was involved is Gary Gerlach, Barbara Jones 
said. Nurses Blue and Strachan said Gerlach was one of the deputies involved in 
the struggle with Wiley the night he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials declined to comment, but have confirmed that Gerlach was 
on duty the night of Wiley's death. Gerlach, who has previously declined to be 
interviewed, could not be reached.

FEELINGS AND IMAGES; 'EXPRESSIONS OF THE HEART' PRESENTS THE EMOTIONALLY 
INSPIRED WORKS OF FOUR WOMEN AT THE NEW CANYON GALLERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 One can appreciate art without any explanation of its source or significance, 
but artists almost always have at least one story behind their work that could 
enhance a viewer's enjoyment and understanding of it. 
</P>
<P>
 This notion is especially true of the four women who have brought their art 
together in the exhibit "Expressions of the Heart" at New Canyon Gallery in 
Topanga. Their inspirations and their stories are for the most part different. 
Yet the 60 works collectively reflect their shared belief that art is an 
expression of strong feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Walker is "trying to get into very deep levels of the mind" with her 
watercolors, she said, "to express emotions that might not be so pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 Among her works are three abstract self-portraits, one of a figure that 
conveys painful sensations as it seems to be opening up, screaming, splitting 
in two. The non-representational "Barriers" keeps one out with its dark tones 
and weightiness. The less dense "Horizon" suggests a lighter, more hopeful 
sense of being. Her "Love Figures" are pulled toward one another with a 
magnetic energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's watercolors are "visual expressions of very sensitive states of being 
that arise from autism," she said. "I think a lot of autism has to do with 
hyper-sensitivity, hyper-awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am to accept my full range of emotions, you cut yourself open to undo 
the blocks. To get through the inertia, you have to cut through to the bone. 
With the release of feeling, you move to a peaceful place with great depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Barr's "Shrine to Guadalupe" holds her handmade jewelry, including 
crosses and bleeding hearts made of sterling silver, brass and copper with 
beveled stones. A few pieces sport pictures of Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and 
Diego Rivera; many others present images of that country's patron saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr sees the cross and the heart symbols not specifically as religious 
expressions, but as symbols of the Mexican people and culture -- to which she 
feels a strong tie -- and the Mexican people's faith in themselves despite 
poverty and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take sanctuary in this object, and it helps them," she said. "I like 
that a lot of (the saints) are women and that they are powerful, that they are 
caretakers. What they invest in her is what makes it so fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The symbols I use have a lot of power on their own. Nobody looks at a cross 
and doesn't have a feeling about something." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more playful note, some of the pieces present lyrics from popular songs 
of the past, such as "Stop in the name of love," "Help me, I think I'm falling 
in love again" and "When you wish upon a star." 
</P>
<P>
 Barr sees her artistic work and that of her show colleagues "as expressions of 
faith and hope that things can be better for a few more people, animals and 
other living things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Barr and Linda Bolhuis started painting with dyes on white silk 
to make scarves. Bolhuis has continued to paint on silk, but besides making 
scarves, she also frames and hangs her images. Often, these paintings reflect 
her concern for endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Two images here illustrate Topanga's beauty, but most of the others were 
inspired by a trip to Costa Rica in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel-like colors and luminous quality of dyes on silk contribute an 
unusually rich texture to the scarlet macaws and the lavender and yellow 
flowers of the painting, "Laundry Day in Escazu." They help convey an 
otherworldliness to the bulls of "The Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolhuis' bird, fish and iguana paintings are complemented by Jenny Stokes' 
animal images on her pottery, which is "never symmetrical," she said. "I leave 
a lot of the bumps and joins to add more life, and to ensure the unique quality 
of each pot." 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) and of British background, she 
studied painting there. After coming to the United States, she became 
fascinated with American Indian pottery techniques, which she uses in her work 
today. Only recently has she begun to apply the painting skills she learned in 
Sri Lanka to her pots. 
</P>
<P>
 Her earthy, variously shaped jars and bottles in the gallery, featuring 
exotic, colorful animal images, are "a remembrance of growing up in the East," 
she said. Where and When What: "Expressions of the Heart." 
</P>

A MATURE COMEDY; MOST OF THE QUIRKY MIDWESTERN CHARACTERS IN THE REVIVAL OF 
'MORNING'S AT SEVEN' ARE SENIOR CITIZENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "It's not really daunting," Roy Hammond said of directing actors twice his 
age. "But it is im pressive -- what they bring to their characters, and how 
quickly they bring it. Also, they bring their whole lives, which is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, 33, is definitely the junior figure these days at the Apex Playhouse, 
where a revival of Paul Osborn's gentle period comedy "Morning's at Seven" 
opens tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are nine characters," said the Baltimore-born director, "and seven of 
them are in their 60s. The other two are 40 and 36." 
</P>
<P>
 The story, set in the Midwest circa 1938, takes place over 24 hours in the 
neighboring back yards of three sisters: Cora, Arry and Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arry has lived with Cora and (her brother-in-law) Theodore since her parents 
died," Hammond said. "Living in the house next door are Carl and Ida and their 
40-year-old son Homer. Homer has been dating a girl for 12 years and, on the 
day the play takes place, he's finally bringing Myrtle home to meet them." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth sister, Esther, lives down the street with her college professor 
husband David. "He never liked anyone in her family," said the director, "so 
she has to sneak around to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, things get rather sticky when David catches Esther visiting her 
sisters, and announces that he's banishing her to a single floor in their home 
-- never to have contact with him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also revealed that Arry has secretly been in love with Theodore for many 
years, which has Cora understandably itching for her sister to move out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very simple play," Hammond said. "It's no 'Terminator' with action or 
a major plot. But it is very funny. They're all quirky characters -- and Myrtle 
is the catalyst." 
</P>
<P>
 The play, which has had major local revivals in past years at the Ahmanson 
Theatre (1981), South Coast Repertory (1993) and the Old Globe (1993), all but 
disappeared when it premiered on Broadway in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opened the same year as (Howard Lindsay's) 'Life With Father' and (Moss 
Hart's) 'The Man Who Came to Dinner,' Hammond said. "They were both very broad 
comedies. Apparently, the producers of this play thought that to compete, it 
had to be very broad as well -- which was a big mistake. It was a flop." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor-director says that when he first read the script, "I saw a lot of 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto Apex co-founder Ron Kidd, who's producing the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the year since we started doing shows here," Kidd said, "we've had a 
preponderance of (material for) young people -- occasionally the role for a 
more mature person, but nothing to sink their teeth into. I knew these older 
actors and felt they needed an opportunity to perform. Also, we get a lot of 
senior citizens in our audiences. So we thought this show was really something 
they could relate to." Where and When What: "Morning's at Seven."

THEATER REVIEW; A KISS BEFORE DYING; 'BURKIE' TELLS THE STORY OF A TERMINALLY 
ILL FATHER AND A FAMILY IN NEED OF HEALING. HUMOR PROVIDES STRONG MEDICINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Burkie" was the affectionate nickname Janie Burke used when speaking to her 
husband, Ed. But now Janie is gone, after a long, painful, harrowing battle 
against cancer. Now it's Ed's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 South Philly plumber Ed doesn't make Janie's choices in dealing with his own 
terminal cancer. He'd watched her suffer needlessly through treatment after 
useless treatment. Ed wants to do it with dignity, without causing pain for 
himself or his two grown children. The right to that choice is at the center of 
Bruce Graham's simple, powerful drama at Interact Theatre, and the 
consideration of the subject is more vital today than when it premiered a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a lesson to be learned in Graham's treatment of the deep 
affection between blustering Ed and his faltering son Jon. But don't get the 
wrong idea. There is plenty of humor in this family, and that's a third lesson. 
Although Ed hasn't long to go, he and Jon have learned that having a sense of 
humor is a great healer, not of cancer but of fear and wasted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Kevin Kelley sees these three layers in the play, naturally and 
carefully weaves them in and out of each other and allows each its moment in 
the patterns of the strong dramatic fabric of the play. He balances naturalism 
and strong theatricality with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Jones, who created the role of Burkie in the original Philadelphia 
production and played it in New York, repeats the characterization here. From 
Ed's bluster to his mental and emotional distraction, from his capricious sense 
of fun to his craftsman's affirmation of a thing correctly done, Jones hits 
each note impeccably. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed's love for his son belies the stereotypical blue-collar parental attitude. 
His daughter Jess was the athlete, and Ed has the trophies to prove it. But 
Jon, who has always wanted to play the piano, has Ed's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 They understand each other, and they've honed their ping-pong punch lines 
about Ed's illness into a fine art. As Ed and Jon parry and thrust, Jones and 
Steven Culp as Jon effortlessly develop an aura of heartbreaking honesty in the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Culp has the most intricate and difficult role in the piece, and the detail 
and delicacy of his myriad shifts of emphasis give the production its solid 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 When he breaks down under his sister's unthinking attitude toward Ed's fate, 
when in Ed's imagination he becomes for a moment the soothing, gentle Janie, 
Culp is riveting. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a villain in the piece. Ed's daughter, in from Phoenix, newly 
pregnant, about to open a second trendy ski shop with her husband, is riddled 
with guilt and intent on taking Ed back with her to a Phoenix clinic where they 
can provide all the newest treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 She is self-involved, short-tempered and blinded to the reality of Ed's 
wishes. Denise Bessette does the improbable in making Jess likable enough to 
warrant the affection both Ed and Jon shower on her. Bringing a good feel of 
South Philly into this microcosmic world, Buck Kartalian is totally charming as 
Ed's retired friend who can't help nudging around the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Zentis' setting looks very South Philly, especially in Cheryl 
Waters' warm, subtle lighting, and an insightful sound design by John 
Rubinstein skillfully balances the jagged classic jazz Ed loved, which lingers 
in Jon's memory, with the impressive tape of Jon's last appearance in a piano 
competition. Where and When What: "Burkie."

ONE FROM THE HEART; SINGERS DON AND ALICIA CUNNINGHAM LOVE JAZZ SO MUCH, 
THEY'VE BEEN FIRED FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their voices flying at breakneck speed over a classic such as Dizzy 
Gillespie's "Shaw Nuff" or Horace Silver's "Quicksilver," Don and Alicia 
Cunningham are two of the most exciting, sophisticated singers in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz is our heart, and we love it," says Alicia Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple, who have been working together since 1969 and who were married 
in 1979, don't always sing jazz. These days, the Cunninghams appear regularly 
in hotels -- traveling to Brazil, Japan and, most recently, Arizona, where the 
lounges in hostelries there demand a varied repertoire, with some jazz 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that mass audiences will accept jazz as long as the tunes are 
familiar," says Don Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 From the '70s through the mid-'80s, their outlets were even more commercially 
oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Alicia Cunningham, "I'd do Streisand medleys, such as tunes from 'Funny 
Girl.' "Still, we'd do jazz, too much jazz, and get fired for it," she says 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cunninghams won't have to worry about overdoing their jazz side when they 
make a rare local appearance tonight and Saturday at Chadney's in Burbank. 
There, the pair will come in as a trio, with Alicia playing piano, Don working 
out on congas and alto saxophone, and Leslie Baker on bass. Their jazz-based 
program should have something for everyone, says Dennis Duke, who books 
Chadney's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One way the singers will get a crowd is with their high-wire-type scat singing 
-- singing syllables in jazz phrases as if the vocalist is a horn. It's an art 
the Cunninghams never practice, so they'll be fresh and inventive when they do. 
Alicia says sometimes she makes mistakes, but so what? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to grow and learn, and if it means falling on my face, I'll do it," 
she says. Though the Cunninghams enjoy working sometimes with a full rhythm 
section, so they can simply stand in front and sing, they find plenty of appeal 
in a more economical context. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more intimate," says Alicia. "We'll do things we don't ordinarily do, 
like more romantic tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a trio also allows the pair to demonstrate their musicality, Don 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to participate more as a pianist, even though I'm not a soloist," says 
Alicia. 
</P>
<P>
 Don will offer some solid alto saxophone solos, as when he's featured on 
"Harlem Nocturne." "My alto playing is soulful, and it's me," he says. "I play 
within my ability, and don't go any further. I respect the instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 A jazz singing duo was probably not what either of the Cunninghams planned as 
a lifelong career. Don, a native of St. Louis who has lived in Los Angeles 
since 1965, started out as a conga drummer, and Alicia, who was born and raised 
in Los Angeles, was a classical pianist and singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started singing in St. Louis because I loved Nat King Cole," says Don, who 
went on to land a job playing congas with singer Johnny Mathis from 1958 to 
1960, and then led a Latin jazz band playing vibes, both in St. Louis and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a scholarship to go to Mount St. Mary's, studying voice," says Alicia. 
"But I always loved Ella and Sarah," referring to singing stars Fitzgerald and 
Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, who have made three albums for Discovery Records, consider 
themselves their strongest proponents as well as critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep each other honest, and as long as we do, we're on the right 
track," Alicia says. "But the minute we become too predictable, too packaged, 
then we better move on to something different. That's when it becomes stale." 
Where and When What: Don and Alicia Cunningham appear at Chadney's, 3000 W. 
Olive St., Burbank.

LYRICS THAT LAUGH; DALE GONYEA TELLS STORIES WITH HIS COMIC SONGS. 'I'M A 
LITTLE HIPPER THAN BROADWAY,' HE ADDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

The Times.

<P>
 "It's been a wild year," says singing humorist Dale Gonyea. "I've sung for 
Placido Domingo, sung at a party for George Burns, gone down the Amazon River 
and performed in Bora Bora and Chile." 
</P>
<P>
 He also made his debut, in April, at the cabaret-coffee house Tonto & Dietz in 
Studio City. He returns there tonight and Saturday, with more shows scheduled 
each Thursday night, June 16 through July 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue suits Gonyea, whose act combines his witty songs about topical 
subjects, a parody or two, droll comments to the audience about events in his 
life and the world, and the kind of masterful piano playing that only years of 
classical study can produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about a place like Tonto & Dietz is that I'm in an urban 
center, so I can be a little more sophisticated and timely," says the 
forty-something Gonyea, who declines to give his age. ("Just say I remember 'My 
Mother the Car' very well.") "I can comment and write about current events. 
It's nice to have an outlet where you can get up and do that -- otherwise you 
get constipated, rashes and things." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his numbers, "I'd Rather Write a Song," for example, is constantly 
updated, with one lyric now, "I'd rather write a song than club a skater in the 
knee." Another, the whimsical lament "Baby, Why'd You Have to Tell Oprah?" 
lampoons the talk-show craze. 
</P>
<P>
 His current repertoire -- he figures he has written about 500 songs, including 
the Grammy-nominated "I Need Your Help, Barry Manilow" -- also includes such 
ditties as "Tick-Tock," warning men to be aware of a woman's biological clock; 
"Namedroppings," the classical music version that includes queries such as 
"Where does Simon Rattle? With whom did Kathleen Battle?" and an opera spoof, 
"The Red Gloves" (or "Il Rosso Isotoners"), in which he sings all the roles.  
</P>
<P>
 Not all of Gonyea's material is comical, though: There's the poignant tribute 
to his father, "My Dad Could Beat Up Your Dad, But He Wouldn't," and the 
downright serious "Don't Pull the Shade (You'll Block Out the Moonlight)," 
about lovers' farewells and new beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of myself as a storyteller," says Gonyea, who began playing piano at 
5 in his native Monroe, Mich., developed an early love for musicals when he saw 
the film "West Side Story," and gained both a music degree and a love of opera 
at the University of Michigan. "I tell stories with songs. I'm a little hipper 
than Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 At Tonto & Dietz, Gonyea is not the only one telling those stories. As in 
April, he will be joined by other singers. Co-owner Susan Dietz "had sent out 
flyers saying, 'Dale Gonyea and Friends,' " he recalls of the departure from 
his usual one-man show. "I have a network of talented friends in this area, and 
a lot had done my songs." 
</P>
<P>
 This time around he will perform with a changing roster of entertainers, 
including Debra Lane and Laurie McIntosh; the previous shows featured Maggie 
Roswell, who provides voices for "The Simpsons," musical theater actor Michael 
Hawkins and theater publicist/singer Rick Miramontez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gonyea has also written material performed by the likes of Bette Midler, 
Andrea Marcovicci, Ray Stevens and Rosie O'Donnell, and has worked for Disney, 
most recently providing lyrics for the Genie's song about his travels, "Nothing 
in the World (Quite Like a Friend)" in "The Return of Jafar," the video sequel 
to "Aladdin." That number reflects Gonyea's own sojourns, performing a show 
more homespun than hip on three cruises a year. Past appearances include 
opening for Andy Williams, Glen Campbell and Dorothy Hamill's ice show and 
playing Town Hall in New York and Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz, who has produced his shows at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills and 
the Pasadena Playhouse, has suggested that Gonyea establish a regular residence 
at Tonto & Dietz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we can do a concept like, 'That Was the Week That Was With Dale 
Gonyea,' " Dietz says. "I adore him. I'm pretty jaded, and I can sit and listen 
to him for hours. I think people love him because he's so innately funny and 
smart and at the same time, there's no pomposity. He's like a regular guy who 
happens to play piano great. And everybody loves to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody, including Gonyea."I don't feel like a tortured soul," he says. "I 
know so many people who are creative who can't enjoy their lives because 
they're always in a state of trying to create something. We're not curing 
anything. If it's not fun, what's the point?" Where and When Who: Dale Gonyea. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Tonto & Dietz, 12747 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 tonight and Saturday and every Thursday, beginning June 16 through 
July 28. Also, a 4 p.m. performance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $15 cover.

BURNING RUBBER BY REMOTE CONTROL; RADIO CARS ARE ENJOYING A RESURGENCE, AMONG 
NOVICES AND EXPERTS ALIKE. THE HIGH-TECH HOBBY HAS A STRONG FOLLOWING IN THE 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What goes around comes around in the radio-controlled race-car business -- 
like the miniature vehicles themselves. Which is why rubber is burn ing once 
again in neighborhood parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 In Woodland Hills, just a trophy dash from the curb at Victory Boulevard, 
members of the Tarzana-based Competition Oval Racing Club spend two weekends 
each month racing on asphalt just outside Victory Speedway, a hobby shop for 
radio-controlled racers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We blow off the pavement, lay down some sugar water to make it sticky and 
people who buy a car have someplace to drive it against other cars," owner 
Robert Sarnelle said. "We used to have it in the back part of the parking lot, 
but we moved it out front to make it more visible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parking-lot racing" -- inexpensive, entry-level competition for operators of 
1/10th scale, battery-powered "RCs" -- has become hotter than a Ferrari at a 
swap meet in the past two years. The practice is not new, just rediscovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon their debut in the early 1970s, radio-controlled vehicles sped to 
popularity as organizers held races on seemingly every spare speck of pavement. 
However, with the advent of national and even world competition, the hobby has 
grown more expensive and racing venues more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, participation was down about 40% nationally from the previous year, 
according to the National Organization for Racing Radio Controlled Autos, or 
NORRCA, a 15,000-member sanctioning organization based in Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RC retailers, organizers and operators hope taking their show back to the 
streets will pump interest into a hobby that all agree could use a swift kick 
in the tailpipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely has been down, but we think it's starting to go back up," said 
Gene Husting, co-owner of Associated Electric in Costa Mesa, a major 
manufacturer of radio-controlled vehicles. "If a hobby shop wants to sell a lot 
of RCs, the best way is to have a lot of RC events. And some of these hobby 
shops have learned that (business) starts to grow pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking-lot programs have popped up throughout Southern California, including 
in Orange, Santa Ana and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Race Prep Raceway in Chatsworth got with the program, offering 
parking-lot races two weekends a month. The shop has offered an indoor dirt 
track since opening two years ago. But doing it on the asphalt has become, 
well, the thing to do, owner Steve Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People started asking about it," Dunn said. "It's a little bit easier for 
newcomers than dirt racing and it doesn't take a lot of money to open up a 
parking-lot track. Plus, the traffic that drives by. . . . People see it, they 
stop and they're amazed. We see them as potential customers." 
</P>
<P>
 At both Victory Speedway and Race Prep Raceway, participants pay $10 for a 
full day of competition. Between racing, operators tune their cars and schmooze 
with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice part about this is that it's local," said Ted McDonald of Canoga 
Park, who began racing five years ago. "I used to make two-hour drives to go to 
races on Sundays. . . . Yorba Linda, San Diego, Bakersfield. I'd leave at 5 
o'clock in the morning and come home at 8 at night." 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift tracks can be reconfigured weekly to form oval or road courses. 
Plywood and fire hoses serve as perimeter walls, and fruit punch is applied to 
the pavement to provide traction. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators navigate from atop a wooden grandstand. Laps are tallied by a 
computer with the aid of a coin-sized transmitter in the nose of each car that 
sends a signal to the computer when crossing the start-finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars are state-of-the art in technology and design. Chassis, axles and 
wheels are made of carbon fiber -- lightweight, yet sturdy material similar to 
that used in aircraft. Steering and suspension pieces are crafted from 
titanium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general public is not aware of what is involved in radio-controlled 
racing," said Frank Killam of Burbank, a 22-year RC veteran who works as a 
design sculptor for General Motors at the company's Advanced Concept Center in 
Newbury Park. "The sophistication of the radio-controlled car industry is just 
short of the aerospace industry. When I started racing, these cars, basically, 
were a toy that you raced around in your driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 As the industry boomed, serious competitors began spending hundreds of dollars 
modifying their cars in search of greater speeds and higher levels of 
competition. Manufacturing accessories became a business itself. Some cars 
today are worth as much as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional and national competition attracts hundreds of operators, and races 
take place at tracks built specifically for radio-controlled vehicles, or on 
high-banked ovals designed for bicycle racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills, a 333-meter track regarded 
as the Daytona International Speedway of RC events, serves each September as 
the site of a weeklong competition that attracts more than 350 of the world's 
top competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the number of tracks across the country has begun to dwindle. The 
Encino Velodrome near Balboa Park stopped staging RC events in 1991. Other RC 
tracks in Encino, Northridge, Pomona and Santa Anita have closed during the 
past two years. Last year, four more tracks in California closed, including 
those in Bakersfield and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost of competition became too much for some people," said Dan Moynihan 
of Chatsworth, an RC manufacturer and race promoter. "Tires, bodies, chassis, 
components. . . . Obviously, if you're racing against somebody's machine that 
is technologically more advanced over what you have, you either have to step up 
or leave. (Some people) got frustrated and left." 
</P>
<P>
 A return to the hobby's roots is geared toward attracting newcomers by keeping 
costs down and competition levels reasonably high. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, NORRCA began publishing guidelines for entry-level competition 
suitable for parking lots. Separate classes are established for novices and 
experts, and modification of cars is all but prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The parking lot stuff has helped pick things up," NORRCA PresidenR. Sitman 
said. "It's not a high-money thing. It's geared more toward Mom and Pop and the 
kids coming out to spend a few dollars in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced technology has helped matters, too. Last year, Japanese companies 
Kyosho and Tamiya began marketing affordable "complete-car kits," race-ready 
vehicles designed to give entry-level racers high-quality performance at a 
minimal expense. The cars sell for between $150 and $300, including the 
controller, battery charger and batteries. Sarnelle and other owners say the 
cars are big sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot less expensive to get into the sport than it used to be," Dunn of 
Race Prep said. "When I first got into it in 1980, a car was about the same 
price, but you had to modify it with another couple of hundred dollars worth of 
stuff to make it work well." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, serious competitors still spend thousands. Killam estimates he has 
pumped more than $100,000 into the hobby over the past two decades. McDonald, 
who has earned an expert ranking, fields several cars in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the Richard Pettys of the RC world are finding the time for a stroll 
through the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't like at a major track where most guys there are so busy trying to 
win they don't have time to talk," McDonald said. "Here, there's no pressure. 
Sometimes, I actually laugh while I'm driving." Where and When What:

PICTURE PERFECT MEMORIES; * PHOTOBUSTERS, A TWO-WOMAN CRUSADE, TURNS HAPHAZARD 
PILES OF KEEPSAKE PHOTOGRAPHS INTO ORDERLY ALBUMS, ORGANIZED BY TIME OR BY 
THEME.

<P>
 You've got a lifetime of photographs, stacks and stacks of prints that add up 
to a hill of a mess. Chances are, they rarely see the light of day -- tucked 
away beneath the clutter of dresser drawers, cardboard boxes, shopping bags, 
storage trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring order out of chaos, whom should you call? 
</P>
<P>
 Photobusters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a budding partnership, barely 2 years old, formed by Pat Sciortino and 
Pam Motown on the rebound from previous careers and broken marriages, dedicated 
to their long-held belief that most families are created equal when it comes to 
keeping their keepsake photos in the dark and in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 They pledge to unscramble the mess, then organize (usually chronologically, 
but often thematically) and showcase your hundreds or even thousands of prints 
in ways that rekindle flames romanced, babies born, trips traveled, birthday 
candles blown. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in gloves and white jackets, Sciortino and Motown work together in what 
they call a "dust-free," spacious room with virtually bare walls (except for 
two tiny photos, framed with a client's note) inside Sciortino's 1886 Victorian 
house in Van Nuys -- transplanted, she says, from its original Downtown Los 
Angeles location, where the Westin Bonaventure hotel now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a luxury service and not for everyone, they concede. After an 
initial free consultation, hourly charges of $25 -- plus reimbursements for 
materials such as photo sleeves and albums -- can add up to fees of $1,000 or 
more. They say they've averaged between two and four clients a month, asking 
each to give them two to four weeks to complete their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-time service -- once we return, it's done," Sciortino says, adding 
that a major task is gaining a client's trust. "When we leave with their boxes 
and bags of photos, the looks on their faces tell us, 'There goes my whole 
life!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Photo therapy" is how Sciortino describes their work -- not just for clients 
but for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems none of us has gotten to enjoy the complete picture of our lives -- 
and sometimes that means thousands of photos," she says. "We're really all one 
family of man. We all have the same kinds of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pam and I, of course, must be discreet. We see entire lifetimes pass before 
us. We see that eccentric uncle -- he's always with a different woman. We see 
the new hairdos, the new house. And pretty soon we're both so wound up in these 
people's lives that I want to cry out, 'God! How's Uncle Harry?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, Sciortino and Motown are asked to sort out photos that outlive 
family breakups, deaths and remarriages. "The kids are all there, but suddenly 
the husband or the wife is gone; or we start seeing stepchildren," Motown says 
-- as well as prints dating back to the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Kaplan, a Walt Disney Co. screenwriter-producer in his 40s, says 
Photobusters has neatly arranged thousands of his prints, creating and updating 
albums for each of his small children, while carefully packaging 1880-vintage 
family photos brought to this country years ago from the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can be a complete slob," Kaplan says, "but they've made me look like the 
best-organized and most artistically talented guy around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Toni Erlich of Tarzana, Photobusters filled nine albums of photos 
accumulated during nearly two decades of marriage, placing between 2,000 and 
3,000 photographs in clear plastic sleeves -- an accomplishment she says 
pleased her husband, Rueben, and their children, Dara, 15, and Ross, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to tell them much," Erlich says of Sciortino and Motown. "For 
the most part, they have an uncanny ability to match who was supposed to be 
with whom. I mean, they came back and told me about my own family!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rita McGregor, a Beverly Hills homemaker, says she had a difficult time 
explaining whenever her husband, Charles, kept asking, "Who is this Pat that 
keeps calling?" 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor had surreptitiously enlisted Photobusters' help to spring a surprise 
anniversary gift -- nine albums of photos -- on Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was absolutely thrilled," she says. "After 37 years of marriage, shirts 
and ties as gifts start to wear off." 
</P>
<P>
 As partners, the Photobusters complement each other, having met four years ago 
as single parents when their children attended the same preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Sciortino, 42, Florida-bred and an erstwhile New York stage actress and 
Hollywood studio publicist, is theatrical and animated; Motown, 50, her British 
accent intact and careers as a punk-clothes designer/retailer and nightclub 
operator behind her, is taciturn and droll, bringing an artistic, literary 
flair to the pages of clients' albums. 
</P>
<P>
 What Sciortino and Motown offer most, says one client, is a "sensitivity to 
family dynamics." 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't inexpensive," Richard Rubin, a Santa Monica advertising copywriter, 
says, "but if you can afford it, it's almost like having an heirloom. Now, my 
kids look at our photos and enjoy them. It's probably my most precious 
possession in terms of their irreplaceability."

ST. JOSEPH ADDS MISSION TO AID ITS OWN HEALTH; HOSPITALS: OWNER OF FACILITIES 
IN ORANGE AND FULLERTON BUYS SOUTH COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER AS NEXT STEP IN 
REGIONAL EXPANSION.

 In the continuing consolidation of the health-care industry, St. Joseph Health 
System in Orange said Thursday that it has bought Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph Health System, which already owns St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and 
St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, said it will keep the Mission Viejo 
facility's 1,300 employees in the deal, terms of which were not disclosed. The 
fate of senior executives at Mission Hospital was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be in a position to develop regionally integrated health care 
delivery in Orange County," said Tom Porath, vice president of corporate 
services for St. Joseph Health System. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Hospital is the designated trauma center for South County and one of 
only three such centers countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 In an increasingly competitive health-care environment where hospitals in many 
cases are receiving lower reimbursements for patient care, such a deal is a 
survival tactic, said Trish Anderson, director of Medical Pathways Management 
Corp. in Torrance. Her company puts together such agreements for hospitals and 
physician groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of individual hospitals looking for a partner or two or 
three," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such agreements, for example, allow a group of hospitals to buy expensive 
equipment that they can share, Anderson said, so that patients at all 
affiliated hospitals have access to the treatment it provides. Hospitals can 
also save money by consolidating their billing, payroll, accounting and managed 
care contracting departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals are affiliating so that they will not have to duplicate services 
and duplicate their infrastructure," said Lori Aldrete, a spokeswoman for the 
California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph Health System is a nonprofit organization sponsored by the Roman 
Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange. It also owns a group of hospitals in 
Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Hospital, which will keep its name, is a 274-bed acute-care facility 
with an associated 53-bed pediatric center, Children's Hospital at Mission. It 
was sold by the privately held Mission Viejo Medical Development Co.

 The apartment vacancy rate for Orange County was 7.2% this spring, according 
to the semiannual survey of the Apartment Assn. of Orange County.That was up 
slightly from a rate of 6.8% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo had the highest vacancy rate, with 11.4% of the apartments in 
that city standing empty. Anaheim was second-highest, with a 10.6% vacancy 
rate. The lowest rates across the county were in Placentia, with 3.7%; Irvine, 
3.9%; and Rancho Santa Margarita, 4.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment association, a nonprofit group of rental property owners and 
managers, surveyed 82,500 units, or about 25% of the units in Orange County. 
The results were released this week. The association conducts surveys each 
spring and fall.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS; AIRPORT DIRECTOR, AIRLINES 
DISCUSS RENO AIR PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of several major airlines that serve John Wayne Airport met 
Thursday with the airport director, Jan Mittermeier, to voice their concerns 
about a proposal that would allow discount carrier Reno Air to begin service 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some airlines are staunchly opposed to the arrangement, the meeting 
went amicably, airport spokeswoman Courtney Weircioch said.Mittermeier offered 
to meet with the representatives so that they would fully understand the 
proposal that goes before the County Board of Supervisors next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air does not currently fly from John Wayne Airport but wants to start 
operating six daily flights to San Jose now being flown by American Airlines, 
with which it has a strategic relationship. American wants to give up the 
routes because of competitive pressure from low-cost Southwest Airlines, which 
began flying from Orange County last month.

 Leasing Tips: Randy Parker, head of the Newport Beach office of Travers Realty 
Brokerage, has 10 tips to help office tenants in lease renegotiations and 
relocations in a recovering Orange County real estate market.  
</P>
<P>
 "When this market starts to recover, and it is certainly doing so, when supply 
starts to dwindle, prices go up," Parker said."The good news is rents are going 
up, so landlords and pension funds are making money. But for tenants, rates are 
going up. Two years ago you could get anything you asked for, but today it's a 
different ballgame."  
</P>
<P>
 His tips are: 1. Prioritize your search. 2. Work with a broker. 3. Know the 
benefits of subleasing. 4. Don't be in a rush. 5. Don't hesitate either. 6. 
Know the basis for future escalation. 7. Know hidden building-space costs, such 
as restrooms or lobbies. 8. Know how to minimize building operating costs 
pass-throughs. 9. Little things mean a lot. 10. Be courageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Los Angeles, Travers is a real estate brokerage that represents 
tenants -- not landlords.

SMALLER TAX CHANGES COULD HAVE BIG IMPACT FOR SOME; CONGRESS: HEALTH AND 
WELFARE ARE IN THE SPOTLIGHT, BUT A HOST OF LESS SWEEPING PROPOSALS COULD HIT 
AMERICANS IN THE POCKETBOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA STERN, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The indictment of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski 
leaves a lot of tax questions hanging in mid-air. Future uncertainties about 
the biggest and most sweeping -- health care and welfare reform -- have been 
amply aired. 
</P>
<P>
 But a host of smaller pocketbook issues are hanging out there, too. Some 
desirable measures may fall to earth and disintegrate. Other less desirable 
measures may get enacted and come crashing through the well-hatched savings and 
investment plans built by many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are the type of person who spends part of every day looking upward for 
a falling sky, watch out in particular for these atmospherics: 
</P>
<P>
 * A fix of the "nanny tax." Both the Senate and the House have passed bills 
that would raise the threshold of household help's income below which employers 
would not have to pay Social Security taxes or withhold income taxes. Currently 
it stands at $50 a quarter -- an amount that pulls in even the occasional lawn 
mower or teen-age baby-sitter and virtually guarantees widespread 
noncompliance. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very popular measure, but the House loves it more than the Senate. 
Besides raising the threshold (under the Senate version, these taxes would have 
to be paid for domestic help earning more than $630 a year; the House version 
bumps it all the way up to $1,250 annually), the House has generally shown more 
willingness to approve revenue losers than the Senate. A weakened Ways and 
Means Committee could lose this provision altogether or easily throw that extra 
$620 a year overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loophole lost for the property owner. Congress perpetually looks at property 
owners as a source of tax income and tries to hone in on the more affluent for 
tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 One break that's helped property owners who rent out their homes (or secondary 
homes) for two weeks or less in a year is about to disappear. This provision 
allowed owners with rental income for 14 days or less to pocket the income 
without any tax or reporting consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 A "technical corrections and simplification" bill which has passed the House 
but not yet passed the Senate (though it's likely) would eliminate this break. 
Homeowners would have to declare the income but could offset taxes by declaring 
rental expenses up to the amount of that income. Look for this to become law 
regardless of Ways and Means politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Succor for the self-employed. Legions of home-office workers are watching 
Congress for two long shots that grow longer as the legislative session 
shortens. Numerous bills would broaden the home-office deduction to accommodate 
the painters, veterinarians, anesthesiologists and other pros who thought they 
had the deduction until the Supreme Court tightened it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But this revenue loser has yet to find a legislative tree upon which to hang, 
and Rostenkowski's departure makes any new tax provisions much less likely 
before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 A second bill, allowing self-employed workers to deduct 100% of their health 
insurance premiums, is wrapped up in health care reform and is unlikely to be 
granted until the big picture is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 * Distant threats. Scarier to many taxpayers (and the industries that sell to 
them) are a series of provisions that are always on the back burner but never 
turned completely off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has its hit list of revenue raisers; so does 
Congress and its Congressional Budget Office staff. Among the tax breaks always 
susceptible to cancellation: interest deductions for mortgages on second homes 
(seen as a rich person's break), tax deferral on annuities (seen as the 
insurance industry's way of offering back-door retirement plans under the guise 
of insurance policies), and any and all benefits that reduce federal estate 
taxes. That last category still is seen as one of the least painful (if of 
questionable logic) ways to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who save and invest should remember the golden rule: Don't pick your 
opportunities by their tax breaks. While taxes, like death, are certain, 
deductions are not.

YOUNG COUGAR ON THE PROWL HAS SAN CLEMENTE ON ALERT; WILDLIFE: MOUNTAIN LION 
HAS SHOWN NO AGGRESSION BUT OFFICIALS URGE CAUTION AFTER LATEST IN RASH OF 
SIGHTINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 A bold young mountain lion has been spotted roaming the canyons east of 
Interstate 5, prompting officials to send out dog teams to find the animal 
before it attacks a person or a pet. 
</P>
<P>
 At one local school, Our Lady of Fatima, 290 students are being made to eat 
lunch indoors to avoid encountering the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that one resident even reported seeing the mountain lion 
drinking from a front-yard birdbath, and another person saw it stroll through 
the parking lot of a restaurant on El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal is described as 2 to 3 years old and weighing about 70 pounds. 
Officials said that although it hasn't been aggressive, it appears to be 
unafraid of people, which is unusual for a cougar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best analogy is that this guy is in his 'terrible twos,' " said San 
Clemente Fire Chief Gene Begnell, who is also the city's animal control 
officer. "He's curious, but that doesn't mean he won't do something stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Begnell urges caution and awareness but said the mountain lion's presence is 
not cause for panic. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the latest in a growing number of wild cougar sightings in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 For several hours on Tuesday a thin, dazed and thirsty mountain lion wandered 
the streets of downtown Escondido in northern San Diego County before being 
sedated with a tranquilizer dart and carted off to a wild animal rehabilitation 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such animals are generally afraid of people, half a dozen confirmed 
mountain lion attacks on humans have occurred since the mid-'80s, said Patrick 
Moore, a California Department of Fish and Game spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, 5-year-old Laura Small was left partially paralyzed when a mountain 
lion grabbed her by the head with his powerful jaws as she hiked in Ronald W. 
Caspers Regional Park in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more opportunities for confrontations with mountain lions now," 
Moore said. "We're taking their habitat away from them, and they haven't been 
hunted in many years. They may be becoming more bold around people because of 
that loss of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Department of Fish and Game, in 1920 only about 200 mountain 
lions were left in California. But today, after they were classified as a 
"special protected mammal" in 1990, they number between 4,000 and 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Clemente sighting, officials have sent flyers to about 700 people 
who live near where the cougar has been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs were sent out on May 28 and June 4 to track the mountain lion. On both 
occasions -- the first behind the 20 block of Santa Clara and the second in the 
canyon between Avenida San Pablo and Avenida Salvador -- the dogs picked up a 
trail but could not find the cougar. 
</P>
<P>
 Our Lady of Fatima Catholic School and Ole Hanson Elementary School have also 
sent home warnings to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna McCluskey, principal of Our Lady of Fatima, said that the 290 students 
must now eat lunch indoors, instead of on the outdoor picnic tables. Parents 
monitoring playtimes are being extra vigilant for signs of the mountain lion, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said that they are used to warnings about coyotes and bobcats but 
that mountain lion sightings are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game wardens think the cougar may be making its way into the canyons 
above City Hall and south of Rancho San Clemente from the wilderness area of 
Camp Pendleton. Mountain lions can travel up to 15 miles a night, typically in 
staking out a territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Begnell said the cougar might be one of two mountain lion cubs born in the 
southern part of the city several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials suggest that people not hike alone and or leave pet food out 
overnight. If confronted by a mountain lion, they say, don't approach it or run 
away. Instead, raise your arms to make yourself appear larger and strike back 
if the mountain lion attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cougar is caught, authorities will determine whether it is a candidate 
for removal to a remote wilderness area or must be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the lion that was loose in downtown Escondido on Tuesday, after 
it was tranquilized and taken to an animal rehabilitation center, it was 
released in the Aqua Tibia wilderness area of the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the third mountain lion incident in San Diego County in the past 
month. Two mountain lions were killed in May by hunters in the Descanso portion 
of the Cleveland National Forest. One of the lions had menaced a young boy, and 
the other was spotted by a rancher who feared for his livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Tony Perry contributed to this report from San Diego. 
Dealing With Mountain Lions 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some steps you can take to keep mountain lions at bay: 
</P>
<P>
 AROUND HOME * Keep pets secure * Install outdoor lighting * Do not feed 
wildlife IN THE WILD * Do not hike alone * Do not run * If confronted, try to 
make yourself appear larger by raising your arms * If you are attacked, fight 
back with a stick, a hat or even bare hands * Notify authorities immediately 
MOUNTAIN LION PROFILE * Adults may be more than eight feet from head to tail * 
Full-grown females weigh 80 to 100 pounds; males weigh 120 to 160 pounds * 
Usually live to 12 years old in the wild * Fast runners over short distances, 
but lack lung capacity needed for long runs * Usually hunt alone at night * 
Prey on large animals, such as deer, but often eat skunks and opossums * 
California population has risen from 600 in 1920 to 4,000 to 6,000 today

BOY'S RETURN TO O.C. SCHOOL SPARKS PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Six-year-old Jimmy Peters returned to Circle View Elementary School on 
Thursday as the campus erupted in conflict over whether the special-education 
student, deemed violent and disruptive by school officials, should be allowed 
to share a kindergarten classroom with mainstream students. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after a federal judge ordered the school to readmit Jimmy, he and his 
father were greeted by three dozen sign-waving parents from both sides of the 
issue who had camped out for three hours waiting to protest and support the 
child's arrival after a 21-day absence. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six adults entered the classroom and removed their children when 
Jimmy and his father, Jim Peters, arrived on campus at 10:45 a.m. Other parents 
were keeping their children home as well, according to organizers of Thursday's 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle View Principal Dan Moss said 14 of the 31 children enrolled in the 
class did not attend school Thursday -- 12 because of Jimmy's presence. Another 
21 students in other grades were kept at home in protest as well, most of them 
siblings of children in Jimmy's class, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three police officers were stationed on the school grounds to keep order as 
television and print reporters hovered just beyond a fence near Jimmy, who 
turned his back and munched a bag of potato chips in the midst of the commotion 
just beyond the playground fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made him out to be a monster," said Debbie Hoops, a parent of a 
special-education student in another school district, who was on hand to 
support Jimmy. "This is hysteria. Mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmy's detractors were equally adamant. "If we didn't think our children 
were in danger, we wouldn't be doing this," said Pam Walker, who withdrew her 
child from Jimmy's class Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court judge on Wednesday rejected the request of Huntington 
Beach's Ocean View School District that Jimmy be indefinitely barred from the 
classroom, ruling that injuries he had allegedly caused other children and 
staff members were not serious enough to warrant his exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 After filing the first lawsuit of its kind in Orange County on May 25, the 
school district had ordered Jimmy temporarily removed from his class, alleging 
that he had kicked and bitten other students and his teacher, and that he was 
disruptive to the learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Thursday, Jimmy had been absent from school since May 19, when he was 
suspended for biting a teacher, his father said. Jimmy's teacher and an 
instructional aide have both taken medical leave as a result of the stress of 
trying to teach Jimmy, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have said they resorted to the lawsuit only after Jim Peters 
refused to voluntarily transfer his son to a special-education class. They have 
declined to reveal Jimmy's disability classification, but said he has some 
characteristics found in autistic children. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters, who acknowledges that his son is handicapped in communicating, 
disputes the allegations of violence and says his child is not autistic. He 
said the school district has been magnifying his son's behavior problems, and 
he has hired an attorney to fight its efforts to keep Jimmy out of a mainstream 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's case has attracted widespread attention in Orange County, 
especially among parents and advocates for special-education students, who are 
increasingly demanding that their children be allowed to remain in mainstream 
classrooms, a movement known as "full inclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters said the incident was typical of how the school district pits 
parents against parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It discourages me," he said. "This is a time for healing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not the kids, it's the parents," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Tracy Pellman said trustees have never discussed 
Jimmy's situation in detail, but she expressed sympathy for parents of his 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that not all students were considered in (U.S. District Judge Matthew 
Byrne's) decision," she said. "It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's demonstrations began hours before Jimmy arrived. By 7:30 a.m. a 
dozen parents were wielding signs saying "Safety Is the Issue" and "Honk for 
Support." They stopped other parents who were dropping children off at the 
school and asked them to join the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers grew quickly and it wasn't long before the entrance to the 
kindergarten area of the 630-student school was dominated by the sound of car 
horns and the sight of picketing parents speaking to camera crews and radio 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and his attorney, Joan Honeycut, said they planned that the child would 
attend only the last hour of class, in hope that protests would die down by the 
time he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want Jimmy to walk through this mess," Principal Moss agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters parked behind the school and brought Jimmy through the back 
entrance of the playground. Parents and reporters watched from just a few feet 
away as children greeted their classmate with waves and hellos. One child, 
6-year-old Trevor Donnelly, gave him a welcoming hug. 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents reacted angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very upset," Pam Walker said. "And we're here to bring attention to 
others who are unaware. We want them to know we are concerned about the rights 
of our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said she has witnessed outbursts of violence by Jimmy and is worried 
about her child's safety. "My child will not be in a classroom with Jimmy," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Croft, who removed her kindergartner and second-grader from the school, 
said parents have worked unsuccessfully within the system throughout the school 
year. She said they needed an outlet for their anger and disappointment with 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to be fair," she said. "I don't want to make this a personal 
issue, and I don't want to have a discussion with (Jim Peters) because I think 
I'll cry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to keep parents from pulling their children out of school, Moss offered 
parents a chance to view the classroom through a glass partition. But once 
Jimmy walked into the class, six parents filed in and emerged with their 
children, telling them this was their last day at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller number of parents welcomed Jimmy when he arrived. The half-dozen 
supporters, most of them parents from other schools who have children with 
special needs, said they had no plans to picket the school until they heard 
about planned protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other side is insane," Theodora Parnavelas said. "I had to come out. They 
are not concerned with the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of role models are these parents to their kids?" Debbie Hoops 
asked. "They're showing their kids what happens when you're different." 
</P>
<P>
 During his first day back, Jimmy spent 40 minutes in the classroom and then 
went for 20 minutes of speech therapy. Moss said he did not know how Jimmy 
spent the rest of the day, or how he adjusted to his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 A special aide hired by the district to help him throughout the morning was on 
duty Thursday, Moss said. Jim Peters spent the entire session with his son and 
said he plans to attend school with Jimmy every day until the school year ends 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy doesn't know what is going on," Peters said regarding the commotion. 
"We'll have that talk tonight, I'm sure. He's just glad to be back."

DISNEY WON'T DECIDE ON RESORT FOR A YEAR AT LEAST; DEVELOPMENT: LATEST DELAY ON 
MASSIVE ANAHEIM PROJECT FIRST AIMED FOR 1993 START REINFORCES FEARS OF ITS 
DEMISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it will be at least another year, 
perhaps longer, before it decides whether to commit to build a $3-billion theme 
park and resort next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although never promising to build it, Disney first proposed the resort in 1990 
and suggested construction could begin as early as 1993, if substantial public 
funding supported the project. Since then, government officials at all levels 
have scrambled to offer hundreds of millions of dollars in freeway and public 
works improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Though delays have been announced several times before, the latest renewed 
speculation that what could be one of Southern California's biggest 
construction projects -- promising 28,000 permanent jobs and millions in tax 
revenue -- is languishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen this year," said Doug Moreland, the director of 
development for the Disneyland Resort project. "We have to see how this all 
comes together." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed resort would include more than 5,000 hotel rooms, a large 
shopping district, an amphitheater and a new internationally themed amusement 
park, called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment industry analyst for the Seidler Cos. 
brokerage in Los Angeles, said the Disney project "just doesn't pencil out 
financially. . . . I think the park will get built when it's right for Disney. 
It's not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 State Trade Secretary Julie Meier Wright called word of the delay "a 
disappointment." Gov. Pete Wilson has taken a special interest in the project, 
pledging $50 million in public works to support the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement comes as Disney is grappling with the financial strains of 
Euro Disney, is waging its own civil war over plans for a historically themed 
Disney's America park in suburban Virginia and planning to build a fourth theme 
park at its Florida resort. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Disneyland Resort had stayed on schedule, the opening would have 
occurred as soon as 1998, according to the city and Disney's official joint 
plan for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "the timetable might be more in line with an opening in 2005," said Ned 
Snavely, general manager of the Anaheim Marriott hotel and a major supporter of 
the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Disney and city officials had said the project might get a 
go-ahead or rejection from Disney Chairman Michael Eisner as early as 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney officials Thursday said the entertainment giant will not decide 
until the funding for all of the public portion of the project -- up to $1 
billion in public works and other improvements -- is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has demanded massive public financing of about a third of the total 
cost of the project -- including two huge parking garages for more than 30,000 
cars -- as a condition of its participation. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as May 28, a House subcommittee had snatched back some of the $28 
million it had allocated for local transportation projects, including the 
Disney parking garage. The combined cost of the garages is about $450 million, 
all of it coming from state, federal, county and city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie -- chief executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
which is underwriting some of the public works costs -- said Thursday that he 
was sorry to hear of the delay and that the appropriations bill with the garage 
money is still moving ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the funding issues, a Disney decision is awaiting the completion of a 
nine-month environmental review of one of the parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Anaheim officials -- who have pinned much of the city's economic 
future on the development of the Disneyland Resort -- announced Thursday that 
they are moving ahead with their $200 million to $300 million in improvements 
to streets, sewers and other public infrastructure regardless of Disney's 
ultimate verdict on the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions more are being spent by the state to build off-ramps on the Santa Ana 
Freeway in anticipation that Disney will eventually go ahead with the project. 
Officials explained that with a local freeway-widening project underway, 
Caltrans simply can't wait any longer for Disney to make its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreland defended the public spending to support the project, saying that many 
of these improvements need to be made to the aging area anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start a process like this you never know how long it's going to 
take," Moreland said, but "we're still committed to trying to put a second 
(theme park) there." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth said Disney officials told him several 
weeks ago that they would be postponing a commitment because of the delay in 
congressional approval for the parking garage. Those funds will probably not be 
allocated until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that they hoped to get that money sooner, but we have to live with 
that," Ruth said. "This is a high-risk investment for them and they want to 
make sure they have everything in line beforehand. It would be nice if it could 
happen quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said city officials are unconcerned that Disney seems to be backing away 
from the project.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if the federal government sees that the city is moving forward they'll 
realize that we're not playing games here," Ruth said of the city's plans to go 
ahead with a major renewal of the 550 acres around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the project were exasperated at the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides need to come up with a decision. It's in the ridiculous stage 
now," said Ed Arnold, co-chair of a Disneyland Resort support group and a 
KTLA-TV sportscaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But analyst Logsdon said his talks with Disney officials have convinced him 
that the resort project can't throw off the 15% to 20% return on investment 
that Disney expects from a project. At most, he said the new resort could 
generate 10%, and it could be as low as 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 With attendance at Disneyland off about 10% this year, he said, Disney would 
rather wait.

20TH CENTURY INSURANCE OUT OF QUAKE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move certain to shake up the Southern California insurance market, 
earthquake-battered 20th Century Insurance Co. said Thursday that it will stop 
selling earthquake policies immediately and phase out all homeowner coverage 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The big insurer's exit increases fears that consumers -- especially in the Los 
Angeles Basin -- will have trouble finding earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, 34,894 homeowner policy holders who have insurance with 20th 
Century will have to look elsewhere. They represent 14.7% of the company's 
business statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also prompted renewed calls for a national catastrophe insurance 
program such as the Natural Disaster Protection Act now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based 20th Century said it will take no new customers in either 
homeowner or earthquake insurance, but will concentrate on the cut-rate auto 
policies that form the bulk of its business and have fueled its 30 years of 
fast growth and high profits. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's action, negotiated last month with Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, directly affects 240,000 homeowners and condominium policyholders, 
the majority of whom live in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our customers have already suffered the disrupting effects of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake," Neil H. Ashley, chief executive, said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize this is one more inconvenience, but it is the right thing to do," 
he added, citing about $600 million in quake claims that wiped out two-thirds 
of the insurer's surplus, or cushion against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Disruption aside, it will cost policyholders money. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi granted the company an immediate 17% increase on its homeowner 
rates, which will bring the average annual premium to $365 from $317, based on 
$117,000 of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 That is still cheap compared with the average of $441 in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. The average premiums for several Orange County cities are 
lower than the county average of $441, with an average annual premium of $361 
for Anaheim, $343 for Huntington Beach and $336 for Mission Viejo, according to 
state figures.  
</P>
<P>
 However, existing homeowner policyholders will be allowed only two more annual 
renewals before they are forced to shop elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer's 90,000 earthquake policyholders must find another carrier by 
their next renewal date. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said in a statement that he did not expect consumers to have trouble 
finding replacement coverage, but others have predicted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he says the market will absorb 20th Century (customers) no problem, I say, 
well, who?" said Stephen L. Young of the Independent Insurance Agents and 
Brokers of California, a trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, insurers have moved to curtail the growth of 
new earthquake and homeowner coverage in Southern California, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will be especially difficult for customers with quake-damaged homes 
to find new coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the state's largest carrier with 20% of the market, recently began 
a "managed growth" program for its California homeowners line, limiting the 
amount of new business it accepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking steps to limit our exposure," spokesman John Millen of No. 3 
Farmers Insurance Group said Thursday. "It's the prudent thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers recently raised the deductible on its quake policies to 15% from 10% 
and is "seriously reviewing the need for increased rates," Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millen said the real answer would be enactment of the Natural Disaster 
Protection Act, whose passage this year is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation would create a national pool for disaster coverage 
with a disaster insurance component built into all homeowners' policies. The 
premiums would be adjusted for regional risk of quakes, hurricanes, wildfires 
or other catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of 20th Century -- the eighth-largest homeowner insurer 
statewide and believed to be the fourth largest in Southern California -- also 
may put upward pressure on homeowners' insurance rates over the long term, 
since 20th Century has been the low-price leader for the 12 years since 
starting that line of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, Garamendi noted that no other carriers have sought rate 
increases in homeowner insurance since January. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's withdrawal was forced by its shocking, $340-million 
first-quarter loss, brought on by more than 41,000 earthquake claims. On the 
day of its annual meeting two weeks ago, company directors voted to suspend the 
company's dividend for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has ordered 20th Century to raise its surplus to $250 million by 
June 30, from the current level of $188 million. Analysts said the low-debt 
company could easily achieve that by bank borrowings.

IMMIGRANT FARMER'S WOES GALVANIZE CONSERVATIVES; ENVIRONMENT: GROWERS,

<P>
 After making a small fortune as an importer in Taiwan, Taung Ming-Lin came to 
America with the dream of turning the soil into a garden of bamboo and bok choy 
and Chinese bitter melon. 
</P>
<P>
 He took one look at the fields rolling out lush and incandescent in Kern 
County and plunked down $1.65 million. Problem was, the 723 acres he bought 
three years ago turned out to be just about the most Godforsaken land in these 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 He set out to make his desert bloom, pouring in another $200,000 for equipment 
and a water well. He didn't know about the salt in the soil that stunted his 
bamboo. And he certainly didn't know about any Tipton kangaroo rats or 
blunt-nosed leopard lizards or San Joaquin kit foxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 51-year-old Lin stands accused by the U.S. government of destroying 
the habitat of endangered species. His tractor and disc have been seized as 
murder weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make bamboo and bok choy part of the American diet," he said 
through a translator. "But the government showed me this dead rat and then they 
took my tractor and disc. Now my land is worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives from Rush Limbaugh to Michael Huffington have seized upon the 
plight of the 5-foot-4 immigrant, who speaks no English and carries a lucky 
jade dragon, as one more example of the federal environmental bureaucracy gone 
mad.  
</P>
<P>
 In this region that gave rise to its own brand of country-Western music and 
remains home to more than a few John Birchers, the issue is white and black. 
It's farmer versus rat; farmer versus feds. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, the Kern County Farm Bureau and the Coalition to Protect 
and Preserve Private Property Rights threw a huge rally in support of Lin and 
other growers who have run afoul of the 1973 Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of tractors and big-rig trucks rumbled through the quiet streets of 
downtown Bakersfield. Crop dusters roared overhead. Lin, looking slightly 
befuddled in his blue jeans and tennis shoes, rode near the front of the 
cavalcade on the wheels of a gargantuan tractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fight or lose your job to the BureaucRATS," read one sign. "Three Rats and 
You're Out," read another, even though it was five kangaroo rats that the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service says it found on Lin's property. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tri-tip beef barbecue that followed, cotton and tomato farmer Tim Thomson 
tried to explain the passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the federal government has done to Mr. Lin is no different than if they 
found one of these kangaroo rats under your back porch and asked you to move 
out of your house but continue to pay the mortgage. It just isn't American." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin's lawyer would also argue that the case harks back to an older and more 
sordid tale of California real estate swindles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real estate professionals involved saw this naive foreign investor who 
didn't speak the language and they swindled him, pure and simple," said Daniel 
Rudnick, Lin's attorney. He is preparing to sue the seller, Tenneco Inc., to 
rescind the transaction and the two real estate agents for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give that ground away. It's got endangered species on it. It's a 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenneco says it wasn't aware that the land, which sat idle for years, was 
considered habitat for several endangered species. And it says it did not sell 
the land as farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were approached with an unsolicited offer to buy the land and Mr. Lin had 
an opportunity to inspect it and get a third-party opinion as to its value," 
said Christine LeLaurin, a Tenneco spokeswoman in Houston. "We feel bad for the 
guy, you bet. But it was no swindle." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Garone, a longtime Bakersfield farmer and one of the realty agents who 
represented Lin, chuckled when asked if the land could sustain crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm guilty of anything, but I don't see how I have anything to 
gain by talking to the media," he said. "It's the federal government that needs 
to be reined in." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin came to America in 1990 with his wife and three of four children. He gave 
up a lucrative career as an importer of U.S.-made refrigerators and 
air-conditioning units to open a small bookbinding firm in El Monte, which he 
still runs. He and the family live in El Monte and Lin travels frequently to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 But he kept dreaming about the life of a farmer, he said, remembering his 
84-year-old father still tilling eight acres of peanuts and rice on an island 
west of Taiwan, happy as can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never farmed, but it's in my blood," Lin said. "My idea was to sell 
the bookbinding company one day and go back to the soil." 
</P>
<P>
 A now-defunct Monterey Park real estate firm told Lin about the fertile San 
Joaquin Valley on the other side of the Tehachapis. He made one trip up and 
then another before deciding in February, 1991, to buy a large parcel 100 miles 
north of Los Angeles near Interstate 5 -- past the sleepy farm towns of Pumpkin 
Center and Panama and Old River. 
</P>
<P>
 A more bereft piece of earth -- at least from a farmer's perspective -- would 
be hard to imagine. But Lin looked past the tumbleweeds and snakes and 
salt-encrusted soil. He looked to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acres and acres of green. Farmland. Cotton. Alfalfa," he said. "That's all I 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
 He said neither the realty agent in Monterey Park nor Garone in Bakersfield, 
who split the sales commission, nor Tenneco told him it would take years of 
irrigation to leach out the deadly salts and turn the 723 acres into marginal 
cropland at best. And the escrow papers, he said, never mentioned a word about 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin said Tenneco even plowed the land clean before he handed over the $310,000 
down payment, removing all signs of virgin desert. 
</P>
<P>
 In early February, after Lin sank a $100,000 well, bought a $50,000 tractor, 
planted five acres of bamboo and watched every third plant wither, a state 
agent with the Department of Fish and Game knocked on the trailer door of Lin's 
farm manager, Robert Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know this was critical habitat for three endangered species? Have you 
obtained the necessary state or federal permit to till the land? 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez answered, "No," and a few days later, according to the federal 
complaint, he proceeded to plow under another swath of scrubland. On Feb. 20, 
more than two dozen state and federal agents, accompanied by helicopters, 
descended on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 They "arrested" the tractor and disc, according to court papers, and found 
"five suspected Tipton kangaroo rat carcasses and/or parts thereof." They 
charged Lin with three violations of the Endangered Species Act, which 
prohibits harming about 600 species of imperiled animals and plants and 
protects their natural surroundings. He faces up to a year in prison and 
$300,000 in criminal and civil fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The show of force rankled people here. The feds say they were just doing their 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty simple," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Karen Kalmanir. "We're 
enforcing the Endangered Species Act. This was an unlawful and knowing take of 
habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalmanir said Lin continued to destroy the habitat after he had been warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalmanir is fresh from the prosecution of a Tulare County farmer who destroyed 
a portion of the habitat of the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, which is found only 
in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Tule Vista Farms entered a guilty plea, was 
fined $5,000 and agreed to sell 100 acres and deed 60 acres more to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Unger, president of the local Sierra Club, supports the federal 
government action and wonders why Lin, a man who is savvy enough to run a 
successful import business, would fail to know the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we protect the kangaroo rat?" he asked. "Because it's part of the 
web of life and it happens to be one of the principal foods for the foxes, 
bobcats and coyotes out there. How can we sit here and play God and say 'This 
species we'll let go?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At a rally and barbecue for Lin and others, E.G. Berchtold told the crowd of 
500 that the tractor he sold to Lin had been seized and it remained in federal 
custody as Exhibit No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States of America vs. One Ford Tractor," he laughed. "You can't 
believe what we're going to have to do to get that tractor back." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, let's go get it right now," a burly man shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," the crowd roared. "Let's go get it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Come see me afterward," Berchtold smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin stood onstage clutching a stuffed mouse someone had given him. His tiny 
frame was half-covered by the American flag and he looked a little lost amid 
the Hillary Clinton and Janet Reno jokes. Half his face drooped from a small 
stroke he blames on his troubles. Politicians running for office kept wanting 
to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed in American government," he said. "But my feelings toward 
the people are very warm."

WHITE HOUSE OKS JOB RULES FOR WELFARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, putting the final touches on the President's 
welfare reform plan, have decided that aid recipients who reach a proposed 
two-year limit on benefits without finding private-sector jobs should be 
permitted to continue in government-subsidized jobs indefinitely, according to 
a senior Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subsidized jobs, whose wages would substitute for welfare benefits, 
would be available only to those who continued to do everything possible to 
find other employment, according to the official and a source outside the 
Administration who has seen the final reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 This could mean that even with the radical welfare reform the President is 
expected to propose to Congress next week, the federal government still might 
have to support some families as long as their minor children lived at home. 
</P>
<P>
 States would be given the option of evaluating whether recipients who have 
held subsidized jobs for two years had made good-faith efforts to obtain 
unsubsidized jobs. Those who were found to have failed to apply for open 
unsubsidized jobs, who failed to cooperate with potential employers or who had 
turned down job offers would be removed from the program and barred from 
applying for further subsidized work for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who plays by the rules can continue on the program," the 
Administration official said, "but it prevents people from just going through 
the motions" and staying on the dole. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether there would be a limit on the number of subsidized work slots for 
welfare recipients was one of the trickiest policy decisions that the 
architects of the Administration's reform plan had to make. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to make sure that there was a clear end to welfare and yet not 
take away the safety net for families who need it. It was the last significant 
policy decision after more than a year of intensive work by Administration 
officials on the proposal, which is designed to fulfill Clinton's campaign 
promise to "end welfare as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, welfare recipients would receive education, training, job 
placement services, child care and health care benefits to help them get off 
welfare. After two years, welfare recipients would be required to work. If no 
unsubsidized job were available, the state would provide jobs for as long as 
two years so that recipients could earn their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients who refused jobs would be subject to severe sanctions. They would 
be ineligible for another subsidized work slot for six months and would find 
themselves with no cash assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of financial and administrative restrictions, the Administration 
decided to apply the new welfare rules only to people born after 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the officials had such a difficult time making the decision is that 
no one knows how many people will be unable to find work because of a shortage 
of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The only people who should be left in the subsidized work program are those 
who are unable to work without a "sheltered environment" and those who live in 
areas where there are no jobs that match their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has not been a broad test of how a mandatory program of subsidized 
jobs would work, and there is no way to estimate how many people would still be 
without regular jobs after two years on welfare and two years doing subsidized 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The option allowing states to cut families off if they are found to be making 
less than a full effort to get work after two years in subsidized jobs is "a 
safety valve to make sure people play by the rules," the Administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a sanction is important to the more conservative members of the 
Administration's welfare reform task force because they believe it is essential 
to send a clear message that work is not an option but a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other welfare reform plans that have already been introduced in Congress offer 
other solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the major House Republican version, states would have the option to cut off 
recipients completely after three years, whether or not they were trying to get 
jobs. Under a plan forwarded by centrist and conservative Democrats in the 
House, the subsidized jobs would end after three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration official said both of these solutions are too "arbitrary" 
and could lead to "unforeseen consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 "We took what was a principled decision," the official added. "People playing 
by the rules ought to be rewarded."

COLUMN ONE; SEEKING GOLD IN THE SILVER STATE; A FLOOD OF NEW ARRIVALS, DRAWN BY 
DREAMS OF THE GOOD LIFE, ARE SHAKING UP ONCE-LONELY NEVADA. IN BOOM TOWNS LIKE 
ELKO, YOU'LL NOW FIND COWBOYS AND CAFFE LATTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chuck wagon is parked by the man-made lake at giant Maggie Creek Ranch, a 
lonely figure in a vast landscape, all but abandoned save for the occasional 
company picnic. Most cowboys here no longer ride the sage-strewn range in 
solitary search for wayward cattle; instead, they truck their horses in to 
round up, rope and brand the herd. 
</P>
<P>
 The smell's the same, but the job is different: There are benefits now, and 
higher salaries, more vandals, fewer rustlers. These cowboys probably have 
wives with careers; they may live in town and drive to work. The spaces here 
are still wide open, but there are far more people in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could drive down Idaho Street halfway through town on the wrong side of 
the street and not meet anybody," says retired cowboy and Elko native George 
Smiraldo, 68. "Can't do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Can't do that anymore because Elko, in Nevada's northeast corner, is one of 
the fastest-growing cities in the fastest-growing state, a place of boom times 
and bad times, wealth and shortage, where cattle still outnumber people 5 to 1, 
but people are slowly, slowly gaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Transplants from throughout the nation have flooded Nevada in the last 10 
years, drawn by plentiful jobs and cheap housing, the lack of a state income 
tax and a perception that anything is possible out here on the cultural 
frontier. A record 6,292 people turned in out-of-state driver's licenses in 
March to live in Las Vegas, which is home to three-quarters of the state's 
population. Nevada as a whole created 48,300 jobs, a 7.4% gain, in the year 
ending in March. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest migration "is overwhelming compared to anything that's ever 
happened in Nevada," says historian James W. Hulse. In 1980, the population 
hovered around 800,000; today, it is nearly 1.5 million. Both counts are a far 
cry from the 1940s, when the state had a bare 110,000 residents, "one square 
man for every square mile," as locals were fond of recounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevada is quite an interesting laboratory," says Hulse, author of "The Silver 
State: Nevada's Heritage Reinterpreted." "The modern business of gambling was 
largely hammered out here. The atomic test site was in a sense a laboratory. It 
is a place of social experimentation." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest experiment is how to live with rapid growth and change, with stress 
on everything from the infrastructure to the environment, the political system 
to the classroom. Much of the pressure comes from Californians who are fleeing 
a sagging economy and bringing their pluses and problems east. In the 16 months 
ending in April, expatriates from the Golden State accounted for 40% of Nevada 
transplants, outpacing Arizona, the closest competitor with 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 These newcomers have changed Nevada for good, and nowhere is that change more 
visible than here in Cowboy Central, where past and present coexist, albeit not 
always in perfect comfort. The contrast begins on the inbound airplane, a tiny 
prop number whose passengers are warned against using cellular phones and 
chewing tobacco. Where, after all, would a gentleman spit in a plane that seats 
30? 
</P>
<P>
 At J. M. Capriola Co. in Elko's old downtown, Paula and Doug Wright still sell 
rawhide reins and hand-tooled saddles, silver spurs and leather chaps. At 
nearby Stockmen's Motor Hotel, founded by a Basque shepherd and now run by his 
son, a rare penny slot machine promises a five-buck payoff -- all copper, of 
course. By day, the neighborhood is pungent with cow manure, by night, perfumed 
with cooking Basque lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 But halfway between J. M. Capriola and Stockmen's is Donuts n' Mor, where 
"mor" these days means caffe latte. The Elko Coffee Co. sells espresso for 80 
cents. Kmart came to town in 1991, and rumor has it that Wal-Mart is not far 
behind. Emergency 911 service was installed last year but has yet to touch the 
farthest reaches of the county. The number of stoplights has jumped from two to 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth rate has cooled from a blistering 21% in 1987 to about 5%. Mayor 
Jim Polkinghorne would like to see it subside even further, but so far his wish 
has not been granted. "Right now, with the infrastructure, we're keeping our 
head above water," he says. "But we don't have much margin." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure Elko's small, but it used to be smaller, having doubled in size in the 
last 10 years. The census never has got it right, they say, but if you look 
real hard you'll find 25,000 people -- if you include Spring Creek, a bedroom 
community of houses and mobile homes eight miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are more plentiful than ever, but just try to find a place to live. When 
you do, just try to pay for it; Elko County has the highest average household 
income in Nevada -- an annual $38,900 compared to $31,000 in Clark County, home 
to Las Vegas -- but its rents rival those in parts of Southern California, more 
than $750 a month for a house. 
</P>
<P>
 When a guidebook named Elko the No. 1 small town in America last winter, the 
Chamber of Commerce received 800 calls in a single month from people nationwide 
who wanted to relocate. It was a real stretch on the small chamber's budget 
just to mail them all maps and stats, Executive Director Lorrie Kocinski says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we told people not to come here unless they already had a place to live," 
she says. "Spring Creek High School opened this year, and we put an appeal in 
the paper asking that if anyone had rental units or rooms in their homes to 
consider renting to teachers first. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, too, because not everyone is as lucky as this new crop of 
instructors. Shawn Hall, for example, spent three months looking for a house to 
rent when he got a job in Elko three years ago. He found a place just four days 
before he reported for work at the Northeastern Nevada Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put a desperation ad in the paper: 'I need a home, and I need it quick,' " 
said the museum's acting director, who is originally from Massachusetts. 
"Someone called and said they just had a house vacated. They asked if I wanted 
to come look. I said I'd take it now and look later." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which begs the question: Why Elko? If you listen to Hunter S. Thompson, 
author of a recent Rolling Stone article titled "Fear and Loathing in Elko," it 
certainly isn't for the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus, who made this map?" Thompson wrote of the stretch of Interstate 80 
between Elko and Winnemucca, in neighboring Humboldt County. "Only a lunatic 
could have come up with a list of places like this: Imlay, Valmy, Golconda, 
Nixon, Midas, Metropolis, Jiggs, Judasville -- all of them empty. . . . The 
federal government owns 90% of this land, and most of it is useless for 
anything except weapons testing and poison-gas experiments." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter S. doth protest too much, but he has a point. While the city of Elko is 
barely longer than the runway at the local airport, Elko County is 17,127 
square miles, larger than Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate 80 threads its way through the barren, arid countryside, linking 
Elko with Salt Lake City 240 miles to the east and Reno 290 miles to the west. 
Boise is 235 miles north and Las Vegas 475 miles south. The space in between is 
just that: space. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeast Nevada's scenic claim to fame is the rugged Ruby Mountain range, 
known by some as the "Alps of Nevada." The snowcapped Rubies loom above Elko's 
aging Commercial Hotel and Casino, site of the first casino floor show: Ted 
Lewis and the Rhythm Rhapsody Revue, 1941. They add a little flair to growing 
rows of tract houses on streets with names like High Noon Road and Lariat 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 They rise over Idaho Street, the main drag and an architectural timeline that 
ticks off the decades, west to east, old to new: 1930s, the Commercial with a 
multistory plaster polar bear a.k.a. White King; 1950s, Karen's Kloset, hot 
pink with bright white wedding gowns in the windows; 1980s, the Red Lion Inn 
and Casino, concrete newness with large marquee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranching is Elko County's economic constant, but the trailer homes and 
brand-new schools aren't filled with the kids of cowboys; the cash cow here 
cannot be roped and branded. The real draw is below the sage and scrub: a 
deposit of gold so big the region ranks among the world's top three producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot talk about the growth of Elko without talking about the growth of 
mining," says the chamber's Kocinski, who moved here four years ago when her 
husband got a mining job. Mining accounts for 54% of the economy here, with 
gambling a distant second and ranching third. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, the mining boom brought so many newcomers so fast that the city 
could not absorb them all. Houses filled, apartments were snapped up, the 
overflow camped illicitly on the shores of the Humboldt River to be regularly 
run off by ranchers. While the boom cooled some in the early 1990s, hotel rooms 
that should house would-be gamblers still are home to mine workers renting week 
to week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 1,000 construction workers here right now," says Jim Mullin, general 
manager of the Newmont Gold Co., currently the top gold producer in the area. 
"They have consumed nearly all the spaces in the RV lots. All rental spots are 
taken. . . . Elko doesn't contain a lot of people who are from Elko. The street 
I live on wasn't there last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Newmont, Barrick Goldstrike Mines and Independence are 
mining the Carlin Trend, a wealth of microscopic gold discovered in 1964. Local 
mining officials estimate that those three mines alone pour $660 million into 
the area each year. High technology allows them to blast ore out of open pits, 
then process the gold using potassium cyanide, acids and other harsh chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the gold deposit is big -- some say it will last at least 35 years -- 
it is nowhere near the size of the northeast Nevada attitude. The area's 
always-healthy scorn for government intervention has blossomed into full-scale 
animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, disgusted over Barrick's recent acquisition 
of a huge mine here, is pushing changes in 1872 laws that could force mining 
companies to pay royalties on the minerals they remove from U.S. lands. 
</P>
<P>
 There are questions about chemicals used in high-tech mining and about how the 
land will look when the mines shut down. Local ranchers worry that the mines' 
"dewatering" processes could disrupt the water table in these drought-ridden 
times. Mine representatives dispute such claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "What isn't GROWN . . . Must be MINED" is the bumper sticker of choice in 
these parts. A touchy Kocinski, bitter about bad press, acknowledges the fact 
that there's a huge hole in the scenery in the form of a massive pit mine. "But 
who cares? . . . You're not talking about Yosemite." 
</P>
<P>
 "We like our mining here," says Terry Lockhart, Avis manager at the Elko 
Airport, even before she greets two prospective customers. "We're the only 
state in the union that wants mining. It provides jobs. What else is Nevada 
good for?" 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask historian James Hulse, he'll tell you Nevada is good for tourism. 
Although the mining boom is mostly confined to Elko and Eureka counties, the 
state as a whole is currently driven by a gaming boom the likes of which has 
not been seen before. Even Elko, where mining is king, has benefited from the 
growth of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll gamble tonight and all day tomorrow," Lois Zaremba says as she 
disembarked at the Elko airport one recent evening. "I don't think I want to 
spend any more than $100 or $150. It's our honeymoon; we won't have time to 
spend too much money." 
</P>
<P>
 Lois and her husband, Joe, of East Peoria, Ill., were hoping to honeymoon at a 
resort hotel in Donner's Grove outside of Chicago, a luxurious place where "all 
the rooms have saunas," Lois says dreamily. But the price was better for a 
gambling getaway, so the happy couple ended up on the Elko Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
 They flew in on the Queen of Hearts, a Casino Express Boeing 737 named not for 
romance but for the playing card on the big jet's tail. The Ace of Clubs 
touched down moments earlier from Oklahoma City; the King of Diamonds is off in 
the Bahamas. Casino Express, after all, is Elko's only international airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month Casino Express brings 12,000 Joes and Loises to town, small-town 
dwellers from places like Elko, middle-rollers unlikely to visit Sin City 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go to places like Waterloo, Iowa; Ft. Dodge, Iowa; Akron, Colo.," says 
David Cimo, airline general manager. "How many people have ever heard of Akron, 
Colo.? There are 1,600 people in Akron, and we have yet to come out of there 
with an empty seat. Every time we come out of there, we've got 124 people on 
the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 That's 124 people to fill the Red Lion's rooms and empty their pockets at the 
Red Lion's casino. Without the airline, the hotel is sunk; without the hotel, 
why have an airline? "It seems so weird to have a full-service airline in a 
place like Elko, Nev.," Cimo says, "this tiny little place in the middle of 
nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it is small and very remote, dependent on mining, hooked on gaming, 
praying for rain so the ranches survive. But Elko, Nev., is looking ahead to 
that far-off day when the mines play out; like the rest of the state, it's 
scrambling to find another way to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first success in the struggle for economic diversity was luring away 
Reno's Dodd-Beals Fire Protection Training Academy -- an enterprise that could 
pump an annual $10 million into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The information superhighway runs through town, but, so far, there aren't any 
off-ramps. The fiber-optics here are fine, but CompuServe to date does not 
offer local phone service for the so-called lone eagle telecommuters. As a 
result, computer users who sign on pay long-distance charges, a real deterrent 
for living in Elko and doing business on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city is working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to come here and telecommute," says Debbie Smith, executive 
director of the Northeast Nevada Development Assn. "We want to do what we can 
to get you to do that. We have been pursuing the 'lone eagles.' And we already 
have two here." Coming to Nevada 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of jobs, cheap housing, no income tax and a feeling that anything is 
possible -- that's why people move to Nevada. Elko, in the far northeast 
corner, is among the fastest growing cities in the state, helped by a mining 
boom and growth in gambling. How the Population Has Grown 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada is the fastest growing state in the United States, with a 50% increase 
in population from 1980-1990. California's population, by comparison, has 
increased 26% in the same period.

</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the people and history of Elko, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded: At the end of 1868, when railroad agents laid out streets and lots. 
First town parcels sold Jan. 15, 1869. Within six months, it had 45 saloons and 
several brothels. An early amenity was an opera house. 
</P>
<P>
 Vital statistics: Elko County is 17,127 square miles, larger than 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware combined. It is nearly 
uninhabited, with 33,530 residents -- or about two people per square mile -- 
according to the 1990 census. The city of Elko has 14,736 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: The city is 240 miles west of Salt Lake City, 290 miles east of 
Reno, 235 miles south of Boise and 475 miles north of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth rate: Although sparsely populated, Elko County is the second 
fastest-growing county (after Nye) in the fastest-growing state. The city of 
Elko is Nevada's fourth fastest-growing, after Henderson (a Las Vegas bedroom 
community), Mesquite and Carlin. Las Vegas ranks No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 University: Got one in 1874. Lost it to Reno in 1886. When in Elko, it never 
had more than 35 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Look Out, Barbra Streisand: Newton Crumley Jr., who bought the 62-year-old 
Commercial Hotel in 1931, is credited with introducing the floor show to the 
world of casinos. In 1941, Ted Lewis and the Rhythm Rhapsody Revue played a 
weeklong gig in Elko; 52 years later, Streisand got $1,000 per ticket for the 
best seats at her sold-out New Year's Eve show in Las Vegas.

20TH CENTURY INSURANCE TO END QUAKE POLICIES; BUSINESS: FIRM, HIT BY $600 
MILLION IN CLAIMS, IS PHASING OUT HOME COVERAGE ALSO. MOVES TO AFFECT 240,000 
CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move certain to shake up the Southern California insurance market, 
earthquake-battered 20th Century Insurance Co. said Thursday that it will stop 
selling earthquake policies immediately and phase out all homeowner coverage 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The big insurer's exit increases fears that consumers -- especially in the Los 
Angeles Basin -- will have trouble finding earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also prompted renewed calls for a national catastrophe insurance 
program such as the Natural Disaster Protection Act now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based 20th Century said it will take no new customers in either 
homeowner or earthquake insurance, but will concentrate on the cut-rate auto 
policies that form the bulk of its business and have fueled its 30 years of 
fast growth and high profits. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's action, negotiated last month with Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, directly affects 240,000 homeowners and condominium policyholders, 
the majority of whom live in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our customers have already suffered the disrupting effects of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake," Neil H. Ashley, chief executive, said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize this is one more inconvenience, but it is the right thing to do," 
he added, citing about $600 million in quake claims that wiped out two-thirds 
of the insurer's surplus, or cushion against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Disruption aside, it will cost policyholders money. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi granted the company an immediate 17% increase on its homeowner 
rates, which will bring the average annual premium to $365 from $317, based on 
$117,000 of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 That is still cheap compared with the average of $441 in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. However, existing homeowner policyholders will be allowed only 
two more annual renewals before they are forced to shop elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer's 90,000 earthquake policyholders must find another carrier by 
their next renewal date. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said in a statement that he did not expect consumers to have trouble 
finding replacement coverage, but others have predicted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he says the market will absorb 20th Century (customers) no problem, I say, 
well, who?" said Stephen L. Young of the Independent Insurance Agents and 
Brokers of California, a trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, insurers have moved to curtail the growth of 
new earthquake and homeowner coverage in Southern California, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will be especially difficult for customers with quake-damaged homes 
to find new coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the state's largest carrier with 20% of the market, recently began 
a "managed growth" program for its California homeowners line, limiting the 
amount of new business it accepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking steps to limit our exposure," spokesman John Millen of No. 3 
Farmers Insurance Group said Thursday. "It's the prudent thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers recently raised the deductible on its quake policies to 15% from 10% 
and is "seriously reviewing the need for increased rates," Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millen said the real answer would be enactment of the Natural Disaster 
Protection Act, whose passage this year is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation would create a national pool for disaster coverage 
with a disaster insurance component built into all homeowners' policies. The 
premiums would be adjusted for regional risk of quakes, hurricanes, wildfires 
or other catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of 20th Century -- the eighth largest homeowner insurer 
statewide and believed to be the fourth largest in Southern California -- also 
may put upward pressure on homeowners' insurance rates over the long term, 
since 20th Century has been the low-price leader for the 12 years since 
starting that line of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, Garamendi noted that no other carriers have sought rate 
increases in homeowner insurance since January. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's withdrawal was forced by its shocking, $340-million 
first-quarter loss, brought on by more than 41,000 earthquake claims. On the 
day of its annual meeting two weeks ago, company directors voted to suspend the 
company's dividend for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was about to grant 20th Century's application to triple its 
earthquake rates, Deputy Insurance Commissioner Richard D. Baum said Thursday, 
but the company suddenly changed its mind and decided to stop selling all 
residential coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the disruption to policyholders, Garamendi negotiated an orderly 
withdrawal over two years, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century spokesman Rick Dinon said that between the time it applied for 
the rate increase and changed its mind, the estimated quake losses had 
ballooned by several hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street loved Thursday's move. The stock of parent 20th Century Industries 
jumped $2 a share, or 13%, closing at $17.75 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts have long questioned whether it made sense for 20th Century -- a 
hugely profitable auto insurance writer with the industry's lowest cost of 
doing business -- to diversify into residential coverage in the first place. 
The strategy became even more questionable in the mid-1980s, when California 
passed a law requiring insurers to offer earthquake coverage to their 
homeowners policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has ordered 20th Century to raise its surplus to $250 million by 
June 30, from the current level of $188 million. Analysts said the low-debt 
company could easily achieve that by bank borrowings.

DISNEY DELAYS ANAHEIM RESORT PLAN FOR A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it will be at least another year, 
perhaps longer, before it decides whether to commit to build a $3-billion theme 
park and resort next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although never promising to build it, Disney first proposed the resort in 1990 
and suggested construction could begin as early as 1993 if substantial public 
funding supported the project. Since then, government officials at all levels 
have scrambled to offer millions of dollars in freeway and public works 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although delays have been announced several times before, the latest renewed 
speculation that what could be one of Southern California's biggest 
construction projects -- promising 28,000 permanent jobs and millions in tax 
revenue -- is languishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to happen this year," said Doug Moreland, the director of 
development for the Disneyland Resort project. "We have to see how this all 
comes together." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed resort would include more than 5,000 hotel rooms, a large 
shopping district, an amphitheater and a new internationally themed amusement 
park, called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment industry analyst for the Seidler Companies 
brokerage in Los Angeles, said the Disney project "just doesn't pencil out 
financially. . . . I think the park will get built when it's right for Disney. 
It's not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 State trade chief Julie Meier Wright called word of the delay "a 
disappointment." Gov. Wilson has taken a special interest in the project, 
pledging $50 million in public works to support the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement comes as Disney is grappling with the financial strains of 
Euro Disney, waging its own war over the fate of a historically themed Disney's 
America park in suburban Virginia, and planning to build a fourth theme park at 
its Florida resort. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Disneyland Resort had stayed on schedule, the opening would have 
occurred as soon as 1998, according to the city's and Disney's official joint 
plan for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "the timetable might be more in line with an opening in 2005," said Ned 
Snavely, general manager of the Anaheim Marriott hotel and a major supporter of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Disney and city officials had said the project might get 
approval or rejection from Disney Chairman Michael Eisner as early as 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney officials said Thursday that the entertainment giant will not 
decide until the funding for all of the public portion of the project -- up to 
$1 billion in public works and other improvements -- is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has demanded massive public financing of about a third of the total 
cost of the project -- including two massive parking garages for more than 
30,000 cars -- as a condition of its participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the funding issues, a Disney decision is awaiting the completion of a 
nine-month environmental review of one of the parking structures. As recently 
as May 28, a House subcommittee had snatched back some of the $28 million that 
it had allocated for local transportation projects, including the Disney 
parking garage. The combined cost of the garages is about $450 million, all of 
it coming from state, federal, county and city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth said Disney officials told him several 
weeks ago that they would be postponing a commitment because of the delay in 
Congressional approval for the parking garage. Those funds will probably not be 
allocated until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that they hoped to get that money sooner, but we have to live with 
that," Ruth said. "This is a high-risk investment for them and they want to 
make sure they have everything in line beforehand. It would be nice if it could 
happen quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said city officials are unconcerned that Disney is backing away from the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if the federal government sees that the city is moving forward, they'll 
realize that we're not playing games here," Ruth said of the city's plans to go 
ahead with a major renewal of the 550 acres around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, chief executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority, 
which is underwriting some of the public works costs, said Thursday that he is 
sorry to hear of the delay and that the appropriations bill with the garage 
money is still moving ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Anaheim officials -- who have pinned much of their economic future 
on the development of the Disneyland Resort -- announced Thursday that they are 
moving ahead with their $200 million to $300 million in improvements to 
streets, sewers and other public infrastructure regardless of Disney's ultimate 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions more are being spent by the state to build off-ramps on the Santa Ana 
Freeway in anticipation that Disney will eventually go ahead with the project. 
Officials explained that with a local freeway widening project under way, 
Caltrans simply can't wait any longer for Disney to make its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreland defended the public spending to support the project, saying that many 
of these improvements need to be made to the aging area anyway.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON AIDES HEAR POLITICAL CLOCK TICKING WITH ALARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton is running out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President returns from a week of celebration commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of D-day in Europe, that is the increasingly anxious conclusion of 
top Administration aides and Democratic strategists, as well as the cheery 
expectation of their Republican opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just that the legislative clock has ticked ominously close to 
quitting time on Clinton's major initiative -- health care reform. Even more 
seriously for the President, he appears to be running out of time with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, his aides concede, faces an increasingly frustrated and uncharitable 
electorate, dismayed by the roller-coaster nature of his presidency, tired of 
revelations about his personal life and impatient to see actual delivery on his 
promises of change. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton cannot turn around that frustration relatively soon, his advisers 
fear he faces twin -- and potentially crippling -- blows: first, that dismay 
with him will fuel large Democratic losses in the congressional elections this 
fall, enough to deny him a working majority in Congress; and, second, that the 
current voter discontent with his performance could harden into a firm judgment 
that he is inadequate to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters "feel it's not working out right," said a senior Administration 
official. Despite consistently encouraging economic news, "people still don't 
have confidence in the Administration on economic matters," he added. More and 
more, "there's an accumulation of people saying: 'Oh, man, they're just not 
making progress.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the first year of the Administration, "voters kept saying they 
wanted him to succeed, they were hopeful," said Democratic pollster Celinda 
Lake. "Now they're expressing considerably more frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 To avert the dangers he faces, aides say, Clinton needs to begin with a few 
major victories -- and soon. "We have a window of about three months," the 
senior official said. "After you hit Labor Day, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton hopes to begin achieving that goal by using the goodwill that even 
Republican pollsters say they believe has been generated by his successful 
participation in the D-day commemorations. 
</P>
<P>
 Building on the theme he enunciated in Europe -- that the current generation 
must meet its challenges the way the last generation met the challenge of World 
War II -- he hopes to press Congress to complete action on an anti-crime bill 
that has been moving slowly through both houses for nine months and on his 
much-debated health care reform proposals. In addition, Clinton plans next week 
to unveil his welfare reform plan, which has been stalled for months by 
internal debates and congressional worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Clinton's aides say they believe that he can overcome his current 
problems, they do not deny them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want results and they want action," said Clinton adviser Mandy 
Grunwald. In the absence of forward movement, she added, "it's a long process, 
and voters find it very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters are "reaching the conclusion that not much is getting done," said 
Clinton political aide Paul Begala, adding that it is "the wrong conclusion" 
and "I think we can dissuade them." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's position can be seen in polls in which his approval ratings have 
generally been lackluster -- in the 45%-to-50% range, depending on the poll. 
Those ratings are not the worst of his presidency, but they are notably bad, 
considering that the economy has improved steadily for the last year and that 
unemployment now stands at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Various polls indicate that Americans are more likely than they were a year 
ago to see Clinton as someone willing to fight for his beliefs. Unfortunately 
for the President, his ratings for honesty, integrity and character have 
steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of troubles have contributed to Clinton's current difficulty, according 
to pollsters and strategists from both parties. A series of foreign policy 
reversals -- including the U.S. mission in Somalia that turned sour and the 
inability of the West to deal with the war in Bosnia -- have dominated the 
news, hardening doubts about the President's leadership ability. Major domestic 
initiatives, most notably health care reform, have been caught up in the toils 
of the legislative process, exposing voters to a steady barrage of stories 
about legislative gridlock. And, finally, the raft of stories about Clinton's 
personal life and about White House staff problems have increasingly begun to 
grate on people. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting impatient," said Republican pollster Frank Luntz, 
describing the results of focus groups made up of moderate, Democratic-leaning 
voters in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The impatience does not stem from any one incident, Luntz says. "It's one 
story after another story after another. It's none of it and it's all of it. 
You talk to people and they're no longer willing to give him a break." 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, Clinton suffers badly, even from incidents that White House 
officials say they handled relatively well, such as the rapid resignation of 
David Watkins, the former White House director of administration, after he used 
a military helicopter to fly to a golf outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a frustration out there from people that they are sick of hearing 
about and reading about the President's problems," said Democratic National 
Committee political director Don Sweitzer, who irritated the White House 
recently when he said that some Democratic candidates might not want Clinton's 
help this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All these problems, while they would be serious for any President, pose a 
particular threat to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ronald Reagan became President, he preached an anti-government message to 
an electorate that was disillusioned with Washington and already inclined to 
head in conservative directions. When Reagan ran into difficulties, as he did 
during the 1982 recession, he could gain time by riding a largely conservative 
tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, by contrast, has been seeking to revive faith in government among 
voters still deeply skeptical of Washington's ability to get things done. To 
overcome doubts about government, key advisers -- including pollster Stanley B. 
Greenberg -- have long pushed a "show me" strategy in which Clinton would 
convince Americans to moderate their skepticism about government by getting key 
programs, such as health care reform, enacted and by proving to the nation that 
they would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success breeds success. There's a certain momentum that you develop," 
Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy, in turn, requires convincing voters that Clinton can be trusted 
to break Washington gridlock and run the government effectively. That trust, 
however, appears to be seriously eroded. If voters do not believe in Clinton's 
effectiveness and credibility, his advisers concede, they will not support 
passage of his programs. And if his programs do not pass, the perception of his 
effectiveness will wane further. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton "can dance along that precipice for another year or two or even three, 
maybe," said William Kristol, head of the Project for the Republican Future and 
a former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle. Republicans who predict 
that Clinton will simply self-destruct are failing to take into account the 
enormous political skills and determination that have enabled him to come back 
from seeming disaster before, Kristol says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's running pretty close to the edge, and there's not a lot of room," he 
added. "That's why this is such a critical time for him. He really needs a good 
domestic win." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's top aides insist that they have several reasons to hope those 
victories will come, beginning with the crime bill, which they hope to see 
emerge from Congress soon. Victory on that front, they hope, will bolster 
Clinton's position on the main battle -- health care. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the White House can achieve those victories, the pace will be far 
from what Clinton strategists once had hoped. At the beginning of the year, 
those strategists dreamed that the crime bill, with its tougher sentences and 
100,000 new police officers, would be passed before Easter, that health reform 
would be on the House and Senate floors this summer and that a welfare reform 
package would be debated in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the delays, however, Clinton aides say they hope that once the 
President achieves a few victories, voters will begin to re-evaluate other 
accomplishments that the public seemingly has discounted. White House officials 
point to enactment of such programs as the new family-leave law, the start of 
the national service program for college students and last fall's passage of 
the free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, they argue that, because every Republican in Congress voted 
against last year's budget bill, Democrats are well-positioned to claim credit 
for the economic improvements of the last nine months.  
</P>
<P>
 Right now that strategy does not appear to be faring well. White House 
officials were taken aback, for example, by the success that Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) had with a flurry of advertisements attacking Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) for her vote on the budget measure, which included 
some new taxes. The ads helped Huffington win the GOP Senate nomination, and he 
will try to wrest the Senate seat from Feinstein in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton advisers say they believe that public attitudes will shift if the 
overall political context changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the middle of success, he (Clinton) gets credit for everything else," 
Grunwald argued. "When the process seems bogged down, it almost blocks 
everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 As Kristol notes, Clinton repeatedly has proven able to come back from deep 
political trouble. Indeed, the roller-coaster ride of his presidency has a 
certain seasonal quality: Two years ago in May and June, Clinton fell to third 
place in polls behind then-opponents George Bush and H. Ross Perot. Last year, 
May and June also marked a low point in which Clinton seemed to face defeat 
over his budget plan and was forced to jettison C. Lani Guinier as his choice 
for assistant attorney general for civil rights. In both cases, Clinton used 
the summer and fall to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back this time, however, could be more difficult than ever. As focus 
groups and polls indicate, Clinton may have become overexposed, wearing out his 
welcome with many voters. That could be a significant problem for an 
Administration that has grown dependent on the President's ability to be the 
chief salesman for his programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, only some of the current voter frustration with Clinton stems from 
the continued sense of Washington gridlock -- a sense that some large-scale 
victories could reverse. Much of the discontent grows, instead, from worries 
about Clinton's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just not been able to shake people's doubts about his credibility," said 
Rep. Dick Swett (D-N.H.), a moderate Democrat from a marginal district who says 
he worries about the effect that Clinton's troubles may have on his own 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent focus groups in California, Lake says, the sort of pro-Clinton 
voters who a few months ago might have risen to Clinton's defense sat quietly 
when others in the group attacked him. "They didn't argue, they didn't nail the 
other people back," she said. "People just don't want him to go up and down 
anymore. They are getting tired of the roller coaster."

HOUSE VOTES TO LIFT BOSNIA ARMS BAN; CONGRESS: LAWMAKERS REJECT CLINTON PLEA 
AGAINST UNILATERAL ACTION, 244-178. BUT A SENATE BILL IS MONTHS AWAY, AND 
PASSAGE OF ANY MEASURE IS SEEN AS UNLIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest congressional revolt over President Clinton's handling of 
foreign policy, the House voted by a large margin Thursday to require the 
Administration to unilaterally lift an embargo on arms sales to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 244 to 178; 117 Democrats lined up against the White House, while 
132 supported the President. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, the White House said that, while Clinton favors lifting the 
U.N. embargo, he opposes acting without the consent of North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization allies who have peacekeeping troops on the ground in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the House decided that the embargo is unfairly punishing Bosnian Muslims, 
who are seriously outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the President had spoken out loudly and clearly for his principles, we 
wouldn't be in this mess . . ," complained Rep. Frank McCloskey, the Indiana 
Democrat who led the rebellion over Bosnia. "But we don't have any sense of 
resolve, clarity, focus or expertise anywhere" in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey warned that missteps on foreign policy would "become at some point a 
domestic political liability for the President," undercutting his stature on 
such issues as health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The House-passed measure, attached to the House version of the annual bill 
authorizing defense spending for the coming year, is unlikely to become law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Senate adopted similar legislation by a 50-49 vote last month, 
McCloskey's measure must still be accepted when the House and Senate Armed 
Services committees meet later this year to reconcile their versions of the 
defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Thursday, the House passed its $262.7-billion defense authorization bill 
by a vote of 260-158, but the Senate bill is at least two months away from 
clearing the Senate floor. Both the chairman and the ranking Republican of the 
Senate panel oppose lifting the embargo unilaterally, as does House Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland). 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the hurdles, it's very unlikely this will go all the way and, even if 
it does, it has not been passed by nearly enough votes to be veto-proof," said 
a House foreign policy aide. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed small consolation to an Administration smarting from a series of 
congressional rebukes that reflect a lack of confidence in Clinton's conduct of 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter circulated to House Democrats before the vote, Clinton argued that 
"unilateral action now would be particularly damaging" because it would 
undermine support for economic sanctions that Washington wants to impose on 
North Korea to punish it for refusing to allow inspections of nuclear 
facilities. More than that, Clinton said, McCloskey's amendment would mean the 
end of the effort to bring peace to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Clinton's top military and foreign policy advisers -- Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott -- underscored those 
points in greater detail at a closed briefing, attended by more than 100 House 
members shortly before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "They argued very strongly that lifting the embargo now would only intensify 
the war in Bosnia and that lifting it unilaterally would cause a serious rift 
with the NATO allies," one participant said. "They even suggested at one point 
that the future of the NATO alliance could be at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 But several lawmakers who attended the session said they thought that the 
Administration team had failed to make a compelling case. Others said they were 
inclined not to take the warnings too seriously because they doubted the 
mandate to lift the embargo would ever become law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely!" responded Rep. Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.) when asked if her 
colleagues regarded the McCloskey amendment as a "free vote" that allowed them 
to express their displeasure with Clinton's Bosnia policy without actually 
forcing him to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sarajevo, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic welcomed the vote. The 
Associated Press quoted him as saying on Sarajevo radio, "We were not expecting 
such a significant and great victory. . . . We are dealing with a unilateral 
lifting of the embargo, which the U.N. Security Council can no longer 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council, with the support of the United States, imposed the 
embargo in September, 1991. The idea was to keep weaponry in the region to a 
minimum and thus reduce the violence. In fact, critics argue, it has aided 
well-armed Serbian forces by denying Bosnian Muslims the weapons needed to 
defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's vote "wasn't exactly a ringing endorsement" for Clinton's foreign 
policies, conceded House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee H. Hamilton 
(D-Ind.), who led the losing fight against McCloskey's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of Democrats told me they didn't really want to lift the embargo 
unilaterally but did want to send a strong signal of disapproval to the 
President over his Bosnia policy and knew that it would be cleaned up in 
conference" with the Senate, Hamilton added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who said he knew that the Administration could not win, had 
sponsored an alternative that would have urged Clinton to seek allied support 
for the lifting of the embargo. His amendment was defeated by a vote of 242 to 
181. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just a large number of people who wanted to say as strongly as 
possible that the President's policy is unacceptable," Hamilton said. 
</P>

 Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) a leader of the embargo-lifting effort, said, "For 
two years now, we have looked the (Serbian) aggressor in the eye and said, 'If 
you go one step further we will take definitive action.' And they took some 
steps, and we backed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an old, old historical lesson: Tyrants never respond to weakness," 
Hoyer said.

EX-DEPUTY CHIEF CHARGED WITH HAVING LAPD RECORDS; POLICE: DANIEL SULLIVAN 
ILLEGALLY GOT INFORMATION FOR HIS INVESTIGATIONS FIRM, OFFICIALS SAY. HE DENIES 
ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>

 Daniel R. Sullivan, a retired deputy police chief once considered one of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's brightest stars, was charged Thursday with 
illegally having confidential law enforcement information in the files of his 
private investigation company. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the highest-ranking former LAPD official to face criminal charges since 
the corruption scandals of the early 1900s, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, charged with 11 misdemeanor counts, allegedly received the 
confidential information from a police officer who has since resigned from the 
force. The former officer, Walter Ray Bentley Jr., was charged separately 
Thursday, as was another private detective to whom he allegedly passed 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Outspoken and personable, Sullivan was widely seen as a likely candidate to 
succeed Daryl F. Gates as police chief. Before his retirement eight years ago, 
he was regarded as a straight-talking "cop's cop" unafraid to take on City Hall 
politicians, members of the civilian Police Commission and even fellow officers 
who stepped off the straight and narrow and took free meals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he strongly denied any wrongdoing and lambasted those seeking to 
prosecute him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed and I am disgusted," said Sullivan, 57. "Are the citizens 
of Los Angeles going to sleep better knowing that (the district attorney and 
Police Department) spent hundreds and hundreds of man-hours trying to determine 
if I got information that indicates someone is a crook?" 
</P>
<P>
 At worst, he said, some files at his Woodland Hills-based Investigative 
Services Corp. detective agency contained "harmless" information about criminal 
records of people applying for jobs with his corporate clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have any records that were unauthorized, I don't know about them," 
Sullivan said. "But if they are, I take responsibility for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sullivan's efforts to downplay the charges, police and prosecutors say 
the allegations are serious and underscore the department's efforts to counter 
improper and illegal trafficking in computerized information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department hopes to send a message that you cannot get away with this 
type of behavior, even if you were a deputy chief of police," said one law 
enforcement official who investigated the case for the past year. "Who knows 
where this information could have ended up? It could have gotten a cop or 
someone else killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson, the prosecutor handling the cases, said 
information on various people -- including witnesses in criminal cases -- was 
obtained from LAPD computers by Bentley and given to Sullivan and another 
private detective, Thomas Whiteaker of Whiteaker Investigative Services in 
Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, Yochelson said, Whiteaker was given information on a witness 
in a murder case who had been relocated for his protection, and information on 
former actor Todd Bridges, who has had a number of scrapes with the law. 
Authorities declined to comment on the specific nature of the material found in 
Sullivan's possession, but said it involved the kind of confidential material 
turned up in background checks. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Bentley, who has resigned from the force, did not return calls 
seeking comment. Whiteaker did not respond to a request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, who during his 25 years on the force headed bureaus on the Westside 
and in the San Fernando Valley, has been under investigation by bunco 
detectives for more than a year because of his alleged ties to Bentley, a 
veteran Juvenile Division officer. Sullivan aggressively projected a 
squeaky-clean reputation. "A police officer who accepts a free or reduced-price 
meal is a whore," he said in a 1983 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Sullivan acknowledged knowing Bentley, and said the 
former officer did work for his private investigation firm, getting court 
records and similar publicly accessible information. But he denied paying 
Bentley any money, saying instead that the two "did favors" for each other, 
which he described as a common practice between the police and private eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have a common community," Sullivan said. "We help each other." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is that level of cooperation that worries police and prosecutors, who 
say they are becoming increasingly concerned about confidential information 
being sold or bartered by police to private detectives. At least one Los 
Angeles police detective has been convicted in recent years for selling such 
information to a private eye, and a Police Commission staffer was suspended for 
10 days in 1992 for using LAPD computers without authorization to get 
confidential data on political figures and celebrities. From 1988 to 1992, in 
fact, at least 66 sworn officers and civilian personnel were disciplined for 
similar misuse of department computers. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal investigation is also under way to determine whether LAPD 
officials compiled confidential information about residents and turned it over 
to the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 Such allegations have dogged the department for years. More than a decade ago, 
it was forced to dismantle its controversial Public Disorder Intelligence 
Division, after it was revealed that a detective in the unit kept files at his 
home and made them available to an ultra-conservative group. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, hidden cameras watched as Bentley received requests from the two 
private investigation companies, ran the names of nearly 500 people and 
companies through department computers and relayed that information back, 
according to search warrants filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 When arrested last summer, Bentley had more than $100,000 in cash hidden in a 
safe, and child pornography that authorities allege he stole from locked police 
evidence vaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley, 47, already has been charged with illegally possessing child 
pornography. He resigned from the department earlier this year, on the same day 
he was to face internal departmental hearings that would have put him on trial 
publicly for a host of sweeping misconduct charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan is scheduled to be arraigned June 24. He and Whiteaker each were 
charged with 10 counts of receiving criminal records, which are confidential 
materials, and one count each of conspiracy to receive criminal history 
materials. If convicted, they each face a maximum of 5 1/2 years in prison and 
$11,000 in fines. Bentley was charged with 11 felony counts of illegal computer 
access and fraud, and faces a maximum of six years in state prison if 
convicted.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; BROWN MAINTAINS COURSE ON VICTORY FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her borrowed campaign plane had been grounded by mechanical problems, but 
Kathleen Brown wasn't ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 As her entourage -- including her husband, Van Gordon Sauter, and her son, Zeb 
-- waited in the Fresno airport to board a new plane, the state treasurer got 
on the phone. She had fund-raising to do. But first, she owed one very 
important supporter a call: Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do need your help. . . . You, Tipper and Hillary -- you guys are big 
draws," she told Gore, who had called to congratulate her on winning the 
Democratic nomination for governor. "This is going to be a tough race, but I'm 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Before a broken wing flap cut short her two-day victory fly-around, Brown 
managed to deliver that same self-confident message in five cities. Whether she 
was touring a San Jose high school or sipping coffee in a Modesto living room, 
Brown hit again and again on a theme she unveiled on election night: "Restoring 
the California Promise." 
</P>
<P>
 And at every opportunity, she tried to distinguish herself from Gov. Pete 
Wilson, whom she accused of "blaming, bullying and bashing" to get reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a choice," she told about 200 students and faculty members at Fresno 
City College, "between the politics of yesterday and the politics of tomorrow, 
between the politics of fear and hate and the politics of putting the state and 
our people back together again. Tell Pete Wilson his time is up!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday began in San Francisco, where Brown and her family had spent the 
previous evening, including dinner with Brown's brother, former Gov. Jerry 
Brown. Even at 7:30 a.m., the sun was hot, and as the plane lifted off, Brown's 
husband announced that there was someplace else he'd rather be going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to Jackson Hole!" joked Sauter, an outspoken Republican who is an 
executive with Fox TV. "We could start a beachhead there for Kathleen." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown rolled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Connell's husband said he was going fishing," she said, referring to 
the Democratic nominee for state controller. "When he heard that, my husband 
got restless." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sauter -- natty with suspenders and a pocket handkerchief -- played his 
part. When the plane arrived at the Modesto airport, Brown introduced Sauter as 
"my Republican supporter that I have converted to the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Sauter corrected: "I'm converted in her case." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown laughed. "I'm getting my votes one by one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the airport, Brown headed to the home of Lee and Lisa Genetti, a police 
officer and a secretary, who had invited two other young couples over to meet 
Brown. When the candidate arrived, with a horde of reporters in tow, she asked 
the group to describe the California they had grown up in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safe," said Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to not lock our doors at night," said Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opportunity," said Paula Schmidt, a college professor who has been able to 
find only part-time work. "My parents were able to buy a home. We're looking at 
10 years before we can buy a home." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a struggle," said Todd Leonard, an accountant. "It's tough to go out to 
dinner once a month. There's just no money left." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown nodded, and offered a few observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There (used to be) a sense of personal responsibility," she said. "We had to 
work hard and play by the rules. If you did that, there would be opportunity. 
It was a contract. But that contract is broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the media and Brown's staff, only six voters actually heard Brown's 
message in person in Modesto -- the Genettis and two other couples. But the 
cozy setting played to Brown's strong suit: connecting with people one on one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safe streets, good schools, new jobs -- if the fly-around was any indication, 
these are the buttons that Brown will push between now and the general election 
in November.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, when she stopped at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Jose, Brown 
was greeted by a crowd of third- and fourth-graders from a nearby elementary 
school. As Brown stepped off her campaign bus, the children cheered and waved 
hand-drawn American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's going to be the next governor of California?" Brown called out to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You!" they screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this crowd," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the high school's multimedia computer labs, students showed her 
high-tech projects ranging from synthesized music programs to animation and 
interactive resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the displays, Neil Uhl's caught Brown's eye. The 17-year-old junior had 
called up a full-color image of Wilson on a TV monitor. Under Wilson's face, a 
headline read, "Our Old Governor." At the touch of Uhl's computer keyboard, 
Wilson's face contorted and transformed into a picture of Brown with a new 
headline: "Our Next Governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was ecstatic. "I've been morphed, " she said, using the jargon for the 
process Uhl had demonstrated. Then she urged Uhl and his fellow technologically 
minded classmates to "stay in California. We need you."

A DEADLY FIRST FISHING TRIP; CRIME: MAN KILLED IN BIG BEAR WAS A MECHANIC AND

SLEEP ON HIS FIRST ANGLING EXCURSION.

 Their families had been next-door neighbors and close friends in Armenia, and 
the Gumuryan brothers thought it would be a relaxing break to take Armen 
Shakhkaramyan to Big Bear on a fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't even have a chance to say any last words," Shakhkaramyan's grieving 
brother, Sarkis, said Thursday, struggling to make sense of his brother's 
slaying. "I just don't understand. They gave them the money, and they shot them 
anyway. Armen was asleep, and then he was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Armen Shakhkaramyan, 47, a plumber and mechanic from Moscow, was killed 
Wednesday and one of his friends was wounded when a gunman fired into their 
station wagon after robbing two of the four men who had gone to Big Bear Lake 
together, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhkaramyan and his three friends went to the picturesque resort to fish and 
had parked their station wagon along the lake shore, waiting for sunrise, when 
they were assaulted, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkis Aylozlan, 28, of North Hollywood was shot in the torso and was listed 
in good condition Thursday at Loma Linda University Medical Center. Khachic 
Gumuryan, 28, and his brother, Nazar Gumuryan, 36, of Van Nuys, were unhurt in 
the attack, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachic Gumuryan said Shakhkaramyan and Aylozlan were asleep in the station 
wagon when they were attacked by two assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Thursday that they are seeking three men who were given a 
ride down the mountain after crashing a white Buick that was used in the 
robbery and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide detectives have found someone who gave three occupants of the 
suspect vehicle a ride down the hill into the San Bernardino area," said Deputy 
Laurie Savage, a San Bernardino County sheriff's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 She said about 30 investigators are working around the clock and will keep 
going until "they either run out of leads or make an arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkis Shakhkaramyan of Montebello said his brother has a wife and two 
teen-age children in Moscow, and the family plans to ship his body to Russia 
for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Another brother, Sogomon Shakhkaramyan of North Hollywood, said only the 
killer can say why his brother was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I answer his children?" Sogomon said. "Who is going to take care of 
them now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Armen Shakhkaramyan, a Russian citizen who had been in the country about a 
year, divided his time between his two brothers' homes, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was making his first fishing trip with the Gumuryan brothers, who are avid 
fishermen, when he was killed, Sogomon Shakhkaramyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men left Tuesday night, parked and set up a camp where they barbecued 
steak and ate tomatoes and cheese, Sogomon Shakhkaramyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they had no luck fishing, they went back to their station wagon to sleep 
about 11:30 p.m., he said. They had planned to get up early to fish before 
returning to Los Angeles about 8 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachic Gumuryan said a man came to the car between 4 and 4:30 a.m. and put a 
gun to his brother Nazar's head, demanding his wallet. His brother handed over 
his wallet, which had no money in it, and the gunman left, Gumuryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gunman returned a few seconds later and fired into the car, shooting 
out the window next to Gumuryan, who said he then offered the assailant his 
wallet. But the gunman did not take the wallet and fired into the car again, 
Gumuryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylozlan then shouted that his leg was hurt, and Gumuryan shouted, "Armen, 
Armen!" There was no answer, and they thought Shakhkaramyan was still asleep, 
Gumuryan said. But they then saw blood in the corner of Armen Shakhkaramyan's 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 After summoning police, Gumuryan returned to the scene with officers who told 
him that Shakhkaramyan was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumuryan said he likes the United States. But he can't sleep now. "Every time 
I'm about to sleep, I think somebody is going to shoot me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After blasting a hole in one side of the station wagon, the gunman fled, 
Deputy Savage said. The California Highway Patrol reported the crash of the 
assailants' car shortly afterward, about five miles from the shooting on a 
winding stretch of California 18 that leads to Green Valley Lake. The vehicle, 
a white Buick registered to a Fontana man, was found abandoned with one of the 
victims' wallets inside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the kindest man," said Armen Shakhkaramyan's niece Tamara, 18. "He 
wouldn't harm anybody. He would try to help everybody. If someone needed help 
with their car, he would run." 
</P>
<P>
 Big Bear residents had trouble Thursday recalling the last homicide in their 
community. One woman said she seemed to remember one about six years ago, but 
she wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stuff like this doesn't happen in Big Bear," said Cliff Fowler, owner of Big 
Bear Sporting Goods. "We watch the evening news and say, 'Aren't we lucky?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the Alpine Restaurant on Big Bear Boulevard, waitress Donna Douglas said 
the robbery and murder had patrons worried that "the same kind of violence 
that's down the hill is coming up to Big Bear." 
</P>
<P>
 But others are convinced that the suspects are not locals who live year-round 
in the resort area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The news hasn't said anything about this being done by people from down the 
hill," said a woman at Big Bear Marina who requested anonymity. "It's upsetting 
that this could happen in a community as safe as this is, but it hasn't 
shattered our tranquillity. This is a freak accident up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said Big Bear residents know they "live in God's country," where the 
peaceful lifestyle can sometimes be taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting, which came just weeks before the summer tourist season, was 
similar to one May 16 in the San Jacinto Mountains near Idyllwild that claimed 
the life of a woman visiting from Germany. Her husband was seriously injured by 
assailants after the couple pulled over at a scenic turnout. Authorities said 
the motive was robbery.

SCHOOL COMPLIES WITH ORDER TO READMIT BOY, 6; EDUCATION: PARENTS ON BOTH SIDES 
OF THE ISSUE PROTEST. DISTRICT HAD REMOVED HIM, SAYING HE WAS DISRUPTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Six-year-old Jimmy Peters returned to Circle View Elementary School on 
Thursday as the campus erupted in protest over whether the special education 
student, whom school officials have called violent and disruptive, should be 
allowed to share a kindergarten classroom with other students. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after a federal judge ordered the school to readmit Jimmy, the boy and 
his father were greeted by three-dozen sign-waving parents on both sides of the 
issue who had camped out for three hours to protest or support the child's 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six adults entered the classroom and removed their children when 
Jimmy and his father, Jim Peters, arrived on campus at 10:45 a.m. Other parents 
kept their children home, according to organizers of Thursday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle View Principal Dan Moss said 14 of the 31 children enrolled in the 
class did not attend school Thursday -- 12 because of Jimmy's presence. 
Twenty-one students in other grades were kept home in protest as well, he said. 
Most were siblings of Jimmy's classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Three police officers were stationed on school grounds to keep order as 
reporters hovered just beyond a fence near the child, who turned his back and 
ate a bag of potato chips in the midst of the commotion just beyond the fence 
around the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made him out to be a monster," said Debbie Hoops, a parent of a 
special education student in another school district who was on hand to support 
Jimmy. "This is hysteria. Mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmy's detractors were equally adamant. "If we didn't think our children 
were in danger, we wouldn't be doing this," said Pam Walker, who withdrew her 
child from Jimmy's class Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge on Wednesday rejected the Ocean View School District's request 
that Jimmy be indefinitely barred from the classroom, ruling that injuries he 
had allegedly caused to other children and staff members were not serious 
enough to warrant his exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 After filing the first lawsuit of its kind in Orange County on May 25, the 
Ocean View School District in Huntington Beach ordered Jimmy temporarily 
removed from class, alleging that he had kicked and bitten other students and 
his teacher, and that he disrupted the learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 His teacher and an instructional aide have both taken medical leave as a 
result of the stress of trying to teach Jimmy, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have said they resorted to the lawsuit only after Peters 
refused to voluntarily transfer his son to a special education class. They have 
declined to reveal Jimmy's disability but said he has some characteristics of 
autism. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, who acknowledges that his son has a communicative disability, disputes 
the allegations of violence and says his child is not autistic. He said the 
school district has been magnifying his son's behavior problems and that he has 
hired an attorney to fight the school district's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's case has attracted widespread attention in Orange County, 
especially among parents and advocates for special education students, who 
increasingly are demanding that their children be allowed to remain in 
mainstream classrooms, a movement known as "full inclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1975 federal law mandates that disabled children be educated in the "least 
restrictive environment," and has increasingly led to mainstreaming in regular 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Tracy Pellman said trustees have never discussed 
Jimmy's situation in detail, but she expressed sympathy for parents of his 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that not all students were considered in (federal Judge Matthew 
Byrne's) decision," she said. "It's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 During his first day back, Jimmy spent 40 minutes in the classroom and went 
for 20 minutes of speech therapy. Moss said he did not know how Jimmy spent the 
rest of the day or how he adjusted to his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide hired by the district to help Jimmy throughout the morning was on duty 
Thursday. Jim Peters spent the entire session with his son and plans to attend 
school with Jimmy every day until the school year ends Thursday.

BILLIONAIRE FUNDS NEW THINK TANK; RESEARCH: WILLIAM R. HEWLETT PLEDGES $70 
MILLION FOR INSTITUTE TO STUDY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES.

<P>
 Billionaire William R. Hewlett, one of the wealthiest men in America, will 
donate $70 million to create a public policy institute to study California 
issues, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan foundation will be known as the Public Policy Institute of 
California and will be immediately propelled by Hewlett's endowment into the 
front line of think tanks studying the state and its policies. 
</P>

 "California's future depends in large part on the quality of its public policy 
and the debate which underlies that policy," Hewlett said in announcing the 
gift. "This state is larger and more complex than many nations. It needs a 
private institution that can do objective, sophisticated policy analysis, 
without fear or favor, and report it effectively to citizens and policy 
makers." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement said the institute will not take positions on policy matters, 
but will attempt to provide information and analysis that will help state 
officials reach decisions on key issues.  
</P>
<P>
 The new organization will be located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its 
president will be David Lyon, currently RAND's corporate vice president for 
external affairs. Former UC Berkeley Chancellor Roger Heyns will serve as 
chairman of the board.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Public Policy Institute of California will generate facts, figures and 
objective analyses that both leaders and citizenry can weigh in making their 
policy choices," Heyns said in a statement Thursday. "It will not itself make 
policy, but it should help Californians to make better policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Public policy experts hailed the creation of the institute, calling the 
endowment substantial and expressing hope that the work produced will fill a 
void created by massive cuts in the budget of the state's own legislative 
analyst. Historically, the legislative analyst's office provided objective 
analyses of state budget and policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this sounds very significant for California, and very positive as 
well," said Lee Friedman, associate dean of UC Berkeley's graduate school of 
public policy. "With state budget cuts, there has been a big gap in the 
impartial analysis of what we're doing in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman added: "If this is truly going to be an objective institute, that's 
great, because we don't have much like it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the endowment of $70 million, the institute could have an initial 
operating budget of $3 million to $4 million annually, Lyon said Thursday. By 
contrast, the Santa Monica-based RAND think tank has an endowment of about $60 
million and an annual operating budget of more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon said the California think tank would be modeled on the Brookings 
Institute, a venerable independent research organization based in Washington. 
The Brookings Institute has a larger endowment -- about $100 million -- but 
that was built over many decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to build an endowment," Lyon noted, "and it's another to start 
with one this size. What it allows us to do is avoid becoming immediately 
involved in fund raising. We can prove ourselves first before going out and 
building a larger budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the institute has not yet set a research agenda, Lyon said it will 
initially focus on "the interplay between public finance and governance." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that the resiliency of the state tax base in a changing economy . 
. . is well worth our attention in the first six or nine months," he said. The 
state's growth and changing demographics will also be top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewlett, 80, joined David Packard to found the Silicon Valley electronics 
giant Hewlett-Packard in a garage. Last year, Hewlett helped finance a lawsuit 
by the Sierra Club to fight logging at Squaw Valley. Packard has used some of 
his wealth to build the Monterey Aquarium and finance marine research.

SUPPORT SOUGHT FOR '3 STRIKES' ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and the father of murder victim 
Polly Klaas called on Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature on Thursday to put 
an alternative "three strikes and you're out" proposal on the Nov. 2 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson, who in March signed legislation identical to the "three strikes" 
ballot initiative that has already qualified, promptly announced that he would 
veto any such bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is wrong to weaken the 'three strikes' measure," Wilson told 
reporters at a Republican Party gathering. "That's exactly what those folks are 
aiming to do, that's the whole purpose of (the second ballot measure) effort. I 
will not participate in the weakening of the 'three strikes' law." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's warning of a veto dimmed hopes for what supporters contend would be a 
more effective but less costly alternative to the first "three strikes" 
initiative, sponsored by Fresno photographer Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was 
slain by a repeat felon. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief element of the alternative, which has not been written into bill 
form, would send criminals to prison for 25 years to life if their third felony 
was a violent act. The "three strikes" initiative that already qualified for 
the ballot requires that the third offense be a serious felony but not 
necessarily a violent one. Under either measure, the first two strikes can be 
serious or violent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, given the Legislature's tough-on-crime mood in this election year, it 
seems unlikely that an incumbent in a contested race would run the risk of 
being perceived as soft on crime by supporting an option to the "three strikes" 
law and ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) conceded that Senate 
Democrats were split over whether to try to draft a modification of the 
original law. GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said most Republicans oppose 
putting a second "three strikes" plan on the ballot because it would confuse 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer, who has been sampling opinion for the last two months on enacting 
some form of alternative and testing law enforcement support, told reporters 
that no consensus had developed.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti and Marc Klaas, the father of Polly, whose abduction from her home 
and slaying last year propelled the "three strikes" initiative to qualify for 
the ballot, contended that the proposed option would be less costly and would 
target violent felons instead of bad check writers, home burglars and other 
nonviolent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference called to muster support for an alternative, Klaas noted 
that he originally backed the "three strikes" ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the depth of despair which all Californians shared with my family 
immediately following Polly's murder, we blindly supported the . . . initiative 
in the mistaken belief that it dealt only with violent crimes," Klaas said. 
"Instead, three out of the four crimes it addresses are not violent." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, who reported his office has filed more than 400 "three strikes" 
cases since Wilson signed the bill that mirrors the "three strikes" initiative, 
warned that there may not be sufficient funds to bring all of them to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the taxpayers of California decide how their tax dollars are spent in 
prosecuting violent criminals," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said prosecutors are given discretion under the current "three 
strikes" law to waive a "third strike" felony when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corrections estimates that the "three strikes" law 
signed by Wilson would lead to a boom in construction of 20 prisons in the next 
few years and add $2 billion annually in operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti and other supporters of the alternative asserted that restricting the 
third strike to violent felons by exempting burglars and other nonviolent 
offenders would dramatically reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter criticism that the alternative would weaken the "three strikes" 
law, sponsors wrote into it toughened provisions for dealing with sex crimes, 
including 15 years to life for a first conviction of forcible child 
molestation. Current law provides a term of three to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and legislative sponsors of the "three strikes" law that Wilson 
signed held a news conference to denounce the alternative plan. "Voters have a 
choice in November. They can vote for ('three strikes') or they can vote 
against it," said Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno).

SEISMOLOGY; BOLIVIA'S 'BIG ONE' A BREAK FOR SCIENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake that occurred 400 miles underneath Bolivia on Wednesday night, 
and was felt thousands of miles north in Canada, was upgraded by scientists 
Thursday to at least a magnitude 8.2 and called a unique opportunity for study 
of Earth's structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroo Kanamori, director of the Caltech Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena, 
said the quake was possibly the strongest of its kind this century and that it 
indicated the interior of Earth may be very heterogeneous, with some regions 
capable of propagating earthquake waves more efficiently for great distances 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake occurred in one of the world's most seismically potent deep 
subduction zones, stretching along the eastern edge of the great Andes mountain 
range from Colombia through Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 A subduction zone is an area where one of the great tectonic plates floating 
on the surface of Earth's mantle is pushing under another. Periodic great 
quakes are associated with this phenomenon, as is volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as UC San Diego geophysicist Guy Masters noted Thursday, "Such events are 
reasonably benign as earthquakes go." Masters and other scientists said that 
the reason the great quake caused no major damage anywhere and no reported 
casualties was that it was so far beneath the surface that it was quite distant 
from any human habitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having an 8-point earthquake in San Francisco and feeling it in 
L.A.," said Joel Ita, a research associate at Caltech. "Being 400 miles away, 
it wouldn't do any appreciable damage here, even if it was that big." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a similarly sized quake, forecast to occur at some time in the 
much more shallow subduction zone off the coast of Washington, Oregon and 
Northern California, would be closer to the surface and prove far more 
destructive, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an analysis prepared for The Times, Ita noted that past observations that 
deep quakes appear similar to more shallow ones, despite scientists' belief 
that there are no faults at such depths, "has long confounded seismologists." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem lies in the fact that at the pressures that the (deep) 
earthquakes occur, the rocks should flow like Silly Putty in response to 
changes in stress and strain, instead of breaking in a brittle way" as occurs 
with faults near the surface, he said. So the deep quakes should be 
fundamentally different than the shallow ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Ita said recent experiments indicate that rather than the brittle fractures 
that take place along fault lines close to the surface, the material in the 
deep subduction zones "actually collapses on itself in a manner exactly 
opposite of such cracks." The 400-Mile-Deep Quake 
</P>
<P>
 The quake lightly damaged buildings as far south as Sao Paulo, Brazil, and was 
felt as far north as Toronto. There were also reports of tremors in California 
and throughout the Midwest. The quake occurred in a zone far beneath Earth's 
surface. This had the odd effect of increasing the temblor's range while 
reducing its destructiveness.

SPORTS; TED TURNER TAKES THE RAP FOR ILLS OF ST. PETERSBURG; RUSSIA'S CZARIST 
CAPITAL PREPARES TO HOST GOODWILL GAMES HE SPONSORS. THE USUAL CHAOS IS EVEN 
WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You're stuck in traffic. Or your paycheck is late. Or you've noticed that 
lately, when the sun goes down, it gets really dark. Who or what is responsible 
for this madness? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a citizen of St. Petersburg, chances are you blame Ted Turner and 
the 1994 Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, the founder of Cable News Network, created the Goodwill Games in 1986 
after politically inspired boycotts kept apart athletes from the United States 
and the Soviet Union. The 1986 games, held in Moscow, and the 1990 games in 
Seattle both had disappointing TV ratings, and Turner lost millions. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the host city -- St. Petersburg this year -- the games are an enormous 
cash gift. A post-event study in Seattle suggested the games brought $150 
million into the local economy. Moreover, the relentlessly positive TV coverage 
of the host city that accompanies such a sporting event usually guarantees a 
tourism boom for the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this would be welcome in St. Petersburg. The local government is 
running an enormous deficit, while foreign tourists -- frightened by crime 
stories in the Western press -- are pushing the czarist capital farther down 
their list of vacation destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 So most Petersburgers support the games. But that doesn't stop their 
complaining. Preparations for the games have turned life upside-down in this 
city of 5 million. Long-overdue road repairs have created downtown traffic 
snarls and brought curses to the lips of many a cabdriver. Shabby palaces and 
buildings are getting shiny new facades. But the improvements are often derided 
as rushed "Potemkin villages" -- a reference to the fake villages Grigory 
Potemkin erected to fool his lover, Empress Catherine the Great, into admiring 
the prosperity of his lands. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed preparations for the games' July 23 opening, city leaders have called 
in the army: privates shouldering shovels are a common sight these days. Mayor 
Anatoly Sobchak -- the games' most ardent supporter -- has also reinstituted 
the Communist tradition of subbotniki , or volunteer Saturdays. Most of the 
volunteerism is coerced: Sobchak has threatened harsh fines for businesses 
whose workers aren't raking leaves or sweeping streets by 8 a.m. every 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to ruining weekends, the games are being cursed for much of the 
usual chaos of Russian life. Government paychecks and student stipends often 
arrive months late here -- an old phenomenon, but in St. Petersburg it has a 
new twist: Suddenly the games are to blame, on grounds that they have emptied 
local coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, when city officials turned off street lights, plunging St. Petersburg 
into darkness -- the games were again to blame. Len Svet, the local electrical 
company, hoped a month without street lights would save 80 million rubles 
(roughly $40,000), but it made life after sunset frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even see the cars, much less the license plates," fretted Capt. 
Nikolai Kuznetsov of the auto police, sitting glumly in a parked Ford on 
pitch-black Moskovsky Prospekt, the city's main north-south road. "They're 
saving every kopeck for these Goodwill Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Sobchak, meanwhile, complain that the games will be fine sport 
but the city will be left with the bill. As the Russian Communist Workers Party 
sees it -- ignoring Turner's pledge to spend $70 million on the games, about 
two-thirds of the cost -- Sobchak is using public money to throw a party for 
foreigners. "Mayor Sobchak is spending billions of rubles that could be better 
spent in our times," said Viktor Tyulkin, the party's chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Party worries about trees being cut down to widen playing fields, 
and wonders if worthy environmental programs will lose funding to track and 
field events. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's AIDS. The city's chief epidemiologist, Aza Rakhmanova, holds 
that the arrival of 80,000 foreign tourists will be -- in the words of the 
daily newspaper Smena -- "the spark that ignites AIDS" in Russia. "Too many 
people are coming, and you can't check them all (for AIDS) beforehand," 
Rakhmanova said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said thousands of condoms would be flown in from Canada and distributed 
free -- possibly with each morning newspaper -- to prepare locals for 
spontaneous physical expressions of goodwill. What Games Offer

TOUCHING STORY ENDS IN CASE OF ATTEMPTED MURDER

<P>
 As a journalist, he wrote the wrenching story of a mother's struggle to raise 
a daughter with Down's syndrome. Now there is more to the story. Police say the 
two became lovers, and that he tried to kill her sleeping husband as she 
watched with a baseball bat in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Frazier has been charged in a plot with Lisa Whedbee to kill John 
Whedbee with a butcher knife early Wednesday. Later in the day, Whedbee filed 
for divorce and a restraining order against his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just so sordid," said Dwight Van de Vate, a Knox County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, lifestyles editor at the Oak Ridger in Oak Ridge, won an award for 
his 1993 Mother's Day story about the Whedbees and their 4-year-old daughter, 
Brittany, who is mentally retarded and bedridden since suffering a stroke in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier and the Whedbees attended Trinity United Methodist Church. She sang in 
the choir. Frazier, himself married, played the organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say she also may have been trapped in an abusive marriage and 
turned to Frazier for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Mrs. Whedbee let Frazier into her Knoxville-area home and they 
waited until her husband came home and went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee, 33, an insurance agent, said he awoke to find a man standing over him 
with a butcher knife and struggled with him. Mrs. Whedbee stood by with a 
baseball bat and did nothing when her husband called for help, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee broke free, grabbed the bat and ran. Police say he later identified 
his attacker as Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, 32, was charged with attempted murder and remained in custody 
Thursday in lieu of $50,000 bond. Mrs. Whedbee, 31, was charged with conspiracy 
to commit murder and released on $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week ago, Mrs. Whedbee obtained a protective order against her 
husband that allowed him to remain in the house. She claimed her husband of 
nearly 12 years had threatened and beaten her, but they agreed to try to work 
out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier told police he knew nothing about the attack, Van de Vate said. But 
Mrs. Whedbee "has been willing to talk to authorities," Van de Vate said, 
without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Esser, publisher of the Oak Ridger, a small afternoon newspaper 25 miles 
west of Knoxville, had no comment except to confirm that Frazier is still an 
employee. Frazier's article about the Whedbee family won the 1994 Malcolm Law 
Memorial Award for feature writing from the Tennessee Associated Press Managing 
Editors.

U.S., WESTERN ALLIES URGE RUSSIA TO COOPERATE MILITARILY, OPEN DIALOGUE; 
EUROPE: NATO SEES SOUND RELATIONS AS 'A KEY ELEMENT FOR SECURITY AND 
STABILITY.' BUT INVITATION FALLS SHORT OF MOSCOW'S DEMANDS FOR WIDER ROLE. 
</P>

<P>
 As part of their efforts to build a new, post-Cold War relationship with 
Moscow, the United States and its European allies Thursday urged Russia to 
immediately join a program of military cooperation and begin an extensive 
political dialogue with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good, cooperative relations between NATO and Russia will be a key element for 
security and stability in Europe," stated a communique issued after a meeting 
here of the foreign ministers from the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign ministers stopped far short of Moscow's demand for a formal 
consultative role in Western Alliance affairs -- something that many believe 
would have dangerous implications, including opening the door to de facto 
Russian veto powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has already declared that it wants to participate in the military 
cooperation program, known as "Partnership for Peace." The program offers such 
things as joint maneuvers, closer high- and mid-level contact and technical 
assistance in weapons development and procurement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was launched earlier this year, 20 non-NATO nations, including most 
of Moscow's onetime Communist allies, have joined. 
</P>
<P>
 But partly because of Russia's desire to gain a degree of influence over NATO 
decision-making and partly because of internal domestic pressures from 
conservative hard-liners, Moscow has demanded special treatment as the price of 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
S. Grachev talked of the need for a broad dialogue with the alliance on 
European issues from nuclear non-proliferation to the environment. Other 
Russian officials have subsequently pressed NATO for a special protocol to 
formalize this dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a constructive working relationship with Moscow on security 
issues is considered one of the most important, yet difficult challenges 
currently facing the Western allies. They must create a link that does not 
alienate Russia again from the mainstream of European events. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, analysts say the relationship should not permit 
Moscow to bend events to its will, as it did after the Allies gave Stalin a 
free hand in Eastern Europe at the ill-fated Yalta Conference in early 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to ease concerns of the Central and Eastern European countries, 
which only five years ago were part of the Soviet empire, NATO Deputy Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino rejected the idea that cooperation would lead to what 
he called "a Yalta II." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has underscored that, despite its 
internal economic chaos and for all its domestic political turmoil, Russia 
remains a major power with considerable influence -- even when its nuclear 
missiles are not at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an urgent necessity to build the Russians into the European security 
system and fully clear that a power this size has to be handled differently 
than Iceland," said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.  
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday's communique, described by one senior U.S. official as NATO's 
answer to Grachev, offered Moscow only an informal dialogue "in appropriate 
areas outside the Partnership for Peace," and pointedly reaffirmed "NATO's 
right to take its own decisions on its own responsibility by consensus of its 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference after Thursday's meeting, Balanzino stressed the 
informality of the proposed political discussions. "Political consultations 
(with Russia) would be on a case-by-case basis on matters of mutual concern," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Balanzino said no details of the proposed consultations were discussed at 
Thursday's meeting. But a British official close to the talks listed nuclear 
safety, counter-proliferation and nuclear cooperation policy as potential 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the West's 
military relations with Russia would be based on a simple formula: "No vetoes 
by Russia, no surprises sprung from the West and substantial cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 A NATO ultimatum in February to Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw from Sarajevo 
or be bombed surprised, angered and embarrassed Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin and temporarily complicated the West's efforts to cooperate with Moscow 
to bring an end to the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's initial reaction to the NATO offer could come almost immediately. 
Moscow's foreign minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, was scheduled to hold talks here 
Thursday night and today with Balanzino, and a Kozyrev meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of any offer of a formal political dialogue, Christopher 
urged Moscow to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement, describing it as, 
"the major strategic development in Europe since NATO was formed." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said they hope the communique's positive tone toward Moscow 
will make up for the lack of substance. "It is good, warm language, a positive 
signal that will allow Kozyrev and people like him to come to Brussels and 
sign," a British official said. "We hope this will give him enough to say to 
those in Moscow, 'The hand's extended; let's shake it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Besides dealing with Russia, the NATO communique reaffirms the alliance 
commitments in Bosnia, including enforcing a "no-fly" zone over the former 
Yugoslav republic.

 A soldier angry that his girlfriend left him rode a tank through the streets 
of Vienna, demolishing 20 cars, a bus and power lines, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the 22-year-old serviceman, identified only as Gerhard M., 
got drunk Wednesday and stole an M-60 tank from an Austrian army barracks at 
Zwoelfaxing, about 10 miles east of Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier drove to Vienna, leaving a trail of destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 He ignored warning shots from police but surrendered after a police tank 
forced him to crash against a concrete pillar beneath a downtown bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier later said that he had been upset after a quarrel with his 
girlfriend and took the tank because he wanted to go home.

9 PRIESTS AMONG 72 SLAIN IN NEW RWANDA MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another massacre. The word has come to symbolize the Rwandan conflict. This 
time it involves nine Roman Catholic priests and 63 others killed in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said Thursday that it had received reliable reports of a 
massacre that occurred late Monday or early Tuesday in the Nyamirambo district 
of the city, a southwestern quarter now the scene of heavy fighting. It was not 
clear whether rebel or government troops carried out the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The news came just a day after Rwandan rebel radio reported that 13 other 
Rwandan clergymen, including the Roman Catholic archbishop of Kigali and two 
bishops, were killed by four rebel soldiers assigned to guard them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are also very, very concerned by what happened," said Col. Frank 
Mugambage, a rebel leader, referring to the incident near Kabgayi, 30 miles 
west of Kigali. "We are ready to admit it was done by some of our misguided 
soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Mugambage said many of his men were recruited from among families affected by 
the recent massacres in Rwanda and because many of the mass killings have 
occurred in churches, some may associate the church with the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 He said one of the soldiers was shot and killed by other rebel guards and 
three others fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II said he was "profoundly upset" by the Kabgayi massacre, and 
prayed that the victims find in heaven "the peace that their well-loved land 
denied them." The Vatican did not comment on the deaths in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 500,000 people have died since the Rwandan civil war erupted anew April 
6, following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in a 
mysterious plane crash. The conflict is both political and ethnic, involving 
historic animosities between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims of the civil war have been civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Government-trained Hutu militiamen have been responsible for most of the 
massacres, often supported by government soldiers.

COLOMBIA DECLARES EMERGENCY; QUAKE TOLL MAY BE 1,000

<P>
 President Cesar Gaviria declared a state of emergency Thursday in the remote 
mountain valley devastated by an earthquake and avalanche after government 
officials said the tragedy had claimed up to 1,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials appealed for donations of clothes, blankets and kitchen 
utensils to help thousands of refugees who lost their homes and farms in 
Monday's disaster in the poor and mainly Indian Paez River valley, about 180 
miles southwest of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 The catastrophe was Colombia's worst natural disaster since the 1985 eruption 
of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano, which buried the town of Armero, killing 
23,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The official death toll from the 6.4-magnitude quake stood at 253, but Omar 
Dario Cardona, director of the National Disaster Prevention Office, said at his 
emergency operations center in the southern city of Neiva that the full number 
of dead may never be known because "a lot of survivors have buried their family 
members on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 His assistant, Juan Manuel Uribe, said in Bogota that "from what we are seeing 
and given the difficulty of finding a lot of people, we can't rule out the 
possibility that the number of victims is higher than 1,000."

CHRISTOPHER PREDICTS U.N. APPROVAL OF N. KOREAN SANCTIONS; DIPLOMACY: HE VOICES 
OPTIMISM DESPITE RELUCTANCE BY CHINA AND JAPAN ABOUT IMPOSING ECONOMIC 
RESTRAINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite signals of reluctance from China and Japan about imposing economic 
sanctions on North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher predicted 
Thursday that such punitive measures would win approval if they come before the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proceeding firmly and deliberately to seek sanctions in the U.N. 
Security Council, and I think they can be achieved," he said at a news 
conference after a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign 
ministers here. 
</P>
<P>
 The official American optimism followed China's rebuff Thursday of a South 
Korean appeal for sanctions against Pyongyang for failing to allow inspections 
of its nuclear facilities. The appeal came after talks between South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the officials agreed that the Korean Peninsula should be 
nuclear-free, the Chinese have insisted that sanctions would lead to an 
unwanted escalation of tensions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not agree on sanctions, for sanctions would only serve to push the 
opposing sides into confrontation with one another and result in a situation 
that no one would like to see," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry urged patience and further negotiations -- 
outside the United Nations -- among key players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in favor of the involvement of the U.N. Security Council in this 
issue," Shen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beijing did not indicate whether it was prepared to use its U.N. veto if a 
resolution is formally put to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In Istanbul, Christopher said he drew a distinction between what the Chinese 
prefer and what they would do in the event of a U.N. sanctions vote, indicating 
that he thought they might abstain if other Security Council members supported 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more here than exists on the surface of some of the statements being 
made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one of many indications of the fragile, fluid state of diplomacy on the 
North Korean controversy, Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci 
sounded less optimistic in testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a series of consultations with key players in the crisis this week, he 
conceded that the United States could not predict how China would vote on a 
U.N. economic embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea also upped the ante Thursday by threatening Japan with war, if 
Tokyo supported sanctions. This was North Korea's apparent attempt to divide 
key players in the dispute. North Korea would regard Japanese support "as a 
declaration of war and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment," 
the official Korean Central News Agency warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although North Korea has generally threatened war in the event an 
international sanctions resolution is passed, Pyongyang has not threatened 
Japan directly or specifically. Some Japanese cities are within reach of North 
Korean missiles, and Tokyo has expressed concern about possible terrorist 
actions by Koreans living in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Remittances from Korean workers in Japan provide hundreds of millions of 
dollars in foreign exchange for North Korea, making Japanese support for 
sanctions a potentially devastating blow for Pyongyang's already fragile 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea is trying to rattle Japan, which has also been resisting American 
pressure to totally cut off Pyongyang, U.S. officials suggested Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the possibility of Japan wavering, Christopher said, "I have no 
question but that the Japanese understand the importance of sanctions, just as 
we do." 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea on Thursday, President Kim Young Sam talked by telephone to 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Afterward, a Korean presidential 
spokesman said, "Japan believes the nuclear conflict should be resolved through 
negotiations but realizes that because of North Korea's attitude, U.N. 
sanctions are inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Hata is expected to travel to South Korea and possibly China soon for further 
talks on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as former President Jimmy Carter announced that he and 
his wife, Rosalynn, will visit Pyongyang next week for discussions with the 
North Korean government, ostensibly as private citizens with "no official 
status relating to the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said Thursday that Carter had been briefed by the White House 
on the situation involving North Korea, but declined to say whether he had been 
asked to carry out any sort of informal mission. Former Presidents frequently 
are used in such a capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency moved Thursday to suspend 
technical aid to North Korea in light of recent actions that it charged widened 
Pyongyang's violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recommendation from 18 of 35 member countries on the IAEA board of 
governors, the U.N. nuclear regulatory group is expected to vote formally 
today. Suspension would jeopardize the $250,000 that North Korea receives 
annually in technical aid and support for its civilian nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony, Gallucci said a Russian proposal for an international 
conference on nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula might be "useful" in 
resolving the present crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the role and sequence of such a session is still under debate by major 
parties involved in the matter, said a Western diplomat at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has not yet endorsed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, critical negotiations are expected to take place behind the 
scenes after Christopher returns from a 10-day trip to Britain, France and 
Turkey. Western diplomats said they expect the talks to iron out an agreement 
on a framework for action at the United Nations to move the crisis beyond 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, Hata on Thursday told opposition Socialist Party members leaving 
today for a Pyongyang visit that Japan and South Korea would cooperate to raise 
living standards in North Korea, if Pyongyang accepts international inspection 
of its nuclear facilities.

IN SWITCH, DOLE BACKS NORTH AND CONTRIBUTES TO CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four days after snubbing Oliver L. North's candidacy, Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) bestowed an endorsement and a $5,000 campaign contribution on 
his party's nominee for a Senate seat from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Ollie that I will do everything possible to assist in his election to 
the U.S. Senate," Dole said Thursday in a brief statement issued after a 
meeting with North."Including, of course, campaigning for him in Virginia." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's comments marked a change from Sunday, the day after North won his 
party's convention to challenge Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb in November. 
Asked in an interview if Republicans should unite behind North, Dole replied: 
"I think it's going to take a while to sort that out." 
</P>
<P>
 North issued a statement saying he and Dole had a "very productive, cordial 
meeting this morning. I welcome his full support and look forward to having him 
join me on the campaign trail in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 North's campaign office disclosed the $5,000 contribution from Dole's 
political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
 North trails Robb in public opinion polls in a race that shapes up as one of 
the most volatile in the country. Former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and 
former GOP Atty. Gen. J. Marshall Coleman may file as independent candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding North dates from his involvement in the 
Iran-Contra scandal of the Ronald Reagan Administration. As a Marine serving on 
the National Security Council staff, North was a key player in the affair, and 
was later convicted of aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress by 
helping prepare misleading statements for other officials. His conviction was 
set aside on appeal.

NOT A JUDICIAL ACTIVIST, BREYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court nominee Stephen G. Breyer promised the Senate Judiciary 
Committee Thursday that he did not believe in "judicial activism." 
</P>
<P>
 "The judiciary is ill-equipped to make broad-reaching policy determinations," 
the Boston judge said in the standard questionnaire submitted to the committee 
for which he once worked."A judge seeking to solve a general social problem is 
less likely to have available all the relevant facts than a Legislature or 
executive entity," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer and his wife, Joanna, also revealed that they own stocks valued at $2.8 
million, real estate valued at $1.9 million and pension accounts totaling 
$862,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate panel is scheduled to begin hearings on Breyer's confirmation July 
12, and so far no serious controversy has arisen over his nomination. 
Republican senators have been especially effusive in their praise of President 
Clinton's nominee. Last week, the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative 
group, issued an evaluation of Breyer's record and found little to criticize.

RULING BACKS WIDER SCOPE OF CHILD PORN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebuffing efforts by the Justice Department to enforce a new, more lenient 
definition of child pornography, a federal appeals court ruled in a 
Pennsylvania case Thursday that the possession of photographs depicting 
scantily clad children is a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold that . . . non-nude visual depictions can qualify as lascivious 
exhibitions" and therefore can be deemed illegal child pornography, the U.S. 
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals said. The ruling reinstates the conviction of 
Stephen Knox, a Pennsylvania man who bought several videos of girls 10 to 17 
posed in bathing suits, leotards and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was a setback for the Administration's lawyers, who last fall urged 
the high court to throw out Knox's conviction, arguing that child pornography 
laws govern only depictions of nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Administration's position hailed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have totally rejected the Justice Department's weakened interpretation 
of the law," said Patrick Trueman, the former head of an anti-pornography unit 
in the George Bush Administration and a vocal critic of the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Knox said, however, that they will appeal again to the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frankly disappointed. They (the appellate judges) had to torture the 
meaning of words to get to this result," said Lawrence Stanley, a New York 
lawyer who represented Knox.  
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing that the decision constituted a rejection of the Administration's 
view, Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said: "I can't prejudge what 
we'll say in the future (if the case reaches the high court again). The 3rd 
Circuit opinion may very well be persuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knox case became a cause celebre among conservative groups last fall after 
it reached the Supreme Court on an appeal. Rather than defend the prosecution, 
U.S. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III urged the high court to throw out 
Knox's conviction, arguing that videos which do not contain a "visual depiction 
of genitals" are not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives were infuriated at the change, which they perceived as a 
weakening of child pornography statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Days' recommendation, the high court sent the case back for reconsideration 
by the federal appeals court in Philadelphia.

KEMP SAYS GOP MUST REACH OUT TO MINORITIES; POLITICS: LIKELY 1996 CONTENDER 
DECLARES HE'LL HELP OTHER CANDIDATES BUT ONLY IF THEY ADDRESS RACIAL ISSUES. HE 
REJECTS THE PARTY'S SOUTHERN STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Kemp, likely a strong candidate for the 1996 Republican presidential 
nomination, has told GOP office seekers who want his help this year that he 
will campaign for them only if they actively canvass for votes in minority 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, a former Buffalo congressman who was secretary of housing and urban 
development in the George Bush Administration, is also warning Republicans 
that, unless the GOP begins reaching out to minorities, "we can't win from a 
political standpoint and we can't lead from a moral standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described "bleeding-heart conservative," Kemp appears to be going hard 
against the grain of the predominantly white and conservative Republican 
electorate. He puts racial problems at the top of his agenda and says that they 
underlie almost all of the nation's major social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other potential Republican candidates have paid little or no attention to 
racial problems. And GOP Chairman Haley Barbour, commenting on Kemp's stated 
position in answer to a reporter's question, said that the party does not 
consider race or minority concerns an issue. Barbour agreed with Kemp, however, 
that Republican candidates should campaign in minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, in an interview, said that he does not want "the Republican Party, south 
or north, east or west, to do what unfortunately it has done all too often 
since the early 1960s -- adopt a Southern strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 The party first embraced a Southern strategy, aimed at securing the votes of 
conservative white Democrats, in 1964 and since then has largely ignored blacks 
to attract whites. The strategy helped the GOP make steady gains and become 
dominant over Democrats in some states in the South.

 "The Southern strategy of not even asking blacks to vote for you for fear of 
losing white votes should be opposed by the Republican Party because we need 
ethnic and racial reconciliation and what better party to lead that than the 
party of Lincoln?" Kemp declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans can no longer ignore the African American vote, Kemp said. In the 
1992 presidential election, blacks cast 8.5% of the votes, and President 
Clinton got 82% of the black vote. 
</P>
<P>
 After Oliver L. North won the GOP senatorial nomination in Virginia in last 
week's party convention, Kemp said he told the former Marine colonel that he 
would speak at his rallies only if the nominee campaigned in the black wards of 
Norfolk, Richmond and other Virginia cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my litmus test," Kemp said, "and I've told others that, too." He said 
North told him he would campaign in black neighborhoods "and I take him at his 
word. But I want to see evidence of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, who ran for the GOP nomination in 1988, said that he would make his own 
decision about running for President in 1996 after this year's elections. In 
several recent forums, he has extensively praised Gen. Colin L. Powell, former 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a leading political figure who, he 
hopes, will run for political office as a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who is black, has not been identified publicly as a Republican or a 
Democrat but Kemp said: "He most naturally would gravitate to the Republican 
Party. He's a man of the center-right. I hope he runs for the Republican 
presidential nomination and picks me as his vice president. It would be good 
for the party." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said that he is calling on all other Republican "potential or 'wannabe' 
or mentioned" presidential candidates to forgo GOP rallies and fund-raisers for 
1996 until after the 1994 elections "so we can get more men and women in 
Congress who understand the major issues facing this country."

FBI, JUSTICE DEPT. CLASH OVER ESPY PROBE; INVESTIGATION: 'HEATED MEETING' 
OCCURS REGARDING WHETHER TO CLOSE INQUIRY INTO ALLEGED FAVORS GIVEN TO 
AGRICULTURE SECRETARY BY TYSON FOODS OF ARKANSAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI and the Justice Department are at odds over whether to curtail a 
politically sensitive investigation into allegations that Agriculture Secretary 
Mike Espy accepted personal favors from Arkansas-based poultry-processing giant 
Tyson Foods Inc., sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the FBI believes that it has not yet exhausted all avenues of inquiry in 
the investigation, sources reported, high-level Justice Department officials 
are pressing to close the case because they say investigators have found 
insufficient evidence that Espy's actions violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over the investigation of Espy's ties to Tyson is potentially 
embarrassing for President Clinton because the former Arkansas governor has 
been accused in the past of showing favoritism to longtime friend and supporter 
Donald Tyson, head of the company, which is one of the largest employers in 
Clinton's home state. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno acknowledged at a news conference that the FBI has been 
looking into allegations that Espy violated the 1907 Meat Inspection Act by 
accepting Tyson's hospitality during a visit to the company's corporate 
headquarters in Springdale, Ark., and by sitting in the Tyson skybox during a 
Dallas Cowboys football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the 1907 act is a felony punishable by a mandatory one-year 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is said to hinge on allegations that Espy accepted these 
favors at the same time he was delaying the imposition of new Agriculture 
Department standards governing inspections at chicken processing plants, 
including 66 such plants operated by Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 While it not unusual for tensions to arise between investigators and 
prosecutors who must decide whether a case will hold up in court, sources 
familiar with the probe said Justice and FBI officials had a "heated meeting" 
on Tuesday in which investigators strongly objected to the department's desire 
to curtail the probe. Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern acknowledged the 
department was "nearing a decision on whether to close" the case, but declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 An initial decision is in the hands of Jo Ann Harris, assistant attorney 
general in charge of the criminal division. But because of the sensitive nature 
of the case, Reno will have an opportunity to review Harris' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Espy refused to comment, saying only that his reaction would be 
"unprintable." But the Agriculture Department issued a statement saying that 
the secretary is cooperating fully with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Tyson Foods issued a statement saying: "For anyone to think 
that Tyson Foods has gotten special or preferential treatment from the 
Department of Agriculture or any of its units is ludicrous and absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking at a trip that Espy made to Mississippi and Arkansas 
in May, 1993, as well as his visit to the Dallas Cowboys game last January. 
During the Arkansas visit, sources said, Tyson provided the agriculture 
secretary with lodging, ground transportation and a return flight to Washington 
on a corporate jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Espy told investigators that he reimbursed Tyson Foods for the 
lodging, transportation and the football ticket. But investigators are still 
uncertain whether his actions violate the 1907 law, which prohibits officials 
under its jurisdiction from accepting "anything of value" from corporations 
subject to government meat inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section are said to 
have argued that the value of the benefits Espy received from Tyson were too 
small to warrant criminal prosecution -- less than $100, by one estimate. Nor 
do they believe that the law, intended to curtail bribery of meat inspectors, 
applies to the activities of a Cabinet officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But FBI officials are known to fear that the sensitive matter could "blow up" 
if the case is closed before all leads are followed to their conclusion. Among 
other things, investigators have been unable to track down documents related to 
a May, 1993, decision regarding poultry inspections. In his interview with the 
FBI, Espy is understood to have said that he had heard rumors that the 
documents had been shredded. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department attorneys also are factoring in the likelihood that 
Congress soon will re-enact the law providing for an independent counsel 
investigation of Cabinet officers accused of wrongdoing. Espy is likely to be 
covered by that law.

MICHIGAN MAN SCRAPES KNEE, DIES FROM VIRULENT BACTERIA INFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old man died Thursday from a mysterious bacteria that has been 
linked to nearly a dozen deaths in Britain this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said Gary Meadows of Ypsilanti, Mich., became infected with the 
so-called flesh-eating bacteria Saturday when he fell off his bicycle and 
scraped his knee.By Monday, his thigh was swollen and he complained of nausea 
and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lloyd Jacobs of the Veterans Affairs Department hospital in Ann Arbor said 
Meadows was diagnosed with having group A streptococcus and was treated with 
penicillin. However, the fast-moving bacteria already had become too entrenched 
in his muscles and tissue for the penicillin to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organism itself is very sensitive to penicillin," Jacobs said at a news 
conference. "However, when the organism gets in places where the penicillin 
cannot get to it, then it becomes extremely difficult to control." 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows was the second person linked to the disease to die in Michigan in less 
than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Salinas, Calif., a 27-year-old man infected with the bacteria is 
being treated at Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital. A spokesperson said the 
unidentified man had been hospitalized there since May 26 "for treatment of an 
infection that was killing the flesh of his right leg." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital said the man's condition had been diagnosed as an infection of a 
spider bite or cut with group A streptococcus bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient was initially very ill, but has been treated aggressively with 
antibiotics and surgery. He is now improving," a hospital statement reported.

3-INCH-LONG GRASSHOPPERS BUG NEVADANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The grasshoppers are back. But so far, agricultural experts say, a surge of 
Mormon crickets in north-central Nevada is not as bad as it was four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300,000 acres in the Battle Mountain and Winnemucca areas are infested 
with the three-inch-long grasshoppers, which eat trees, shrubs, flowers -- even 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 George Nash of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the bugs are a public 
nuisance, but so far have not severely damaged any crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest issue with Mormon crickets," Nash said. "They're large 
insects. They're not very attractive. They have some rather nasty habits -- 
they like to eat each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as far as agricultural loss, we really haven't seen very much, if any." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are poisoning those that infest areas around homes. For residents, 
the bugs are a disgusting pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They eat the paint off your house," said Alicia Price of Battle Mountain. 
"They didn't eat my paint, but they left black marks all over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ate all the plants and flowers. They're just disgusting and huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Burkhart, who owns a flower shop, said the crickets arrived on Memorial 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just jillions of them," she said. "Everybody out there had golf 
clubs and bats and things they were trying to combat them with." 
</P>
<P>
 The grasshoppers were dubbed Mormon crickets after an infestation in Utah 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Their eggs hatch in the spring. The crickets grow to adulthood by late summer 
and usually die by September. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the insects infested about 3 million acres in Nevada.

COURTS HELPING PUT SPECIAL STUDENTS IN REGULAR CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Orange County students with special needs that range from minor 
learning disabilities to severe emotional disorders now spend most of their 
school days in mainstream classrooms, but outbreaks of violence and disruptions 
like those alleged in the Jimmy Peters case are rare, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a series of court rulings over the past five years, a coalition of 
activist parents who make up the "full inclusion" movement have made segregated 
classrooms for special-education students the exception rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Though inclusion is often more expensive and leads to complaints from teachers 
and some parents, it has become education policy in many parts of the United 
States because of the emerging legal view of special education as a civil 
rights issue. And many educators believe it is far more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since there are no special restaurants or special grocery stores or special 
movie theaters that one goes to as an adult, integrated educational settings 
better prepare children for the world," said Edward Lee Vargas, assistant 
superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, in which more than 
half of 4,000 special-education students spend more than half of each school 
day in regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't segregate kids for ethnic or racial reasons or gender reasons," 
Vargas added. "The question is being asked more and more: Why should we 
segregate kids who learn differently?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that is the first of its kind in Orange County, the Ocean View 
School District in Huntington Beach went to court last month to remove 
6-year-old Jimmy Peters from kindergarten at Circle View Elementary School, 
where officials say he repeatedly bit children, threw chairs and interrupted 
lessons by running around the room screaming. The boy's father denies the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a federal judge sent Jimmy back to class. His action continues a 
national trend of courts supporting parents who want their children 
mainstreamed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 5 million special-education students nationwide, and more than 
36,000 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In the county, 26% of the students with special needs spend all their time in 
regular classrooms, helped by aides, adapted computers and other support 
services. Another 45% spend at least half their day in regular classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Less than 1% are sent to private special-education programs at public expense. 
The remainder, 28%, are in special classes or centers for most of the day, but 
many of them also receive some education in traditional settings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not one or the other, either you're isolated or it's full inclusion," 
said Newport-Mesa Unified School District Trustee Sherry Loofbourrow, president 
of the California School Boards Assn. "Right now there's a whole range of 
options for children to have their special needs met and also have interaction 
with other children." 
</P>
<P>
 Although local and national experts agreed Thursday that Jimmy Peters' case 
appears unusually extreme, many pointed to other problems arising from the 
trend toward inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jimmy's classroom, parents have raised the common complaint that their 
children received less teacher attention because of the demanding presence of a 
disabled student in the room. Teachers themselves protest that they lack the 
training to handle special needs or collaborate with the host of specialists 
that may accompany such children. 
</P>
<P>
 And inclusion increases the expense of providing special education, which 
already costs $1,000 to $20,000 extra per child each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous dilemma," said Justine Maloney, legislative chairwoman of 
the 60,000-member Learning Disabilities Assn., which opposes full inclusion. 
"I'm not sure what the answer is, but I know that teachers are very frightened. 
They're frightened of the behavioral aspects of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Arnesen, head of special education for the Orange County Department of 
Education, said there is no "one size fits all" answer to the inclusion 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all individual -- what the parents request, what the needs of a child 
are -- it really does have to be considered on an individual basis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Special-education students get more attention and protection than anyone in 
the public schools, with each receiving an individualized education plan 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 That process began in 1975 with the federal Individuals With Disabilities 
Education Act, also called IDEA. Still the law of the land, IDEA demands that 
special-education students receive a "free and appropriate public education" in 
the "least restrictive environment" possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, many school districts began experimenting with mainstreaming, 
placing students with mild to moderate disabilities in regular classrooms -- 
often without any extra help or special programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the disability-rights movement burgeoned in the late 1980s, the 
full-inclusion trend emerged, bringing children with severe mental, physical 
and behavioral problems into regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is challenge some of those assumptions that have 
traditionally led to segregation," said Christopher Button of United Cerebral 
Palsy, a leader in the push for inclusion. "There are increasing numbers of 
examples of excellence where (inclusion) is happening well, where kids with 
disabilities and kids without disabilities are benefiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, courts and 
the U.S. Department of Education have given increasing support to inclusion 
programs. Among the protections special-education students have is the "stay 
put" clause, which prevents a school from removing a disabled child from a 
regular classroom without parental permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline is restricted too: Special-education students cannot be expelled 
from a school if their behavior stems from their disability, even if an action 
would otherwise be considered an expellable offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts are really making school districts bend over backward -- and 
beyond -- to accommodate children in (regular) classrooms," said Melinda 
Maloney, editorial director for a Pennsylvania company that publishes 25 
newsletters on special education. "You have a tremendous political grass-roots 
movement pushing inclusion, you have Clinton appointees favoring inclusion. . . 
. For the first time in 20 years all the planets are aligned." O.C. Special 
Education 
</P>
<P>
 Since passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, segregated 
classrooms for special-education students are becoming the exception rather 
than the rule. Federal law and courts around the country have demanded that 
students receive public education in "the least restrictive environment" 
possible. A look at programs serving Orange County's special-education 
students: 
</P>
<P>
 * Total special-education students: 36,263 (8.94% of Orange County's total 
student enrollment) 
</P>
<P>
 * Designated Instruction and Service: 9,483 (26% of special-education total); 
students spend entire day in regular classes, but may have special support 
services 
</P>
<P>
 * Resource specialist: 16,330 (45%); students spend more than half the day in 
regular classes, but may leave at times to work with specialists) 
</P>
<P>
 * Special classes and centers: 10,182 (28%); students spend less than half the 
day, or no time at all, in regular classes) 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-public schools: 268 (1%); students served full-time at special-education 
facility, paid for by public school districts)

URBAN INDIANS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SEEK HIGHER PROFILE; SOCIAL SERVICES: A 
GROUP IS GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO URGE INCREASED AID FOR NATIVE AMERICANS 
WHO LIVE IN METROPOLITAN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County could be called the secret capital of Indian America. There 
are an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Native Americans, more than in any other U.S. 
metropolitan area, more than on any reservation -- and yet they are invisible 
to most Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 Today a delegation of American Indians from Los Angeles will travel to 
Washington to join a meeting with White House officials aimed at raising the 
profile of urban Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that 60% of Native Americans live in cities, activists from across the 
country plan to lobby the federal government for social services targeted 
specifically at urban Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to make the government "more aware of the fact that Indian people 
are struggling in urban areas," said David Rambeau, a Paiute and director of a 
Skid Row center that serves poor families and homeless people of many tribes. 
"There needs to be an urban Indian policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, urban Indians say, it has been reservation Indians who get 
virtually all public and government attention, as evidenced by the high-profile 
meeting of tribal leaders with President Bill Clinton two months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Urban Indians do not expect their visit to receive the heavy television 
coverage that was given to the tribal leaders. They will not wear 
camera-attracting feather headdresses, and some, because they are of mixed 
ancestry, do not look like people's stereotypical images of Indians. Yet for 
these activists, tribal identity remains central to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has a large Native American population largely because of a U.S. 
government relocation policy in the 1950s and 1960s. Tens of thousands of 
people from scores of tribes were given bus tickets off their reservations and 
were promised help finding jobs in big cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Indian activists have long believed the government's aim was not merely 
to assimilate Native Americans but to wipe out their Indian identity by 
immersing them in mainstream environments, says Colleen Colson, a Cherokee who 
is a member of the Los Angeles City-County Native American Indian Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously (the policy) didn't work because we're all still here," Colson 
said. "(It) makes us want to fight harder to be close to our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of relocation, the Los Angeles region has one of the most diverse 
Native American populations in the country. Only a small minority of the 
Indians are from Southern California tribes. Because the government discouraged 
Indians from clustering together, they are scattered across the Los Angeles 
Basin, with no predominantly Indian neighborhoods, clusters of shops, or 
community centers. Large numbers live in the Long Beach, Bell Gardens and other 
Southeast Los Angeles County cities.  
</P>
<P>
 But one notable exception is Orange County, which is home to about 4,500 
members of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians. About half of the surviving 
members of this tribe, which traces its roots back 10,000 years, live in San 
Juan Capistrano near the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Juaneno leaders are trying to persuade the federal government to recognize 
them as a tribe. They formally applied for tribal status in 1982, but made 
their first government claim more than a century before that. In recent months 
they have emerged from among hundreds of bands, rising to No. 1 on a long list 
trying to gain active consideration by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Uyeno, a consultant to the Native American Indian Cultural Center in 
Tustin, said Thursday the local Juanenos supported the push by Los Angeles area 
Indians for recognition. "All they want is the right to claim they're Indian," 
Uyeno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Indians have little interest in their tribal roots and live 
entirely mainstream lives, others are actively trying to maintain or rediscover 
traditions. On almost any weekend in Los Angeles, hundreds of American Indians 
gather at powwows, the pan-tribal community gatherings featuring dance 
competitions, food and fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 Others gather on Skid Row. About 20% of Native Americans in Los Angeles live 
below the poverty level, a reflection of the fact that urban Indians face many 
of the same problems of Indians on reservations, such as alcoholism and low 
education levels, says Colson. They suffer higher rates of diabetes, 
tuberculosis and heart disease than the population as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 They also face the stress of adjusting to a pace of life far faster and more 
competitive than that on reservations and aggravated by the lack of a 
traditional family support systems. In addition, the continuing influx of 
newcomers from reservations and rural areas to Los Angeles burdens American 
Indian-oriented social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Indians say they face identity conflicts on a more regular basis than 
reservation Indians because they are surrounded by people who tend to hold 
images of them formed by Hollywood Westerns.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, Native Americans who look like the popular conception of Plains 
Indians -- tall, dark and Roman-nosed -- are greeted as "Chief" on the street 
and face taunts at work. Indians who are paler or otherwise fail the stereotype 
hear questions raised about whether they are Indians at all. And all struggle 
with the inability of many people to recognize that their many tribes have 
different cultures and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our children don't identify themselves as Indian (in school). They 
don't want the hassle," Rambeau said. They would rather be taken for Mexican 
Americans than be asked about tepees or asked to "play Indian" in Thanksgiving 
Pilgrim plays -- when their own tribes never lived in tents and never were 
anywhere near Massachusetts, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Native Americans also face an onslaught of curiosity 
from spiritual seekers looking for enlightenment in Native American religion.  
</P>
<P>
 "People choose to romanticize American Indians. If we don't meet their 
expectations or their stereotypes, we tend to be discounted as American 
Indians," Colson said.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Los Angeles Indian community includes rap musicians, skateboard 
champions, doctors, teachers and engineers. "People need to realize," Colson 
said, "that we're very much here and very much part of today's world."

DANA PARSONS: RECALL LEAVES VOTERS VINDICATED, THE UNSEATED UNSETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "T here is a secret in building a town. Do you want to know what it is? It 
takes a stiff backbone, a spirit of progressiveness and determination to win 
out, and a disposition that can stand all sorts of criticism."  
</P>
<P>
 That analysis was uttered by none other than George Amerige, who, along with 
his brother, Edward, founded Fullerton in 1887. Is there any way we can reach 
George Amerige today to get his take on Tuesday's blockbuster recall election, 
in which three-fifths of his hometown's City Council was voted into oblivion? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. So, for our limited purposes today, we're left with the opposing 
views of a longtime Fullerton resident I found sitting in a barbershop and 
newly dumped Councilwoman Molly McClanahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Never has the expression "staggered term" taken on such literal meaning. 
McClanahan and Councilmen A.B. (Buck) Catlin and Don Bankhead have been 
staggered, all right. They're now reeling about the ring, wondering what hit 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan was back at work Thursday at the Anaheim YWCA, where she runs a 
youth employment service. She was feeling, well, staggered. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered what it felt like to be ditched so abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a personal dimension and a public dimension," she said of 
the recall. "It's like a death. It's like a numbness and then grief. It's 
because you feel like you cared and nurtured not just a city but the citizens 
in that community. You've been a guest in schools, done guest lectures -- I go 
wherever I'm invited. If I'm invited to a group of homeowners, I go there. I 
relish the invitations. I never turned down an invitation to a school, because 
I think young people are so very important and vital to democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan thought she knew her town. Elected in 1982, she had met hundreds of 
citizens, either as volunteers or candidates or appointees to various local 
boards and commissions. But the group that led the recall effort seemed to come 
out of nowhere after the council passed a stopgap 2% utility tax last year that 
it said was needed to shore up the city's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Tuesday's recall so shocking was that Orange County voters have 
threatened officeholders repeatedly in recent years without success. In the 
last few years, Orange County citizens have tried about 20 times to recall 
members of either city councils or school boards and have come up with a big, 
fat zero. The last successful attempt was in 1989, when Fountain Valley 
residents recalled their mayor, who went too far in drumming up local business 
and pleaded no contest to soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at yourself as being a leader," McClanahan said, talking about 
herself and her comrades. "You're a listener, but you're also a leader and you 
make decisions -- some are popular and some are not, but you try to look at the 
well-being of the city and the overall public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 She knew she lived in a conservative town. Fullerton, after all, is Bill 
Dannemeyer's stomping grounds. It is not a city that suffers taxes gladly. So 
she knew the tax wasn't popular, but what still had McClanahan shaken Thursday 
was the tone of the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morning after the election, I had a call from an anonymous male who said, 
'You're fired, and I'm glad.' It's that kind of callousness and viciousness 
that hurts. The flyers the recall group distributed said, 'Throw the snakes out 
of Fullerton.' It's that kind of thing that's painful, because you cared over a 
host of issues, not just the one they're recalling you for." 
</P>
<P>
 If McClanahan is in pain, what about the other side? Are they gloating? 
</P>
<P>
 I ran into one Thursday morning in a local barbershop. He has lived in 
Fullerton for more than 40 years and, now retired, has worked there for 30. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him about the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I told him I knew what happened; I wanted to know why . 
</P>
<P>
 "This recall won because the council wouldn't recognize the citizens that 
voted against that 2% tax," he said. "There was over 600 people down there (at 
a public meeting), and our mayor (Catlin) and the council just ignored their 
vote on it. All the citizens had a standing vote, and they ignored it." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just the tax, he said: "It amounts to about $54 a year. It wasn't an 
awful amount, but it was the way we were treated. It was like they were saying, 
'There's no use in you coming down here at all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if he was gloating over the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a lesson to pass on to the city officials," he said. "That we do 
amount to something other than just being a person. Our votes will count." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked his name, but he didn't want to give it. He concluded by saying, "You 
can find out a lot of things in a barbershop."

PARENTING; THE FAMILY SPECTACLE; GETTING A FIRST PAIR OF GLASSES CAN BE A 
TURNING POINT IN A CHILD'S LIFE. DOING IT RIGHT SAVES THE CHILD -- AND 
CONCERNED PARENTS -- A LOT OF GRIEF.

 Brian Murray and his 3-year-old son, Steven, were in Michael C's Optical in 
Woodland Hills, helping each other pick out eyeglasses. Brian modeled a pair 
with brown frames. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brown is nice," Steven said approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The optician helped Steven, who was getting his first-ever glasses, try on a 
pair with blue frames. "You look great in blue," his dad said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two finished making their selections, and as they exited, Brian and 
optician Michael Chris winked at each other conspiratorially. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's eyesight is fine. He had just purchased an inexpensive pair of frames 
with clear lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to share the experience with Steven to help him feel comfortable," 
he said. "It was something we could do together -- like throwing a ball. We 
made a big deal about choosing frames and colors, so it was positive and 
special, as opposed to a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Steven, almost 20% of infants and children have vision abnormalities that 
can be corrected with glasses, according to the American Academy of 
Ophthalmology. The group recommends that children's eyes be evaluated by a 
physician within the first six months of life and again at age 6 months to 1 
year, age 3 and age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools usually screen the vision of older children. In general, among those 
between 6 and 12 years old, myopia (nearsightedness) is the most common 
problem, while amblyopia ("lazy eye") accounts for the majority of eye 
disorders in infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the specific condition is, getting a first pair of glasses is a 
milestone in a child's life. While certainly not the most traumatic event a 
family will experience, it is a big deal -- and often most difficult for the 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "First-timers really need their hands to be held -- not the kid, but the 
parent," Chris said. "Some are in tears because they think their child has some 
kind of defect. But it is so normal! Just about everyone has some kind of 
refractive error (in their vision.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents wonder how to persuade antsy young children -- who may have 
trouble keeping shoes on their feet -- to wear their glasses. Surprisingly, 
though, eyeglasses usually pose less of a problem than parents expect, 
according to Dr. Sheryl Handler, an Encino pediatric ophthalmologist.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most kids who need glasses really want them, like them and are dedicated to 
them," she said, "to the point where parents have to slip their glasses off 
when the child falls asleep or takes a bath. Their glasses open up their whole 
life; they experience major improvements in all their skills."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can also be relieved to learn that the stigma faced by 
spectacle-wearing children during previous eras has all but disappeared. "Eye 
wear is trendy and fashionable now, and there are so many (kinds of glasses) to 
choose from," Chris said. "A lot of kids are very excited about getting 
glasses, and they look so cute in them that a brother or sister -- who doesn't 
need glasses -- will be jealous and want a pair too." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Steven's mother, Kathleen Murray, admitted she was upset to learn that 
Steven needed glasses. "It really bothered me," she said. "I remember when I 
was growing up how cruel kids were." She was relieved when, instead, the 
neighborhood children clustered around Steven in admiration -- then turned to 
their parents demanding glasses for themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other had, many adolescents -- especially girls -- may be reluctant to 
wear glasses, according to Handler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls around 12 years old have all the tough preteen issues," she said. "They 
are at that tough time in life when everything is so fragile. They will often 
do anything not to wear glasses because they think it will be socially 
difficult. All it takes is one person to tease them, and they feel awful.' 
</P>
<P>
 Such adolescents -- if they are mature and responsible enough -- may be good 
candidates for contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of hygiene and dexterity," Handler said. "Medical problems 
come about if contacts are not properly removed and cleaned. Kids who put their 
hands everywhere and play outside in dirt and sand should not be put in 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel Young, 16, of Woodland Hills has worn contacts since she was 12 years 
old. "They are a lot of responsibility, but it is worth it," she said. "My 
glasses were always slipping off my nose, and I never liked any frames or the 
way they made my eyes look. I like the way I look without glasses better." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Gary Young, believes Ariel, as well as her younger sister, Robin, 
9, look "adorable" in glasses. Both girls were fitted for their first pair at 9 
months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have to have a problem, this is not the worst one that can happen -- 
and it is correctable," he said.

PARENTING; MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 While most children easily adapt to glasses, eye-care professionals recommend 
that parents take several steps to smooth the transition: 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop a positive outlook yourself.Children will not feel good about 
wearing glasses if parents seem worried or depressed about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the cutest and most colorful styles -- and the best fit for the tiniest 
tots -- find an optician who specializes in children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow older children to take their time choosing a frame style, and check 
out the selection in several stores if necessary. Adolescents should feel their 
glasses are stylish and flattering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't get frustrated or impatient if your child does not adapt to wearing 
glasses right away. Youngsters may need a few days to adjust. MARYANN HAMMERS

PARENTING; COSMETIC CONCERNS: TOO MUCH TOO SOON?; QUESTION OF MAKEUP AND YOUNG 
GIRLS TRULY IS A FAMILY BALANCING ACT. BUT GOOD GROOMING IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

 How young is too young for a girl to wear makeup? Parents and kids tend to 
disagree on the subject. Advertisements and MTV might dazzle girls with the 
magic of cosmetics, but few moms and dads want their daughters rushed 
prematurely into womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the line gets fuzzy is with kiddie makeup kits that appeal to girls as 
young as 4. At that age, experimentation seems harmless, especially when it's 
part of dress-up games and make-believe. But makeup artist Jocelyn Zayco points 
out that a 4-year-old's playful interest can become an obsession a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Zayco, senior makeup artist at the Centre Salon in Woodland 
Hills' Sebastian International Headquarters: "You'd be surprised how much a 
9-year-old knows about makeup. Nine-year-olds -- if they could -- would wear 
lipstick and even eye makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Not in my back yard, says Peter di Caula, who counsels adolescents in his 
Northridge psychology practice. Though he allowed his own 10-year-old to wear 
some cosmetics for a dance recital a couple of years ago, he says that except 
on similar special occasions he probably won't again until she's in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 His professional view is that permission to wear makeup should be granted to 
girls on a case-by-case basis and that moderation is important. The reason? 
Appearances can be misconstrued by peers and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conceivably, wearing makeup at an early age could be a manifestation of a 
more serious problem," he says. He cites some teen-age girls who aim to attract 
and date older boys and move within social circles beyond their years. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Caula concedes that interest in cosmetics is as natural for girls as 
playing with trucks is for boys. Regardless of how a parent feels about it, 
most girls want to wear makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Lauren Hoover of Calabasas says that more than half her female 
classmates wear some, and a couple of fellow seventh-graders lay it on pretty 
thickly. Hoover uses lip gloss and mascara, though her parents never actually 
gave her permission. But Lauren isn't sneaky with cosmetics. She says her look 
is so natural it hasn't bothered her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Zayco, who sees teen-agers flock to the cosmetic area at the Centre Salon, 
strives for a balance between the interest of girls and the wishes of parents. 
Sometimes, she counsels, the easiest way to discourage extreme looks is to 
teach girls basic grooming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents can often appease girls too young to wear makeup by teaching them how 
to care for their skin," Zayco says. She adds that confidence in good grooming 
can build all-important self-esteem. Young ones, she recommends, should start 
with mild cleanser, tinted moisturizer (less obvious than foundation, more 
visible than a color-free product) and nude-colored lipstick. Though some girls 
prefer darker lipstick, Zayco persuades them to tone it down by showing them 
pictures of famous models in more subdued shades. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle colors offer grown-ups and kids a compromise in the battle over makeup. 
Arin Tuchman of Calabasas enjoys complete freedom with cosmetics. On her 13th 
birthday, she graduated from blush to foundation, eye shadow and mascara. The 
key to gaining that freedom, explains her mother, Sheri Tuchman, was going the 
natural route. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't even notice it if you looked at her, and if it makes her feel 
good, and she doesn't overdo it, I don't see a problem with it," Sheri says. 
</P>
<P>
 She points out that initially, rather than letting Arin "go crazy at Sav-on," 
she took her to Jus Judy's, a Woodland Hills makeup-artist emporium, for 
professional training and products. 
</P>
<P>
 Consulting a professional can make a world of difference, agrees Wendy Doyle, 
a Van Nuys makeup artist. In her opinion, "a little mascara and some lip color" 
are fine for 14-year-olds, but she suggests they skip eye shadow and eyeliner. 
Doyle, whose work takes her from the Valley to Santa Monica and beyond, laments 
that some Valley teen-agers tend to overdo it. "I definitely see more makeup in 
the Valley than I do at the beaches," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A session with a makeup artist, she suggests, can steer teen-agers toward 
flattering colors and successful application techniques. Also helpful are 
certain cosmetic lines that encourage girls to try products at home. Origins, 
for example, provides onetime-use applicators so users can test makeup in or 
out of a store without buying it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for some parents, not all girls are clamoring for cosmetics. 
Lauren Hoover's 9-year-old sister Erin could care less about painting her face. 
"I don't really like makeup," she says, though her mother has put a little on 
her from time to time for special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's in a real tomboy stage now," confirms mother Becca. "But I'm not sure 
how long that will last."

 It's summer reading season again, time for parents to head for libraries and 
bookstores for the usual stack of childhood favorites. For certain grown- ups 
-- those who whiled away their own youths dreaming over books -- the prospect 
of sharing remembered tomes with kids is delightful. "Eloise," "Charlotte's 
Web," "Treasure Island" -- whatever ignited the love of reading in parents will 
probably leap to mind as they shop for children's summer fare. Their 
youngsters, however, may have other ideas. They might, for example, reject 
"Eloise" -- the classic story by Kay Thompson about an impish resident of the 
Plaza -- in deference to the Berenstain Bears, the wildly successful series by 
Stan and Jan Berenstain. They might choose the Rev. W. Awdry's "Thomas the Tank 
Engine" over the "Velveteen Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Clifton, children's librarian at the Sherman Oaks Branch of the Los 
Angeles Public Library, reports that some juvenile classics hold up better with 
today's youngsters than others. Among the winners, she mentions Theodor Seuss 
Geisel's "Dr. Seuss" series as well as the "Madeline" books by Ludwig 
Bemelmans. "Eloise," she says, contains some "hard-to-get jokes, plus it looks 
dated" -- especially to children weaned on the representative, detailed 
illustration style of contemporary artists like Chris Van Allsburg. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, she points out, "some books that parents liked, their kids 
will too if parents bring them out at exactly the right age." 
</P>
<P>
 She cites Margery Williams' "Velveteen Rabbit" as one grown-ups often 
introduce too soon. "It's fine for 7- or 8-year-olds," she concedes. "But 
preschoolers find it hard to sit still for." 
</P>
<P>
 Clifton advocates reading aloud to youngsters as a way to turn them on to 
books. "As soon as they can sit up," she advises, "make it part of their 
bedtime routine." She believes that "the more parents read to children, the 
more accepting kids will be of a wide range of books. It broadens their 
horizons." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents find television a fierce competitor with any book for kids' 
affections. Rather than fighting it, some use the tube to enhance the appeal of 
the written word, either through videos of classic storybooks or shows such as 
the PBS series "Reading Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
 Others employ the set as a way to discover their young one's interests -- 
whatever they are -- in order to turn them into reading material. Adults who 
themselves were once forbidden to buy comic books now snap them up by the 
armloads if they're based on such television hits as "The Simpsons" and "Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TV, of course, isn't the only route to a child's literary heart. Glenda Grubbs 
of North Hollywood found her sports-crazy son Logan, 8, eager to start reading, 
but only if he could learn more about his favorite athletes. "I bought him 
anything I could find about sports," Grubbs says. "Logan read so many sports 
books I've lost track of the titles. I remember one Michael Jordan book he 
loved. If it was about sports and had big typeface and colorful illustrations, 
I got it." 
</P>

 Carl Stensel of Studio City bought science books for his son Max, 8, who is 
passionate about science and technology in general, and fighter planes in 
particular. According to Carl, "He loved science fact books with lots of 
pictures and captions. He started off reading captions, really. I bought 'The 
Big Book of Real Airplanes' (Putnam, $7.95), the 'Encyclopedia Brittanica Book 
of Fascinating Facts' (Outlet Books, $17.99) and all the science-oriented 
'Eyewitness' books (Dorling Kindersley, $7.95-$12.95)." 
</P>
<P>
 Only when Max was well into reading in his chosen field did his father 
introduce Franklin W. Dixon's "Hardy Boys" series, which Max now reads avidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stensels' experience offers parents a hint: Be patient. Sometimes 
grown-ups forget exactly when they read the cherished volume that sparked their 
own passion for print. Many, in fact, were 11 or 12, not 8 or 9, when they 
first cracked "Tom Sawyer." Like their own kids, they needed to cut their 
reading teeth on easier fare first. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, it's wise to remember that discovery is part of the thrill of 
reading. Whatever a grown-up puts in front of child, the child may opt for 
something he or she finds independently -- perhaps at camp or at a friend's 
house. Whatever it is may itself become the stuff of memory, the one book out 
of all the rest that opened up the written world.

PARENTING; KIDS TAKE THESE LESSONS TO THE BANK; PARENTS ADVISED TO TAKE ACTIVE 
ROLE IN HELPING CHILDREN LEARN TO SAVE AND PROPERLY MANAGE MONEY.

 There's more to teaching kids about money and restraint than saying no to 
every candy bar and toy request. But parents who simply hand their child a 
piggy bank and hold their breath aren't doing enough either.  
</P>
<P>
 In the book, "Money Doesn't Grow on Trees," (Godfrey & Edwards, $11) author 
Neale Godfrey advises mom and dad to take a more active role, starting to talk 
to children about money as soon as the youngsters turn 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Early lessons include differentiating between coins -- a skill that becomes 
important later as children learn to count change. By the age of 5, they should 
have a piggy bank, advises Godfrey, and by 12, they may be able to manage a 
clothing allowance. Above all else, Godfrey emphasizes, parents should stress 
the relationship between a job and its payoff and never pay children for 
unfinished chores. 
</P>

 Twelve-year-old Benjamin Weiss of Sherman Oaks understands the value of a 
dollar better than most children his age. Benjamin, a student at Adat Ari El 
Day school in North Hollywood, has about $2,000 in his savings account at Home 
Savings of America. The sum consists of saved allowance funds and money 
received for household chores, neighborhood gardening, baby-sitting for his 
5-year-old sister and occasional gifts. Though the youth admits to spending 
some of his money -- and even donating some to charity -- he places a high 
priority on saving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saving is important, so you will have money when you are older," says Ben.  
</P>
<P>
 Ben's money management savvy earned him a first-place award in a Math You Can 
Bank On contest sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank and The Times. Ben developed a 
hypothetical MacIntosh computer program to manage money he earned during six 
years of mowing lawns. The program took into account earnings, interest rates, 
inflation and depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben's mother, Vivian Glucksman-Weiss, says she and her husband, Mitchell 
Weiss, do exercise their parental authority when it comes to Ben's savings 
plan. "We make him put (his money) in the bank," she acknowledges, "but every 
once in a while he buys something." Recent purchases include a pair of Doc 
Marten shoes and assorted compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not all kids Ben's age are concerned about the distant future, some 
save money to handle ongoing financial needs. Rachel Cantrock of Calabasas 
hoards earnings from baby-sitting and chores, she says, in case she wants 
something her mother doesn't feel she needs. Such frivolities include makeup, 
troll dolls and assorted decorative things for her room. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel's mother, Gayle Cantrock, laments that many Los Angeles children do not 
appreciate the value of money. She believes, though, that in subtle but 
effective ways she has instilled a respect for money in her own children. For 
example, if she and Rachel are shopping, Cantrock won't necessarily purchase a 
pair of shoes her daughter wants. Mom says that 18 pairs of shoes are enough, 
and it's up to Rachel to buy the new ones herself or pass. Knowing how to 
distinguish between need and want is a valuable lesson, Cantrock believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the young consumer has a few extra dollars or thousands, banks work 
hard to win their business. Home Savings of America, where Ben banks, is 
committed to youngsters' financial education. The bank's adopt-a-school program 
sends branch managers to area schools to teach children the importance of 
savings and provide information on how to set up no-fee savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo Bank offers a special Club WF-1 program to savers under age 18. 
Members get a personalized club card and an information packet that details the 
services they're eligible for. These include opening savings and/or checking 
accounts and receiving an ATM card. According to program guidelines, parents 
must consent, apply with their minor children and act as account custodians. 
There are no monthly fees levied for youngster's accounts (though some fees may 
apply for ATM withdrawals.) 
</P>
<P>
 Through such efforts, banks try to encourage financial responsibility among 
young people. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathleen Shilkret says that the 
implications of helping shape the behavior of young consumers extend far beyond 
individual account management. It could be, she speculates, that by teaching 
young people good habits, the massive credit card debts that plagued the 
leveraged 1980s might be minimized in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are the future. The only way they will learn is by seeing the 
consequences of whatever decisions they make," Shilkret believes. If they learn 
when they are young, in a controlled environment where the stakes are 
relatively small, she adds, "they will be more responsible adults."

PARENTING; LESSONS OF A FAMILY ALBUM; THE YELLENS CHRONICLE THEIR LIFE TOGETHER 
-- THE UPS AND DOWNS -- FOR A UNIQUE INSIDER'S LOOK AT RAISING CHILDREN. 
</P>

<P>
 Northridge psychologists Andrew and Heidi Yellen keep some interesting 
mementos in their office waiting room: scrapbooks of their family vacations, 
academic and sports awards won by their children, poetry written by their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends tease me that we're the 'Leave It to Beaver' family," jokes Josh, 
20, the Yellens' son.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is," says daughter Erit, 16, "we are." 
</P>
<P>
 If the scrapbooks aren't enough to prove it, Andrew Yellen has just published 
a book called "The Art of Perfect Parenting and Other Absurd Ideas." Subtitled 
"The first truly practical, hands-on approach to behavioral management," it 
draws on the experiences of three generations of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Folksy, humorous, full of practical advice, the book started off as a 
newsletter to friends and clients detailing the Yellens' successes and failures 
as parents. Andrew and Heidi specialize in family therapy, and unlike many 
psychologists, they are very open with their clients about their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we feel like the way we handle a situation with our children can 
teach someone how to avoid conflict with their own," Heidi says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, we're proud of our family," Andrew adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured along the lines of an easy-to-use parenting manual, the book opens 
with a brief history of the Yellen clan -- children, parents and grandparents, 
Ruth Yellen and her late husband, Al. Known as "Ma and Pa Cookie" because of 
Al's long-ago habit of bringing goodies to his grandkids, the senior Yellens 
inform the story with a down-to-earth wisdom comprised of common sense and 
respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the book, Andrew emphasizes his debt to them, the couple who gave 
him something rare in contemporary culture: a model for parenthood. He bemoans 
the fact that, in society at large, "for some reason, after World War II, we 
lost 'it' -- the ability to pass on parenting skills from one generation to 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of first-person chapters written by Yellen's children and 
parents, his book aims to bridge that gap and give moms and dads a program for 
effective family stewardship. Indeed, the warmth and immediacy of the family's 
presence contributes a great deal to the book. Their accounts dramatize the 
effectiveness of Yellen's parenting strategy -- an approach that involves 
setting up a framework of expectations within the family so that everyone 
understands his or her obligations to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocating the use of a "behavior contract" between parents and children, 
Yellen offers a system of rewards and "consequences" that, he believes, keeps 
family disputes to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "By structuring your child's behavior with a contract," he counsels, "he or 
she is actually freer to be a child in the truest sense of the phrase. The need 
for them to test their limits ceases to exist. They can make choices, even if 
it's not always the appropriate one." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a program, Yellen says, is the basis for the success of his own family, 
who remain close despite the fact that Josh now goes to college in Santa 
Barbara and Ruth lives in Laguna. The worst blow to the clan was Al's death in 
December. His battle with prostate cancer, in fact, was what prompted Andrew to 
write the book he had been mulling over for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as much an honor to my whole family as it is a book that can help 
people parent their children," Andrew admits. "I wanted my father to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Art of Perfect Parenting" is replete with tales from Yellen family life: 
disputes over profanity and door-slamming, the usual battles between parent and 
child, which, in this group's case, tend to resolve themselves harmoniously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing stories about yourself is a bit embarrassing," Erit says, "but I don't 
mind if it's going to help someone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports would seem to indicate it has. According to Dr. Lance Steinberg, 
a psychiatrist and pediatrician with offices in Encino, Beverly Hills and 
Calabasas, "(The book) is clear, precise, funny and sparkles with gems and 
expertise." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Leslie J. Forman, Northridge Hospital's clinical director for adolescent 
psychiatric services, says that Yellen's program allows children to grow as 
individuals in a structured forum.  
</P>
<P>
 Such feedback would probably have warmed the heart of "Pa Cookie," who was, 
his family reports, devoted to youngsters. A handwritten letter from him is 
included at the back of Yellen's book. In it he concludes, "Successful 
parenting is life's greatest reward." Where to Go What: Andrew Yellen's book 
can be purchased by writing Yellen & Associates, 11260 Wilbur Ave., Suite 303, 
Northridge, CA 91326. (It also can be ordered through local bookstores.)

PARENTING; REVEALING TRUTH WITH DISCRETION; HOW HONEST PARENTS SHOULD BE IN 
AIRING THEIR PAST WITH CHILDREN IS TRICKY, EXPERTS SAY, AND DEPENDS ON A 
YOUNGSTER'S MATURITY AND OTHER FACTORS.

<P>
 The moment of truth came when Sheila and her 15-year-old daughter were having 
lunch with friends: "Mom, were you a virgin when you got married?" the 
teen-ager asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After a beat, Sheila admitted that she and the girl's father had had a 
"pre-honeymoon" trip, but quickly explained that they had wedding plans at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila, who like most of the parents quoted here asked that her real name be 
withheld, later admitted that she hadn't been completely truthful about her 
early escapades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 1969. 'Free love' was in. But I'm not proud of it now," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 How honest parents should be in airing their past with children is tricky, 
experts say, and depends on a youngster's age and maturity, what he or she is 
asking and even a parent's motive in telling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Total honesty is good in the abstract, but it's not always appropriate," said 
Lois Gordon, an Encino marriage and family counselor.  
</P>
<P>
 Grown-ups tend to want to reveal too much, said psychologist Laura 
Schlessinger, who often fields disclosure questions from parents on her KFI 
radio talk show. Callers have wanted to divulge everything from their own past 
prostitution to the story of their child's conception through a sperm bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger's advice: "Parents should give only the information that helps 
children grow and make better choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents rightly fear that admitting past peccadilloes can give children a 
tacit go-ahead to behave the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very quiet about my sexual past because you have to set an 
example," said Roslyn Rozbruch, 37, a Sherman Oaks mother of two girls, ages 6 
and 2. "I wouldn't tell (my daughters) things that I wouldn't want (them) to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie, an 18-year-old high school senior, proves the wisdom of this attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 She revealed that she loves to learn about her parents' past in order, she 
said, to "use it against them. Like when I got drunk and told my dad he 
couldn't get mad at me because he'd done the same thing in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for keeping quiet involves parents' own privacy issues. One mom 
said she won't tell all because "I don't want my kids discussing my private 
life with their friends." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, though, too much disclosure, especially about current issues such 
as dating, can make youngsters feel uncomfortable, said Gordon, as if no one is 
in charge. She said parents should examine their motives: " 'Why am I 
disclosing this? Do I want sympathy? Do I want my kid to like me or think I'm 
cool?' Those might be suspicious motives." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said, ask the child why he wants to know. "Sometimes they just want 
to tell you about something that scared them and asking is a way to open the 
topic." 
</P>
<P>
 An opportunity to explore a worrisome topic arose when Schlessinger's 
8-year-old son asked if she had ever smoked marijuana. In Schlessinger's case, 
allaying his fears coincided with being honest: "I told him I had too much 
respect for my mind," she recalled. "We talked about how difficult it was 
because people razzed you if you didn't. We discussed how I got through the 
'60s without the drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon cited another example. If a child is feeling depressed or insecure, it 
may help for parents to acknowledge having felt that way once too. "You might 
say, 'I felt depressed in college, but I went to a therapist and although I was 
embarrassed at first, it helped me,' " Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even grown-ups with more lurid histories may choose to air the details. A 
Granada Hills father said he isn't comfortable with his children thinking he 
was perfect. He tells them the good as well as the bad about his college 
experiences with drugs and sex -- especially since he fears a friend could leak 
the information anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sharing of your past can give you credibility, said Charles Lerman, 44, a 
North Hills psychologist and father to four sons. "You don't want to lie to 
your kids, because on some level your child will sense it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some youngsters, of course, don't even want the lowdown on Mom and Dad. A 
Chatsworth high schooler was disgusted when she found out her mother once 
smoked cigarettes, and three junior high girls giggled when asked if they 
wanted to know about their parents' past sexual experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's gross," squealed one. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever a child's interest level, Lerman suggested that parents anticipate 
possible questions and decide ahead of time how to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consider how comfortable you are in telling the truth," he said, and watch 
your child's reaction. Have they tuned you out or do they look shocked? "Ask 
them how they feel." 
</P>
<P>
 The important thing, Lerman emphasized, is to keep communication open because 
"if you have dialogue, you have a chance to make a difference."

<P>
 For families who find even the neighborhood supermarket a challenging day 
trip, the idea of planning a full-scale excursion can be overwhelming. Not only 
is money often an issue, but there is also the daunting prospect of shepherding 
children from place to place and keeping them entertained for days on end.  
</P>
<P>
 But family vacations can be fun -- really. The trick is finding activities 
that appeal to both children and grown-ups, and gearing the trip to the 
personalities on board. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of trip-planning for a wide range of clients, Sam Meinel of Travel 
Syndicate, in Woodland Hills, focuses on making sure children will be amused 
and safe, and that money is spent wisely. "Everybody's looking for easy , and 
value for the dollar," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents warn that the biggest vacation expense can be the cost of 
getting there. Air fare for a family of four adds up quickly. But even road 
trips can be costly. Food alone can at least $20 to $30 a meal, even for fast 
food.  
</P>
<P>
 For families looking for something exciting and different but sensibly priced, 
there are close-to-home alternatives that promise as good a time as a 
full-scale trip. Some offer a novel mode of transportation -- a train to San 
Francisco or a boat to Catalina -- while others present a new landscape to 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 relatively painless and reasonable family vacations that should be 
fun for everyone: 
</P>
<P>
 1. COAST STARLIGHT TRAIN TRIP TO SAN FRANCISCO: Imagine boarding a train at 
the Glendale Amtrak station at 10 a.m. and spending the day speeding up the 
coast. At 9 p.m., you arrive in Oakland, where a complimentary charter bus 
takes you to the Embarcadero in San Francisco. After a few days exploring the 
city, you're back on the train, going home.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a fun way to see the state without having to drive -- or make 
time-consuming stops for food. Cost varies depending on the day of travel, but 
adult fare is typically $68 round trip; children's fares are half price. Amtrak 
can also provide motel packages. Call (800) USA-RAIL for more information and 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 2. SANTA CATALINA ISLAND: Only 22 miles from the Mainland, Catalina feels 
farther away than a 90-minute boat ride. With 76 square miles of land and 54 
miles of shoreline to explore, the island makes a great family vacation because 
there's so much to do there -- from quaint shopping to Jeep trekking to 
bison-watching bus rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of comfortable hotels are located in Avalon, Catalina's main town. But 
adventurous families might try a yurt -- a more rustic dwelling on a cove near 
Goat Harbor. Twenty-four feet in diameter, the wooden structures known as yurts 
feature a kitchen, fireplace, beds, gas barbecue, carpeting and a hot shower. 
Located on a private beach, they're convenient to hiking and snorkeling and 
range from $65 a night during the week to $125 a night for four or more (up to 
six) on weekends. Transportation from Avalon to Goat Harbor costs $8 a person. 
For reservations and information, call the Catalina Island Conservancy, (310) 
510-1745. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat travel to Catalina is offered by several firms and runs about $34 for 
adults and $25 for children. For information about transportation and island 
accommodations, call the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors 
Bureau, (310) 510-1520. 
</P>
<P>
 3. CAMPING: Camping is a low-cost way to visit beautiful places where children 
can run, explore and be wild. Families new to camping can rent the equipment, 
including tent, stove, lantern and sleeping bags, from camping outfitters; a 
week's rental runs about $100. Chadi Juberail, of Recon-1 in Tarzana, suggests 
reserving equipment two to three weeks in advance in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the hundreds of places in California to camp, most are listed in several 
good resource books. "Camp California" (Prentice Hall, $4.95) gives information 
and reservation phone numbers for more than 1,700 campgrounds. The Official 
Guide to California State Parks is available for $2 by writing the California 
Department of Parks and Recreation, Publications Section, P.O. Box 942896, 
Sacramento, Calif. 94296. For general information and for California parks 
reservations, call (800) 444-7275. 
</P>
<P>
 4. NATIONAL PARK LODGES: National park lodges are affordable places that feel 
like a cross between summer camp and a nice resort. Most offer evening 
naturalist lectures geared to families, along with a variety of nature 
programs, hikes, crafts and science activities. Some require early 
reservations, but even the most popular lodges get last-minute openings. The 
federal Consumer Information Center in Pueblo, Colo. offers "A Guide to Your 
National Forests" ($1), "National Park System Map and Guide" $1.25) and "Lesser 
Known Areas of the National Park System" ($1.50). Write the Consumer 
Information Center, Pueblo, Colo. 81009 or call (719) 948-4000. 
</P>
<P>
 5. PALM SPRINGS: For those who like it hot, summer is a bargain in Palm 
Springs. Temperatures range from the low 70s to 105-plus, but hot-weather 
activities abound. The Palm Springs Aerial Tram runs to the Mt. San Jacinto 
State Park and Wilderness (elevation 8,516 feet), where 54 miles of hiking 
trails and a restaurant await. (Adults, $15.95; children 5-12, $9.95). The Palm 
Springs Oasis Waterpark offers 22 acres of water activities: 12 water slides 
and body- and board-surfing in a two-thirds-acre pool. The Children's Museum of 
the Desert features hands-on science and art centers. Many area hotels 
radically discount their rates for summer. Call the city of Palm Springs' free 
reservation service, (800) 347-7746, for information. 
</P>
<P>
 6. CAMBRIA: Halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, in northern San 
Luis Obispo County, Cambria is what Carmel was before it became a tourist 
attraction. Its colorful main street offers great shopping: toy stores, a 
toy-soldier factory and numerous art and antique galleries. The beaches are 
breathtaking, with sea lions playing and sunning offshore. Just a few minutes 
north is San Simeon, home of the famous Hearst Castle, where the tours are 
suitable for children 6 and older. A wide range of accommodations includes 
bed-and-breakfasts and kid-friendly motels. For more information, call the 
Cambria Chamber of Commerce, (805) 927-3624. 
</P>
<P>
 7. SAN DIEGO: For climate, kids' activities, the bays and the beach, San Diego 
is considered by many travel experts to be the closest thing to perfect for 
family vacations. There are fabulous parks: Mission Bay, a 4,000-acre aquatic 
playground, Old Town State Historic Park and the San Diego-La Jolla Underwater 
Park. Sea World is there, along with the San Diego Zoo and the 2,100-acre San 
Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents can provide packages that combine discounted tickets to many 
attractions with special hotel and motel rates. For information and a free San 
Diego Visitors Value Pack, contact the San Diego Convention and Visitors 
Bureau, 401 B St., Suite 1400, Dept. 700, San Diego, Calif. 92101 or call (619) 
236-1212. 
</P>
<P>
 8. DAY TRIPPING: Some families prefer to stay close to home or can't take more 
than a day off at a time. For them, the ideal break might be a series of day 
trips with their house as home base. One day could be set aside for Universal 
Studios, another for the beach, others for Little Tokyo, Exposition Park, the 
J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Olvera Street and the Los Angeles Children's 
Museum Downtown and the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical 
Gardens in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to save the days just as if you were going out of town. Otherwise 
responsibilities or intrusions might interfere. For information on Los Angeles 
attractions, call the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau, (213) 624-7300. 
</P>
<P>
 9. RIVER RAFTING: For thrills, fresh air and a change of pace, nothing beats 
river rafting. Trips range from a gentle one-day voyage on the Klamath River in 
southern Oregon to a seven-day adventure on the Owyhee in southeast Oregon. 
Some trips are geared to families with young children -- age 4 and older -- 
while others, in faster and possibly more dangerous water, are limited to teens 
and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfitters provide everything from food to shelter for overnight trips. Some 
offer outdoor skills training, fishing, bicycling, jet-boat trips and hikes. 
Prices range from $62 for a child and $76 for an adult for a one-day trip, to 
$500 to $600 a person for a one-week excursion.

</P>
<P>
 10. TRAVEL BY WAGON TRAIN: This unusual adventure isn't expensive . . . once 
you get to Jamestown, N.D. There, the Fort Seward Wagon Train is celebrating 
its 25th anniversary. From June 25 to July 2, 200 people will dress in pioneer 
attire and take canvas-topped wagons pulled by horses or mules along a 100-mile 
trail beginning and ending in Fort Seward, an old U.S. Cavalry post north of 
Jamestown. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are assigned basic chores -- like chopping wood, building fires 
and cooking. After each day's journey, families help set up camp and take part 
in arts and crafts, scavenger hunts and campfire songs. Cooking is done in open 
pits. The cost, which includes everything except the tent, sleeping bags and 
period clothes (which families must bring), is $260 for adults, $185 for teens 
and $135 for children 12 and younger. For more information, contact Fort Seward 
Inc., P.O. Box 244, Jamestown, N.D. 58402 or call (701) 252-6844. Survival Tips 
for Family Trips 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how exciting the destination, traveling with children is a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are tips from parents, travel agents and experts on organization to make 
traveling more kid-friendly: 
</P>
<P>
 1. When packing for children, take clothes that mix and match, and don't 
forget small backpacks, even for preschoolers. If you plan to carry luggage any 
distance, try lugging it around the house to test its weight. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Pack some new, dime-store quality toys for moments of boredom. Classics -- 
such as the mini-Etch-a-Sketch, small dolls, playing cards and tiny race cars 
-- work wonders. A compact tape recorder -- with earphones -- and some favorite 
travel music are a must. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Ask school-age children to help make an official trip record by collecting 
postcards and hotel stationery in envelopes, and noting such details as weather 
and special family activities. Some children like being the map navigator -- 
encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Bring plenty of snacks and juice. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Stop at parks and play areas; kids need fresh air and exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Give children disposable cameras to capture the trip for all time.

PARENTING; A LITTLE LIGHT LEARNING; COLLEGES AND PARKS OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF 
CHILDREN'S CLASSES FOR SUMMER.

 Sarah Kneeland of Winnetka can't wait for the Pierce College summer catalogue 
to arrive in her mailbox. She loves to pore over the course descriptions, 
choosing the class that seems most appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Will she try her hand at theater? Learn vaudeville? Take choreography lessons? 
</P>
<P>
 She usually ignores the ponderous academic stuff. After all, Sarah is only 5. 
And besides, it's summer. The three R's can wait till September.  
</P>
<P>
 For a change, how about three S's: surfing, swimming and singing? Or P's -- 
puppet-making, piano-playing and puppy-training? Or M's -- modeling, 
map-reading and magic? 
</P>
<P>
 Parents seeking fun, creative and reasonably priced summer classes for 
children need look no further than the local park or college extension program. 
This season's lineup includes a vast array of interesting and even downright 
wacky programs that teach kids -- from about age 4 up -- everything from 
forecasting weather to building a bug zoo.  
</P>
<P>
 "The courses offer kids an opportunity to dabble, explore and be enriched -- 
without making a full commitment," said Sarah's mother, Ellen Fleischmann. 
"It's a smorgasbord approach, which works for young children who have a short 
attention span. And Sarah gets a kick out of telling people she goes to 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Such summer offerings are especially welcome now that many cash-poor schools 
have all but dropped elective subjects such as art, music and drama from their 
curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Bell of San Fernando, for example, is disappointed at the lack of 
serious art classes at the private elementary school her 10-year-old daughter, 
Dominique, attends. She fills in the gap by enrolling the girl in a six-week 
"Cartooning for Kids" class taught at Learning Tree University by a 
professional illustrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since she was big enough to hold a pencil or crayon, Dominique has 
considered herself the little artist," Bell said. "Her school doesn't emphasize 
art at all, and private classes are too expensive. But she is having a great 
time in this cartooning class."  
</P>
<P>
 Extension courses, which usually meet once weekly for four to six weeks, tend 
to be less structured and have fewer students than traditional school 
classrooms, so students have ample opportunity for hands-on involvement and 
personalized attention.  
</P>
<P>
 "And the people who teach the classes are experts in their fields," said Cindy 
Lieberman, program specialist at Pierce College Extension, "so students get the 
benefit of learning from someone who really loves their craft."  
</P>
<P>
 Non-traditional classes can also pinpoint a child's untapped talent or 
undiscovered interest, Lieberman added.  
</P>
<P>
 "The back-to-the-basics movement may help a kid be a better reader," she said, 
"but in summer maybe they'd rather be a puppeteer. Or a magician. This is an 
inexpensive way to introduce kids to a lot of different subjects."  
</P>
<P>
 By expanding their world and mastering new skills, kids also get a boost in 
self-esteem, according to Carol Finkle, recreation program coordinator at the 
Creative Arts Center in Burbank, which offers drawing, painting, sculpture and 
clay classes, all taught by working artists.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see things like art, music and dance as natural ways to develop a child's 
self-image," she said. "Only a few kids will get an A in arithmetic, but 
everybody can create something. Our main purpose is to tap into the kids' 
creativity and give them an opportunity to do what they want -- not what they 
have -- to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And after all, it is summer.

PARENTING; CURES FOR SHOPLIFTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAMMERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 You just got a call from the Police Department. Your child was arrested for 
shoplifting. What happens now? 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on the juvenile's history," said Los Angeles Police Detective 
Jim Witowski of the Van Nuys Division."If it is their first or second arrest, 
and they seem to be doing well at school and home, I may release them to their 
parents -- and it will end at that. But if it is their third time, we will file 
criminal charges." 
</P>
<P>
 For many young people, the experience of getting caught, arrested and carted 
away in a patrol car may be enough to stop them from repeating the offense. But 
Witowski suggests that a trip to the police station and a chat with the 
juvenile detective may be in order even before the situation gets that far. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in one case, an 8-year-old repeatedly stole quarters from her 
mother's purse. In desperation, the mother called Witowski, who offered to talk 
to the girl. "The mom brought her in," he said, "and she saw some kids in 
handcuffs. They were sitting on a bench, waiting to go to Juvenile Hall. The 
little girl looked at them and broke into tears, and the mother hasn't had a 
problem since." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Witowski, juvenile detectives are likely to direct young 
first-time offenders into counseling or "diversionary" programs designed to 
discourage them from crime. Their parents are often sent to court-sponsored 
parenting classes. "If I have the slightest indication that there is a problem 
-- if the kid has an attitude or seems to be leaning toward gangs or drugs, or 
if his parent seems to be losing control, I refer them to (such programs)," 
Witowski said. MARYANN HAMMERS

PARENTING; REACHING FOR ATTENTION; THERE IS NO PROFILE FOR THE TYPICAL 
SHOPLIFTER. BUT ONE EXPERT SAYS THEY HAVE A COMMON TRAIT -- THEY ARE TROUBLED. 
</P>

 Having ditched his first-period class, the 14-year-old boy was hanging around 
outside a convenience store with a few buddies when he decided he wanted some 
candy. So he went into the store, selected an 85-cent chocolate bar, and -- 
although he had plenty of change in his pocket -- walked out without paying for 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 And he got caught.  
</P>
<P>
 It hardly qualified as a major heist. But it was a crime. The police were 
called, and the boy was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the sheriff called me, my heart went 'boom,' " the boy's father said. "I 
found my son sitting in the back seat of the patrol car, crying his eyes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes like this happen every day, everywhere, from the priciest suburban 
enclaves to the grittiest urban neighborhoods. The young offenders are gang 
members and cheerleaders, class clowns and class presidents. They take 
everything from expensive clothing to potato chips. And while their motives for 
shoplifting vary from peer pressure to rebellion to a cry for attention, 
experts say the best time to intervene is before it starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents often wait till something happens before they do their teaching," 
said the father of the boy who stole the candy. "This experience caught me way 
off guard. I should have done more education and talked to my son about good 
values -- before the incident occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who think that their child is not the shoplifting type may be 
surprised to learn that there is no such thing, according to Police Officer 
Sandra Castillo. "There is no typical profile," she said. "You have the nice 
kids with hard-working parents, and you have the kids who steal because they 
have no money, and you have those who do it because they are hardheads." 
</P>
<P>
 But they have one thing in common, according to Marilyn Shore, a Westlake 
Village psychologist who specializes in teen-age issues: They are troubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You usually don't see shoplifting in the well-adjusted, involved teen," she 
said. "Shoplifting is a way of acting out: If they cannot fulfill their needs 
in a constructive manner, they do it destructively. And peer pressure during 
the adolescent years is so strong that if everyone else in their group is doing 
it, shoplifting may become the thing to do."  
</P>
<P>
 While there are no sure methods to prevent children from stealing, one 
effective measure, according to Shore, is to get involved in their lives. "In a 
warm, friendly, caring way, let your kids know you are concerned about what 
they are doing," she said. "Take 20 minutes sitting on the kid's bed with the 
door shut, and really listen, respond and ask questions. Talk to them about 
right and wrong. More than anything else, those one-on-one conversations let 
your child feel your love." 
</P>
<P>
 If parents learn that, despite their best efforts, their child has shoplifted, 
they should take immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to the youngster, suggests Peggy Wilson-Jordan, clinical director of 
Mid-Valley Youth Center, a Van Nuys residential facility for high-risk 
adolescents. "The kid may be trying to get someone's attention, or he may be 
depressed or unhappy and is stealing to fulfill an emotional need." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts stress that it is important that youngsters face consequences for 
their actions.  
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to give a very clear, calm message that what they did is not 
OK," Shore said. "(The children) definitely have to take the merchandise back. 
If it has already been eaten or used, they have to pay for it or provide some 
sort of service to the person they have offended." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy who pocketed the candy, for example, made amends -- at his father's 
insistence -- by spending two weekends doing odd jobs at the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cleaned windows, swept the floor -- did whatever the owner told him to 
do," the father said. "His friends came by the store, and they knew why he was 
there. I also grounded him to his room for two weeks. I felt kind of sorry for 
him, but I also felt it was important to not back down. And I think it worked. 
There have been no further incidents."

PARENTING; LIFE WITH BABY; PREPARATION CAN HELP MAKE THE FIRST WEEKS AT HOME 
WITH AN INFANT GO MORE SMOOTHLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You ate the healthiest foods, memorized books about pregnancy and childbirth 
and became a regular Dr. Kildare on labor and delivery procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, you've never prepared more for a single event than you have for the 
birth of your baby. But what happens after that? Are you ready for the 
transition to life with a little one? 
</P>
<P>
 While a car seat is required for bringing baby home from the hospital, parents 
should fasten their own seat belts for the changes that the little bundle of 
joy will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those first few weeks are wonderful, but they can also be difficult in ways 
parents never even thought about," said Tammy Yazgulian, the New Arrivals 
consultant at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. "Fortunately, just like there 
are ways to prepare for the birth of a child, there are ways to prepare that 
can make the transition easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the classic way to get a jump on the big change is by preparing the 
baby's home environment in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't wait until you're nine months along to say, 'Oh, let's get the crib 
up,' " said Yazgulian, who has two children of her own. "I see it happen all 
the time -- premature deliveries that come a week, two weeks or three weeks 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time," she advised, "you don't want to get it done too early 
because then you're just standing in the doorway wondering where the baby is." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa and Scott Nickerson of Woodland Hills set up a baby's room and pre-washed 
infant clothes in the weeks leading up to the birth of their son, Cale, 2 1/2 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really nice in the sense that I didn't have to rush around and do that 
stuff after he was born," said Lisa, who is also the mother of a 3 
1/2-month-old daughter, Esme. "The house was ready to have the baby in terms of 
physical things." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with setting up the crib, Yazgulian recommends that parents use the 
weeks leading up to delivery to prepare in other ways. They should start 
stocking up on diapers and, if the mother won't be breast-feeding, the kind of 
formula they plan to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "By doing that, you're preparing and also spreading out some of the expenses 
you are going to incur once the baby comes home," Yazgulian said. "It's also 
never too early to buy some child-proofing things like cabinet locks and 
electrical-outlet covers." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the readiness of the home, there is also the mother's 
post-delivery physical condition to consider. Antoinette Johnson of Northridge 
laughs when she remembers the weeks following the arrival of her daughter 
MacKenzie 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was denied so much sleep, I eventually started hallucinating," Johnson 
said. "I told my husband I was seeing baby faces on the walls." As a result, 
she has some pointed advice for other expectant mothers: "Rest now. Because 
you're never going to rest again." 
</P>
<P>
 Yazgulian said women can prepare somewhat for the disruption of their regular 
sleep pattern by getting in the practice of catnapping before the baby is born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moms should learn to rest when they can, especially during the day," she 
said. "Shade the windows, unplug the phone, put on some music or read. 
Basically, try and find a method that will help you relax and fall asleep when 
you need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the physical changes, parents should also be aware of the emotional 
transition they are about to experience. The relationship between a woman and 
her partner is invariably affected once they become parents. Attention once 
paid exclusively to each other is now focused, sometimes almost entirely, on a 
third person. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Nickerson said it is important for Mom and Dad to make time to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten a baby-sitter and gone out once a week since the birth of our 
first child," Nickerson said. "We just go out by ourselves, maybe only for an 
hour or two, and have a glass of wine or a beer and talk to each other. It's 
helpful to keep that relationship between a husband and wife separate." 
</P>
<P>
 Yazgulian adds that all the organizing and anticipating in the world can't 
fully prepare prospective moms and dads for the magnitude of what's ahead. "It 
sounds overwhelming, and for most parents, no matter how much you prepare for 
this transition, it's still going to feel that way," she said.

<P>
 For those getting ready to meet baby, experts recommend the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Select and get to know your pediatrician before the infant arrives. Talk 
with friends and/or secure some recommendations from the hospital.Make a list 
of questions and interview potential candidates until you find the one you feel 
most comfortable with. Find out how to contact the doctor during non-business 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take the car seat out of the box and learn how to use it properly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take a baby-care class at your local hospital. These classes might seem 
elementary on the surface, but they can be helpful, even to those who have 
experience caring for babies. Holding and washing the baby, and caring for the 
umbilical cord are just a few of the topics covered. Hospitals also offer 
infant CPR classes, a good idea for anyone who plans to be around a new baby. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get the birth announcements ready. It may not seem like a taxing job, but 
the point again is to eliminate stress once the baby arrives. You won't know 
when the baby is going to arrive, but you know who you are going to inform once 
that happens. So address and stamp the envelopes. Once the baby is born, all 
that's left to do is fill in the name, date, time, height and weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrange for a helper -- a relative or a hired professional -- and decide in 
advance what their responsibilities are going to be. GARY KLEIN

INSURER HALTS SALES OF QUAKE POLICIES; PROTECTION: WOODLAND HILLS-BASED 20TH 
CENTURY WILL PHASE OUT ALL HOMEOWNER COVERAGE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE ACTION 
WILL AFFECT 60,000 VALLEY PROPERTY OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move certain to shake up the Southern California insurance market, 
earthquake-battered 20th Century Insurance Co. said Thursday that it will stop 
selling earthquake policies immediately and phase out all homeowner coverage 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The big insurer's exit increases fears that consumers -- especially in the Los 
Angeles Basin -- will have trouble finding earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also prompted renewed calls for a national catastrophe insurance 
program such as the Natural Disaster Protection Act now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based 20th Century said it will take no new customers in either 
homeowner or earthquake insurance, but will concentrate on the cut-rate auto 
policies that form the bulk of its business and have fueled its 30 years of 
fast growth and high profits. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's action, negotiated last month with Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi, directly affects 240,000 homeowners and condominium policyholders, 
the majority of whom live in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 20th Century homeowner policy was sold in 1982 in the San Fernando 
Valley, where 60,000 homeowners are insured through 20th Century, about 26,000 
of them with earthquake coverage. As of last month, 20th Century had received 
22,700 earthquake damage claims from covered policyholders, most of them Valley 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our customers have already suffered the disrupting effects of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake," Neil H. Ashley, chief executive, said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize this is one more inconvenience, but it is the right thing to do," 
he added, citing about $600 million in quake claims that wiped out two-thirds 
of the insurer's surplus, or cushion against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Disruption aside, it will cost policyholders money. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi granted the company an immediate 17% increase on its homeowner 
rates, which will bring the average annual premium to $365 from $317, based on 
$117,000 of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 That is still cheap compared with the average of $441 in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. However, existing homeowner policyholders will be allowed only 
two more annual renewals before they are forced to shop elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer's 90,000 earthquake policyholders must find another carrier by 
their next renewal date. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said in a statement that he did not expect consumers to have trouble 
finding replacement coverage, but others have predicted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he says the market will absorb 20th Century (customers) no problem, I say, 
well, who?" said Stephen L. Young of the Independent Insurance Agents and 
Brokers of California, a trade organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, insurers have moved to curtail the growth of 
new earthquake and homeowner coverage in Southern California, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will be especially difficult for customers with quake-damaged homes 
to find new coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the state's largest carrier with 20% of the market, recently began 
a "managed growth" program for its California homeowners line, limiting the 
amount of new business it accepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking steps to limit our exposure," spokesman John Millen of No. 3 
Farmers Insurance Group said Thursday. "It's the prudent thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers recently raised the deductible on its quake policies to 15% from 10% 
and is "seriously reviewing the need for increased rates," Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millen said the real answer would be enactment of the Natural Disaster 
Protection Act, whose passage this year is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation would create a national pool for disaster coverage 
with a disaster insurance component built into all homeowners' policies. The 
premiums would be adjusted for regional risk of quakes, hurricanes, wildfires 
or other catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of 20th Century -- the eighth largest homeowner insurer 
statewide and believed to be the fourth largest in Southern California -- also 
may put upward pressure on homeowners' insurance rates over the long term, 
since 20th Century has been the low-price leader for the 12 years since 
starting that line of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, Garamendi noted that no other carriers have sought rate 
increases in homeowner insurance since January. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's withdrawal was forced by its shocking, $340-million 
first-quarter loss, brought on by more than 41,000 earthquake claims. On the 
day of its annual meeting two weeks ago, company directors voted to suspend the 
company's dividend for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was about to grant 20th Century's application to triple its 
earthquake rates, Deputy Insurance Commissioner Richard D. Baum said Thursday, 
but the company suddenly changed its mind and decided to stop selling all 
residential coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the disruption to policyholders, Garamendi negotiated an orderly 
withdrawal over two years, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century spokesman Rick Dinon said that between the time it applied for 
the rate increase and changed its mind, the estimated quake losses had 
ballooned by several hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street loved Thursday's move. The stock of parent 20th Century Industries 
jumped $2 a share, or 13%, closing at $17.75 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts have long questioned whether it made sense for 20th Century -- a 
hugely profitable auto insurance writer with the industry's lowest cost of 
doing business -- to diversify into residential coverage in the first place.

SWAT LEADS TO DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT AGAINST PROFESSOR; EDUCATION: BLACK 
STUDENT SAYS HE FELT HUMILIATED. INSTRUCTOR DOWNPLAYS WHAT HE CALLS A TEST OF 
WILLS OVER A FAILING GRADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An African American Cal State Fullerton student said Thursday that he is 
filing a discrimination claim against a political science professor who struck 
him on his bare behind with a ruler as punishment for dropping a class. 
</P>
<P>
 Keary Johns, 23, said he was desperate to keep a failing grade off his record 
so he could graduate this month when he agreed to drop his sweat pants before 
Prof. Emeritus Julian Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said that he broke away in tears after the first blow, and said the 
professor later tried to downplay the incident by remarking that black 
fraternity members go through much worse -- even branding each other -- during 
hazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way he would have done that to a white student," Johns said. "When 
he hit me, he stripped me of my manhood. It hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said Thursday that he "lightly swatted" Johns once with a ruler on 
April 27, but Foster said the incident started out as a joke and has since been 
blown out of proportion. Foster, who is white, insists that race played no 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish to God I had never done it," Foster said, "His being black had nothing 
to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, who had been on the school's faculty since 1963, also said he made the 
comment about black fraternity members, but insisted that it is being taken out 
of context.  
</P>
<P>
 The professor recently offered through his attorney to apologize and pay Johns 
$500 if the student dropped his complaints. The offer was refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns and Santa Ana civil rights attorney Ron Talmo said they will file a 
claim today against the professor and the university, alleging discrimination 
and assault and battery, and seeking $1 million in damages. The claim is a 
precursor to a lawsuit, and is the first step in legal action against the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the university could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
Sandra Sutphen, chairwoman of the political science and criminal justice 
division at Cal State Fullerton, said she could not discuss the student's 
allegations because she was unaware of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident took place just as the nation's attention was turned to 
Singapore, where an American teen-ager was awaiting a lashing with a rattan 
cane for a vandalizing spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Talmo and Johns are also involved in other legal action against the 
university. The lawyer is representing Johns and other students in a lawsuit 
alleging the university unfairly stripped him and other football players of 
financial aid they were entitled to after the school dropped its football 
program at the end of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said the dispute between Johns and his professor began in early 
April, when Johns went to see Foster about dropping a political science class. 
Johns said when he returned two weeks later, Foster told him he must be 
punished for his actions and offered two choices: Six whacks with a long ruler 
or a class failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The student said Foster ordered him to pull down his sweat pants and brace 
himself over a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still couldn't believe he was going to go through with it, but then he 
smacked me, hard," Johns said. "But I couldn't take it. I felt so humiliated. I 
stood up and said 'Go ahead, fail me.' I started to cry and he sat me down, 
trying to calm me down. And then I left." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he had submitted to the punishment because his grade-point average 
was already hovering near failure, and an incomplete grade in Foster's class 
would jeopardize his chances to graduate on time. Foster ultimately allowed 
Johns to drop the class without being penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a bind. I needed to graduate," said Johns, who said he fled the room 
after the first blow because the humiliation of bending over a chair, with his 
bottom exposed to the professor, became too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, however, said Johns first asked him for a grade of D, even though 
Johns never attended class. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, 67, said he planned to allow Johns to drop the class, but first 
lectured the student that he needed to "begin behaving like a responsible 
adult, instead of some child who needed a swatting when he broke the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The student then began laughing and said he would take a whacking if it meant 
he could drop the class without consequence, Foster said. The two then began 
trying to "outbluff" each other, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said it at first to get through to him, to let him know he was acting 
childishly," Foster said. "I wanted him to say "I'm sorry" and apologize for 
his behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Foster said, Johns astonished him by partially pulling down his sweat 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I flicked him with the ruler, I was kind of saying, "Get out of here, 
you won," Foster said, adding that the blow was very light.  
</P>
<P>
 "But his demeanor changed immediately. He began saying 'You hurt my pride.' 
And I told him I never intended to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns left and talked to his African American studies professor and later 
returned to confront Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when he tried to laugh it off," Johns said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said 'You know, It's my understanding that black fraternity members do 
much worse to each other, they even brand each other, I hear,' " said Johns, 
who does not belong to a fraternity. "Then he said, 'I'm sorry you couldn't 
handle it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Both say that Foster then signed the documentation Johns needed to drop the 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns participated in graduation ceremonies last week, but still must take a 
math class this summer to complete his undergraduate studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Frederick T. Mason, who represents Foster, said his client did a 
"foolish" thing but never intended to harm or insult the young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Foster made a mistake, but it's being blown out of proportion," Mason 
said. "The young man consented. It was not racially motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that his client had agreed to pay Johns $500 to make the complaint "go 
away," not because it had merit.  
</P>
<P>
 The student's father, Walter Johns, said Thursday he was shocked to learn his 
son was struck by a professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an abuse of power," said Walter Johns, who lives in Lancaster. "If I 
had another son, I wouldn't want to send him there. To do that to a grown man 
is just degrading." 
</P>
<P>
 ' I was in a bind. I needed to graduate. '

THE GREENING OF ANAHEIM; TOURISM: CITY WON'T WAIT FOR RESORT TO TRANSFORM SEEDY 
DISNEYLAND AREA INTO A LUSH GARDEN DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to remain competitive in the tourism industry, city officials 
said Thursday they are ready to transform the urban clutter surrounding 
Disneyland into a lush garden district with wide pedestrian walkways and 
tropical foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 Garish neon lights will be replaced with stately signage, and unsightly 
utility lines will be buried underground. Streets will be widened and large, 
so-called gateway posts will welcome tourists to the new "Anaheim Resort." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than four years, city officials have been working on plans for a 
massive overhaul of the 550 acres around Disneyland. The city's $200-million to 
$300-million plan is intended to go hand-in-hand with the Walt Disney Co.'s 
$3-billion expansion project, but will be implemented regardless of Disney's 
decision to build or abandon its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our vision and blueprint for the future," said Deputy City Manager 
Tom Wood, who released some of the details of the plan at a press conference 
Thursday. "We believe it's essential for us to go forward with this." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said approval from city agencies could come as soon as this 
fall, with construction phased in during the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Diego are fiercely competing with Anaheim for 
convention and tourism money, Wood said. And in a city such as Anaheim, which 
receives more than a third of its revenue from tourism, it is vital to compete 
constantly for the tourist and convention dollar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The urban decay around Disneyland's borders has long been a source of 
annoyance for Disney, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's revitalization plan has been a key issue for Disney officials, who 
are proposing to build a resort with more than 5,000 hotel rooms, a large 
shopping district, an amphitheater and a new theme park, called Westcot, next 
to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're totally supportive of the city's vision," said Doug Moreland, director 
of development for Disney, adding that the city's efforts "will bring more 
tourists into the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials, however, said Thursday they will not make a commitment on 
their project until mid or late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim will proceed regardless, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's a mess out there. We're beginning to get complaints from 
meeting planners out there," said Councilman Bob D. Simpson, who is also the 
executive director of the newly formed Anaheim Hotel/Motel Assn. "This (plan) 
is desperately needed. We need to keep pace with the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for Anaheim's grand vision will come from several sources but will 
mostly burden new development and hotel and motel owners in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A controversial 2% increase -- to 15% -- in the city's hotel bed tax is 
included in the proposal. The city also plans to tap developers of future 
projects and will consider imposing "special assessment districts" for storm 
drain and sewer projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the city will continue to seek county, state and federal funding 
for public works projects, such as widening streets and utility lines 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Anaheim residents will not be taxed for any of the 
improvements. And while the city is turning to the private sector for much of 
the cash, Wood said the city is trying to minimize the impact on business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to discourage growth in the area, we want to encourage it," he 
said, noting that the plans provides for the development of up to 16,000 new 
hotel rooms in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "These improvements will be installed during the next 10-year period to serve 
demand and future growth in the area," Wood said. "If the Disneyland Resort is 
undertaken within the next year or so, all of these improvements will be funded 
and installed sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will release its planning document, known as the specific plan, on 
Wednesday. The document will be open to public review for 45 days. Both the 
Planning Commission and City Council will hold public hearings and vote on the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * NO RESORT DECISION SOON 
</P>
<P>
 Disney says it'll take at least a year to make a final decision on big Anaheim 
expansion. A1

NEWPORT BEACH POLICE WANT CAMERAS IN CARS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CHIEF ROBERT 
MCDONELL SAYS VIDEOTAPING IS VITAL IN COURT CASES. HE ALSO WANTS EQUIPMENT FOR 
TWO HELICOPTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Believing that "a picture is worth a thousand words," Police Chief Robert J. 
McDonell said Thursday that he would like to see all of his department's patrol 
cars and helicopters equipped with video cameras later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something that has been in the back of our minds for some time," said 
McDonell, who will present the City Council on Monday with a proposal to 
purchase a $239,000 videotaping system for 29 patrol cars and two helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The fist-sized cameras, perched just below the rear-view mirror, would record 
pursuits and traffic stops and can be activated manually by the push of a 
button on a control console or be activated automatically whenever the 
vehicle's emergency lights are turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 The video image is relayed to recording equipment in the patrol car's trunk 
and cannot be erased or edited by officers, making the visual record a way to 
prove or disprove complaints of misconduct, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A wireless microphone can also provide audio for the taped images and can 
continue to operate for a certain distance even after the officer is out of 
camera range. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonell's request for the taping system comes at a time when the city is 
faced with a $3-million deficit and the Police Department plans to reduce its 
staff of sworn officers by five positions to 133 to cut its overall budget by 
$600,000 for the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 But McDonell said purchasing the equipment would actually save the city money 
in the long run because it would greatly reduce the amount of money the city 
has been spending to defend itself against police-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, the city has spent an average of $600,000 a year on lawsuits, with 
42% of that spent on legal fees, regardless of the outcome of the case, 
McDonell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the cameras will stop a lot of these claims before they are filed," 
he said. "We will be able to play these tapes and will have the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonell said the expense would include installation of the cameras, the cost 
of enough videotapes to last at least one year, a computer and program for 
tracking the tapes, containers, shelving for storage and other related 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department became the first law enforcement agency in Orange 
County to equip all of its patrol cars with video cameras. The department began 
experimenting with cameras in some cars in 1992, then installed the equipment 
in the rest of its fleet last year, Assistant Sheriff Dennis LaDucer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wins with recorders," LaDucer said. "They create a tremendous 
amount of public trust. When a deputy responds to a call, there's a 
disinterested third party there watching it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin, Los Alamitos and Garden Grove police departments have cameras in all 
or some of their patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Police Sgt. David Kreyling said the video cameras have been "a positive 
move with no negative side." 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove, seven of the department's 40 patrol cars have video cameras. 
Police Capt. David Abrecht said the department cannot afford to equip the rest 
of the fleet at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said a video camera would probably have been helpful in tracking down 
the killer of Officer Howard Dallies Jr., who was shot to death by a 
motorcyclist during a traffic stop in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have followed hundreds of leads in the case but have so far made no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "A camera would have been really helpful in getting an accurate description," 
Abrecht said. "It would have given us a lot more to work with."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 4 CHILDREN SAVED FROM HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four young children escaped unharmed Thursday morning when an adult noticed 
smoke coming from a bedroom closet, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam Nguyen, 30, was able to rescue his three children and their cousin -- all 
under the age of 4 -- and call firefighters to put out the blaze in the 1100 
block of North Berni St., just before 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen firefighters from Santa Ana and Garden Grove brought the blaze under 
control within five minutes, said Santa Ana Fire Department spokesman David 
Wadsworth.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the single-story dwelling was destroyed, and the eaves of an adjoining 
house were also damaged, Wadsworth said, adding that preliminary investigation 
indicates the children might have been playing with matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was eerily similar to one in Oceanside on Monday morning that killed 
four young children and their sleeping uncle. Investigators said that fatal 
fire, which was reported just after 8 a.m., was also caused by the children 
playing with matches in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
 All four San Diego County victims died of smoke inhalation, officials said. 
The children's parents, a Marine and his wife, were at work at the time of the 
fire. Smoke detectors in the apartment were melted so badly it was not possible 
to tell if they had sounded, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadsworth described the two fires as very similar and attributed the lack of 
injury in Santa Ana to Nguyen's being awake.  
</P>
<P>
 "Time of day in these things is essential, that's the difference," he said, 
adding that Nguyen had been asleep but woke up to go to the bathroom.  
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of the bathroom and saw smoke," Wadsworth said, giving him time 
to rescue the children and call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no smoke detectors in the house, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's grandfather, 58-year-old Thanh Van Nguyen, who rents the house, 
was at a dentist's appointment at the time of the fire, Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials estimated the damage to the house and contents at $75,000. MARK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; BOOK MAY BE TAKEN OFF 5TH-GRADE LIST 
</P>

<P>
 Fifth-grade students at Bryant Ranch Elementary School will finish reading "My 
Brother Sam Is Dead," but they may be the last fifth-grade class in 
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad hoc committee recommended Tuesday that the district restrict the book to 
eighth-grade classrooms starting with the next school year.Teachers at Bryant 
Ranch will be allowed to finish teaching the book because the students have 
nearly completed reading it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to pull it now," said Assistant Supt. Sharon McHolland. 
"Some students have already done their writing assignments and there isn't time 
to have them read another book." 
</P>
<P>
 McHolland said the district's curriculum committee will vote on removing the 
book from the approved fifth-grade reading list and placing it on the 
eighth-grade list when it meets in October. If the committee follows the 
recommendation of the ad hoc subcommittee, the novel will be replaced on the 
fifth-grade list by a book dealing with the Revolutionary War, she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VOLUNTEERS WHO HELP PAROLEES TO BE LAUDED

 Participants in a voluntary program that encourages attorneys to "adopt" adult 
and juvenile parolees will be honored at an awards luncheon in Irvine today. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to the Big Brother/Big Sister program, Volunteers in Parole (VIP) of 
Orange County pairs attorneys with parolees in an effort "to stop the revolving 
door of recidivism," said Janeen Foreaker, program director of the 
Anaheim-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
 VIP started in California in 1969 after Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. 
Burger challenged attorneys to play a part in helping parolees become 
law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County operation began in 1982, working solely with California 
Youth Authority parolees. In July, 1993, the California Department of 
Corrections joined VIP to provide assistance to adult parolees. Orange County 
is the only program that works with both adults and juveniles, Foreaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's supposed to be a fun program," according to Foreaker, who said attorneys 
sometimes take parolees out to hockey or baseball games, help them look for 
jobs or make financial plans, "or just meet for breakfast on a Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 "It introduces (parolees) to something new -- it expands their horizons a 
little bit," Foreaker said. "Usually they've been dumped on for a lot of years. 
They're sick of the drugs, they're sick of the gangs. They want to start doing 
something." ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FREE BOAT-SAFETY INSPECTIONS OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only one in 10 boats gearing up for summer voyages is properly equipped in 
case of an accident, according to the U.S Coast Guard Auxiliary. But the 
volunteer boating-safety group is hoping to improve those numbers by providing 
free inspections for boaters as the season gets underway. 
</P>
<P>
 A volunteer from the 2,300-member force in the southwest region will come to 
any Orange County harbor to perform an inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newport Dunes marina, auxiliary volunteer Dave Knight inspected Eric and 
Laura Wolff's 18-foot powerboat Tuesday, discovering that its flares were too 
old to work, the distress flag was inadequate and the motor and fire 
extinguishers needed to be secured. 
</P>
<P>
 Had a regular U.S. Coast Guard officer stopped the couple for a "compliance 
boarding" -- which it can do at any time and for any reason -- such violations 
could have cost the couple $100 to $1,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The auxiliary's services extend well beyond Safe Boating Week, June 5-11, and 
are designed to prevent the kind of accidents seen by the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department every year.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Terry Lundy of the sheriff's Harbor Patrol in Newport Beach has three 
major complaints about boaters around Orange County: They fail to pay 
attention, post a lookout or keep the boat maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of boating deaths involve alcohol use, according to Lt. 
Christine Gustafson of the U.S. Coast Guard's 11th District in Long Beach. 
Sober boating is the theme for this year's Safe Boating Week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard suggests selecting a designated driver for boating parties, 
but drunken boat passengers can also be a major problem. When passengers fall 
overboard, often disoriented by alcohol and fatigued by sun and glare, the 
breaking waves and cold water can be life-threatening, Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In this and other cases, "the cheapest life insurance you can buy is a life 
jacket," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Sheriff's Department reported 208 boating accidents countywide, 
down from 233 in 1992 and 244 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 During the winter, most boat losses result from leaks, according to Deputy 
Lundy. In the summer, Lundy said, collisions are the biggest cause of 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Capsizing is a major factor in boating deaths, according to Michael Ammon of 
the California Department of Boating and Waterways. Small boats are especially 
vulnerable if overloaded with passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of visibility and warmth, Ammon advises boaters to always stay 
with the boat if it capsizes. Flares should be lit if available, and boaters 
should huddle together in the water or on top of the capsized vessel for 
warmth. Parents should also take care that children do not slip out of 
oversized life vests. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the big mistakes we see is people trying to swim ashore for help," 
Ammon said.  
</P>
<P>
 To arrange a free boat inspection from the Coast Guard Auxiliary, call (800) 
869-SAIL. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MOUNTAIN LION CUB MOVES IN AT ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the county's newest residents was not too happy with the welcome wagon 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-week-old mountain lion, who was moved here Monday from Lassen County, 
jumped up a tree and stayed there panting and growling while about 100 
schoolchildren and some dignitaries welcomed him to his new home at the Orange 
County Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cubs are beautiful, but they are animals and they command our respect," 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said. "They are indeed Orange County residents." 
</P>
<P>
 The cub's mother was shot and killed by a rancher last month. The cub was 
found May 10 in the mountains between Susanville and Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Fish and Game Department had issued the rancher a permit to 
shoot the cub's mother because she had attacked a herd of goats in the area, 
according to zoo director Forrest de Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The tawny cub, which weighs 12 pounds, seemed frightened by the noise the 
children made just before he entered his new home. He hissed and growled but 
remained on a branch. The cub will grow to 160 pounds in a year or two, de 
Spain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zookeepers will feed him a "carnivore diet" consisting of food mountain lions 
normally eat in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez will be one of the people to pick the lion's name July 31 when the 
zoo's "name-that-cat" contest concludes. Any visitor to the zoo, at Irvine 
Regional Park in Orange, can submit a name. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; THE WILD, WILD WEST, FROM A KID'S VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing red bandannas and cowboy boots, more than 400 schoolchildren on 
Thursday celebrated the good, the bad and the ugly aspects of life in the Old 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to excite children about history by providing interesting educational 
activities, Fay Fryberger Elementary School's fourth annual Western Day offered 
a bonanza of events such as horseback rides and panning for bits of 
gold-colored rock. 
</P>
<P>
 By high noon, the students had learned how to draw Native American pictographs 
and had viewed antique cooking paraphernalia, including coffee grinders, butter 
churns and toasters. The playground posse sipped "sarsaparilla," which was 
really root beer, and made paper tepees as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a celebration of our Western heritage and students love it. This really 
brings it to life," said teacher Ann Hosier, who coordinated the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said they enjoyed learning about events that occurred long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the funnest things in my whole life," 6-year-old Darrell Gramm 
said after climbing down from a horse named Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I panned for gold. I would have liked to have lived in the Old West because I 
would have found a lot of gold," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, students eager to find a fistful of "gold" nuggets crowded around a 
plastic wading pool filled with sand and murky water. With pie tins in hand, 
the children showed true grit in finding the gold-painted rocks during a timed 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, 8-year-old Josh Kessler said he wouldn't want to live in the Old West 
"because they didn't have cars and you always had to walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh pointed out that although old-time cowboys did have horses, cars are 
better "because you can fall off a horse." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; EX-INMATE RAMS HIS CAR INTO JAIL GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old former jail inmate, allegedly high on cocaine, rammed his car 
several times into gates at the county jail and coroner's office Monday night, 
police and sheriff's officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Alan Martens of San Clemente was seen by off-duty sheriff's deputies 
deliberately driving his car into the main gate entrance of the jail's 
intake/release center at 550 N. Flower St., said sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Martens then backed up his car and rammed the gate a second time before 
driving into the parking lot of the coroner's office, located at the same 
address, and ramming into the gate entrance there. 
</P>
<P>
 Martens was arrested at the scene. He was taken to Orange County Jail on 
suspicion of damaging county property and for allegedly being under the 
influence of drugs. He was cited and released, jail officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police Lt. Robert Helton, whose department assisted in the arrest, 
said authorities have not been able to determine the motive for Martens' 
actions. He was briefly incarcerated in the county jail in 1992 after being 
arrested on charges of robbery, burglary and grand theft -- charges on which he 
was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison, according to the state 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does have a criminal record," Helton said. "It could be him just taking 
out his frustration and anger toward authority." GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; AREA REZONED FOR HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved a request from a developer to build houses 
on a lot currently zoned for commercial and church use, altering its zoning to 
designate it high-density residential. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch will allow the developer to build a maximum of 10 units per acre, a 
higher density than allowed under the commercial zoning.The eight-acre lot is 
on the southeast corner of Yorba Linda Boulevard and Village Center Drive. 
Although it has been zoned for commercial and church use since the East Lake 
Village planned community was developed more than 10 years ago, there has never 
been any interest from businesses in building there. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearby residents did not object to rezoning the property from 
commercial to residential, several complained about the change from medium 
density to high density. They contend that building houses on 5,000- to 
6,000-square-foot lots next to their 10,000-square-foot lots will negatively 
affect their home values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very concerned about density," said David Crumley, whose house on Via 
Ventosa backs up to a lot in the proposed development. "I purchased (my house) 
seeing low-density everywhere and didn't anticipate high-density housing 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Crumley's house is in a neighborhood that has about 2.9 houses per acre. S and 
S Construction is planning to build 43 houses on the eight-acre lot, creating a 
density of 5.2 houses per acre. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; GRADUATING ON . . . TO KINDERGARTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The graduation ceremony had all the trappings of a high school commencement, 
except the graduates were 4 and 5 years old. They wore caps and tassels and 
received diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the ceremony took place at Buena Park High School, the graduates 
were 32 Lil' Coyote Preschool students who took part in a yearlong course in 
which 75 high school students learned parenting and teaching skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The graduates had just completed a 13-week session aimed at teaching the older 
students how to care for children and to teach preschoolers how to spell their 
names, tie their shoes, learn colors and count all the way to five. 
</P>
<P>
 Altalagi Valentin, 16, gave hugs and kisses to some graduates while her 
classmates cheered and slapped hands. Some cried as they watched the young 
students graduating. 
</P>
<P>
 After the graduation, Altalagi sat 2-year-old Penelope Brown on her lap while 
giving her cake. The pair later held each other and sang a song first in 
English, then Samoan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to take this class because I like being around kids. But I didn't 
think I would get so attached to them," Altalagi said. "All the drawings they 
did for me, I keep up on my wall at home. They're my pride and joy and I'm 
grateful for the experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The class is not mandatory but its popularity grows each year, said home 
economics teacher Barbara Bressler, the program's creator and director. She 
started the course 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the program has received national recognition when it was twice 
nominated for a top educational award, and also helped her get "Teacher of the 
Year" honors from local civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Bressler said 40 children and grandchildren of Buena Park teachers, employees 
and residents are enrolled in the preschool. The remaining preschoolers will 
graduate when they are old enough to go to kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Bressler said most of the students who take the class plan to become teachers. 
She explained the program's increased popularity to its "real-life" lessons and 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 She works with area preschools, where she arranges volunteer jobs for her 
pupils. She also finds baby-sitting jobs for them and gets local businesses to 
donate snacks for the preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Schoner, assistant principal, said students are attracted to "good 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep (the program) because it's a worthwhile learning experience," he said 
</P>
<P>
 The students "are learning how to be responsible and organized," Bressler 
said. "And, they learn what it takes to be a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Johnson, 17, said she was sad to see her class coming to an end. "I 
hate to watch the kids graduate because I won't get to see them everyday and I 
just love them. They're so cute." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; UNCOUNTED BALLOTS MAY DECIDE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 550 potentially crucial uncounted ballots in the close City Council race 
could be tallied as soon as today, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the uncounted ballots were mailed or were absentee ballots filed on 
Election Day, said Rosalyn Lever, an assistant to the county registrar of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 She said there is also an unspecified number of ballots that were not counted 
because they contained write-in candidates or were somehow damaged by the 
counting machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Any ballot that contains any writing for a candidate for any office is pulled 
out and forwarded to the registrar of voters without being counted at the 
precincts, Lever said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point resident Bonnie Streeter ran an unofficial campaign for county 
sheriff and received at least 10 local votes that remain uncounted, said Ernest 
A. Nelson, the candidate who placed fourth in the race for three open council 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were about 14 different (Dana Point) precincts that had some ballot 
cards pulled out," Lever said. "There are also some out there that the machines 
crunched on election night. We'll get them counted as quick as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining ballots are considered crucial because only 69 votes separate 
the top four finishers. Because of the unusually low turnout -- only about 30% 
of the registered voters -- and the 12 candidates in the race, it took far 
fewer than the expected 3,500 votes to win a council seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Toni Gallagher was the top finisher with 2,604 votes, followed by Councilwoman 
Karen Lloreda and Harold R. Kaufman with 2,576 and 2,555 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Still considered in the running are Nelson and Bill Shepherd with 2,535 and 
2,416 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the top finisher received only 13.6% of the vote, there will be no 
runoff under city law.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MAYOR CRITICIZED FOR AUTO CLUB DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce harshly criticized Mayor 
Sandra L. Genis on Wednesday for holding up a project that could bring hundreds 
of jobs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ferryman also called opponents of the plan to expand the headquarters of 
the Automobile Club of Southern California "a parade of anti-business groupies 
that crawl out of the woodwork every time something of any value comes before" 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday delayed approval of a 500,000-square-foot expansion 
of the auto club's offices here. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after Genis grilled city staff for more than two hours about 
details of the environmental impact report. The council delayed its vote on the 
EIR until June 20. The mayor told traffic consultants she believes the project 
will produce more traffic than the EIR shows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the auto club's plan for its offices at 3333 Fairview Road is approved, the 
company will become the city's largest employer. A study estimated the 
expansion could bring about 1,300 jobs and add $2.3 million yearly in retail 
sales and services to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis, a professional land-use planner, was elected to council after she and 
other residents sued in 1987 to block a 3.2-million-square-foot project on the 
Segerstrom Home Ranch, next to the auto club. She said at the council meeting 
that the auto club's large development could cause serious traffic and housing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her intimidating manner with the staff and everyone else she comes in contact 
with is totally unacceptable, unprofessional and offensive," said Ferryman, in 
a public statement authored on behalf of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any other city in the state would be and are in fact trying to persuade the 
auto club to come to their city," Ferryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis quickly defended her actions.

 "These questions had been submitted in writing by the public and had still not 
been answered," the mayor said. "I guess if you ask six times to get an answer 
you're supposed to quietly go away and shut up. That's not what I was elected 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Allan L. Roeder said, "Obviously when we got to Monday evening, 
we weren't fully prepared to address (the questions). There frankly was nothing 
raised Monday night that should have been a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 His staff is now preparing answers to the questions from Genis and residents, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Peter F. Buffa, who abstained from the EIR vote because he has 
worked for the company that did the environmental study, said he is concerned 
about the fate of the auto club expansion.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream project for the city," Buffa said. "I would be surprised if 
other cities in Orange County haven't been waltzing them." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the auto club declined comment on whether other cities have 
tried to woo the project away. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO PUT PAINTING BACK ON DISPLAY

 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy decided Thursday to rehang an oil painting that 
was removed from a City Hall gallery this week after an employee complained 
that it was offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came after the city's Arts Commission passed a resolution Thursday 
morning in support of displaying the work, which depicts a family in the 1930s 
eating watermelon at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the work represented the artist's recollections of a 
family outing at Seal Beach when she was a young girl. The artist is white. 
Figures in the painting have brownish skin. 
</P>
<P>
 A city employee told officials Wednesday that the painting was stereotypical 
and denigrated black people. Murphy said he knew of no other complaints about 
the work, which was one of 30 selected to appear in a new exhibit at City 
Hall.SHELBY GRAD

<P>
 A 5K/10K run to benefit the South County Safe Rides program will be held 
Saturday in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo-based program arranges confidential transportation home for 
teen-agers in South County who have been drinking on weekend evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners interested in participating can register on the morning of the 
competition, which starts at 7:30 a.m. Registration costs $18. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will get computerized race results, a T-shirt, a bag of giveaways 
from local merchants and will be eligible for a drawing. Aerobic warm-up and 
massage therapy will be available before and after the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by TJ Maxx clothing stores, all proceeds from the race will go to 
the teen program. 
</P>
<P>
 South County Safe Rides tries to keep teen-agers who have been drinking at 
parties off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone line operated by volunteers in South County takes calls from teens 
on Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is run by the Boy Scouts of America and is assisted by several 
businesses in the community, including TJ Maxx clothing stores and Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Rides needs about $25,000 annually to operate and is funded through 
donations and fund-raising events such as Saturday's 5K and 10K runs. Last 
year's event raised $10,000 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also are needed. Those interested in participating are given 
training, which is offered every two months. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the program, call (714) 831-6311. The hot line number is

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY DENIES CLAIMS FROM TWO GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has rejected two claims filed against the city -- one from a 
group of fire victims and another from seven Police Department employees whose 
personal conversations at work were taped without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 As is usually the case with such claims, the council unanimously rejected them 
without comment. Often such claims are a prelude to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim by El Morro Mobile Home Park fire victims was the first to be levied 
against the city since the October blaze, which damaged or destroyed more than 
400 homes in and around Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21 victims are asking for a total of more than $880,000 from the city. 
They contend that Laguna Beach failed to properly inspect or maintain land 
around their homes or to provide a sufficient water supply or an adequate 
fire-suppression plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The police employees' $10,000 claim involves the discovery in January that 
some workers' personal conversations were being taped. The Orange County 
district attorney's office is also investigating that matter, which police 
officials say resulted from faulty equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Tuesday, the council unanimously agreed to begin formal 
discussions with the state regarding the possibility of creating a soccer field 
on a strip of state-owned land behind El Morro Elementary School. Proponents 
say the field is sorely needed, because the sport's popularity has mushroomed 
and Laguna Beach has only one field. That field, at Moulton Meadows Park, is 
not regulation size. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also voted 5 to 0 to buy 17.5 acres in the Canyon Acres area for 
$102,000 to preserve as open space. The purchase was made possible because of a 
recent agreement between the city and Laguna Beach County Water District that 
allows the district to build a 3-million-gallon reservoir in the Top of the 
World neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that agreement, the district will pay the city between $174,000 and 
$550,000, depending on a judge's decision. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; '50S, '60S ROCK MUSIC CONCERT STILL ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will have a park concert this weekend over the objection of several 
neighborhood residents who are concerned about traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members thought the Sunday concert at Rimgate Park, near Lake 
Forest Drive and Trabuco Road, was too close at hand to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do that?" asked Councilwoman Ann Van Haun. "Let's go ahead and have it 
because we've never put one on before." 
</P>
<P>
 The council heard a report from Human Service Director Joseph D'Onoffrio and 
decided that security arrangements for the show will be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who live near the park objected to the concert, expressing 
fears that gangs might pose a threat. Residents also wanted the council to 
block off the streets around the park to eliminate congestion in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 p.m. concert will feature rock groups playing music from the '50s and 
'60s, entertainment that Van Haun said "isn't likely to attract youngsters in 
large numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 The streets will not closed off, Van Haun said, because city plans for parking 
and traffic flow are well organized. FRANK MESSINA

ROBBER CONFRONTS MAN AT CARPORT, TAKES VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An armed man surprised a motorist returning home Thursday afternoon, ordered 
him out of the car and then escaped in the vehicle, police said. The motorist 
was not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 3 p.m., the 57-year-old victim pulled his 1990 Honda Accord into 
the carport area behind his apartment complex in the 15300 block of Golden West 
Street, Huntington Beach police Lt. Louis Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in his 20s with short blond hair, wearing a white T-shirt and dark 
baseball cap, pointed a blue steel automatic pistol at the motorist and ordered 
him out of the white, four-door vehicle, police said. The gunman then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle's license plate is 2TCX389. Anyone with information regarding the 
theft is asked to call the Huntington Beach Police at (714) 536-5951.

COUNTY AGREES TO TURN OVER LIBRARY TO MISSION VIEJO; SERVICES: THE TENTATIVE 
PACT IS PROMPTED BY SYSTEMWIDE BUDGET WOES. THE CITY WOULD BUILD A BIGGER 
BRANCH FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a $9-million library budget deficit, the county has tentatively agreed 
to turn over a local branch to city officials who then want to build a new, 
bigger library. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough agreement came Wednesday when the county decided to shift to 
Mission Viejo nearly $1 million in annual tax revenue from a countywide special 
assessment district to help the city operate a new library expected to be built 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo taxpayer funds were enough to operate the existing, badly 
undersized branch library, but aren't sufficient to pay for a new 
25,000-square-foot building envisioned by local residents for the past several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the county, said Mayor Susan Withrow, "means that the hopes 
and dreams of our citizens are becoming a reality. We'll be able to provide our 
children with the information technology of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who participated in the meeting with 
Mission Viejo officials Wednesday, said the agreement establishes "a working 
partnership. This partnership will provide a great opportunity for citizens at 
a time when there is great uncertainty over how to fund library services." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the details of the accord are yet to be finalized, the two sides have 
agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Turn over tax revenue for library operation by the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contract to staff both the current and future library with county personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transfer the deed for the current library site -- valued at about $1 million 
-- to Mission Viejo. City officials say the library will eventually be sold and 
the proceeds applied toward constructing the new facility, expected to cost 
roughly $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guarantee access to the future library for all cardholders in the county 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing is everything," Withrow said. "The county's library budget picture 
looks very bleak right now. And I think (county officials) see that the city of 
Mission Viejo is willing to substantially contribute financially to a new 
library and wants to increase library services." 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to build the new and larger library at Marguerite Parkway and 
La Paz Road within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the council announced it was negotiating to trade 7 1/2 acres 
at Los Altos Street for about four acres next to a plot on Marguerite Parkway 
previously earmarked for the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the land trade are expected to be finalized next month. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials anticipate someday building a City Hall on the new library 
site, turning the intersection into a Civic Center complex. 
</P>
<P>
 They have high hopes for a new library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to be able to plug into local school houses, computer information 
services and have adequate CD-ROM stations," Withrow said. "I hope to be able 
to equip that library with programs and technologies to meet the needs of every 
generation in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Withrow said the council wants to increase library hours at the existing 
branch from 35 hours to approximately 55 hours and increase spending for new 
books.

BUENA PARK DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved new guidelines for architects designing fences 
and landscapes for multifamily developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines were adopted Monday on a 4-1 vote, with Mayor Donald L. Bone 
opposed.Council members also heard the first reading of zoning amendments 
drafted to enforce the guidelines. They will hear the second reading and vote 
June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in requests to the Planning Commission for reviews and variances 
for security fences prompted the council to order a staff review of zoning for 
fences, parking and landscaping, according to Rick Warsinski, assistant 
director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is the revised architectural design guidelines, which were drafted 
by the development services staff and the Planning Commission together. The new 
guidelines, Warsinski said, "promote the integration of the design of fencing 
with the design of landscaping." 
</P>
<P>
 The section on fencing sets rules for materials, setbacks, color, landscaping 
and screening. One change requires some ornamentation on fences to discourage 
straight lines of metal, Warsinski said. Fences also are limited to six feet in 
height in yards next to streets. The set-back rules require that solid fences 
be at least five feet from the front yard property line, though open fences 
could be as close as three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone said he opposed the measure because of concern about new setback 
requirements for fences and rules governing larger turnaround space in parking 
lots.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have in the older part of town a lot of shotgun lots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some units, the turnaround radius would require perhaps taking a parking 
stall out, and parking is at a premium. We have to set some priorities here -- 
parking or security," he said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior planner Leslie Kyle said those problems could be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.

JUDGE SAYS PARENTS' 911 CALL NOT RELEVANT IN FATAL RAT BITE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for a homeless couple accused of letting a pet rat kill 
their infant son suffered a setback Thursday when a judge refused to let the 
jury hear an emotionally wrenching 911 recording made the night the baby died. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the ruling, Orange County Superior Court Judge Kazaharu Makino said 
the tape would have a "substantial emotional impact" and could unfairly sway 
the jury. Makino added that the parental grief heard on the tape "is not 
relevant" to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen and Steven Giguere Sr. are on trial for involuntary manslaughter and 
child endangerment in the death of their 4-month-old son, Steven Jr., who was 
bitten more than 100 times by the starving animal last August. The couple faces 
up to six years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense was hoping that the 911 tape would rebut damaging testimony 
against the couple, which has portrayed them as extremely neglectful parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Day One these people have been made out to be pretty miserable people," 
said attorney William Watson, who represents Kathyleen Giguere. The tape " 
would have shown these are people who clearly cared about their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has argued that the couple, who were living with their infant 
son and a 3-year-old daughter in a filthy, trash-strewn station wagon, were 
criminally negligent by allowing the rat to roam free in the car. The couple 
were not around when the rat's teeth struck an artery, causing the child to 
bleed to death, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense maintains the baby died of sudden infant death syndrome or a 
congenital breathing disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 With the jury out of the courtroom, both parents wept Thursday afternoon as 
they listened to their 911 conversation being played. Both parents could be 
heard crying into the phone as emergency operators instructed the couple how to 
administer CPR to the infant, who had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Makino, however, permitted the defense to provide the jury with a transcript 
of the five-minute phone emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense concluded its case Thursday. The jury is expected to begin 
deliberating early next week.

VILLA PARK IRRIGATION OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY TO ILLEGAL MINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The general manager of an Orange County water district pleaded guilty Thursday 
to running an illegal mining operation that damaged a popular county park and 
destroyed wetlands that were home to endangered birds. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Magistrate Judge George H. King ordered that David H. Noyes, general 
manager of the Serrano Irrigation District in Villa Park, pay a $2,500 fine and 
remain on probation for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Smith Sand and Gravel, a Corona company hired by the water district to 
do excavation work behind the Villa Park Dam reservoir, also was ordered to pay 
the county $25,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Noyes could not be reached for comment and a trucking company official 
declined to talk about the case.  
</P>
<P>
 In a previous interview with The Times, Noyes denied that officials with the 
water district did anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities charged Noyes and the trucking company with a single 
misdemeanor violation of the federal Clean Water Act, alleging that they 
discharged fill material in a delicate wetlands area behind the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the water district received a federal permit to remove silt material 
that had washed down from Weir Canyon and settled behind the reservoir. Under 
the permit, the water district and its contractor were allowed to excavate 
approximately 8.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey C. Eglash said the water district instead 
excavated 25 acres, including extremely sensitive wetlands that are home to the 
Least Bell's Vireo, a songbird on the nation's endangered species list. The 
bird, which inhabits Southern California's willow woodlands, has few such 
places left to nest. 
</P>
<P>
 Eglash said the water district and trucking company sold the excavated 
material at a substantial profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage caused by the additional excavation will cost the county an 
estimated $2 million to restore, Eglash said. County officials have sued the 
water district in Orange County Superior Court to recover the costs, the 
prosecutor said.

THE CHANTAYS' 'NEXT' WAVE; O.C. SURF ROCKERS EMERGE FROM PIPELINE WITH KILLER 
ALBUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What is it with these Chantays? 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the Santa Ana-born surf band refuse to go away, but after three 
decades its members now have the audacity to suddenly go frisky on us. These 
days the group is blasting out sproingy, driving surf instrumentals with the 
sort of verve its members exhibited back in their teens. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, was when they conquered the world with "Pipeline." Their 1962 
composition became one of the most immediately recognizable and enduring 
instrumental anthems ever, requisite material for every garage band and covered 
by everyone from the Ventures to a 1988 Grammy-nominated pairing of Stevie Ray 
Vaughan and Dick Dale. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a few good years. Not rich ones, since these were the days before 
bands had attorneys, but ones rich in experience , putting on local dances, 
touring, surfing, sharing each other's friendship and jokes and receiving 
holiday cheese logs from Lawrence Welk after they were the first, and likely 
only, rock band to appear on his show. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1964 British Invasion, however, all that -- except the cheese logs 
-- came to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our work stopped almost overnight. You couldn't sell an American band," 
guitarist Bob Spickard recalled recently. Surf music went from being the 
coolest on the block to an instant anachronism, and it had to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of their contemporaries, the Chantays eventually split up. The 
members kept playing music, going with the trends of the day. After "American 
Graffiti" made nostalgia hip, some surf bands regrouped, though most -- 
including for a long time the now-revived surf stegosaurus Dick Dale -- kept 
their roots at arms length, often playing with a numbing '70s lounge 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently that might have been said of the Chantays. Indeed, the fact 
that it was said in a January review of one of their shows prompted the band to 
shake things up, they say. If so, the group's just-released "Next Set" album is 
a winning bit of proof that we critics provide some not entirely leech-like 
function. 
</P>
<P>
 The album is a just-about thrilling return to the Chantays' surf roots, 
freshly assaying such classics as their own "Pipeline" and "Blunderbus," the 
Bel-airs' "Mr. Moto" and the Pyramids' "Penetration," as well as several new 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's those, with such titles as "Killer Dana," "Bailout at Frog Rock" and 
"South Swell," that are the real kickers, true to the surf form, but evolved 
with adventurous arrangements and razor-sharp playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The album is available at Tower Records' El Toro and Costa Mesa locations. The 
band will perform at the Costa Mesa Tower tonight at 5:30, as well as at the 
Rose and Crown in San Clemente on June 19 and the Heritage Brewing Company in 
Dana Point on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the impetus that turned the band around, they clearly didn't need 
much nudging. It only took them a couple of months to transform, throwing 
themselves into rehearsing and writing with the sort of zeal you see in '60s 
gladiator movies, when crusty galley slaves break their chains and shout, "Now 
let's show them how free men can row!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just an oldies band. We're old," declares drummer Bob Welch. "But 
we're portraying newness. Our sound now I think is even so much more energetic 
than what we were in the past. We're all so excited." 
</P>
<P>
 At Laguna's Las Brisas restaurant last week, the four senior Chantays -- 
original members Welch, 49, guitarist Spickard, 48, guitarist-bassist Brian 
Carman, 48, and 1967 inductee guitarist-bassist Gil Orr, 55 (they were joined 
near the end of the meal by guitarist Ricky Lewis, 36, a Chantay since 1980) -- 
discussed their lively-upped selves over an all-you-can-eat brunch. And these 
guys can really put it away. 
</P>
<P>
 They're hoping to try the buffets in other towns soon. While most of their 
gigs in recent years have been casuals, weddings and the occasional club gig, 
they're actively looking now for a major-label signing and a chance to hit the 
road nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not so outlandish a proposition, considering Dick Dale's recent 
successes and a resurgence of interest in instrumental surf rock, noted by a 
recent front-page article in Billboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That article hit it on the head, saying that surf music never got to complete 
its natural cycle because the British (Invasion) came along," Carman said. 
"We'd like to get out there and let it finish the course." 
</P>
<P>
 They're a curious bunch. On one hand, they're now old enough to swap tales of 
back and cataract surgeries (When told the other band members thought he was 40 
instead of 36, Lewis quipped, "Aw, they've got Anheuser's disease"). Yet 
they're still young enough to still be out there surfing, biking and 
Boogie-boarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr is a retired service station owner and pump attendant -- a "petrol 
transfer engineer" he calls it -- and the rest run their own businesses. Though 
they have the musical skill that comes with age, they still can appreciate the 
kid-revered qualities of speed and volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of bored with even playing before," Welch said. "And now we're 
practicing twice a week, five hours at a time, and loving it. It's just a blast 
to play, and I'm not even in shape for this. I went through five shirts 
sweating at a gig the other night." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Carman: "Someone told us, 'You were just great, but you're going to have 
to ventilate Big Bob.' You know, I switched over to bass years ago and hadn't 
played guitar much in years, and I get shivers playing it now." 
</P>
<P>
 "So do the people in front of you," joked Spickard. 
</P>
<P>
 The band laughed, and Carman explained. "It's not funny. Well, it is kinda. My 
wife came to see us at the gig, and was sitting there at the front table. Then 
suddenly on the third song, 'Killer Dana,' she said it felt like her brain 
moved and her ear went with it. I noticed after a while she'd moved to another 
table. She still hasn't recovered." 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't shaking too many brains with their previous lounge-bound 
approach. Though the fire would flare up a bit on their old surf numbers, they 
were all but smothered by the cover tunes that surrounded them.  
</P>
<P>
 Orr said, "We work for the audience, and particularly at the high-school 
reunions and weddings we'd play, (the cover tunes) were generally what people 
liked to hear. But if you're doing 15 kinds of music a night like that you 
don't do justice to anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference now is we have to create our audience. Now we're going to play 
what we know is best," Carman said. "This is where our talent lies. I don't 
think there's any question about it. I feel so absolutely confident now that 
this is what we should be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first played the new songs we'd written, that's what really put the 
glue on it. When you haven't written something in so long, and then you feel 
good about it, there's no stopping you." 
</P>
<P>
 Carman says he hadn't written anything since the '60s. Back then, he and 
Spickard had composed "Pipeline" within six months of getting their first 
guitars, and recorded it two months after that. 
</P>
<P>
 They're working at a similar pace now: In addition to "Next Set," they have an 
album's worth of new material they'd like to record.  
</P>
<P>
 "Next Set" was recorded much the way the "Pipeline" was, in a rushed session, 
live with no overdubs. One day in March they set up in Dana Point at Michael's 
Supper Club (which is open these days only for banquets and such), brought in 
their vintage Fender amps and reverb units and portable recording equipment and 
recorded the 11-song album in as many hours. The session cost $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the tracks are instrumentals, they're not without stories.  
</P>
<P>
 "Killer Dana" is about a famous wave that used to break right near where they 
recorded the tune, before the harbor jetty was built. "South Swell" was 
inspired by a Mexican surf band Orr once saw in Cabo San Lucas. "Bailout at 
Frog Rock" is about a near-gnarly experience Carman and his son had on a boat 
off Catalina.  
</P>
<P>
 "We and two close friends almost drowned by Frog Rock. The music follows it 
completely: It was a nice slow cruise in the harbor, so the tune's intro is 
nice and pretty. Then all hell broke loose when we found there was a big gaff 
in the hull," Carman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new songs this time started with Carman and Orr, but all the members had a 
hand in them by the time they were recorded, and the writing credit is shared 
by all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read an article on R.E.M., how they've stayed together for all these years, 
and one thing they insist upon is sharing the credit," Carman said. "Otherwise, 
it leads to needless problems. A song doesn't work until you perform it with 
everybody anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Spickard, Carman and Welch have known each other since grade school. They 
formed the band, with other original members Warren Waters and Rob Marshall, 
while they were all students at Santa Ana High School in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Chantays means nothing. It was just one of several, including the 
Zantays and the Montays, that they'd tossed around. 
</P>
<P>
 Carman had an older brother in a band called the Rhythm Rockers that was a 
local sensation (its "Soul Surfin' " album is one of the best of the surf era). 
Hearing them practice in a neighborhood garage made them want to start their 
own band. 
</P>
<P>
 Spickard had gotten a $125 Barth guitar and amp for his 15th birthday. Welch 
"sold his soul" to his parents for a drum set, and Carman took the enterprising 
step of stealing his mom's credit card to buy a $47 Montgomery Ward guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 They borrowed some of their sound from the reverb-drenched sonic tidal waves 
"King of the Surf Guitar" Dick Dale was creating at Balboa venues. Unbeknown to 
Dale, they also borrowed his then-under-development Fender reverb unit.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was in for service at Fender once, and someone's dad knew someone there 
who borrowed it and let us have it for a week. That was our first experience 
with reverb, and we thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread," 
Spickard said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the reverb units were on the market, the Chantays were making 
money playing local dances, and Spickard and Carman bought their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Spickard and Waters saw the famous Hawaii Pipeline curl in a Bruce Brown 
surfing film, their song had been called "Liberty's Whip," after the Lee Marvin 
character in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." It also briefly was called "44 
Magnum." But when they saw that wave, they knew that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 The song that became an international hit was recorded in a small Downey 
studio in 1962, using their budget department-store guitars. It became a hit in 
early 1963, and the group recalls gigs where they headlined over the Beach 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Their success didn't sit well with everyone. Dale, they said, used to claim 
they had stolen the song from him, and when he would grudgingly accede to 
audience requests to play their hit, he would introduce it as "Sewer Line." 
</P>
<P>
 They snagged a three-month job playing in Hawaii, though that plum gig was 
offset by other road experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Carman recalled, "We had a gun pulled on us at Redwood City." 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't pull it on us," Spickard corrected. "They just showed it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what's that called?" Carman retorted. "This guy wanted us to hire him 
as a bodyguard. We said we didn't need one. He pulled the gun and we said, 
'Yeah, we do. We need one real bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Though the band's star waned in the U.S. after the Beatles hit, they got 
invited in 1965 to tour Japan, where instrumental music remained popular. By 
then, Welch and Carman had day jobs, and Spickard went, with other players 
filling in. "It was tremendous," he says. "For a couple of weeks we felt like 
we were the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
 They also enjoyed the Beatles, Stones and other British acts, though that 
sound did contribute to the Chantays' demise. There were other factors. Carman 
cites problems with their label, their distributor and their manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also were getting married, getting families and the responsibilities that 
go with them," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually they called it quits. Then in the '70s Spickard and Carman started 
doing club work as a duo. Orr, a guitar whiz who in his early teens had played 
alongside the likes of Jimmy Bryant, had joined the Chantays in 1967 and had 
hooked up with them again by the late '70s. Lewis joined them in 1980, and the 
following year they took on the Chantays name again. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years they had gone from being originators to a copy band, where 
it just happened that some of the songs they were copying were their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jobs forced that a lot," Spickard said. "We were doing a lot of casuals, 
and they wanted Top 40, so we learned it just to get work, and because we still 
liked to play. But to get work, we've gone through country, blues, the whole 
gamut." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the surf music they helped originate hasn't gotten much respect over 
the years, there have been some ratifying moments. Carman said, "I went and saw 
Los Lobos at the Greek two years ago with some good friends and our spouses and 
girlfriends. The band came out for their first encore and did 'Pipeline.' The 
audience stood up and started clapping with it, and I've never been so proud in 
my life. For a band like Los Lobos to be playing 'Pipeline,' it was just 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not beyond their dreams to get that kind of response playing their own 
music again.  
</P>
<P>
 "My goal for us is to get the record for having gone the longest time between 
hits," Carman said. "There's been the Meat Loaf phenomenon, but that's not 
anything if we can pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one sign we might make it is the reaction we've been getting in the 
dozen or so gigs we've done since we've started in again. It's incredible the 
response we've been getting, from both old fans and kids who have never seen us 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 "The compliments we've been getting are great," Spickard said. "Even my wife 
said, 'I've never heard you guys sound so good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carman said, "My wife thinks so too, and she can't even hear, now that her 
brain moved." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our old following says we're like a new band," Welch said. He likes 
that following and clearly is joking when he says the band's goal is to "Get 
signed; Get out of O.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they're "100% committed" to making a go of their music this time, they 
leave the impression they won't be too dissatisfied if it isn't a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's always been important, that's brought us together, is 
friendship, camaraderie," Spickard said. "We actually enjoy each other's 
company. This is our outlet. We laugh a lot. So, we'll see what happens."

O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN; FAME STEALS SHOW IN O.C. BROADWAY SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Herman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of it: Carol Channing starring in "Hello, Dolly!" again, 30 years after 
she originated the title role. Now that's chutzpah.  
</P>
<P>
 Next June, when she gets to the Orange County Performing Arts Center, which 
announced earlier this week that the musical will be part of its 1994-95 
Broadway Series, she'll be past 74. 
</P>
<P>
 More power to her. But do you really want to see a septuagenarian Dolly Levi? 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose there's no law against one. Dolly doesn't really have to dance in 
the show. She doesn't even have to sing. Channing's celebrated show-biz style 
owes more to talking her songs than singing them, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it makes you wonder how old Horace Vandergelder will have to be. Surely 
not a day under 80. (You remember him. He's the rich old boy she marries). 
</P>
<P>
 Other thoughts occur about the series. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, do theatergoers realize they'll be seeing "Jelly's Last Jam" with 
Maurice Hines in the starring role, not younger brother Gregory, who starred in 
the show on Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice happens to be a very fine dancer, but he doesn't quite have Gregory's 
charisma as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's face it: The center and every other theatrical venue booking these 
touring shows are playing a name game. It's the proven way to draw an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Osmond, coming next season in "The Sound of Music," is another 
transparent instance of easy attraction, and a more dubious one. 
</P>
<P>
 Given her wholesome image, Osmond playing the postulant nun made famous by 
Mary Martin promises to be even less of an artistic reach than her brother 
Donny is making in the title role of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor 
Dreamcoat." 
</P>
<P>
 He's been such a smash hit in that touring show, first in Toronto and now in 
Chicago, that she'll probably be a bigger hit in this show in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask OCPAC executive director Tom Tomlinson for his thoughts on the name 
game, he says Channing "certainly owns the role" and that "the audience will 
look forward to seeing an established star who's a legend in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Osmond also gets his personal endorsement. "I went up to San Francisco 
to see her (performance)," he said earlier this week. "I was surprised -- 
that's the wrong word -- pleasantly pleased to see the good job she did. And 
the costumes and scenery were beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, it makes you grateful for the prospect of catching Petula Clark 
in "Blood Brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the show's mixed reviews as a downbeat musical, at least Clark will be 
coming to the center relatively fresh from her personal triumph on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped save "Blood Brothers" from closing when she stepped into one of the 
starring roles almost a year ago. Clark, who plays a desperately poor mother of 
nine children, left the Broadway production only last week to be in the road 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," also coming to the center, 
doesn't have a name star -- yet. But the producers are hinting strongly that it 
will. (Could it be Donny? Doubtful. He's on a different tour.) 
</P>
<P>
 The "Joseph" we'll be getting is the one coming from Broadway. It's the same 
version that went to Broadway from the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles where it 
played last year for almost five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to "Porgy and Bess." No name stars here. Marquita Lister will 
play Bess in this import from the Houston Grand Opera. It's doubtful you ever 
heard of her. 
</P>
<P>
 But if things go right with this new revival of George and Ira Gershwin's 
classic folk opera, nothing else in next season's Broadway Series will come 
close to touching it artistically. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of eight other opera companies have invested in the production, 
including the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson is justifiably proud of getting Costa Mesa on the show's itinerary. 
To make it happen, he said, the center gladly invested $50,000 of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted us to be part of its tour," he said. "That kind of opportunity comes 
along very rarely." 
</P>
<P>
 The money, which he regards less as an investment than as an added 
"cost-of-artist fee," comes from a reserve fund the center has for programming 
(a fund now "in excess of $1 million," Tomlinson said.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Grand Opera has done "Porgy and Bess" before. Opera Pacific 
brought one of Houston's earlier revivals to the center in 1987. But this one 
is said to be a revamp from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Porgy and Bess" will play the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles 
a week before coming south, that still shouldn't take the glory or the 
adventure out of the center's involvement.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: 3 DAYS OF THE NEWSCASTS, OR CAN EMMYS BE 
REVOKED?; MANY AWARDS HAVE JUST BEEN BESTOWED ON THE TOWN'S NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, 
BUT HOW WORTHY ARE THEY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 L.A.'s finest. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Emmy Award judges ruled Saturday, naming KTTV-TV Channel 11's 
"Fox News at Ten" the area's best daily 60-minute newscast and KNBC-TV's 
"Channel 4 News at 11" tops in the daily 30-minute format. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they represented all of 1993, the newscast awards actually were based 
on only one night of programming -- last Nov. 16 -- with stations not being 
told in advance precisely when they would be under scrutiny by the out-of-town 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how award-worthy are these Emmy-winning newscasts? Here's how they 
performed three nights this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Minus commercials, anchor chitchat, weather and sports, about half of Channel 
11's hourlong "Fox News at 10" was devoted to actual news. To its credit, the 
newscast did not boast about its Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 31 stories -- a dozen of which featured people in peril -- averaged nearly 
a minute in length, the longest being a five-minute D-day package that led the 
newscast. That was followed by a useful story reviewing the latest Los Angeles 
Police Department contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then "Fox News" rolled in the violent crime-and-misery stories, including the 
Oceanside fire that took the lives of an adult and four small children. 
Trampling on his right to grieve privately, "Fox News" lengthily showed the 
anguished father of the children coming apart and pleading: "Please, God, don't 
. . . no . . . God . . . no. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox News" capped this section of the program with its nightly running total 
of gun deaths in Southern California. Next came a spate of quickie headlines, 
the longest of which lasted 30 seconds. Meanwhile, nearly four minutes were 
devoted to the horse-race aspects of the coming Tuesday primary election, two 
minutes to a story about downtown buildings failing earthquake stress tests and 
90 seconds each to a follow-up on the Azusa bear shooting and a story reporting 
possible biological causes for women crying more than men. As if Hollywood were 
reality, the latter story was supported by clips of actresses bawling in 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox News" also gave just under two minutes to a feature on roller-coaster 
riders at Magic Mountain. "You guys have to have tough stomachs?" one was 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tough stomachs are mandatory for viewers at 11 p.m., where the notion of 
Channel 4, KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KABC-TV Channel 7 vying for a best news award 
is like Dr. Mengele, Jack the Ripper and Hannibal Lecter competing for the 
title of best surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, "No. 1-rated, Emmy Award-winning Channel 4 News at 11" -- as it 
called itself -- opened with the Oceanside fire story, also showing the poor 
father's terrible pain. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the half-hour newscast delivered about 14 minutes of actual news, 
including just over two minutes on those shootings of teen-agers at a San 
Marino party. Then came the quickies, plus a minute on the elections, a D-day 
story and a nicely done tie-in with a local veteran. "We're proud of you," 
anchor Kelly Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 And proud of "A Child Lost Forever," that evening's 1992 NBC docudrama whose 
"real story" -- did that mean the movie was false? -- the newscast 
self-servingly rehashed for 90 seconds. After more quickies (including Dian 
Parkinson's sexual-harassment suit against Bob Barker and a blurb on Bob 
Woodward's new book on the Clinton Administration), the "No. 1-rated newscast 
in all of Southern California" closed out in typical fashion by blowing kisses 
at the ensuing "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" and "Late Night With Conan 
O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Moyer: "Hey, tonight, Jay welcomes Little Richard." Lange: "Whoooooo!" 
Moyer: "Conan welcomes Fran Drescher." Lange: "Absolutely!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 T uesday . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Primary night found "Fox News" delivering a routine election newscast -- the 
usual returns plus reporters checking in from various headquarters, including 
free-spirit Jane Wells sharing her inner child with Republican senatorial 
winner Michael Huffington: "Y'know, I gotta tell ya, you're still sort of a 
mystery man to me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the elections predominated, "Fox News" did report gunplay at a 
graduation celebration, kids playing with matches as the possible cause of the 
fatal Oceanside fire, a mountain lion being captured in Escondido, a paternity 
suit against Michael Jackson and a study showing college drinking on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Emmy-winning "Fox News" did manage to cram in coverage of the 
Hollywood premiere of "Speed," which -- was it a coincidence? -- just happened 
to be a movie from 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting rave reviews," said anchor John Beard. "Sounds exciting," said 
substitute anchor Carol Lin. 
</P>
<P>
 As for excitement, Channel 4 expanded its late Tuesday newscast to an hour, 
with reporter Laurel Erickson providing the highlight with a perceptive look at 
the coming "street fight" between Gov. Pete Wilson and his Democratic 
challenger, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet technically, the newscast sank faster than a liberal in Orange County, 
opening with split-screen live pictures of Republican and Democratic 
headquarters, then cutting to Moyer: "You were looking at two live pictures. 
Let's put em' up again, on the left the Republican headquarters, on the right 
-- c'mon, let's see the picture -- the Democratic headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
 But no pictures. "Well," Moyer said, "you saw them (earlier) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse when Jess Marlow confidently began what was scheduled to be a 
tape-supported election analysis, then was victimized by a 13-second snafu that 
seemed like 13 minutes. He looked at the camera, waiting for the tape to come 
up. Seemingly frozen, he kept looking. Kept looking. Kept looking. Then he 
slowly lowered his eyes so that he was looking at his lap. He kept looking 
down. Then he slowly raised his eyes, again looking at the camera. Kept 
looking. Finally, tape came up. The wrong tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyer jumped in: "Y'know, Jess, what strikes me about all this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 After some ad-libbing, Marlow finally got his tape. But there were more 
mess-ups, such as Lange reporting that Huffington's GOP opponent, Rep. William 
E. Dannemeyer, was "very annoyed tonight -- he was quite angry," without saying 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 4's non-election news included a classic example of the gratuitous 
live stand-up, with reporter Beverly White, somewhere in Laguna Beach, 
reporting that four people from "the Laguna Beach area" may have died in a 
small plane crash in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Fox News" led with that day's widely felt earthquake in an isolated area of 
Bolivia, from which there were no early reports of damage or casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the next eight stories were about crime, six involving violence. 
Post-election coverage was devoid of thoughtful analysis. There were a strew of 
quickies. Buried near the end of the hour was a substantive story detailing 
criticism of President Clinton's plan to upgrade school lunch menus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolivia quake led that evening's "Channel 4 News at 11," too, preceded by 
a trademark tease from Moyer: "8.0 quake felt in Los Angeles, but centered 
somewhere else!" Making viewers wonder during the ensuing commercial break 
whether "somewhere else" meant San Francisco or San Diego was typical of KNBC 
-- using fright to lure viewers to the newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour also included an update on a Channel 4 investigation and the 
usual rat-a-tat-tat of headlines. But missing from this mix -- as if erased 
from memory -- was the one story that had preoccupied everyone on Tuesday. 
What? Nothing about the primary elections? Well, as this week proves, even 
L.A.'s finest aren't perfect.

ART REVIEW; THE RESURRECTION OF 'MADONNA AND CHILD'; ROGIER VAN DER WEYDEN'S 
MASTERPIECE, ON VIEW AT THE GETTY, HASN'T LOOKED SO GOOD IN 500 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Certainly among the rarest and arguably the finest old master painting in 
California is the Huntington Gallery's "Madonna and Child." Made by the 
legendary 15th-Century Flemish master Rogier van der Weyden, the late work is 
on loan to the J. Paul Getty Museum where it has been newly restored by 
paintings conservator Mark Leonard. It's now on view in an installation by 
curator Arianne Faber Kolb alongside two Getty paintings by Rogier followers. 
</P>
<P>
 One is "The Dream of Pope Sergius," whose toy-like town scape bespeaks the 
peace of Christian faith. The other is a "Deposition" that echoes Rogier's 
masterpiece in Madrid's Prado museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogier's genius lay in his ability to take the then avant-garde realism of the 
Van Eyck brothers and meld it with the undulating decorative line of the Middle 
Ages. The result is a combination of optical believability and spiritual poetry 
that conveys a sense of the Christian religious experience that is still 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Deposition's" rhythm of downward curves suggests a dirge accompanying the 
grieving Mary when, later, she rocks the body of the crucified Christ as if he 
were still a child.  
</P>
<P>
 He is in "Madonna and Child." He wriggles from Mary's arms to play with the 
Holy Book, not knowing what it contains for him. Mary looks on, sweetly sad, as 
if she senses what is in store for the infant she knows to have no father but 
God. She is heavily draped as if already in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 It has always been a poignant picture. In the past one wondered if that 
quality were not in part produced by its rather shabby physical condition. In 
Paris, before its acquisition by the Huntingtons in 1907, French conservators 
found its original wood paneling badly deteriorated. They painstakingly 
transferred the painting to canvas. The Huntington put it back on wood but it 
still bore the imprinted texture of the fabric and a nasty seam where the 
original support had cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard undertook the picture as part of a Getty program to assist other 
museums in the restoration of important paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning uncovered the old fissure and numerous gaps in the paint, but a 
picture otherwise in sound condition. Leonard fixed the damage with the care of 
a human computer painting one pixel at a time. In the process he discovered 
interesting stuff about Rogier's working methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a technique of Medieval artists, Rogier rendered Christ's halo with 
narrow strokes of viscous paint radiating from the child's head. These he 
covered with a sheet of gold leaf. When the paint was dry, he brushed away the 
excess leaf adding a magical effect in the otherwise highly realistic scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Depicted fabric and ornament seem to have physical substance. Flesh tones 
radiate the diaphanous glow of baby skin. The final restoration is as close as 
human ingenuity can get to a resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 Also newly on view is a show of 25 master drawings called "16th-Century 
Ornamental Designs." It's a useful reminder that old masters we now consider 
geniuses were also craftsmen working for patrons who did not always require the 
Sistine Ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 What I need today, Albrecht, is a nice design for my armorial signet ring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you were Albrecht Durer you probably grumbled to yourself about being 
under-appreciated by dunderhead fellow Germans, but you did it. Nice too. 
</P>
<P>
 Taddeo Zuccaro was considered a great artist in his day but he did not shy off 
the occasional design for a majolica or metal plate. Why should he when the 
ring of pagan nude lovers and warriors displays a talent equally at home doing 
grand domed ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of the job and not insignificant. Hans Baldung Grien was 
willing to subdue some of the weirdness of his proto-surreal style in his 
stained glass design, "A Monk Preaching." The high Mannerist Domenico 
Beccafumi's "Study for a Figure of Abraham" was for the pavement of a big 
commission he held for the cathedral of Sienna. Baldessare Peruzzi, a follower 
of Raphael, designed an altar for the same cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars love this sort of thing because it gives them the look of lost 
ornamental objects. Artists probably liked it because it was often a mark of 
their ability to handle projects both grand and intimate, the latter allowing 
them to let their hair down a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch Friedrich Sustris seems to relish the idea of doing an image of 
"Angels Bearing the Column of the Passion" for the etched glass lid of a 
reliquary. The contrast of weight and flight likely struck him as perfect for 
the translucent material. 
</P>
<P>
 Whimsy predominates in Theodor de Bry's design for a pendant where an owl sits 
on a grape vine holding a jewel aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 Both patron and artist seem decidedly light-hearted in Hieronymus Lang's 
design for a stained glass roundel with the arms of a married couple. In it a 
winsome lass holding a distaff gives a saucy glance to a farmer bearing a 
decidedly blunt but impotent implement. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW / MIKE BOEHM; PLAYING, WRITING IN THE PRESENT INTENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quiet intensity is Ben Harper's ticket to pop music's roster of all-star 
rookies for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old singer-songwriter from Claremont fired up a small audience 
Wednesday night at the Coach House without even leaving his chair. The seat was 
mandatory because Harper plays lap-style acoustic slide guitar steeped in the 
Delta blues tradition. But rather than position himself as another blues 
shouter, he explored the intensity that can come from focusing inward. 
</P>
<P>
 His singing was founded upon near-whispers, low moans and half-swallowed 
keening plaints. His vintage Weissenborn guitars moaned and quavered too, and 
rattled like the wind blowing through an abandoned desert town. The result was 
instant gravitas, a clear sense that the artist had more on his agenda than an 
evening's entertainment. His inward but dramatic bearing added to the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 His lyrics also conveyed a sense of mission. Some songs carried at least 
traces of lightness, but often they revealed a barely reined-in anger over the 
persistence of racial injustices, weariness in the face of insurmountable 
troubles, and a yearning for spiritual release. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harper did make room for one rambunctious element: a three-man, 
drums-bass-percussion rhythm section that played with far more force and drive 
than on his debut album, "Welcome to the Cruel World." It proved to be a mixed 
blessing. Early on, the emphasis on tough rhythm nearly derailed the show as 
the band crowded out Harper's voice and guitar playing. Eventually, the force 
was harnessed and became an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper contributed to his halting start by opening with a 10-minute song that 
tried to create tense drama but never got off the mark, largely because his 
guitar playing was more taken with percussive sound effects than with the 
creation of coherent lead lines. The number, not on his album, raised concern 
that here was another unprepared rookie desperately trying to stretch a 
50-minute CD's worth of material into a 90-minute headlining set. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harper found his bearings with "Whipping Boy," a slow, brooding song that 
merged folk-blues guitar with heavy rhythm, as if Ry Cooder had taken over 
leadership of Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsys. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's best songs were his most meditative: the back-to-back ballads 
"Waiting on an Angel" and "Forever." Starkly lovely and palpably aching, 
"Angel" is one of the best ballads of the year. Both songs rank with the work 
of two other quietly intense singer-songwriters, Joan Armatrading and Tracy 
Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those laments set up a long, concluding dialogue between confrontations with 
worldly troubles and the attempt to leave them behind with a spiritual leap. A 
dark, driving gospel song, "Child of God," looked toward escape to the 
hereafter. "Like A King" returned to the fallen world, invoking Rodney King and 
Martin Luther King to decry the lasting effects of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Like some of Harper's other protest songs, the "King" lyric settles for the 
bareness of a prosaic, ready-made sound bite, where good topical writing 
demands flashes of imagination (you don't write bald position papers in 
miniature -- "can't walk the streets, to them we are fair game"; you try to 
write something with the clarifying symbolism of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the 
Wind," or with the you-are-there storytelling and portraiture of Bob Marley's 
"No Woman, No Cry" or "I Shot the Sheriff"). But the "King" music was trenchant 
and memorable, and Harper's chant-like delivery gave it a resonance and 
timelessness missing from the lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper came to the brink of despair with "Welcome to the Cruel World," which 
would have made for a stunning closer if he'd had the nerve to leave an 
audience with its devastating declaration of utter dejection: 
</P>
<P>
 And if you get up to heaven before I do,  
</P>
<P>
 I'm gonna tell ya, it's gonna be cruel there, too.  
</P>
<P>
 He relented, however, ending with "Breakin' Down" and its extended, boisterous 
workout on Afro-Caribbean rhythms. The finale may have been conventional, but 
Harper seems like a newcomer with the artistic ambition to mount future 
challenges to his audience and to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbys, regulars on the local coffee house scene, offered a set made of 
far milder stuff. Most of it was folk-pop in the mellow '70s vein of Kenny 
Loggins, Dan Fogelberg and Crosby, Stills & Nash -- pleasantly wistful, but 
rarely striking. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand exception was "Lonely Rider," a superb a cappella song featuring 
yearning lead vocals by Stan DeWitt and outstanding glee club-cum-bluegrass 
harmonies from the three other band members. Few opening acts have the gumption 
to venture a ballad, let alone sing it without instrumental accompaniment. The 
Woodbys seized the house and held it with a striking performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aphids' opening set reminded one that any motivated garage band can have 
its moments of ragged, three-chord glory. But given the foursome's overall 
stiffness, its wan, mannered singing, and its bland lyrics about girlfriend 
problems, glory proved fleeting.

POP NOTES: ELECTRIC CIRCUS ROCK RESURGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Electric Circus in Anaheim is back in business as an original-rock venue 
for local bands after a three-month hiatus due to what club owner Allen 
Ornstein describes as "a major license problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Ornstein said that the club, at 314 N. Beach Blvd., had a temporary 
entertainment license when it opened last year, but difficulties with local 
authorities ensued when it tried to get a permanent license. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had a problem at the club; police were never called," Ornstein said, 
noting that it took "a lot of work, energy and money spent" to get the Electric 
Circus back in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming shows include the Sun Demons, Rhythm Lords and Barrelhouse tonight, 
Solomon Grundy and Mighty Smiley on Saturday, the Homewreckers on June 17 and 
Standing Hawthorn, Tremelo and Psychobud on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornstein plans to devote Fridays to roots music, Saturdays to alternative-rock 
bands and Sundays to reggae. Wednesdays and Thursdays will be dance-music 
nights, with disc jockeys instead of bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows start at 9 p.m., with admission kept to $2 because, as Ornstein put it, 
"everybody has less money these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of using outside promoters, as he did before the licensing 
difficulties, Ornstein plans to book the shows himself. Information: (714) 
826-9686.

 A budding science career has been put on hold so the Offspring can further its 
budding career in punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Holland, the singer and songwriter of the Orange County band, says he 
has taken a two-year leave of absence from USC, where he was six months into 
thesis research for a doctorate in microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's time has been in demand lately with the band, which has ridden its 
alternative radio hit, "Come Out and Play," onto the Billboard Top 200 albums 
chart -- the first album on an independent label by an Orange County rock band 
to do so since Stryper came along back in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cloning a mouse retrovirus, the same family as HIV," said Holland. 
"Right now there's just no way I could give it the (needed) commitment. It gets 
more and more hectic every week. I was trying to do experiments, and it just 
wasn't working out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring will play to its biggest audience ever Saturday at the KROQ 
Weenie Roast at Irvine Meadows. The rest of the summer is booked with tours of 
the United States and Europe.

A ROUGH DIAMOND; AWARD: LIQUOR STORE OWNER MYUNG A. CHUNG IS HONORED FOR HIS 
ROLE IN HELPING TURN AROUND A CRIME-RIDDEN COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Myung A. Chung could have just been another angry liquor store owner who 
fought city codes, ignored his community and turned a blind eye to the crime 
and blight around him. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, he paid attention to community protests and city demands for his 
cooperation. And on Thursday some of the same people who complained about his 
store honored him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bought into a real tough part of the city," said Jon Perica, a city zoning 
administrator who could have been Chung's nemesis. "He got into problems 
because he didn't know how to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Pacoima community leaders rose up to ask that special 
restrictions be placed on three liquor stores -- including Chung's -- that were 
targeted by the city and the community as public nuisances for attracting drug 
dealing, crime, graffiti and alcohol sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, outside of Chung's store, John's Liquor Store on Van Nuys 
Boulevard, the community, anti-alcohol activists, state and city officials, as 
well as Los Angeles police publicly thanked him for taking an active role in 
turning around the neighborhood. Leaders of the Los Angeles Coalition on 
Alcohol Responsibility and Enforcement (LA CARE) presented Chung -- who likes 
to be known by his American name, John -- with a "Blue Ribbon" award for his 
community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 To Perica, the example Chung has set is extraordinary because not only did he 
comply with restrictions that were imposed on his business, he did so the day 
they went into effect in 1988. And not only did he post the restrictions on the 
property as required, he blew them up into poster size so that all visitors 
could see his earnest effort to work with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is unique, a diamond in the rough," Perica said. "For every one of a Mr. 
Chung, you would get 10 others who would deny they are violating conditions, 
get a lawyer and fight the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the restrictions imposed by the city, Chung agreed to scale back his 
hours by not staying open after midnight, add security, keep the property clean 
and discourage loitering. He also goes to classes once a year to get an update 
on liquor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung was honored Thursday not only because he did not fight the restrictions 
-- as another liquor store did -- but because he also became involved with the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 'You have to be involved," said Chung, who was a recent immigrant to America 
from Korea when he bought the store in 1986. "In the long run, it's better for 
your store." 
</P>
<P>
 An example of Chung's involvement is his nomination of three local students 
who won college scholarships from the Korean American Grocers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 His business is a success story, Perica said, that shows, "it is possible to 
sell alcohol in a responsible way." 
</P>
<P>
 But Augie Maldonado, a community activist, points out that this successful 
cooperation between a business and a community was made possible in part 
because John's Liquor had been caught in a police decoy program selling liquor 
to minors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big mistake," said Chung.  
</P>
<P>
 Police decoys are minors who try to purchase alcohol to see if the cashier 
checks for valid identification. Chung said he did not intend to sell to a 
minor, but business was busy and he got careless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a bad person," said Perica, who uses Chung as an example to other 
businesses. "He's a well motivated person and a super hard worker. He just 
needed some guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado said 1988 -- when Chung's liquor store was targeted by community 
activists -- was a year in which Pacoima residents became aware that crime and 
drug-dealing was reaching a peak in the community. A series of marches were 
held that year at targeted stores, which community leaders connected with 
criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a period in this community that was very ugly," said Maldonado, who 
is also a member of LA CARE. "It's been an uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chung's cooperation has been well worth it, Maldonado said. 'The payoff 
for John is that now he has a lot of friends."

JUDGE REJECTS BAN ON PLAYBOY IN FIREHOUSES 
</P>

<P>
 A federal judge Thursday struck down a Los Angeles County order that forbade 
firefighters from reading or possessing Playboy in firehouses, ruling that the 
anti-sexual-harassment measure violated constitutional guarantees of free 
speech and press. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued an order barring the county 
from enforcing its ban on Playboy against Fire Department Capt. Steven W. 
Johnson, who brought a lawsuit challenging the policy. The judge found that the 
ban placed "severe limitations on Johnson's First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials failed to prove their argument "that quiet reading of Playboy 
contributes to a sexually harassing atmosphere," Wilson announced at a hearing 
in U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the county said it is likely they will appeal Wilson's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win for both sides," said Johnson, a 27-year veteran who was 
represented by ACLU and Playboy attorneys. "Because now both sides can choose 
what they want to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a resident of Corona del Mar, said he plans to have a copy of Playboy 
in hand when he returns to work Monday at his station in Lake Los Angeles, in 
the far northeastern corner of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials banned Playboy and other magazines featuring 
pictures of nude or skimpily dressed women from all work locations in 1992, 
saying the measure was needed to prevent development of a "sexually charged 
environment" for the department's 11 women firefighters who work with about 
2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's trial, one county official testified that the ban would also 
apply to certain issues of Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated 
magazines that contained pictures of nude or partially nude women. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether county fire officials will apply Wilson's ruling to all magazines 
remains unknown, because the judge's order specifies only Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's attorneys argued that the ban violated his constitutional rights and 
that while the county may have had good intentions, the policy was vague and 
overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department said they didn't want Capt. Johnson reading something they 
didn't want him thinking about," said ACLU attorney Paul L. Hoffman after the 
hearing Thursday. "When you start allowing that kind of thought control, you're 
going down the wrong track."  
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, one of four attorneys to represent Johnson, said the case should send 
a message to employers that they must take workers' rights into account when 
formulating similar policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should send a message around the country that they (employers) can go 
far to prevent sexual harassment, but that they can't trample on First 
Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters, who were ordered by the department's headquarters not to comment 
on the decision, had mixed reactions -- and not for attribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our department was totally wrong," one captain said. "There are nude pictures 
in National Geographic. Will we ban that next?"  
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find a whole bunch of people angry about this decision," said 
another male firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get 15 days off a month, you can read whatever you want to read then," 
said a female firefighter. "I work at a nice, nice station, but they're not all 
so nice. There are some stations where you know you are walking into a bunch of 
trouble. There are posters up of sexy women, and I really don't like to work 
around that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she added that she thought the whole debate "is a big joke -- there 
is Christian material that isn't supposed to be circulated around the station 
either" but is. 
</P>
<P>
 Another firefighter protested that the publicity given the dispute will 
mislead the public. "Where I work, we don't have time to read anything. We 
don't just read dirty books, play cards and sit around the station. We 
responded to more than 11,000 calls last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston, executive director of the Southern California chapter of the 
ACLU, declared Thursday's ruling a victory for Johnson and his desire to 
quietly read Playboy at his station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud the county for developing a policy on sexual harassment," Ripston 
said. "But the right to read is something the First Amendment protects." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, described Wilson's ruling as "simply wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 "What the ACLU and this judge have shown is that living, breathing women's 
rights count less in this system," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that "simply alleging the need to avoid sexual harassment is 
not enough. The county bears the burden of showing that real -- not imagined -- 
disruption is threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said there is no evidence that Johnson intended to commit acts that 
several women firefighters expressed fears of in declarations they filed with 
the court. Those acts included making lewd comments, displaying the magazine's 
pictures to unwilling viewers, or reading magazines with nude pictures of women 
on the cover, all of which are prohibited under other provisions of the 
county's sexual harassment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge concluded that the county can "not ban the reading of Playboy simply 
because they disagree with the manner in which Playboy portrays women."  
</P>
<P>
 Les Tolnai, a senior deputy county counsel who defended the ban, asked the 
judge to delay putting the order into effect to give the county time to appeal. 
Wilson advised Tolnai to file a written motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Tolnai said he was disappointed with Wilson's ruling, and 
that concerns persist that allowing magazines such as Playboy in firehouses 
will create an environment in which women will be sexually harassed. "The 
department is going to make every effort to manage its employees so that 
doesn't occur," Tolnai said. "But this will it make more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief Michael Freeman said he agreed. "We believe and still feel 
that we were within the law in providing a non-hostile work environment," 
Freeman said. "My understanding and experience . . . is that women can and do 
feel pressure and take offense around that type of material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of looking at them with respect and as members of an emergency team, 
they are looked at in a sexual way" by men who read the magazine, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written copy of his findings, Wilson found that Playboy contains "matter 
of public concern" and that firehouses offer sufficient privacy for a 
firefighter to read the magazine without exposing its contents to an "unwitting 
onlooker." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also wrote that the policy restricted Johnson's rights because it 
banned him from reading Playboy during his relaxation time at the fire station 
-- a place that serves as his home for several days at a time -- giving him no 
opportunity to exercise his freedom of expression.

DISTRICT WILL GIVE CLAS TEST TODAY; EDUCATION: JUDGE SAYS ANTELOPE VALLEY 
OFFICIALS COULD NOT USE PLANNED APPEAL TO DELAY THE CONTROVERSIAL EXAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After weeks of strenuously protesting the state-mandated CLAS test as 
anti-family and an invasion of privacy, the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District has been ordered in court to administer the test before the school 
year ends next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne, who ruled Monday in Superior Court in Los Angeles that the 
district could not refuse to give students the controversial test, issued an 
additional order Thursday saying that a planned appeal of her ruling could not 
be used as an excuse to delay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because students are scheduled to take final exams on all school days next 
week, the CLAS test -- normally given over four days -- will be administered in 
its entirety today. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated district officials and board members said the test, formally known 
as the California Learning Assessment System test, will be administered as 
ordered to 3,000 10th-grade students, but added that the validity of the 
results will be questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really will not be any kind of test at all," said board member Wilda 
Andrejcik, who has been in the board minority in her support of the test and 
desire to give it. "I'm very frustrated that this wasn't resolved earlier. (The 
test) has lost all its validity." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the school district and state Department of Education blamed each 
other for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have given it earlier and under better conditions," said Susie 
Lange, a Department of Education spokeswoman. "They made that choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education had maintained throughout the controversy that 
schools were required to administer the test. But department officials have 
said that individual students not wishing to take it could be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's superintendent, Robert Girolamo, said he expects school 
today to be nothing short of chaotic, as students who would otherwise be 
readying for final exams are herded into cafeterias and auditoriums for nearly 
six hours of testing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Thursday night how many students will even end up taking the 
essay-style test, which is designed to measure students' critical thinking 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter was to be sent home with all 10th-grade students Thursday afternoon 
to inform their parents that the district was giving the test and that they may 
exempt their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finals count, CLAS doesn't," said board member Sue Stokka, who has 
consistently opposed the test along with Tony Welch and board President Billy 
Pricer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents will have to decide which is more important," Stokka said. 
</P>
<P>
 While educators have heralded CLAS as a revolutionary method of measuring 
students' abilities, several conservative religious groups earlier this year 
began to object to the test, claiming it included literature passages that 
promoted racism and questions that asked students personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy surrounding the test, which prevented its public review, was also 
blasted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley school board's conservative majority voted to not 
administer the test April 20, becoming the first district in the state to 
notify the Department of Education of its outright refusal to give it. Five 
other school districts of the 1,006 in California have also voted against 
administering the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is the only one that the Department of Education has filed suit 
against over the test. "We would have pursued the other five districts legally 
(but) we simply ran out of time," said Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Bill Olenick, who with Andrejcik voted against the board 
majority's decisions to not the administer the test, said he believes the court 
orders are a victory for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight (over CLAS) is in Sacramento, not at the local level," he said. 
"The ruling's a victory of parental rights to choose what's best for their 
students. By banning the test the district stepped all over the rights of the 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's attorney, Frank J. Fekete, is expected today to file the 
appeal of Wayne's Monday ruling, but board members said it's unlikely the 
district will actually pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to expend time or any money on something that is a designated 
loser," Pricer said. "It might be better to regroup and see what we have to 
prepare for for next year."

THE QUAKE'S LITTLEST VICTIMS; YOUTH: SCHOOL PROGRAM PROVIDED ART THERAPY, 
COUNSELING AND SAFETY TRAINING TO UNDO JANUARY'S TRAUMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, 8-year-old Leilani Sanders began to have 
problems at school. The quality of her work declined, and her behavior became 
terrible, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other students at Tarzana Elementary, the quake forced Leilani from 
her home. But those around her quickly discovered that the disaster's 
psychological toll rivaled the physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 For many children, when their homes collapsed, so did their sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, more than 100 of these littlest victims of the quake -- for whom 
words can be difficult and comprehension of a disaster harder still -- 
celebrated their personal recoveries, which were assisted by trauma therapy 
groups at school.  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake "made me feel scared," Leilani said. "It keeps on shaking and 
you can't get away from it. They said, 'Don't be scared, because the shocks 
will stop.' I feel happy, kind of, because they told me it was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony complete with cake, applause and certificates for each child, 
the school community came together to honor their youngsters' progress.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting in January, using a grant from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, support from the Los Angeles Unified School District and individual 
donations, school officials hosted three teams of counselors.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to LAUSD counselors, a FEMA-sponsored group worked individually 
with the more troubled students and a group from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in 
Los Angeles led the youngsters in art therapy sessions, in which the children 
drew images of themselves and their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children can express their feelings through pictures and then talk about 
their feelings," Tarzana Principal Roberta MacAdam explained after Thursday's 
ceremony. "If they draw a house falling down, the object is to get them to talk 
about it, so at the end of the sessions they can draw a picture with the house 
all put back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children were suffering from a feeling of powerlessness, 
especially in the face of a problem even adults around them couldn't handle, 
said Suzanne Silverstein of the Psychological Trauma Center at Cedars-Sinai. So 
the students were also taught how to make themselves safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "As adults, part of our responsibility is to teach our children what they need 
to know to go through life," Silverstein said. "When there's a disaster, it's 
the responsibility of the adults to help the child understand what's 
transpired." 
</P>
<P>
 Children were taught how to make their bedrooms earthquake-secure and assemble 
an earthquake kit. They are not helpless, they were assured, and were reminded 
that everybody needs a hand to hold when they are scared.  
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein said Leilani's behavior was typical. Unable to express themselves 
in speech as adults do, children often act their feelings out. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Sanders, the girl's mother, was relieved by her daughter's newfound 
ability to cope with the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her teacher has said, 'I've got my old Leilani back,' " Sanders said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EX-COACH PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN PANTY RAIDS

 A former youth soccer coach pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony burglary 
charges stemming from the discovery of a plastic bag in his attic that 
contained underwear belonging to several girls who played on his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Castellanos, 19, of Montbello, faces seven counts of felony residential 
burglary and 12 counts of receiving stolen property for allegedly breaking into 
20 homes in the La Crescenta-Tujunga area and stealing panties and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 After he appeared for an arraignment in Pasadena Superior Court, Castellanos' 
case was sent to the Los Angeles County Probation Department for an 
investigation into his background. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Thomas Stoever also ordered Castellanos to visit a psychiatrist. He will 
appear for a pretrial conference in Pasadena Superior Court July 26 at 8:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on information contained in the probation and psychiatrist's 
reports, attorneys will either attempt to settle the case at the pretrial 
hearing or ask that it be held over for trial, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol 
Rash. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos told Glendale police he broke into the homes of 14- and 
15-year-old girls who played on his American Youth Soccer Organization Region 
88 team and on his father's team to steal their underwear as a "memento from 
each of the girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found a "break-in list" detailing robberies committed from early 1993 
through April, 1994, in Castellanos' bedroom after his arrest April 27. The 
list featured a column with girls' names and addresses and a category listed as 
"underwear mission." JENNIFER OLDHAM

 While the rest of the United States marked American Red Cross awareness month 
in March, the San Fernando Valley District office was forced to break from 
tradition because of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of raising funds, Red Cross workers in the Valley -- along with those 
in Los Angeles -- spent the month providing aid to quake victims.Planned 
fund-raising activities had to be put off until May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Marie Montez, Valley district manager, said her office alone spent $37 
million providing earthquake relief and that it is in "great need" of funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Valley district office, 14171 Sherman Way, Van Nuys, sustained 
$100,000 in earthquake damages, Montez said. 
</P>
<P>
 March has been American Red Cross awareness month since the days of President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who designated it as such because the middle three 
letters in March, a , r and c , are the initials of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same spirit, the month of February belongs to the American Heart Assn. 
because of Valentine's Day, Red Cross officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Save the Day" is the theme of this year's Red Cross fund-raising campaign. It 
is designed to let companies and organizations donate money to cover a day's 
operating budget of the American Red Cross, Montez said. MAKI BECKER

 Rosemont Middle School administrators will launch a homework tutoring program 
this fall to provide students with college-age mentors and give tutors valuable 
teaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnerships between seventh- and eighth-graders and students majoring in 
education from Glendale Community College, Occidental College and Cal State 
Northridge will help reach students who haven't participated in other homework 
programs, said Rosemont Principal Lois Neil. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the students having difficulty in not only one subject, but in a 
number of classes," Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tutoring programs currently in place at Rosemont include peer-tutoring 
sessions, in which 12- to 14-year-olds help their friends out with assignments, 
and twice weekly homework clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new homework program is a logical extension of successful tutoring efforts 
already in place -- some of which helped the 1,100-student school win a 
California Distinguished School award from the state, Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we won this award is because we hound students to get 
their homework done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the new effort, 165 students and their parents will be invited to 
attend tutoring sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators plan to ask college students, who as education majors are 
required to observe classroom activities, to join the homework program to help 
them decide if they really want to become educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle school students will be able to look up to the college tutors as role 
models, giving them extra motivation to get good grades so they can go on to 
college, Neil said.  
</P>
<P>
 The homework program will be administered using a $2,000 Step Up to Support 
Education Grant awarded to Rosemont by Southern California Edison. The grant 
will be used to purchase a computer, calculators and dictionaries to turn the 
school's library or cafeteria into a homework center. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 The impact of Mayor Richard Riordan's $4.2-million budget on residents of 
Sherman Oaks will be discussed Wednesday during a meeting sponsored by the 
Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Aguilera, Riordan's representative for the San Fernando Valley, will 
speak at the meeting, to be held at 8 p.m. at Union Federal Savings, 13300 
Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new budget would add 450 new police officers and provide overtime for 
existing officers. Richard H. Close, association president, said the group will 
ask Aguilera how this increase would affect the visibility of officers in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting also will focus on how the budget will improve the appearance of 
the community and make it more livable. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MERCHANTS MEET TO FORM BUSINESS WATCH

<P>
 More than 30 merchants met for the first time this week to establish the 
Corporate/Business Watch in the western Van Nuys area. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Senior Lead Officer Joe Losorelli of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Van Nuys Division, 32 people representing as many companies 
discussed issues from crime prevention to dealing with panhandlers for nearly 
two hours Wednesday at the Best Western Airtel Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was peppered with questions about robberies, graffiti, shoplifting 
and other business-related crimes, which Losorelli answered with a variety of 
tips. He recommended adding lighting to deter criminals and he handed out 
criminal description sheets that help police identify criminals after a 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Joanis, who organized the watch program, said she was pleased at the 
turnout.  
</P>
<P>
 Joanis expects more merchants at the next meeting, which will focus on 
tackling graffiti. It will be held July 27 at 6 p.m. at American Pacific State 
Bank, 16600 Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it was really positive," said Joanis, co-owner of Lutz Copies & 
Printing. "It's a lot of work, but it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants in an area from Woodley Avenue to Balboa Boulevard and from Victory 
to Roscoe boulevards were invited to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something we definitely need in the west Van Nuys area," said 
Jim Porter, an ex-LAPD reserve officer now serving as vice president-manager of 
American Pacific State Bank. "To have the community involved just makes for a 
more secure area for preventing crime." JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 8 HONORED FOR GIVING SCHOOLS A HELPING HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For people who attended grade school decades ago, the news that some schools 
can no longer afford to keep their libraries open is bound to be shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Pick was shocked, too, when she learned that budget cuts had shuttered 
the library at her child's school in Tarzana, but she decided to do something 
about it. Pick cleaned the library, repaired damaged books, and organized a 
staffing schedule for volunteers. Today, the library is open every period, five 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino resident was one of eight volunteers to be honored for their 
outstanding service Thursday at a Los Angeles Unified School District reception 
at its downtown headquarters. Two other San Fernando Valley residents, Mira 
Sonderling of Van Nuys and Al Struckus of Woodland Hills, also were honored. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards are given each year to volunteers who have made exceptional 
contributions to their schools. There are 18,000 volunteers throughout the 
district, making the Los Angeles program the largest school volunteer program 
in the nation, according to Deputy Supt. Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
 To make Nestle Avenue Elementary School a better place, Pick, 47, has done 
everything from serving as PTA president to cleaning the school's sickroom. She 
types Nestle's newsletter, runs the book fair and created a program in which 
families are recognized for donating books to the library on their child's 
birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Getting kids involved in the library is my driving goal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know her say that Pick deserves the recognition.  
</P>
<P>
 "She does all this stuff behind the scenes, and all of a sudden everything is 
done," said Principal Edward Catlett.  
</P>
<P>
 There are 125 volunteers at Nestle, which has a student population of 390. 
Catlett chalks up the high participation rate to the staff letting the 
volunteers know that they are trusted, and to the efforts of volunteer 
coordinator Carol Siembieda. 
</P>
<P>
 Struckus, who is in his 70s, used his experience as an amateur carpenter to 
engage students in school-beautification projects at Miguel Leonis Continuation 
High School in Woodland Hills. Due to their efforts, a gazebo, a barbecue, and 
a waterfall have sprung up at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired engineer for Rockwell International Corp. says he is happy to have 
allowed students room to express their creativity and to feel good about making 
their school a special place.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are my new children," said Struckus, whose own children have grown up 
and moved away. "They really are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonderling, 65, also is putting her retirement years to productive use. She 
tutors former high school dropouts and English as a Second Language students at 
the North Hollywood Adult Learning Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Sonderling works in a classroom where students do independent study in a 
variety of subjects toward their high school degree. She helps students over 
rough spots in math, history, science and English. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just makes them feel, 'You can do it, I'll help you do it, you will do 
it,' " said Rheta Goldman, coordinator of the daytime program. "She just builds 
self-esteem, which is so important today." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PANEL APPROVES PLAN FOR THEATER COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas Planning Commission this week approved the construction of a 
controversial eight-plex theater, shops, restaurants and other changes to plans 
for the city's largest commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes would allow an extra 150,000 square feet of retail space in the 
planned 1.5-million-square-foot office complex known as Calabasas Park Centre 
without changing the overall size of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision rests with the City Council, which plans to hold hearings 
on the matter as early as July. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents near the development south of Calabasas Road between Park 
Granada and Parkway Calabasas vehemently oppose plans for a theater, which they 
fear would bring rowdy, young movie-goers carousing through their quiet 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a bedroom community," said Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn. President 
Mike Fichera. "We enjoy a great deal of serenity, and this is going to change 
the character of our lives. This is a disaster waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 3 to 2 at a special meeting Tuesday in favor of the 
2,800-seat theater complex, with Commissioners Dave Brown and Allan Cooper 
calling for fewer seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concern over the effects of a shopping center on local traffic and 
safety, many homeowners have testified at city hearings that the project would 
be a benefit to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a true community center, where people can go meet and 
greet," said Mark Ossala, vice president of Kilroy Industries, a general 
partner in the project. "There are going to be four sit-down restaurants, 
places for people to sit and read, movies within walking distance and a safe 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the developers would begin work on the retail 
center within 90 days and finish within 11 months, Ossala said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theaters were the most explosive matter of the whole project," 
Commissioner Frank Rich said. "It was hard for me to limit its size because of 
all the security requirements we're slapping on the developer." 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by Los Angeles County supervisors in 1989 before Calabasas 
incorporated, the massive Ahmanson/Kilroy project would include only about 
50,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the shrinking demand for office space in the Valley, however, the 
developer asked the city about a year ago to allow an extra 150,000 square feet 
of retail space, raise the height limit and extend the time limit on the 
development agreement from 1999 to 2014. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission did not raise the height limit from its current cap of five 
stories and extended the time limit for the project for up to five years. KURT 
PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PANEL OKS $5 MILLION TO PURCHASE PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An influential House panel approved $5 million Thursday to purchase land next 
year for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area -- the same amount 
included by President Clinton in his budget proposal but far less than park 
advocates had requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), the park's leading advocate, had 
asked the Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies for $15 
million last month. This was the same figure recommended by a coalition of 39 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5 million is nearly 10% of the $49 million approved for park purchases 
nationwide -- a smaller percentage than the sprawling Southern California park 
has received previously. In addition, the recreation area was not given the 
largest sum of any unit of the national park system; the subcommittee included 
$6.5 million for Saguaro National Monument in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monicas, the National Park Service is seeking funds to acquire 19 
properties, totaling 500 acres along the Backbone Trail, which are estimated to 
cost $10 million. The 43-mile trail winds along the spine of the Santa Monica 
Mountains from Will Rogers State Park to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, nonetheless, sought to cast the subcommittee's decision, the first 
in the annual congressional budget process, in a positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased that the subcommittee continues to place a high priority on 
acquiring more park land in the Santa Monicas," Beilenson said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson had noted that the lingering California real-estate recession has 
created temporary buying opportunities. He also pointed out that, given the 
vulnerability of the mountainous land to wildfires and mudslides, buying 
property for open space could save large sums in future disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for the second consecutive year, the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation 
Area appears to be positioned to win a smaller share of the scarce parkland 
acquisition funds than it has in many earlier years. If this occurs, it will 
fare worse during these two years under Democrat Clinton than it generally did 
under Republican President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monicas received $4 million last year, which was far less than it 
had received for any fiscal year since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure approved by the Appropriations subcommittee becomes the figure 
adopted by the full House. The Senate generally approves less money than the 
House; the two sums are then reconciled in a conference committee of lawmakers 
from each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The key House panel's action came two days after voters rejected a $2-billion 
bond proposal to buy parkland that would have directed more than $85 million to 
the Santa Monicas Mountains Conservancy, a state agency that buys and manages 
land in the national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the bond measure's defeat, the conservancy and a sister agency, 
the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, will be forced to lay off 
more than a third of their employees and postpone significant property 
acquisitions, officials said. ALAN C. MILLER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; COUNCIL CONSIDERS NEW SPENDING CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills City Council has given preliminary approval to a tax on 
utility use and cuts in spending and employee positions to help pull the city 
from its worst-ever fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous vote, the council Wednesday night approved a tax on the use of 
electricity, gas and telephone service. If given final approval June 22, the 
tax would be set at 4% for residents and 3.5% for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed tax drew angry opposition two weeks ago from a standing-room-only 
crowd, some of whom were regular City Council critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very angry," said Barbara Murphy, who started a group called Citizens 
Against New Local Taxes in response to the proposed tax. "We will develop 
ballot measures to revoke the tax and or recall all five members of our City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ed Corridori, who was elected in November, said the decision was 
not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy about imposing a tax either," Corridori said. "But without it 
I'm going to be sacrificing the quality of life in my community I love, and I'm 
not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike neighboring Calabasas, Westlake Village and Los Angeles, the city of 
Agoura Hills has so far resisted placing fees on utilities or public 
landscaping to raise money for law enforcement, public works and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also proposed $270,000 in spending cuts to help plug a projected 
$1-million shortfall. In all, $5.7 million is required to operate the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the cuts were the elimination of four part-time positions and two 
full-time jobs -- a senior planner and an administrative secretary -- leaving 
the city with 17 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also moved to eliminate an after-school program at Yerba Buena 
Elementary School and funding for traffic and security at the Pony Express Days 
festival and other public events. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts will be considered again, along with the final version of the budget, 
at a meeting to be scheduled later. KURT PITZER

LANDOWNERS AT MALIBOU LAKE SPLIT ON FIRE RULES; SAFETY: COUNTY OKS BUILDING 
RESTRICTIONS TO CURB BLAZES. ABSENTEE LANDLORDS VOICE SUPPORT, RESIDENTS BLAST 
PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Thursday approved a 
controversial set of building restrictions intended to ease the danger of 
wildfires around Malibou Lake -- but only after making last-minute changes that 
residents fear will do little to protect their mountain hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of an hourlong hearing in the board's cavernous downtown 
meeting room, residents who showed up intending to support the restrictions did 
an abrupt about-face and vowed to fight the new rules in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But owners of vacant property who originally threatened to mount legal 
challenges against the building restrictions walked away satisfied with the 
board's unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has come back to where it is reasonable," said Phyllis Daugherty, an owner 
of vacant property who represents a group of other landowners in the area. "You 
can't just take away people's property rights completely." 
</P>
<P>
 The rules approved Thursday, technically known as the Malibou Lake Community 
Standards District, change slightly and make permanent a set of temporary 
restrictions in effect since January, 1993. County officials hope the 
guidelines developed for Malibou Lake can be applied in other mountain 
communities prone to fast-moving brush fires, such as Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who have supported tougher restrictions for more than two years 
complained that the new rules -- proposed as a compromise by retiring 
Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman -- came as a surprise and will do little to 
protect them from fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who live there deserve to be protected," Malibou Lake resident 
Joel Schulman said. "Fire knows no compromise. . . . With these changes you're 
proposing, it's over. This is so completely toothless that it's useless." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing his critics, Edelman said: "We don't live in a perfect world. We 
live in a world we try to make more perfect, as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman and others specifically took issue with a loosening of rules 
governing how much of a lot could be covered by a new house. Under earlier 
proposals attacked by vacant landowners, new homes would be allowed to cover 
just 15% of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules allow 25% lot coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lot coverage is significant because if buildings occupy too much of the hilly 
terrain, it becomes difficult for firefighters and other rescue crews to 
maneuver around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bailey, the Los Angeles County Fire Department's head of fire safety, 
agreed to the increased lot coverage as long as other elements of the community 
standards district remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those elements include requirements for fire sprinklers in new homes and a 
virtual ban on street parking to allow large emergency vehicles room to 
negotiate the narrow, winding roads that surround the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for stricter guidelines emerged three years ago when residents 
complained about new construction projects proposed for their community, which 
is served by a network of narrow, winding roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents protested that more houses and more cars would make it nearly 
impossible to escape during a brush fire. Vacant landowners agreed that fire 
danger in the community was high, but they complained that residents, too, had 
added to the threat by making illegal -- and possibly substandard -- additions 
to their homes.

JURY BEGINS DELIBERATIONS IN ASSISTED SUICIDE CASE; TRIAL: ALEX COVENTRY FACES 
CHARGES AFTER GIVING A LOADED SHOTGUN TO HIS ROOMMATE, WHO THEN KILLED HIMSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the legacy of Dr. Jack Kevorkian finally looming before them, a Van Nuys 
jury began deliberations Thursday to determine if a man violated California's 
assisted suicide law by handing a loaded shotgun to his drunk and despondent 
roommate, who then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury is being asked to decide if Tujunga resident Alex 
Coventry should be convicted under a seldom-used, 121-year-old law that 
prohibits deliberately aiding, advising or encouraging someone to commit 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Coventry, a 44-year-old recovering alcoholic, is charged with assisting in the 
death of Leonard Medina, a 42-year-old unemployed man who shared an apartment 
with Coventry and Linda McDowell, Coventry's girlfriend. All three had been 
drinking the evening of July 2, 1993, when Medina shot himself, according to 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors maintain that Coventry's actions were outrageous and criminal 
because, they allege, he knew that Medina was very upset about his bleak 
financial situation and yet still handed him a loaded weapon and encouraged him 
to, "Just do it." They also maintain that Coventry knew Medina had previously 
tried to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments Thursday, attorneys differed on whether the case 
should include comparisons with cases against Kevorkian, the retired Michigan 
pathologist who has gained international attention for admitting he helped 20 
terminally ill patients end their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kenneth P. Lezin, who maintains Coventry had no idea Medina 
actually would commit suicide, expressed anger and outrage that his client was 
being prosecuted at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Lezin suggested that the district attorney's office was simply seeking 
publicity when it charged Coventry and that the case was filed because 
prosecutors thought it was "cute, because they thought it might be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "They continue to deny this case has nothing to do with Kevorkian. . . but 
don't think that for a minute," Lezin said, pointing to a CNN camera crew in 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The key word in the California law being cited in the case is "deliberately," 
the defense attorney said, arguing that Coventry cannot be guilty of that 
because he did not believe his roommate would kill himself, thinking instead 
that Medina was "all talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Lezin played a tape recording of a police interview in which Coventry is heard 
saying: "I think he did it accidentally, too . . . He might not have known that 
it was loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 "This law is designed specifically for a Kevorkian-type situation" where 
someone is clearly aware that his actions will result in another's death, said 
Lezin, as he asked the jury to issue a not-guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Coventry acknowledges his actions were wrong, Lezin said the 
"terrible judgment" behind his actions lacked the criminal intent necessary to 
be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes him responsible," Lezin said. "He's going to have to deal with that, 
but it doesn't make him criminally responsible." 
</P>

 In an emotional argument to the jury, Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew R. Flier 
agreed with the defense on one point: "What Mr. Coventry did was a foolish act, 
a stupid act." And the prosecutor tried to distance Coventry's trial from a 
recent case against Kevorkian, in which a jury ruled that the doctor was 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian helped people commit suicide "under the supervision of a medical 
professional, and those people were terminally ill -- not just depressed," 
Flier said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he took a tack familiar to those who followed the prosecution in the 
Kevorkian trials: Assisted suicide "is not a philosophical argument," he said. 
"The Legislature has said this is a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor compared Coventry's defense that he was intoxicated that night, 
and that he thought Medina was just kidding, to Monday-morning quarterbacking, 
in which people second-guess the decisions that lost Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Using handwritten charts to illustrate his points, Flier stressed that 
Coventry admitted what he did and that these actions clearly encouraged Medina 
to kill himself. One chart listed six other things that Coventry could have 
done, such as give Medina an unloaded weapon or call a crisis hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Coventry was just tired of listening to Mr. Medina," the prosecutor said. 
"He was fed up. He told him to put up or shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Flier accused McDowell, Coventry's girlfriend and a witness to the shooting, 
of lying during her testimony as part of a cover-up the pair plotted after 
realizing they were in trouble. He pointed to the numerous times McDowell 
answered that she could not recall certain events in an attempt to increase 
juror skepticism of her truthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury of nine men and three women will resume deliberations in the case this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is convicted of the charge, Coventry would face up to three years in 
state prison.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISTRICT MAY CLOSE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES DURING 
LUNCH HOUR; EDUCATION: HART TRUSTEES INDICATE THEY FAVOR CHANGING POLICY. 
STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE VOICES OPPOSITION. 
</P>

<P>
 High school students accustomed to flocking to nearby fast-food restaurants 
and grocery stores during lunch might find themselves limited to school 
cafeterias this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District's board of trustees has asked 
district officials to develop proposals for closing the campuses of the city's 
four traditional high schools during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in grades nine through 12 are currently allowed to leave campuses at 
the lunch hour, but all five of the board's members indicated at a meeting 
Monday night they favor changing that policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A student representative at that meeting told the board that students strongly 
oppose the idea primarily because campuses lack adequate eating and restroom 
facilities. School officials acknowledged that significant renovations would 
have to be made to correct the lack of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The closed campus policy had been considered and rejected by the Hart board 
during the past few years but the board -- which also at the meeting approved 
mandatory uniforms for students at a new junior high school -- seems to be 
taking an increasingly conservative stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pendulum is swinging back," said District Supt. Walter Swanson. "We are 
looking at things more socially conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Paula Olivares, a supporter of open campuses when she joined 
the board 2 1/2 years ago, said she has changed her mind "180 degrees" since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be a supporter of closing the campus completely," she said. "I think 
it would be difficult to administer keeping part of the campus open and part of 
the campus closed." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to requiring all students to stay on campus, proposals discussed 
at the meeting included allowing only seniors to leave for lunch and a program 
that allowed students to earn the right to be off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider the proposals at its July 13 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of 15 Southern California school districts surveyed by Hart officials 
have an open campus policy, and one of those districts will close its campus 
this fall, said Cheryl Brown, principal of Saugus High School. She said seven 
districts have completely closed their campuses and six have modified programs 
that allow some students to leave during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the closed campuses have allowed fast-food vendors such as Subway and 
Taco Bell on campus, which has proven a popular option among students, Brown 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed campuses with a variety of eating facilities could generate up to 
$900,000 annually, according to district reports. However, several board 
members and school officials expressed concerns about the start-up and 
operating costs of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 A May 24 telephone survey of 137 parents in the Hart district indicated that 
77% felt students should not leave campuses during lunch. Pam Raney, a parent 
who presented the survey results to the board, said concerns were expressed 
about students getting into traffic accidents and fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "As parents, we would like to see the students remain on campus for their own 
safety," she said. "We are not seeking to punish them. We just want to know 
where they are." 
</P>
<P>
 But the student representative told the board that closing campuses during 
lunchtime could result in an uproar. Kari Thatcher, a junior at Hart High 
School, cited long lines at the school cafeteria. She calls the quality of food 
deplorable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get better food (off campus)," she said, "and often it's cheaper than 
eating at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Kari said restroom facilities on campus are also a major concern. There are 
not enough of them, she told the board, and those that exist are so dirty many 
students refuse to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 She said additional campus supervisors would also be needed. "I think you can 
imagine the chaos of 2,000 students coming to one area to get lunch as quickly 
as possible and socialize," Kari said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said that merchants surveyed at fast-food 
restaurants and other businesses frequented by students at lunch favored closed 
campuses by a 56-36 margin. Those favoring the closed campus primarily cited 
unruly student behavior, although 56% of all merchants surveyed said they have 
not received complaints from other customers about students. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-three percent of the merchants said closing campuses would have a 
financial impact on their business.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOARD OKS PROGRAM REQUIRING STUDENTS TO WEAR 
UNIFORMS; EDUCATION: TRUSTEES APPROVE A VARIETY OF ENSEMBLES FOR LA MESA JUNIOR 
HIGH, WHICH WILL OPEN IN THE FALL.

<P>
 Uniforms will be required for students attending La Mesa Junior High School, 
opening this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District unanimously approved a pilot 
uniform program at a meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although uniforms have been mandated for students at several public schools in 
the Los Angeles area in recent years, this is the first such program in Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Olivares, president of Hart's board of trustees, said she voted for the 
uniforms because she believes they will improve students' academic performance 
and eliminate peer pressure when it comes to clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Research shows that students who do attend a school with uniforms do have 
increased learning and better test scores," she said. "I think part of the 
reason is students at that (grade) level spend a lot of time worrying about 
what they're wearing and what other students are wearing." 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of ensembles -- ranging from shorts and T-shirts to dressier slacks 
for boys and skirts for girls -- were approved by the board. The cost to 
students for the clothing is expected to be $100 to $150 a year, with $100 
scholarships available to needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothes were modeled at the meeting by 14 sixth-graders who will go to La 
Mesa in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials and parents who developed the uniform policy said most 
students were enthusiastic. Lindsey Metcalf, 11 -- who modeled a plaid vest, 
white oxford shirt and black shorts for the board -- said she likes the policy 
because finding fashionable clothes to fit her 4-foot-5 1/2-inch height is 
nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got the growth of a 7-year-old," Lindsey said. "I can't find good 
clothes to wear. Now people won't go 'Those look like baby clothes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Lindsey said there are disadvantages to the uniforms, including the taunts 
from students at other schools who won't be wearing uniforms in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of the models didn't have positive things to say about the new 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to wear my own clothes," said Jamie Dirosario, 12. "I wish there was 
just a strict dress code instead of the uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mesa will open its doors to about 500 seventh-grade students this fall. The 
uniform policy will be evaluated quarterly during the school year to determine 
if it should be continued. It it goes well, it could spread to other junior 
high schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard from others who say they are interested in the concept," said 
district Supt. Walter Swanson. "We have to start someplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The uniforms will make the campus safer by making it easier to recognize 
non-students, La Mesa Principal Rochelle Neal said. She said that another 
advantage is that it will eliminate baggy clothing that can conceal weapons and 
is often associated with gang membership.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the approved uniform outfits, the board policy bans hats, 
unusual hairstyles, open-toed shoes and clothing more than one size too large. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety of clothing allowed was enough to persuade board member William 
Dinsenbacher, a skeptic of the uniform policy when it was first proposed, to 
change his mind and vote with his fellow board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my doubts all along," he said. "But after seeing this, there are a lot 
of choices they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Students failing to observe the dress code will be required to wear their gym 
clothing during the school day on their first offense, Neal said. Parents will 
be notified following a second offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Student detention would result from a third offense and subsequent offenses 
would result in Saturday school assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents objecting to the policy can send their children to one of the 
district's other junior high schools, Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fashion show of the uniforms will be presented at 7 p.m. Wednesday at 
Valencia Valley Elementary School. Fittings and preliminary orders will be 
accepted following the show, and will also be taken from 4 to 9 p.m. June 27 
and 28 at the Hart district office. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniforms will also be sold at a student store at Valencia High School from 
mid-August through mid-September. The store will be opened at other times 
during the year if necessary. La Mesa Uniform Program

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE TO LOOK FOR NEW SITE FOR METROLINK 
STATION; TRANSIT: COMMUTER TRAINS ARE BEING MOVED TO A NEW SET OF RAILS. CITY 
COUNCIL REJECTS THE IDEA OF BUILDING AN UNDERPASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Metrolink station built right after the earthquake here has been a 
huge success, but there's one problem: it's on the wrong side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to replace the existing platform, the Palmdale City Council told its 
staff to find a new location after rejecting the idea of spending $300,000 to 
build an underpass to allow passengers to continue boarding at the present 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 That platform, north of Avenue P on Lockheed property near Air Force Plant 42, 
was built immediately after the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged freeways and cut off 
many Antelope Valley residents from their workplaces. The platform is on the 
east side of the Southern Pacific freight tracks, which are also being used by 
Metrolink commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few weeks, however, Metrolink will move its trains to a new set of rails 
west of the freight tracks. Because of safety concerns, passengers will not be 
allowed to walk across the freight tracks to board Metrolink trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, council members said they want commuter trains to continue to serve 
their community. "We cannot lose the presence of Metrolink in this valley," 
Councilman David Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Palmdale platform closes, Antelope Valley riders will have to board 
at Lancaster or Vincent Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials are reluctant to invest money in an underpass at the 
present station because Lockheed officials have said they may not renew the 
lease with the city next year. According to city staff members, Lockheed is 
worried that the commuters are coming too close to the company's high-security 
research operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying land elsewhere, then putting in a platform, lighting fixtures and a 
parking lot could cost more than $500,000, Assistant City Administrator Ron 
Creagh told the council. At the moment, he said, only about 80 people board 
Metrolink each day at the Palmdale platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stanger, executive director of Metrolink, told the council that 
ridership from the Antelope Valley should increase in July when crews complete 
track improvements that will cut the train ride between Lancaster and Los 
Angeles to one hour and 35 minutes. When the service began, the 78-mile trip 
took two hours and 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanger also warned that the cost of a monthly pass from the Antelope 
Valley to Los Angeles will soon jump from $112 to $208. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Myers told Stanger that many Antelope Valley residents cannot 
afford that. He said Metrolink must lower its fares to attract more riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers also said the city staff should look for a place to build a new 
Metrolink stop in Palmdale, possibly a combined rail and bus station. He said 
the project might be linked with downtown redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think we have to make a commitment to rail," he said. "We have to 
step up to the plate, one way or another."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 4TH OF JULY PARADE IS 1 MORE VICTIM OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has claimed yet another victim -- the favored route 
of the annual Fourth of July parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade has traditionally taken a route between William S. Hart and Henry 
Mayo Newhall parks, winding north up San Fernando Road, west along Lyons 
Avenue, north along Orchard Village Road and east on Dalby Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But transportation officials are loathe to clog San Fernando Road -- the route 
that also serves as California 126 -- with marching bands, baton-twirlers, show 
horses and other parade entries that make it temporarily unusable as an 
alternate to the Golden State Freeway for southbound travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the earthquake and the problems they still have with the freeways, 
they don't want to block off San Fernando Road," said Bob Martin, parade 
committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks after the Northridge earthquake, heavy truck traffic unable to pass 
on the Golden State Freeway rumbled down Lyons Avenue and San Fernando Road to 
reach the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the alternate road clear, the parade will shift its route one block 
west and travel north along Walnut Street to connect with Lyons Avenue and 
continue on to Newhall Park. The new route bypasses much of Santa Clarita's 
downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 groups and businesses have entered the parade so far, and 
applications are being accepted through Wednesday. Some 15,000 to 20,000 
spectators are expected to watch the more than two-hour event featuring antique 
cars, show horses and cars representing community businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of entries. It's not the Rose Parade; it's a downtown hokey 
kind of parade," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the break in tradition, organizers expect little to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still downtown Newhall, and Hart Park is our cornerstone anyway," Martin 
said. "Most of the businesses are closed that day. The restaurants downtown 
might have better access (for customers) because they won't be shut down." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade is dedicated to people who helped others in the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, firefighters, American Red Cross representatives and other 
emergency service personnel will be featured in several entries and Carl 
Goldman, owner of KBET-AM 1220, which emerged as an information powerhouse in 
the days after the quake, has been chosen as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Past marshals have been linked with the city's Western heritage, from Roy 
Rogers and Dale Evans to Robert Conrad and Iron Eyes Cody.

STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF ABSTINENCE; HEALTH: PLACENTIA EDUCATORS USE PROGRAM 
TO TEACH TEENS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES AND RESIST PEER PRESSURE TO 
ENGAGE IN SEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Andrienne Ervin and Cyndi Watson have long worked with youngsters, helping 
them navigate the rocky terrain of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 They've witnessed the highs and lows, the successes and the failures. 
Throughout their careers they have strived to turn those often turbulent 
teen-age years into safe and productive times for their students. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ervin, an El Dorado High School assistant principal, and Watson, a 
teacher at Tuffre Junior High School, have found themselves on the front lines 
in a battle over adolescent sex in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among a growing number of educators, school counselors and health 
professionals across the country who are seeing teen-agers -- even children in 
middle school -- having sex at increasingly younger ages, sometimes with 
multiple partners and often showing scant concern for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the threat of AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases and 
the increase in teen pregnancies, Ervin, Watson and others are fighting to turn 
back the tide of early sexual behavior and convince young people that it can be 
harmful to their physical as well as emotional health. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program called "Education Now, Babies Later" (ENBL), Watson teaches 
seventh-grade girls and boys at Tuffre that it is important for youngsters to 
postpone having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, one of many being used nationally by schools, churches and 
communities to promote teen abstinence, teaches young people refusal skills 
that will help them resist peer pressure to engage in sex at an early age.  
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is for their lives," said Ervin, who has been an educator for 26 
years and a strong supporter of ENBL at her school. "We want to show them that 
they have a choice whether to have sex or to wait. We are saying you are in 
control of your destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta 
view early teen sex as such a health risk for adolescents that they have cited 
reduction of teen sexual activity as a national health objective. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators like Ervin and Watson see firsthand why teen sex has become a 
critical issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescents "seem to be under tremendous pressure to go through the rites of 
passage," Ervin said. They want to grow up so fast. They see movies, television 
and advertisements that are "oozing with sex. So, they think everyone is doing 
it. . . . They believe 'if I don't do it, my friends will think I'm a geek.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do more than just provide birth control information for kids," she 
said. When you just "tell kids to use condoms, it's like giving up, and saying, 
'You are going to do it anyway,' " Ervin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said Watson, who has taught youngsters for 18 years. "I am 
seeing a lot of girls as young as 12 and 13 having sex . . . and bragging about 
it. They think they are invincible to pregnancy or (sexually transmitted) 
diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In California alone, a statewide study in 1992 found that 17% of girls between 
the ages of 12 and 14 were sexually active, according to Cynthia Scheinberg, 
executive director of the Coalition for Children, Adolescents and Parents in 
Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 The state-funded ENBL program is being used in schools throughout the state, 
including 65 in Orange County, Scheinberg said. The coalition has the state 
contract to set up the program in Orange County schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The program is not without its critics. Those opposed to abstinence-based 
programs complain that it is unrealistic to believe that kids are going to stop 
having sex. By teaching abstinence only, they say, the programs fail to provide 
important information about health and anatomy. Critics also believe that such 
a curriculum makes kids who have had sex feel guilty and feel like failures. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will release results 
of its latest survey on teen sexual behavior in the United States. In its first 
national survey on risky behavior among young people in 1990-91, the study 
found that 40% of teen-agers polled said they had sexual intercourse by the 
ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-two percent of those polled said they had intercourse by their senior 
year in high school. Twenty percent of the students surveyed said they had had 
sex with four or more partners in their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results were concerning," said Dr. Laura Kann, who helped conduct the CDC 
study. "The results showed there are a lot of kids who are at risk for 
(sexually transmitted diseases) . . . AIDS, and pregnancies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, doctors at the Atlanta center estimate that 3 million teen-agers suffer 
from a sexually transmitted disease, including syphilis, gonorrhea and 
chlamydia. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson and other educators and psychologists who work with adolescents are 
particularly troubled by the cavalier attitude toward sex they see displayed by 
boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of these youngsters, sex has become a game. Despite the threat of 
pregnancy, AIDS and other diseases, some of these kids are throwing caution to 
the wind, said psychologist Lois Raffel, who counsels students in the Placentia 
Yorba-Linda Unified District schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for early sexual activity among teens may be varied, according to 
experts on adolescent behavior. Peer pressure, changing attitudes toward sex, 
lack of adult supervision, influences by the media, a breakdown of family and 
community, and lack of health and sex education, are some of the explanations 
offered. Experimentation with drugs and alcohol also lead to early sexual 
activity, counselors say.  
</P>

<P>
 Priscilla Hurley, executive director of Choices/Teen Awareness Inc., another 
educational program in Orange County that stresses abstinence to students, 
argues that many youngsters are hearing no guidelines about sex from society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culturally, there are no boundaries in terms of sexual behavior today," she 
said. "Teens are on a wide-open playing field. They are confused," said Hurley, 
whose program is used at various Orange County schools, including El Dorado 
High.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was part of the '60s. We believed if it feels good do it," Hurley said. But 
the free sex philosophy of the '60s does not work today and kids have to get 
that message, she said. They have to be taught that "if you pursue that kind of 
behavior, we will lose you." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of babies born to young teen-agers in this country has continued to 
rise since the mid- to late 1980s. In 1991, 531,591 babies were born to girls 
under the age of 20, an increase of more than 50,000 from 1985, according to 
statistics from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County alone, 1,657 babies were born in 1992 to girls between the 
ages of 15 and 17. Seventy-nine babies were born to girls between the ages of 
10 and 14, a 38% increase during a five-year period, according to data provided 
by the Coalition for Children, Adolescents and Parents. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As some young girls have become more independent and assertive, they have 
become more aggressive in their pursuit of boys, notes Los Angeles psychologist 
Marcia Lasswell. They feel free to call boys first, ask them out on dates, 
initiate sex and then boast about it to their friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "They go after what they want. They are more overt (sexually) and sometimes it 
gets out of hand," said Lasswell, president of the American Assn. for Marriage 
and Family Therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasswell said she and some of her colleagues even hear of girls "pressuring 
the boys to have sex and making references to their manhood" if they decline. 
</P>
<P>
 For some young girls, sex satisfies a desperate yearning for the love and 
affection that may be missing in their lives, Raffel said. For them, it is not 
a game, she said. They want to "be loved, touched and cared for. We all need 
that as human beings. But in today's rushed and hurried world we aren't doing 
that as often as we should." 
</P>
<P>
 For some boys, early sex is viewed as expected behavior and a status symbol 
among some kids, counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Brady, a senior at Dana Hills High School, said, "I know there are 
girls who are having sex starting at ages 13 and 14. It blows my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're having sex that early because they need to look and feel older . . . 
and peer pressure. When girls are younger, it's cool to be with older guys and 
maybe have sex with them," said Brady, 18, a cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Others do it to rebel against their parents. Brady said she knew of one girl 
at her school who wanted to get pregnant and did for that very reason. She also 
did it because she thought she would have more independence from her parents if 
she got pregnant and had a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda, a 14-year-old freshman at Los Alamitos High School, said she is 
disturbed by how sexually active some of her classmates are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids treat sex as if it means nothing. They don't realize the problems 
it could create. They think sex is expected of them. In fact, a lot of boys 
won't go out with a girl unless they will have sex," said Brenda, who is not 
using her real name.  
</P>
<P>
 "One friend started having sex in sixth grade. It was really sad. It was 
obvious the boy was using her. 
</P>
<P>
 "In grade school, we all thought having sex was stupid. But now some of them 
are doing it. They think I'm really uptight. But I can't even picture myself 
having sex now. Getting pregnant at 14 would be the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one little girl in my class who I was 99% sure was sexually active," 
Watson said. "She was 12 years old and she wrote on one of her papers, 'Sex is 
great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Watson recalled a 15-year-old girl at school who had sex with one boy to get 
back at another boyfriend. She got pregnant and had an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 She also sees how crushed some of these girls are when their sexual 
relationship ends in rejection or pregnancy. "For 12- and 14-year-olds, it can 
be devastating. These kids just don't understand. They cry and cry. Some of 
them have been suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can play an important role in helping to turn the tide in teen-age 
sex, Watson and others say. The ENBL program also educates parents on helping 
their teens to delay sex. 
</P>
<P>
 But counselors complain that some parents either give their children the wrong 
message about sex or no message at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of parents don't really know how prevalent sexual activity is. 
I think they are afraid to talk to their kids," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents are too permissive, allowing their high-school-age children to 
serve alcohol at parties or failing to monitor behavior, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Robbie Brady, who counsels students at Dana Hills High School, said 
she has seen 14-year-olds being left alone for a weekend, youngsters being 
allowed out late at night or spending long periods of time with members of the 
opposite sex without adult supervision.  
</P>
<P>
 It becomes an invitation for trouble, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents who don't set guidelines for their children argue that they 
don't want to interfere," psychologist Lasswell said. "Of course parents should 
interfere. That's what they are there for. Parents need to keep a close eye on 
their children. Otherwise, they will begin trying things they shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, Ervin and the others hope they can give these youngsters the skills to 
combat peer pressure and take control of their lives. But it may be an uphill 
battle. "They are given information about pregnancy, AIDS" and sexually 
transmitted diseases, Raffel said. "But that doesn't matter in the heat of 
passion. If somebody says, 'I love you,' and you don't hear that very often, 
passion takes over and you don't think about the health book lesson at school."

INVISIBLE NO MORE; RANDALL ROBINSON IS A QUIET FORCE FOR CHANGE -- CONSIDER HIS 
RECENT HUNGER STRIKE AND OUR ABOUT-FACE ON HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER CLAVER McALEVEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randall Robinson just wanted to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1950s Richmond, Va., a town where Jim Crow still ruled, and Robinson 
was a 13-year-old deliv ery boy awaiting a signature for the groceries he had 
delivered to a family in the lily-white suburbs. He was standing in the shadow 
of an old prewar icebox listening to family members talk about the most 
embarrassing matters without missing a beat, when he suddenly realized they 
didn't see him.  
</P>
<P>
 As much as he shuffled his feet and cleared his throat, no one paid any 
attention. It wasn't until years later when Robinson read Ralph Ellison's 
"Invisible Man" that he could put a name on the feeling, but that afternoon he 
understood, in the most gut-wrenching way, that he, too, was invisible. "It was 
like I wasn't there," he marvels. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Randall Robinson, 52, doesn't have to worry about people paying 
attention. He is the guiding light and co-founder of TransAfrica, an 
internationally recognized black lobbying organization. And when it comes to 
the most important issues in the international black community over the last 
decade -- South Africa and Haiti -- many believe he is one of the most 
influential African American leaders in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to his recent hunger strike as a significant factor in forcing the 
Clinton Administration to change its Haiti policy -- "27 days into the hunger 
strike, Clinton blinked," wrote one national magazine. And to his 
anti-apartheid activism in the 1980s. Robinson's protests snowballed into a 
national movement that raised congressional consciousness and helped lead to 
the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which cut U.S. economic ties with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after its passage, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), the prime Senate 
sponsor of the act, said: "When history is written of the struggle for a new 
South Africa, Randall Robinson's name will join those of Desmond Tutu, Nelson 
Mandela and the others who worked so hard to make the dream of freedom a 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, fellow Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry said: "It was Randall Robinson 
who first sounded the moral alarm on Haiti. And he had the moral authority to 
do so because of his work with the Free South Africa Movement in pushing the 
South African boycott bill through Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's quiet clout was never better demonstrated than in April and May.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton scored major points by 
excoriating President George Bush for his Haiti policy. "I am appalled by the 
decision of the Bush Administration to pick up fleeing Haitians on the high 
seas and forcibly return them to Haiti," Clinton said during that time. But 
after the election, his Administration dragged its heels at changing that 
policy. Robinson, working in conjunction with the Congressional Black Caucus 
and other U.S. representatives, decided to hold the President's feet to the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The chosen weapon was a hunger strike, which Robinson began April 12. By the 
end of the third week (he drank water and juice and lost 13 pounds) and as 
media reports about his health increased, the pressure on Clinton mounted. And 
while the White House publicly downplayed interest in Robinson, it was quietly 
sending emissaries to ask him what it would take to end his fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was the same on the 20th day of the strike -- when Samuel Berger, 
Clinton's deputy national security adviser, came to call -- as it had been on 
the first. All Robinson wanted the President to do, he told Berger, was to keep 
his word. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger left the TransAfrica building in northwest Washington near Embassy Row 
making no commitment. Caught by reporters later, he had no comment, other than 
to express admiration for Robinson. Yet within a week -- during which there was 
a flurry of media attention as Robinson was briefly hospitalized for 
dehydration -- Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser was 
calling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a quiet, lonely Saturday at strike headquarters in the Trans-Africa 
basement. The only guests were Robinson's wife and young daughter, who was 
sitting in vigil at her father's bedside when the phone rang. Lake had two 
questions, Robinson recalls: What would Robinson do if the President announced 
the next day that he was changing his Haiti policy and that the refugees would 
no longer be immediately repatriated to Haiti but, rather, given a chance to 
prove their refugee status? 
</P>
<P>
 And second, would Robinson do the President the honor of accompanying Vice 
President Al Gore on Air Force One the next day, May 8, as it winged a 
delegation of American dignitaries to Johannesburg for the inauguration of 
Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's answer was simple -- he would wait to see what the President had to 
say and, given the shape he was in after a nearly monthlong hunger strike, 
thank you but no, he didn't think he'd be able to take the President up on his 
offer of free air fare to Johannesburg.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, having seen the President's statement about offshore hearings 
for refugees seeking political asylum, Robinson announced that he was ending 
his fast. And while the Administration tried to downplay the timing, many 
observers, some of them Republican, believed there was a connection. As an 
outraged Dan Quayle said on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley" that morning: 
"This is foreign policy by hunger strike and that is not the way to conduct 
foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Growing up the son of a history teacher and high school coach, Maxie (Iron 
Man) Robinson, Randall Robinson was instilled with a sense of pride and 
achievement at an early age. The whole family was -- Robinson's older brother, 
Max Robinson, was the nation's first black network-TV anchor (he died of AIDS 
in 1988); one sister is an actress, the other is an elementary school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprouting to 6 feet, 5 inches, Robinson not only starred academically but on 
the basketball court as well, winning a scholarship to Norfolk State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of college, he was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during his two-year stint in the Army that Robinson started to realize 
that African Americans should care about Africa. A voracious reader -- 
everything from Edmund Burke to W.E.B. DuBois -- he haunted the post library 
until he came upon a book by E.R. Braithwaite, who had written the acclaimed 
novel "To Sir With Love" (which became a Sidney Poitier movie). It was "A Kind 
of Homecoming," which told the story of a trip Braithwaite had taken to Africa 
in search of his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only vicarious," Robinson says now, "but it was as though I had gone 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
 After his Army detour, Robinson returned to college and finished his degree in 
sociology in 1967. He earned a law degree from Harvard in 1970. He finally got 
the chance to go to Africa later that year on a Ford Foundation fellowship. 
There, on an island off the coast of Senegal, he stood in the preserved doorway 
of an ancient fortress from which thousands of Africans had been ushered onto a 
ship and sent to America. And it was only then that the young boy who had once 
stood motionless, invisible in a white household in suburban Virginia, finally 
broke down and cried. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, in 1976, Robinson and a number of supporters -- Ossie 
Davis, Ruby Dee, Arthur Ashe and Richard Hatcher among them -- started 
TransAfrica with a $5,000 donation. The idea behind the organization was 
simple: "As Greek Americans care about Greece," Robinson says, "and Jewish 
Americans care about Israel, (African Americans) should care about Africa. It's 
the fountainhead of our people, and our destinies are inextricably linked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last analysis, African Americans will stand only as tall as Africa 
stands. And an Africa that takes its place on the world stage will be 
tremendously enabling to all African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, of course, wasn't the first President to feel the bite of Robinson's 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, it was clear to Robinson and others that Ronald Reagan's 
policy of "engagement" with South Africa -- trading with that the country in 
the hope it would change -- was a failure. The defining moment for Robinson 
came in the fall of 1984 when the Botha government arrested virtually the 
entire (black) leadership of the South African trade union movement.  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Robinson decided he would go to the South African consulate and 
tell those there what he thought. And tell them and tell them and tell them, 
until apartheid was ended, he was thrown out, or he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting two like-minded individuals, he called the South African ambassador 
and arranged an appointment on Nov. 21, 1984, the day before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 All went well for the first hour or so, until the ambassador was called out of 
the meeting. When he returned, Robinson recalls with a smile, "he was ashen 
faced." He had just learned that the press was surrounding the embassy and that 
Robinson and company planned to refuse to leave. "Of the three choices he had, 
we fervently hoped that in his apartheid-inflated bravado, he would make the 
right one" and have them arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests (including that of a U.S. congressman) made front-page headlines 
around the world the next day. Over the next year, anywhere from one to 120 
people were arrested at the South African Consulate every day -- more than 
5,000 total -- including such politicians and celebrities as then-Connecticut 
Sen. Lowell Weicker, Stevie Wonder, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ashe. By the time 
the initial series of protests was over, Congress was on its way to passing the 
Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 (over Reagan's veto) and, with its last significant 
trading partner slipping away, the government in Pretoria was forced finally to 
confront the international legacy of its apartheid policy.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic," says Robinson's friend and longtime supporter Bryant Gumbel, 
the "Today" show anchor, "and somehow appropriate that on the day of his 
crowning achievement (the inauguration of Nelson Mandela) Randall couldn't go 
because he was recovering from a fast on behalf of someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson downplays his contributions. "There's no great craft in this," he 
says. "It grows out of a need to make a statement. When we went to the embassy 
in 1984, none of us had a clue that it would register, but it was the right 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't cause the President to change. Others have to do that. But to get 
them to do that, you have to get them a message. It must be kept simple and it 
has to be repeated over and over and over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his foreign-policy victories, what Robinson is proudest of is 
TransAfrica, which he believes will be his legacy. He has seen it grow to a 
foundation with a $1.2-million annual budget, a stunning new headquarters and a 
$3-million capital campaign. Among its supporters are Sugar Ray Leonard, who 
contributed $250,000, and Bill Cosby, who has raised more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Robinson has succeeded where previously only white foundations 
dare tread -- in corporate America. Among other recent donors: sports-shoe 
manufacturer Reebok with $375,000 and Coca-Cola with $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always bridled at the notion that African Americans should only 
concern themselves with domestic issues," Robinson says. "Anywhere decisions 
about America and the world are being made, we have an obligation to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 And TransAfrica, he believes, has a special obligation. "American policy 
should reflect American ideals, and if those ideals are to be supportive of 
democracy and economic development, then we have not behaved that way over the 
last 30 years toward Africa and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somalias don't just happen," Robinson says grimly. "We had a lot to do with 
it. We sent the dictator of a peaceful, pastoral society that had survived 
1,000 years $887 million worth of arms -- everything he needed to destroy 
himself and his people -- just because we wanted access to an air base in the 
Gulf of Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Somalia is but one example. In the name of the Cold War, many African 
societies have been devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after ending his hunger strike, Robinson was back on the warpath. 
Calling a lunchtime news conference at the TransAfrica headquarters, he 
excoriated Clinton for, in typical fashion, backing and filling.  
</P>
<P>
 "The policy of sanctions," he intoned, "has been so bungled by the Clinton 
Administration . . . that we're left with but one option" -- that of force.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, former Rep. Williams H. Gray III, the special White House envoy 
for Haiti, told a House panel that Clinton is ready to consider unilateral 
military action if sanctions fail. He also said the United States is making 
progress in pulling together a multinational peacekeeping force for Haiti that 
would move in after the military regime falls -- peacefully or because of an 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "A nation like the U.S. can't drift too far from its values and still 
recognize itself." In this case, Robinson says, that means taking a stand 
against tyranny, even if it means sending in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always believed that if you've got a message that resonates, a simple 
message, a call for simple fairness, you've got a chance. And if you can craft 
strategies to deliver that message to the masses, it can work. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you can do that," he says later, if you can be that committed, "you 
have a chance . . . and it really doesn't matter if you are up against a 
President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Or two, for that matter.

THE GOODS; THE ANNUAL TIE SIMPLY WON'T DO; WHAT DOES DAD WANT ON HIS DAY? 
SPORTSWEAR AND TOOLS.

<P>
 Father's Day is coming up on June 19 and Dad doesn't want a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, ties were at the bottom of the list, along with after-shave lotion 
and items for the car, in a recent Roper survey of current trends in Father's 
Day gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had assumed that ties were a big gift, but they aren't -- they are a dud," 
says Paul Luthringer of MCI Telecommunications, which commissioned the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in for dads this year? Casual clothing is the front-runner at 27%. 
Sporting goods followed at 9%, and books or tools registered 5% on the 
gift-choice scale.  
</P>
<P>
 But because 26% of Americans surveyed said they had no idea what to buy, MCI 
decided to give them some help. By dialing (800) 203-DADS, consumers can hear 
gift ideas from a handful of top retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Brothers, Brookstone, Nature Company, Radio Shack, Tiffany and Co. and 
Timberland are participating in the MCI Father's Day Gift Idea Hotline.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the hot line was launched last month, up to 400 people a day have been 
dialing in, Luthringer says. 
</P>
<P>
 The callers hear a variety of recorded suggestions from the retailers they 
choose, ranging from a six-in-one wonder tool kit for $15 (Brookstone) to a 
reversible golf jacket for $135 (Brooks Brothers). 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line will run until Father's Day, because the survey also showed that 
6% of Americans wait until the very last minute to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 And it also gives MCI a chance to plug its 50% Father's Day discount on 
domestic calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father's Day really can't touch Mother's Day in terms of calling traffic," 
Luthringer says. "We want to increase it." 
</P>
<P>
 And what gift is he planning for his own Dad? "I'll probably give him a tie."

 A few years ago, this new machine would have been gastronomically incorrect. 
But timing is everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, when real breakfasts are back in vogue and the egg has been upgraded to 
not-as-bad-as-we-thought status by medical researchers, the Breakfast Express 
from Hammacher Schlemmer hits the market.  
</P>
<P>
 The appliance brews one to four cups of coffee, toasts two slices of bread or 
an English muffin and fries two eggs sunny-side up while you shower or lie in 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about the size of a small microwave oven (9 1/2 inches wide, 15 inches 
long and 13 1/8 inches high), so it doesn't take up much counter space. It 
contains a coffee brewer on one side, toaster and non-stick frying pan on the 
other. Stainless steel cutters automatically slice off the bottoms of two raw 
eggs, so they drop shell-free into the pan. All the device's functions can be 
operated independently, and the frying pan and toaster grills remove easily for 
washing. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast Express has a 24-hour clock with a wake-up alarm and can be 
programmed to begin cooking and brewing whenever you want. The meal is ready in 
less than 10 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast Express ($399, plus $14.95 shipping and handling) may be ordered by 
calling (800) 543-3366. A Better View of the World 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp has added even more bells and whistles to its Viewcam, the unique 
camcorder the electronics company introduced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viewcam, you may recall, is the Hi-8 millimeter camcorder with a four-inch 
color liquid crystal display screen so you can see everything you record on a 
screen instead of through a conventional viewfinder. It also enables you to 
watch playback on the spot, complete with audio, and it doubles as a portable 
video player. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest model, VL-H400U, the second generation Viewcam, has instant 
playback with slow motion -- a great feature for studying a golf swing or a 
toddler's first steps -- an added wide-screen capability and a built-in hand 
strap to keep the camcorder secure if you are recording while in motion. And 
the zoom button on the lens has been replaced with a switch for easier 
operation.

 An on-screen world clock will tell you what time it is anywhere, and even has 
a Daylight Savings feature that automatically changes the time when it is time

 Viewcam VL-H400U retails for about $2,200 at electronics stores or mass 
merchandiser outlets. An optional accessory, the TV Tuner Pack, is also 
available. This device, about the size of a cigarette pack, snaps on the 
camcorder and turns it into a tiny TV capable of getting up to 68 stations.

 Rock-A-Bye Baby Inc., a Pompano Beach, Fla. manufacturer of infant care 
products, has introduced an innovative baby pacifier -- a stuffed animal that 
emits authentic intrauterine sounds recorded from a pregnant woman's womb. 
</P>
<P>
 Company representatives say the Natural Audio Pacifier has been tested on 
thousands of newborn babies in hospitals and clinics and was found to calm 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 A small audio unit that operates on a nine-volt battery fits in the back of a 
stuffed bear or bunny. The unit has a timer option that gives parents a choice 
of continuous sound or sound in five-minute intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock-A-Bye Bunny, a 10-inch white rabbit with black or raspberry accents, and 
Rock-A-Bye Bear, 11 inches in beige with brown trim or white with black trim, 
are made of hypo-allergenic, non-flammable materials. 
</P>
<P>
 These plush pacifiers ($35 each) are available nationwide in children's, gift, 
book and toy stores. You can find them locally at Bellini Juvenile Furniture on 
San Vicente Boulevard, Sid's Baby Store in Hollywood and Carousel Toys in 
Pasadena. Or call (800) 762-5229 for a store in your area.

THE GOODS; AT YOUR SERVICE; WHETHER IT'S A SOCIAL SECURITY WOE OR A POLITICAL 
COMPLAINT, CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OFFICES ARE THERE TO LISTEN AND HELP YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, a Los Angeles mother journeyed to Mexico and recovered two sons 
kidnaped by their father. 
</P>
<P>
 The grateful mother succeeded because the district office of U.S. Rep. Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) secured help from the State Department and the 
Mexican consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a dying former pilot in Los Alamitos, wounded and captured in a 
dangerous World War II mission over Austria, was belatedly awarded the 
Distinguished Flying Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot finally received his medal because the district office of Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) interceded with the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 These cases are among tens of thousands handled each year by the district 
offices operated by each member of Congress in his or her home district. Each 
of the federally funded offices serves about 600,000 citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to a district office "takes us back to 19th-Century America, when 
there was a stronger connection between the electorate and elected officials," 
says USC political science professor H. Eric Schockman. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when it often seems as if government service and influence is 
monopolized by lobbyists in Washington, district offices give every citizen a 
local place to get help or just sound off. 
</P>
<P>
 Working long hours in crowded offices with well-used furniture and constantly 
ringing phones, the staffs help constituents solve problems with federal 
agencies or express opinions on political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a one-stop service center," says Rose Castaneda, an administrative 
assistant in the office of Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City). "Sometimes I 
feel like McDonald's. Tell us what you want and we facilitate it." 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a good caseworker, you can't give up when normal procedures don't work. 
You've got to ask what else might work," adds Yolanda Chavez, chief of staff 
for Roybal-Allard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That comes with rapport you have with different offices. You also must have a 
passion about helping people. You work as a mediator between the agency and the 
constituent. The bottom line is that the constituent gets the service they 
deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, district offices help people work out problems with Social 
Security, Medicare, the Veterans Administration or the Immigration Service, 
says Kathleen Hollingsworth, district director for Rohrabacher's office.  
</P>
<P>
 "Usually 70% to 75% of our casework involves those agencies," she says. "The 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the State Department are important 
simply because we have so many new immigrants in this area. . . . We often have 
people saying 'I want my grandmother to visit here and they won't give her a 
visa.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena district office of Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) recently 
helped a woman with lupus, arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome gain 
disability benefits formerly denied by Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffs may also help constituents replace lost Social Security checks or gain 
Medicare coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing the district with the nation's highest percentage of Latino 
population and lowest median income, Roybal-Allard's office teaches people how 
to qualify for tax credits, home ownership, banking services and citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices also react to emergencies. Following the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
Berman's staff found an apartment for a pregnant woman whose residence had been 
destroyed and who was due to give birth in a week. It replaced another 
constituent's damaged wheelchair and bought $300 of insulin and syringes for 
needy diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to breaking logjams with federal agencies, the offices may refer 
matters outside federal jurisdiction to state or local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Their other big job is to help constituents express opinions or get 
information on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When big issues are up, like health-care reform or NAFTA, we don't get our 
routine work done," says Hollingsworth in Rohrabacher's office. "People are 
constantly writing and calling with their opinion." A staff member summarizes 
the views and sends them to the congressman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 District offices also book the representative's schedule, make nominations for 
appointments to military academies and dispense tickets for Washington tours. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have serious business with a district office should visit it 
personally, USC's Schockman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a person (in the staff office) is connected with a welfare mother or an 
AIDS patient or someone who is really suffering, and sees that individual on 
the other side of the desk, I think there's a greater response level to that 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 But staff members say telephoning the office is more efficient. "It saves them 
a trip and it's rare that we can't help them over the phone," says Patricia 
Miller, administrative assistant to Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Staff offices, usually run by four to eight people, are listed in most phone 
books under United States Government Offices. They can work quickly in 
emergencies or, on more routine matters, follow up and keep written records of 
cases as they progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers say they're too busy to tally up the cases they handle. But Pat 
Walmisley, staff assistant for Moorhead, says she has 420 ongoing requests and 
recently closed one that began in 1988. Rohrabacher's office has 479 cases in 
progress, Hollingsworth says. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices are effective because Congress and federal agencies have reasons 
to cooperate, says Gary Jacobson, professor of political science at UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress wants good relationships with the agencies because it will be asking 
them for things," Jacobson says. "People in the agencies want to be seen as 
fair, effective and competent because Congress enacts their budget every year 
and writes the laws that create their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The district offices can't solve everything, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon's office in Los Angeles "received a few calls recently from people who 
have concerns about whether their home may be in foreclosure," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the lender is federally chartered, they're hoping we can be of 
assistance. That problem isn't within our jurisdiction. If a lender operated 
outside guidelines, we could intervene." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all calls are about crucial matters such as losing a home. One man asked 
to speak to Rohrabacher about why the Food and Drug Administration would allow 
manufacturers to put plastic in cheese products. Seems the man was melting 
cheese in a pan on the stove and the cheese turned "gooey like glue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said since it was processed food, he might want to add a little milk and 
turn the heat down," Hollingsworth recalls. "I never heard back." 
</P>
<P>
 But most calls are important. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent telephoned donation of 200 gallons of paint to Berman's office made 
Castaneda happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The paint would transform the exterior of the peeling Monlux Elementary School 
in North Hollywood. The campus had not been scheduled for painting for many 
years, but will now be beautified in a community effort spearheaded by Berman's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff had hurried to help arrange the project after a call from the school 
six days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met with the principal and scheduled a Saturday to bring in parents to 
paint," she says. "We made phone calls and got promises of contributions for 
paint and equipment. It wasn't really a hard task." 
</P>
<P>
 Those kinds of results are satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me, 'What do you do?' " Castaneda says. "I tell them: 'I respond.' 
" CASE STUDY 1 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
 The Monlux Elementary School in North Hollywood needs a paint job, but is not 
scheduled for painting by the Board of Education for many years. Principal 
Naomi Suenaka, center, examines the deterioration with Marti Farless and 
Ellison Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
 A call to Rep. Howard Berman's Mission Hills district office. It obtains 
donations of paint and equipment, and spearheads a community project to paint 
the school. CASE STUDY 2 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
 A dying World War II pilot wants recognition for a dangerous bombing mission 
in which he was wounded and taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
 A call to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's Huntington Beach district office. It 
contacts the Department of the Air Force, which awards the man a Distinguished 
Flying Cross. CASE STUDY 3: 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
 Teena Rossitto, suffering from lupus, arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome, 
is denied Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
 A call to Rep. Charles J. Moorhead's Pasadena district office. It contacts the 
agency and helps clear the roadblock. Her benefits begin arriving.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jodi Gross grew up in an apartment without a yard and remembers wanting a 
garden so desperately that her mother finally painted a garden mural over her 
bed.  
</P>
<P>
 Now she, her husband, Dale, and their two children -- Mitchell, 4, and Amelia, 
10 months -- live in a Canoga Park apartment, where they have no place to plant 
a garden. This hasn't stopped her, though, from realizing her life's dream. In 
January, wanting her own children to grow up gardening, and cherishing visions 
of a patch full of herbs, onions, garlic, peppers, strawberries and flowers, 
she rented a plot at the Orcutt Horticultural Center in West Hills. There, for 
a $20 annual fee, gardeners get a freshly tilled 10-by 20-foot plot and all the 
water they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a setup, Gross has found, provides an arena for an ideal family project. 
Children of all ages enjoy digging in the dirt, watching plants grow and 
presenting the fruits of their labors at the dinner table. In addition, said 
Yvonne Freeman, adult education coordinator of the Common Ground Garden Program 
in Los Angeles, gardening sessions can easily turn into nature lessons as young 
ones observe the snails and butterflies that greens attract, the variations in 
leaf forms and the way they incline to catch the sun.  
</P>
<P>
 For the Gross family, the process began with research: With children in tow, 
Jodi Gross scavenged the library for practical books on vegetable gardening and 
then planned the details on graph paper. She bought about $100 worth of plants, 
seeds, bulbs, tools and soil amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 For the children, even the preliminaries were fun. "We had a ball," Gross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the garden is in, she brings the children to their plot two or three 
days a week, for an hour or so. Mitchell helps weed and water, and loves 
looking for new strawberries to harvest. Amelia usually sits in a stroller and 
watches, sometimes napping in the sun.  
</P>
<P>
 If there's time, Gross sits down with a cold drink and surveys the area. "I 
like the satisfaction of putting something in the ground and watching it grow, 
and just being outside with lots of beautiful things all around," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Karla West of West Hills describes a similar delight in her foray into family 
food gardening. Twice a week for the last seven years, she has been bringing 
her husband and two children -- Ambur, 12, and Daniel, 9 -- along with the 
family dog, to their garden plot at the Orcutt center. While the Wests live in 
a house with a small yard, Karla likes the community feel of a neighborhood 
garden, and relishes the chance to swap ideas and trade vegetables with other 
gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wests plant what they like to eat: broccoli, corn, onions, carrots, 
sunflowers, beets and lettuce. They also grow turnips -- not to cook, but 
because they grow so fast. "It makes me feel successful," said West, a teacher 
at Sutter Middle School in Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 She's glad to report that her children don't mind weeding and watering -- 
unless it's hot -- and they love planting and picking. But she thinks the best 
thing about the garden is that it has made the kids appreciate the value and 
taste of fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, who has three youngsters who garden, offers a few tips for families 
interested in trying a vegetable garden. First, she counsels, start small and 
gradually increase the size of the area so that the details and the work are 
not initially overwhelming. In terms of crop selection, she finds that baby 
pumpkins, sunflowers, pole beans and cherry tomatoes are typically big hits 
with children. But she advises parents to select seeds and plants that the 
family is most likely to enjoy eating. "There's no sense planting kohlrabi if 
you're not going to eat it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In her own garden, she encourages her children to have fun but also to dig, 
rake and weed as hard as they can. In her words, "My kids realize that if you 
want the rewards of the harvest, you have to work." WHERE TO GO 
</P>
<P>
 What: Rentable family gardening plots. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: The Orcutt Horticultural Center, 23600 Roscoe Blvd., West Hills.

 Price: $20 a year for a 10-by-20-foot plot.

SALUTE TO SENIORS '94; PROFILES FROM THE CLASS OF '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon, they will be moving on -- to college, into the workplace, away from 
home. Whatever their destinations, the members of the Class of '94 will be 
taking with them their high school experiences.  
</P>
<P>
 Many have already helped give direction to their generation -- from helping 
conduct AIDS research to breaking down the walls of racism that divide schools 
and communities. Others have given disaster victims critical assistance or 
joined to fight the onrush of gang violence. Some have helped spirits soar with 
their art and music. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Class of '94 are entering a world with larger freedoms and 
responsibilities, of possibilities and problems. For this third annual Salute 
to Seniors, The Times invited Orange County high schools to nominate students 
who have distinguished themselves in the areas of leadership, academics and the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
 From those nominees, one student from each school was chosen to be featured in 
today's edition -- students who may or may not be their school's "top" student, 
but who by their involvement and accomplishments seem to especially represent 
the hopes of the future.
