 ON THE ROAD: Ventura County has yet to regain its allure for folks from out of 
state. . . . The Department of Motor Vehicles reports that 11,265 licensed 
drivers moved from the county to other states, while 7,017 out-of-state drivers 
moved here. That's a net loss of 4,248 drivers. And the DMV figures that for 
every two drivers, there's a dependent who doesn't drive. So it places the 
county's exodus last year at 6,372 people. The pattern mirrors a statewide 
trend (A3), with 126,000 California drivers fleeing for other states. 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE MARCH: One Thousand Oaks homeowner reports a black column of ants 
heading straight for the swimming pool. Another says every night a phalanx of 
critters crawls across the kitchen counter. . . . Driven indoors by the heat, 
six-legged armies are infiltrating homes in search of water (A1). . . . Pest 
control firms are buzzing with calls for help. "There's been a tremendous 
increase since the heat wave started," said Marco Sobrino, of Conejo Valley 
Pest Control. "I've seen thousands and thousands of ants everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE WATERFRONT: Aquarium fever is breaking out along the Gold Coast. . . . 
Enticed by the notion of a prestigious tourist attraction, Ventura, Oxnard and 
Santa Barbara are racing forward with plans to build aquariums brimming with 
sea life (Ventura County Life, Page 8). But experts say three fish tanks would 
saturate the market. "I hope somebody really does an aquarium," says urban 
planner Bill Fulton, "but all three of these towns is a ridiculous idea." 
</P>
<P>
 ON A ROLL: What baseball strike? For fans of Thousand Oaks Little League, this 
could hardly be considered a lull in the season. . . . The Thousand Oaks 
13-year-old All Stars defeated a team from Arlington, Fla., 10-4, to win their 
second game in the Junior League World Series in Taylor, Mich. . . . The 
Thousand Oaks team advances to the semifinals tonight. "I think we're capable 
of winning the championship," said Coach Craig Frazier. "We're right there."

MUSIC REVIEW; EUROPE PREVIEW AT THE BOWL SHOWS SERIOUS SIDE OF SALONEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say this for Esa-Pekka Salonen. He is a conductor open to new ideas. Even bad 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year around this time, he serenaded the picnic crowd at Hollywood Bowl 
with an indigestible mishmash that juxtaposed symphonic sophistication with 
pop, schlock and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, his alfresco music-making remains emphatically, uncompromisingly 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to know if the change of stylistic heart reflects a new aesthetic 
idealism or mere practicality. The Los Angeles Philharmonic embarks on an 
ambitious European tour next week, and the maestro has to polish the export 
repertory. This is no time for frivolous detours. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening item on the program Tuesday night offered a potential shock, not 
to mention a flirtation with audience alienation. The music of Elliott Carter 
isn't exactly lingua franca in our wide open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen did not venture a thorny example of Carter's late output, to be sure. 
Our maestro opted for the relatively conservative First Symphony, written in 
1942 when the composer was a cautious 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The inherent dissonances didn't threaten to stretch many ears among the 22,788 
reportedly assembled for the occasion. But the contemporary opus didn't promise 
much solace for the hum-along habitues either. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. No problem. The Bowl survived its ordeal by Carter with ease, and 
with honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen conducted this example of rugged musical Americana as if the inlets of 
Cape Cod meant as much to him as the fiords of Finland. In the maestro's calm, 
analytical hands, clever Carter -- always individual and ultimately poignant -- 
sounded no more forbidding than folksy Copland. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to accessibility (everything is relative) represented an expressive 
cul-de-sac for the composer. Still, it is a cul-de-sac of historic interest. 
Salonen and the Philharmonic explored it with telling sympathy and affecting 
fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 They closed their lengthy program in similar triumph with an unusually tight 
and propulsive performance of Sibelius' Second Symphony. Like all interpreters 
of this once over-popular essay in orchestral indulgence, they found the 
composer most congenial in flights of arching lyricism, somewhat trying in 
passages of redundant bombast. 
</P>
<P>
 If one must endure the thematic bludgeoning of the hyper-extended finale, it 
may be best to endure it in a performance as crisp and restrained as this one. 
Unlike some famous colleagues, Salonen kept Sibelius' ideas flowing as briskly 
as logic would permit, never dawdling to stress the obvious. The Philharmonic 
responded to his no-nonsense urgings with virtuosic flair in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the evening was Mozart's beloved D-minor Piano Concerto, K. 
466. This challenge turned out to be a bit more problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Emanuel Ax, the powerful soloist, played with the purity, clarity and grace 
that have earned him international acclaim for nearly two decades. Choosing 
fascinating, slightly anachronistic cadenzas by Beethoven and Hummel, he 
persuasively stressed the heroic storm behind the Mozartean charm in the outer 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The tender Romanze emerged brisk and prosaic, however, and the aura of repose 
wasn't exactly enhanced by the jet-buzz ostinato that cut through the 
pianissimo reflection. The skies will be friendlier, we trust, in London, 
Birmingham and Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen's accompaniment seemed more dutiful than beautiful. Mozart may not be 
his cup of aquavit.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SOCIAL DISTORTION: RUSTY BUT POWERFUL AT THE TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of Los Angeles' early punk bands, Social Distortion mixed the basic 
swing of blues and country with punk-rock, delivering some of the best 
underground tunes of the early '80s. The Fullerton quartet stood apart from 
speedy hard-core bands by doing such songs as Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" with 
a cool patience, and separated itself from older punk bands by trading in 
anarchy for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Distortion hasn't played live in over a year, so the band's set on 
Tuesday at the sold-out Troubadour was slightly rusty. It was also inescapably 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Mike Ness had his hair slicked back and wore overalls that exposed his 
multiple tattoos, and he sang to a crowd with a similar look. Despite some 
recent throat problems, he made it through the set by smoothing out his usual 
gravelly drone and dropping the volume. There weren't as many rough edges, but 
his voice still dug into the music and grabbed hold.  
</P>
<P>
 SD's trademarks -- slippery guitar, stalking, hard-core bass lines, swaggering 
rock 'n' roll rhythms -- were all intact. They played mainly old material -- 
from "Mommy's Little Monster" to "Born to Lose" -- plus a couple of new songs 
from an album due out next year. The new material, though not quite mastered 
yet, fit in nicely with the other tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, the group's sound was still relevant, and its songs 
emerged not just as great numbers from a bygone era, but as good rock songs 
with built-in longevity. LORRAINE ALI

ART REVIEWS; CULTIVATING UNEXPECTED VISTAS OF ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing happens by accident in Lynn Geesaman's meticulously composed 
photographs of extravagantly manicured gardens and parks. Every tree, shrub, 
footpath and pond plays at least two roles simultaneously, reminding viewers of 
the beauty of natural flora and demonstrating the gardeners' power to compose 
plants in visually satisfying panoramas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stephen Cohen Gallery, Geesaman's 25 exquisite silver prints from the past 
six years begin where the gardeners leave off, adding another level of artifice 
to nature's raw materials. Her pretty, black-and-white images focus on odd, 
off-center vistas. Geesaman tweaks the highly structured symmetry of the formal 
gardens she visits in Belgium, Holland, France, England and Italy to create her 
own idiosyncratic -- yet formally rigorous -- compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 From across the gallery, the Minneapolis-based photographer's perfectly square 
pictures appear to be modest abstractions. Against bright, white skies that 
look like pure vacuums, saturated black silhouettes of shrubbery and trees 
dramatically contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of tonal modulation locks the pictorial elements into single 
planes. Branches, trunks and canals read as straight or curved lines. Sculpted 
topiaries have the presence of flat, geometric shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The restraint evident in Geesaman's well-mannered photographs enhances the 
visual tension between volumetric depth and graphic two-dimensionality. Moving 
up close to her pictures complicates the formal drama, revealing previously 
invisible textures, details and subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
 What had seemed to be monochromatic silhouettes slowly unfold to become rows 
of identically trimmed trees, tangles of limbs sprouting foliage from their 
ends or clusters of plump topiaries whose individual leaves are clearly 
articulated. Dark halos emanating from the trunks of many trees endow 
Geesaman's artificial landscapes with a soft, haunting afterglow that 
intensifies their mystery. Seemingly lit from behind, her photographs resemble 
empty stage sets suspended in time and cut free from the pull of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fragmentary and partial, these entrancing images reject the idea of distant 
overviews or excessively planned surveys. Rather than privileging a fixed, 
central point-of-view, Geesaman's photographs describe unexpected perspectives. 
They combine a classically modernist sense of composition with a romantic 
desire to find vistas that stir deep sentiments, effectively demonstrating that 
when fresh views don't happen by accident, they can be carefully cultivated.

 Fresh From the Past: "In Retrospect: Paintings of the '80s" is a slyly titled, 
six-artist exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery. Its compact, 
far-from-complete survey of a vital strand of Los Angeles-based abstraction is 
more of a tease than a fully elaborated history lesson. Like a movie preview, 
it leaves you wanting to see more of each artist's rich, painterly flourishes, 
bold, graphic patterns and quirky, cartoon Surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is an effective antidote to the notion that painting, in the 1980s, 
wholly consisted of the neo-expressionist return to figuration that swept 
Europe and New York. By baldly laying claim to that decade, "Paintings of the 
'80s" pointedly suggests that art in Los Angeles has its own history, that it 
cannot be assessed in terms of Baselitz, Clemente or Schnabel, but must be 
accounted for according to different criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the exhibition's 14 images still look fresh. However, they are 
most engaging as points of comparison to each artist's current work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lari Pittman's mural-scale "Netherworld" traces his manic, hyperactive 
graphics to an imaginary landscape overlaid with decorative motifs, dancing 
organic forms and a sailboat drifting on a golden lake. Likewise, Roy Dowell's 
current, cacophonous collages have their roots in five emblematic paintings, in 
which Cubism's fractured space is held in check by an eccentric geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Pally's recent, tattoo-like cartographies grow out of rougher, 
doodle-derived compositions that masterfully meld media. Three dreamy paintings 
by Jeff Gambill begin to chart the psychological territory out of which his 
moving, inarticulate symbols continue to spring. "Broader Landscapes," by Renee 
Petropoulos, signals her emergent interest in pushing painting beyond its frame 
to actively engage architectural space. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike all of these images, which track each artist's current work back to an 
earlier stage of development, Karen Carson's juicy oil-and-acrylic-on-canvas 
departs from her recent banners, globes and installations, revealing a 
sumptuous side that has not carried over into her more message-oriented pieces.

 Grand Delusions: "Pistonine," Greg Solomon Falk's largest sculpture at William 
Turner Gallery, resembles a gigantic, dysfunctional balance that doubles as a 
gushing water fountain, miniature reflecting pool and slow-burning oil lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitions behind this towering, multipurpose contraption, made of rusted 
metal, baked clay, hidden pumps and ample gaskets (among other mechanical 
devices), are concisely summarized by the materials listed under its title on 
the exhibition checklist: earth, fire, water and oil. The artist, it seems, 
wants viewers to believe that his piece consists of four substances very 
similar to the four elements that were once believed to constitute all physical 
matter: earth, fire, water and air. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preposterous game of one-upmanship, Falk proposes that, as an artist, he 
has outdone the creator of the universe himself. In substituting oil for air, 
the young sculptor pretends to have made an object more valuable and salable -- 
and poisonous -- than anything else that exists. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Falk's fantasy of grandeur is that he asks viewers to share 
it. Although the idea that artists are endowed with godlike powers -- capable 
of miraculous creations and able to give form to inchoate matter -- might be 
attractive in the studio, it falls flat in the gallery, especially when it's 
the art's main appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of six small sculptures confirm suspicions of Falk's pretensions. 
Individually titled "Core Sample," followed by fictitious latitudinal and 
longitudinal readings, these watered-down, cleaned-up assemblages, placed under 
glass on expensive metal pedestals, look like designer rehashes of the style 
that originated in California more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth piece in this series gives away Falk's game. "Core Sample -- 
Latitude 120 North, Longitude 43.1 West" describes coordinates that do not 
exist. Its toothless Surrealism attempts to trick viewers into thinking that 
its gambit is authentic, and not just a self-conscious pose trying to pass 
stylized merchandise off as the real thing.

SCOTT HARRIS: WHEN SLURS BOOST SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acho Nwana, a New Yorker of Nigerian origin, used an ethnic slur the other 
day. The word was ofay . It's black slang for white person -- an obscure term, 
but derogatory all the same. According to one dictionary, it has roots in both 
militant politics and pig Latin. Ofay, you see, means "foe." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I didn't know all this when Nwana acknowledged his use of the word, but I 
did suspect that ofay was a sneaky version of whitey or honky. For the record, 
I'm a white guy. But did Nwana's word offend me? Not at all. I like to think of 
myself as an enlightened slice of Wonder Bread, so I considered the context and 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
 The context was Scrabble. The intent was points. 
</P>
<P>
 " Fay is a very common play," explains Nwana, a computer systems analyst for 
Reader's Digest. "And ofay is a way to build on it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, to say that Nwana just plays Scrabble is a little like saying Pete 
Sampras just plays tennis or Don Juan just played around. He may not be the 
reigning world champ -- that's Mark Nyman of Leeds, England -- or the world's 
No. 1 ranked player -- that's Joe Edley of Coram, N.Y. -- but Nwana competes on 
their level. This week, Nwana, Nyman and Edley are among the 300 players who've 
gathered at the Universal Hilton to compete for the $50,000 purse in the 1994 
National Scrabble Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 My despondency over the baseball strike wasn't the only reason I dropped by to 
watch the world's greatest Scrabble players in action. Nor is the fact that I, 
like 30 million other Americans, happen to like Scrabble. What really 
interested me was the thought that I might witness a milestone of social 
history -- the very last politically incorrect Scrabble championship in the 
United States of Sensitivity. I mean, America. 
</P>
<P>
 If the PC armies had their way, ofay would not be a legal play. Nor would any 
other ethnic slur. Another camp, meanwhile, has sought to ban profanity. 
Fearful of a public relations debacle, Hasbro Inc., which owns the rights to 
Scrabble, has agreed to outlaw such words by deleting them from the next 
edition of the Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of Scrabble purists has largely ranged from anger to dismay to 
bemusement. "Freedom Bans Censorship," declared one player's T-shirt. Nwana 
says he has argued with black and Jewish friends that words on a Scrabble board 
have no meaning beyond their score. "These words are part of history. Why deny 
it?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Landsberg of Brentwood, who once scored the astonishing world record of 
770 points in one tournament game, says it will be hard to please everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a receding hairline, so I would like bald out of the dictionary," he 
cracks. "One of my favorite words is fubsy. It means chubby and somewhat squat. 
Now, its just a perfect word that describes a lot of people, but somebody won't 
like it. There's just word after word that can be construed as offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few players who expressed a contrary opinion was Eugenio G. 
Ngan-Tian of Winnipeg, Canada. Ngan-Tian says that as a Christian, he favors 
banning several words from Scrabble.  
</P>
<P>
 But does his religious faith keep him from playing such terms? 
</P>
<P>
 The player shrugged and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've got to," he said, "because I'm here for the money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John D. Williams Jr., executive director of the National Scrabble Assn. and an 
expert player himself, is in the uncomfortable role of one of Scrabble's 
official censors. Because the National Scrabble Assn. is funded by both Hasbro 
and Scrabble club members, his job requires him to balance both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Williams says, there are 150 words on the hit list. Romanian interests 
have sought assurance that gyp will be banned, but Williams says he has yet to 
hear from the Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
 A few problematic words, it seems, may be saved by the assignment of new 
meanings. Poof , for example, was explained in current Scrabble dictionary as 
British slang for a gay man, but in the next edition it may be redefined as "a 
magician's expression." Williams says he has a special problem with the word 
tup . It means . . . well, sorry, you'll have to look up that one yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the best solution is the creation of two sets of rules -- one for 
leisure play, and one for tournaments. This week, Williams announced that 
"OSPD2" -- as players refer to the second edition of the Official Scrabble 
Player's Dictionary -- will remain in force for tournament play. The sanitized 
OSPD3, however, will be "official" as far as the public is concerned. Williams 
is hopeful that the PC crowd will accept this compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying, in effect, is that we're trained professionals. . . . 
We're saying, 'Kids -- don't try this at home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe I didn't witness history after all. Well, gosh darn it.

HEALTH CARE: CALM DOWN AND GET BACK TO BASIC PRINCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton did what leaders are 
supposed to do. They took the risk of forcing the nation to face the reality 
that something is seriously wrong with the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years now the Clintons have brought the message home and pushed 
Congress to pass reform. A lot is at stake for the President -- and for Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), for whom health reform is the last 
big issue before he retires later this year. Some within the Republican Party 
would deny Clinton anything that would enhance his or other Democrats' chances 
at the polls. Some legislators on both sides of the aisle, listening to a 
public that wants reform but is wary of government, are ambivalent. It's an 
overheated political environment; not a good situation for making a major 
change in public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this means there are not serious flaws in the health care system that 
must be corrected. There's a momentum for action that should not be frittered 
away. But Congress, so far at least, has failed to come up with a plan that 
targets what's worst about the system without creating potential new pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 MISSING THE TARGET: In their appropriate zeal to enact reforms this year, 
proponents lost sight of one of the key arts of effective lawmaking: setting 
priorities. There's no question that the weaknesses of the health care system 
-- 37 million uninsured, spiraling medical costs -- deserve a full response. 
But there's also no question that when the health care system commandeers 
one-seventh of the U.S. economy, the proposed cures had better not exacerbate 
the ills. The stakes are just too large. Mitchell's well-intentioned but 
omnibus bill is the result of trying so hard to placate the business, labor and 
medical lobbies. As currently written, it paints with too broad a brush; it's a 
mammoth measure that proposes to gag on gnats and swallow camels. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 85% of Americans have health insurance, 15% go without coverage, and 
anyone who loses a job is vulnerable to joining the swelling ranks of the 
uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the employed, who is not covered by any health insurance? About 98% of 
employers with more than 100 employees provide health coverage. More than 70% 
of companies with more than 10 employees offer coverage, though not all pay for 
it. But among the 3.5 million smallest firms, 73% do not offer coverage. Hello, 
Congress, do you think maybe those small firms need your attention right away? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitchell bill deserves clear credit for heeding what health professionals 
have been saying for years: Universal coverage, or coverage for virtually every 
American, is essential. Coverage for all is the only way to stop the insane 
cost-shifting and last-minute acute medical care that jack up the health care 
bill.  
</P>
<P>
 LOCATING THE TARGET: So the first goal should be to insure those who are not 
insured. The poorest Americans receive and should continue to get government 
help. The majority of those who are not insured work, full-time or part-time, 
typically for small firms. Small firms also happen to be the engine that drives 
growth in the California economy. How then do you get coverage for employees of 
small firms without crippling small employers?  
</P>
<P>
 Remember those politically reviled health insurance purchasing cooperatives 
(HIPCs) that originally were part of the Clinton proposal? They are thriving in 
voluntary form. The Health Insurance Plan of California, set up by the state 
but privately run, allows small employers to get better rates as a group; 
insurance premiums have been driven down 10% for members of the plan during the 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses, so many right on the edge of profitability, naturally do not 
want to be saddled with skyrocketing insurance rates, which is exactly what can 
happen when just one employee in a 10-employee firm becomes gravely ill. Small 
employers must band together for the same reason that universal coverage must 
be the nation's goal -- the more people in an insurance pool the more that risk 
is spread around and costs are contained. There seems no avoiding it: As a 
first step, small businesses that don't offer insurance should be obliged to 
join HIPCs -- private or public -- so that they can offer their employees 
access to a range of reasonably priced insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
 MOVING REFORM FORWARD: Employers wouldn't have to pay for the insurance, only 
offer it; employees could then choose a plan they could afford. Tax 
deductions/credits could be offered to prompt employees to buy at least basic 
coverage. To encourage cost containment, favorable tax treatment could be 
limited to the cost of only the basic plan. It's a start and, politically 
speaking, a start that's doable now.  
</P>
<P>
 This approach, which has been endorsed by some Democrats and Republicans, 
would not get the nation to universal coverage but it would move things in the 
right direction. Most, including supporters of the Mitchell plan, agree now 
that absent a massive new tax program that Americans currently are unwilling to 
undertake, universal coverage must occur incrementally.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting a grip on total health care reform -- involving issues of portable and 
catastrophic coverage, eliminating discrimination against the sick, cost 
containment -- can be done in stages. The Consumer Price Index found that 
medical costs rose 5.4% in 1993; though it's the lowest growth rate in 20 
years, it is still double the inflation rate. Did the rate slow because the 
medical industry kept costs down in hopes of beating back feared government 
regulation? Or did the competitive pressures of the marketplace work naturally 
to slow the rise in costs? Probably both. A combination of government 
watchfulness and market forces can continue to shake up the system and make 
health care affordable and efficient. It is neither now.

ORDER IN THE COURTS; DISCIPLINING JUDGES -- AND STREAMLINING JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Legislature is edging toward opening a long-overdue public 
dialogue on court reform. Proposed constitutional amendments now under debate 
would, if approved, permit the voters to decide whether to reorganize the 
increasingly cumbersome trial court system and whether to shed daylight on the 
state's largely secretive and ineffective system of disciplining wayward 
judges. Both changes are needed. Lawmakers have shown little appetite over the 
years for challenging the judiciary on matters relating to its comportment and 
organization. Lately, however, momentum for reform has been building. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing the way the Commission on Judicial Performance operates is clearly 
the more pressing need. California was once a leader in monitoring and 
disciplining judges. No longer is that true. The commission, created in 1960, 
is dominated by the judges themselves, conducts its business largely in secret 
and, according to a growing number of critics, is ineffective at investigating 
the increasing charges of malfeasance on the bench and at imposing discipline.  
</P>
<P>
 The California commission has held public hearings in only two judicial 
discipline cases in its 33-year history. The second began Tuesday in Fresno, in 
the shadow of steady progress by the Legislature toward approval of a proposed 
constitutional amendment. Two similar bills, which would be reconciled and 
passed as one measure, would add more citizen members to the commission, give 
the commission broader rule-making and budgetary discretion and require public 
hearings to be held once preliminary investigations were completed and formal 
charges had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, many state judges oppose these changes, and the California Judges 
Assn. and the California Judicial Council, which is charged with overseeing 
operation of the state courts, have taken no formal position on the measures. 
Such indifference or opposition is sad to see; these proposals make a great 
deal of sense.  
</P>
<P>
 So too does the proposal, still clinging to life in the Legislature, to 
consolidate the state's trial courts by eliminating municipal and justice 
courts and directing superior courts to hear all original civil and criminal 
matters. This proposed constitutional amendment fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority when the Assembly voted on it last month. It may come up 
again in coming weeks; we hope it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure, Senate Constitutional Amendment 3, would complete the voluntary 
administrative coordination launched in 1991 under the Trial Court Realignment 
and Efficiency Act. As part of that effort, administrators and clerks who serve 
municipal and superior judges in the same counties are merging, eliminating 
much staff duplication, effort and cost. SCA 3 would go further, replacing the 
separate justice, municipal and superior courts with a single, unified court. 
The move would eliminate the overlapping jurisdictions among these trial courts 
and streamline operations. Unification is also projected to result in long-run 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Consolidation would have the effect of elevating municipal and justice court 
judges to the superior court. They would share the same duties as superior 
court judges and receive the same pay. Many sitting superior court judges are 
concerned about the elevation of so many lower court judges; some worry also 
that SCA 3 might result in higher public costs in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 But to our mind, the long-run advantages of trial court consolidation -- both 
in terms of efficiency and cost -- outweigh possible short-term problems. More 
immediately, however, we think that the Legislature should approve this 
measure, putting it on the ballot so that voters themselves can have a chance 
to decide.

IMMIGRATION AND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm offended by the Federation for American Immigration Reform's attacks on 
immigrants. The amnesty study cited by Dan Stein (Commentary, Aug. 8) covered 
immigrants who came here illegally, but he uses the results to tarnish all 
immigrants. He tries to tell us that foreign workers, pulled in by the 
invisible hand of the market, don't have the appropriate skills. Hogwash! 
Immigrants don't throw accountants out of their jobs. They obviously have the 
right skills, or they wouldn't find work. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ira Mehlman's slippery piece (Aug. 9) tries to take on the "myth" of the 
tax boon, he starts by getting his facts wrong: He won't face the fact that 
illegal immigrants pay millions into Social Security, with no hope of ever 
getting any back! As for the legal immigrants, who also pay more in federal 
taxes than they get back, the worst he can say is this: "That's true of almost 
everyone." In other words, they contribute to society just like citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR's answer to our nation's problems is to blame everything on foreigners. 
This racist theory encourages simplistic thinking and intolerant attitudes. My 
parents are immigrants. I'm proud of them, and it burns me up when FAIR tries 
to tar and feather them.

 I was very pleased to read Stein's fine column regarding the disastrous impact 
of the federal government's "open door" immigration policy on Southern 
California. As highly skilled, taxpaying workers leave the state, to be 
replaced by poorly educated immigrants, our economic base, education system, 
and quality of life will continue to decline. Because a large percentage of 
U.S. immigrants choose to settle in California, Uncle Sam effectively forces 
the area to accept them at a far greater rate than it can reasonably assimilate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Having gone from the "brain drain" of the 1960s to the "welfare drain" of the 
1990s, the United States needs immigration reform that represents the rights 
and interests of its own citizens. Gov. Pete Wilson, you have my vote! 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN A. ELDON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stein omits deliberately the generosity of the "unskilled, poorly educated" 
immigrants who not only are willing to perform the hardest and worst-paid jobs 
in our community but contribute to our society with family values, 
determination and strong religious beliefs, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The article mentioned "our needs as a nation"; I wonder what our real needs as 
a nation are. The essential needs are those that unskilled, poorly educated 
immigrants are able to help us to achieve by their hard-working example. It is 
that which will inspire us to continue living our life as human beings. It is 
obvious that without a foundation of understanding, tolerance and solidarity, 
sooner or later the "perfect society" that only accepts and welcomes educated 
people will turn into a very cold place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to thank those that, regardless of legal status, are doing hard 
work for us, receive a very low salary and still do not complain: nannies, 
agricultural workers, workers in factories, carwashes, restaurants. Stop and 
think what our life would be without them. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Mehlman and FAIR need to find a substantially bigger "ledger" as they 
calculate the costs versus the benefits of immigration in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In this discussion it is important to remember that the United States makes up 
6% of the world's population and consumes 40% of the world's resources. The 
119,231 refugees legally admitted to the United States in 1993 constituted 
significantly less than .5% of the estimated 16,255,000 refugees in the world 
last year (World Refugee Survey, U.S. Committee for Refugees). Adding the 
200,000 undocumented immigrants who are estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to 
enter the United States annually only marginally improves that sorry record. 
</P>
<P>
 The world is indeed fortunate today that enormously less well-endowed 
countries such as Tanzania and Zaire do not calculate their global 
responsibilities in the manner advocated by Mehlman and FAIR. Unfortunately, 
many other countries in Western Europe and the developed world do gauge their 
responsibilities by the example set by the United States.

 I was pleased to read the commentaries concerning immigration and population 
in the Aug. 10 issue. The issues of population growth and immigration are so 
tightly bound with one another that they cannot be separated in any honest 
debate. It is time we forget about race in these matters and consider the 
effects of runaway population growth on our quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 As a worldwide phenomenon, legal immigration seems to be vanishing. Most other 
developed countries have extremely tight immigration policies, excluding nearly 
everyone except refugees and those who do not need to work to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we commit ourselves to remaining the exception, we should consider the 
possible results down the road.

PENDING CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your otherwise outstanding editorial, "One Vote the State Desperately Needs" 
(Aug. 9), outlining the benefits in the pending anti-crime bill, unfortunately 
failed to report on one of the provisions that will be of the greatest 
advantage to California -- $1.8 billion to reimburse states for the cost of 
imprisoning criminal illegal aliens. This provision, based on an amendment I 
offered to the crime bill with Reps. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Gary 
Condit (D-Ceres), assures that at least $1.8 billion over the next six years 
from the Crime Control Trust Fund will be provided to states and local 
governments to help with the cost of imprisoning criminal illegals. It will 
save California taxpayers close to three-quarters of a billion dollars over the 
next six years.  
</P>
<P>
 This important crime bill, in addition to the strong punishment and prevention 
provisions to combat crime, represents a major step forward in the fight 
against illegal immigration. Along with the federal payment to states for 
imprisoning undocumented criminal aliens, the bill provides $1 billion for the 
Border Patrol to hire 1,000 new officers and improve its equipment, increases 
penalties for abuse of the asylum laws, and expands criminal alien detention 
centers.

 REP. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON

</P>
<P>
 Lost amid all the rhetoric and hand-wringing over the Clinton Administration's 
so-called crime bill is that it will undo a key provision of the Reagan 
Administration's efforts in the quest to reduce drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is currently written, this bill would allow for the immediate release of 
thousands of convicted drug dealers by repealing existing minimum mandatory 
sentence provisions. Those provisions serve as a powerful incentive against 
drug dealing, as well as a tool for prosecutors to gain convictions against the 
drug lords who have wreaked havoc in many of our neighborhoods. The legislation 
is a result of intense lobbying by criminal defense attorneys and soft-on-crime 
critics of mandatory sentencing.  
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL D. ANTONOVICH 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor, Los Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, I voted against a rule to allow consideration of the pending crime 
bill. Although there were provisions in the bill which I strongly supported -- 
monies for community policing and prevention programs, an assault weapons ban 
and drug treatment -- there were other parts of the bill I found objectionable. 
Most objectionable to me was the expansion of the death penalty to cover 60 new 
federal crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 I am opposed to the death penalty on moral grounds. There are, however, plenty 
of reasons to reject capital punishment as public policy. The death penalty is 
disproportionately imposed on the basis of race. Forty percent of prisoners on 
death rows across the U.S. are black. Eighty-four percent of the prisoners 
executed since 1977 were convicted of murdering white victims, despite the fact 
that blacks and whites are homicide victims in roughly equal numbers. 
Discretion by prosecutors in deciding when to seek the death penalty can mean 
unequal outcomes for the same crime in jurisdictions with longstanding 
histories of racial discrimination. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 
aimed at drug kingpins, 75% of those convicted have been white but 78% of death 
penalty prosecutions under the act have involved blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty is justifiable neither on moral grounds nor on grounds of 
efficacy in the fight against crime. It is, however, a convenient tool for some 
to pretend they are doing something about crime in the streets without really 
doing much at all. I look forward to voting "aye" on a bill that attacks the 
root causes of crime and assures us of safe streets without expanding the 
opportunity of the state to put more people to death.

A SATURDAY BIKE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, I rode a bike on a warm August Saturday morning to buy Basmati rice. 
The city occasionally slaps the rider in the face with its degradation of 
life.A young woman was asleep on a filth-stained sidewalk underneath a 405 
Freeway bridge alongside El Segundo Boulevard. The sight of her was shocking: 
sooted foot pads, teen-age in appearance, curled like a fetus, her side on hard 
concrete, and a sack under her head. Concrete beneath and above, a river of 
asphalt only inches away.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than a refreshing rest below a shading willow next to a cool stream, 
and the sweet song of a mockingbird, this woman had to cope with a harsh 
environment accentuated by unrelenting and irritating noises of passing cars. 
Every breath she took brought in lung-searing air that had been cycled through 
combustion engines. Meanwhile, thousands of people passed by only 50 feet above 
her, unaware of her pain. I continued to ride, and refocused on Basmati rice.

JAZZ REVIEW; WALLACE RONEY'S MANY GIFTS SHINE IN AN UNFOCUSED SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wallace Roney's opening set at Catalina Bar & Grill Wednesday night was a 
testimony to the value of sheer talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-praised trumpeter started late and started slow, and tenor 
saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, his partner in the front line, didn't make it on 
stage until halfway through the first number. The result was an unfocused 
program, off-center here and disconnected there, a familiar example of the 
hazards of an opening night in a new venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these problems, Roney's performance was one of the most fascinating of 
the summer jazz season. In solo after solo, he persistently placed great 
creative demands upon himself, spinning out brilliantly articulate lines that 
often skimmed the outer limits of the harmonies, sometimes abandoned them 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping out of the Miles Davis shadow that occasionally has obscured the high 
quality of his work, his only flaw was an intermittent tendency toward 
improvisational verbosity, toward filling every available space with as many 
notes as possible. But his better work made a convincing case for Roney as one 
of the most important jazz trumpeters of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 His band was first-rate. Coltrane is still in the process of finding his own 
voice, an understandably difficult task, given his father's legendary status. 
He wisely has incorporated other influences -- especially apparent in an 
impressive series of blues choruses -- into what is, at the moment, an eclectic 
but promising style. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Gerri Allen, always impressive, was no less so in her few solos. At 
one point, during the standard "If I Should Lose You," it was her superbly 
controlled, briskly swinging improvisation that finally began to bring the 
group into musical sync. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Clarence Seay and drummer Eric Allen provided solid support, with 
Allen adding substance and dynamics to an aggressive manner that, in a lesser 
player's hands, might easily have deteriorated into unrewarding bashing. 
</P>

CLUB REVIEW; SUNSET STRIP'S COCONUT TEASZER STILL HAS THAT CREEPY '80S VIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there weren't so many bands who need gigs in this town, the Coconut Teaszer 
might have closed its purple doors long ago. Possibly one of the most 
unpleasant rooms in L.A. for live music, the Teaszer seems to exist 
predominantly through bands who rely on the kindness of friends as they entice 
buddies to the Sunset Strip club with generous guest lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Strip's "pay-to-play" policy went out of vogue a while back, the 
Teaszer still has that creepy '80s vibe. This could be in part because bands 
who play at the West Hollywood room are often paid only if they draw a big 
enough crowd, according to a club spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Teaszer, which also contains an upstairs dance floor, is currently 
in the midst of a face lift -- adding antique pool tables and new booths, among 
other cosmetic shifts -- the changes really need to be focused on the main 
performance space. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling in the main showroom is so low that it acts as a compressor, 
funneling the sound directly into your eardrums. The tiny downstairs basement 
space, called the 8121 Club, is a sweaty room with an equally oppressive air. 
Perhaps the overhaul that's in the works will inspire some major revisions down 
the road, allowing the Teaszer to not only function as a showcase but also to 
show folks a consistently good time. 
</P>
<P>

CUBAN FOLKLORIC GROUP AT PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cuba's oldest folkloric group, Los Munequitos de Matanzas, will perform Friday 
and Saturday at 8 p.m. at Pasadena City College. Founded in 1952, Los 
Munequitos de Matanzas is a 14-member percussion group, song and dance ensemble 
specializing in traditional rituals and rumbas. 
</P>
<P>
 A post-concert dance party will be held at 10:30 p.m. Friday at Steven's Steak 
House in the City of Commerce, featuring Afro-Cuban music by Mazacote and MC1. 
All proceeds from both events will benefit the Institute of Cuban Folkloric 
Studies. 
</P>

 Boyz 'N the White House: Twenty months ago, two members of L.A. street gangs 
were invited to President Clinton's inauguration, a gesture that hasn't been 
forgotten by some Los Angeles police. On a wall inside the LAPD's Newton 
Station in South-Central, a list of the most active gangs in the area includes 
a fictitious entry at No. 6:

 "Clinton Gangster Crips."

 A bureaucrat who should stay after school: "As I have taken an early 
retirement," writes former high school teacher Andrew DiConti, "I did so with 
the thought of adding time to those 'Golden Years.' "

 You can imagine his disappointment, then, over the note he received from the 
El Monte Union High School District, which began with a warning of several 
personal disasters.

 Clearing Floogie's name: Lloyd Peyton of L.A. and several others take issue 
with the reader who theorized that the name in the 1940s song, "Flat-Foot 
Floogie with the Floy-Floy," was slang for prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have in front of me 'The American Thesaurus of Slang' and the entry for 
prostitute shows no floogie among the over 150 entries," he wrote. "She (the 
reader) may mistakenly have been referring to floosie and its several 
variations, floosy , floozey , flossy and fluzie ." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton adds: "That was my era and, in that innocent time, no one would have 
thought to use such a term in an upbeat nonsense song." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we'll take his word for it. But if Floogie wasn't a street-walker, how did 
her feet get flat?

COMMENTARY; IS CALIFORNIA IN A STATE OF DECLINE OR REBOUND?; THE TIMES HAS 
INVITED GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES KATHLEEN BROWN, THE DEMOCRAT, AND PETE WILSON, 
THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES OF THE 1994 CAMPAIGN IN A 
SERIES OF ARTICLES ON THIS PAGE. HERE ARE THE FIRST, WHICH EXAMINE THE ECONOMIC 
AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR CALIFORNIA.; OUR FAMILIES NEED A 
GOVERNOR WHO MANAGES THE STATE'S MONEY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. THAT MEANS 
CREATING GOOD JOBS, INVESTING IN EDUCATION, . . . MORE COPS ON THE STREETS . .

<P>
By KATHLEEN BROWN, Kathleen Brown is the state treasurer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1980, Ronald Reagan asked one of the most powerful questions in political 
history: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 In California today, you don't even have to ask. Our schools are crumbling, 
our streets are unsafe, more than 550,000 jobs have vanished, 61,000 businesses 
have failed, and a record number of people are leaving the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question is whether California's decline could have been prevented. 
The answer is yes. Leadership counts. California's slide could have been -- and 
should have been -- stopped with tougher, smarter fiscal management and 
innovative leadership that would give California's middle-class families their 
fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not what California's families have been getting since Pete Wilson 
was elected governor. Every year since 1991, Wilson has rolled over a chronic 
$3-billion deficit. In 1992, the state ran out of funds and Wilson issued IOU's 
for 64 days. This year, the governor's proposed state budget actually contained 
a $2.7-billion accounting mistake. Last month, California was forced to borrow 
$7 billion to make ends meet -- the largest such borrowing in American history. 
It's no surprise that Financial World magazine ranks California worst in the 
nation in state management. 
</P>
<P>
 If a family managed its checkbook the way California state government has 
managed its finances, that family would be bankrupt and its home foreclosed. So 
it came as no shock earlier this summer when Wall Street's three credit rating 
agencies dumped California from the highest credit rating level to nearly the 
lowest in the nation, costing taxpayers millions in higher interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
 California's fiscal situation is spinning out of control and our middle-class 
families are paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Wilson raised taxes by $7 billion, the largest state tax increase in 
American history. This cost middle-class families $1,000 on average. Yet 
despite paying more taxes, all they have gotten in return is overcrowded 
schools, college tuition increases and fewer police on our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County alone this year, $350 million in state dollars were 
taken from local government, forcing cuts in library hours, after-school 
programs and crime-fighting measures.  
</P>
<P>
 To restore California's fiscal soundness and to give a fair share to our 
families, we need to take the following steps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut government waste and slash bureaucracy. We need to cut the size of state 
government and run it more efficiently. In tough economic times, families have 
learned to do more with less. Now it is time for government to do its share. 
New taxes are out of the question, so we will need to cut state spending. That 
means fewer bureaucrats, streamlined government activities and substantial cuts 
in programs. 
</P>
<P>
 By conducting a comprehensive review of each and every activity of state 
government, we can save billions while improving performance. Texas saved $5.2 
billion in a similar performance review. In California, that money can go to 
revitalize our schools, help our colleges, put more police on our streets and 
provide loans to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restore California's fiscal soundness with a tough long-term budget 
strategy. Restoring our fiscal soundness will not happen until we bring our 
budget back into balance. And it will certainly never happen if we follow 
Wilson's "Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes" approach -- hoping and praying 
for billions from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 We must eliminate the $3-billion deficit that has piled up over the past three 
years. I have proposed a five-year strategy to pay off our debt and move 
California soundly into the black. My plan includes real budget cuts, 
reductions in welfare and closing tax loopholes for special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The key advantage to this longer-term approach is that it provides a one-time 
opportunity to get our fiscal house in order without severely threatening our 
economic recovery or police, fire and library services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move California's economy into high gear. California's recession has 
devastated the state's coffers. To restore fiscal soundness. California will 
need at least 1 million new jobs and renewed economic growth. New jobs and 
growth mean more revenues for state government. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson claims that California's economy is recovering, but our 1.4 
million unemployed workers know better. They understand there's a big 
difference between McDonald's burger-flipping jobs and McDonnell Douglas 
aerospace jobs -- but Wilson doesn't get it. While the rest of the nation has 
created 1.9 million new jobs since January, California has actually lost 500 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 California needs a governor who fights for middle-class jobs and helps move 
our economy into high gear. My economic recovery plan includes tax credits for 
job-creating businesses, new loans to small businesses and "California First" 
preferences for state firms in the awarding of state contracts. It also sets 
forward strategies to build advanced ground transportation, aircraft 
manufacturing and "green" industries of the future. My economic revival plan -- 
endorsed by business leaders and economists -- will create at least 1 million 
new quality jobs by 1998 and restore the California promise for our families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give California's middle - class families their fair share. Taxes have 
risen, services have plummeted and middle-class families have gotten less and 
less value for their tax dollars. Public schools have been shortchanged, 
college fees have skyrocketed and local governments -- saddled with unfair 
burdens -- have been forced to pull police off our streets and cut health-care 
services. Yet Pete Wilson doesn't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years of neglect, our families need a governor who manages the 
state's money for the middle class. That means creating good jobs, investing in 
education, putting more cops onthe streets, and cutting the size of state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, California's middle-class families are no better off than they were 
four years ago. They certainly cannot afford four more years of Wilson's fiscal 
mismanagement. It is time for state government to put California's families 
first. And it is time California's families got their fair share.

By PETE WILSON, Pete Wilson is the governor of California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California is blessed with the most creative, energetic, entrepreneurial 
people -- employers and workers -- to be found anywhere on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians have refused to be defeated by fire, floods, earthquakes, drought 
or even international recession and Washington's wrong-headed cuts in aerospace 
and defense spending, but something else threatens our jobs and quality of 
life: the high-cost of doing business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, we've made fundamental changes to improve our jobs climate. 
We cut workers' comp rates for small business by 19% just since 1993. We 
enacted job-creating tax incentives totaling a 10% reduction in the state tax 
rate for California companies. We cut years of red tape and over-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, we've seen positive results: Computer giant Intel announced 2,000 new 
jobs; toy company Lego chose California over Virginia as the location for a new 
resort, creating 700 new jobs, and San Bernardino's California Steel Industries 
announced plans to retain 1,000 jobs and add hundreds more. All cited our 
reforms as part of the reason for their decision to stay and expand in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But as much progress as we've made to fulfill California's potential, there's 
still much more to do. The question we face on Election Day is: Who's best able 
to continue making the kind of change we need? 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown offers glib slogans like "California First," "Golden State 
Growth Program" and "Grassroots Capitalism." But when it comes to making real 
change, Brown has revealed herself to be an ally of the special interests who 
favor the status quo -- trial lawyers, labor bosses and government employee 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at the record: 
</P>
<P>
 When we won workers' comp reform last year, small business cheered. But Brown 
defended and applauded the very lawyers who had profited from the system and 
fought reform. She told them she regretted the "turmoil and upheaval" these 
reforms would impose on their practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Brown also succumbed to big labor pressure and denounced NAFTA. 
Fortunately, the trade agreement passed and has already increased U.S. trade 
with Mexico 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 To seize the opportunities that California's future can offer, we need a 
governor who can stand up to the special interests and continue bringing 
fundamental change to our state. This is my agenda for change: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep cutting back red tape. I created Cal-EPA to streamline and insist on 
honest science as the basis for environmental regulation. Now we're fighting to 
reform the state and federal endangered species acts, which threaten to deny 
the water needed to sustain 40,000 family farms in the Central Valley and the 
growing cities and industrial users of Southern California. We don't need a 
database of regulations on the books, as my opponent suggests. We need to get 
unnecessary regulations off the books. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hold the line on spending. For the first time in modern California history, 
we've reduced the size of California's budget from one year to the next and 
kept spending more than $18 billion below projections. We need to keep a tight 
grip on our state's public purse. Otherwise, autopilot spending will create 
pressure for tax increases that sap dollars from job-creating private sector 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring taxes down. Our 1993 tax incentives are attracting new jobs today. But 
we should go even further. The corporate headquarters tax incentive now before 
the Legislature is a good start. As our economy grows, all Californians deserve 
to see their tax bills shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 My opponent proposes a new business tax moratorium that would provide 1/20th 
the tax relief of our incentives and a new-jobs tax credit that would let 
bureaucrats deny four out of every five businesses that apply. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand foreign trade. Two million California jobs depend on foreign trade. 
That's why NAFTA was so important. Now, I'm working for passage of GATT, the 
international trade and tariff agreement, which would open markets for 
California products in more than 110 nations. Bank of America economist John 
Wilson estimates its failure would cost California 173,000 jobs in 1995 alone. 
But Brown's misguided "California First" proposal violates GATT, inviting 
foreign retaliation against California companies that would cost thousands of 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get lawyers out of fender-benders. Too many lawyers are filing too many 
lawsuits, clogging our courts, driving up insurance costs and increasing the 
cost of products in California. We need reforms, like no-fault auto insurance, 
that will take lawyers out of routine fender-benders and other transactions 
where they wrongly drive up costs and drive out jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Target defense conversion. My first few months in office, I convened a 
summit of aerospace leaders to develop a strategy for defense conversion. Now, 
we have the most aggressive and successful conversion plan in the country, and 
our 1993 tax incentives are tailor-made to promote defense industry spinoffs 
and high-tech ventures. We're also fighting additional base closings and 
redeveloping closed bases into new civilian job-generators.  
</P>
<P>
 * Bring down health-care costs. We need to improve health care but not at the 
expense of jobs. My approach, the Health Insurance Plan of California, has made 
health coverage affordable for small business without employer mandates or one 
cent from the taxpayers. My opponent supports President Clinton's employer 
mandates, even though a UCLA Business Forecasting Project study estimated that 
they would cost California business $4.5 billion and our state 80,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 If we make change, California has all that it takes to be the world's 
entrepreneurial hot spot for the rest of the decade and beyond. As the 
Economist magazine recently observed, "California seems better equipped to cope 
with the future than anywhere else in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 California is on the road to recovery -- no matter what the naysayers might 
hope or claim. So let's not retreat to the status quo favored by the special 
interests. Let's keep moving forward and making fundamental change to restore 
the confidence, optimism and competitiveness of California. California's 
workers and employers deserve nothing less.

KID STUFF: JUST THEIR SIZE; FINALLY, AN AMUSEMENT PARK THAT SCALES ITS FUN IN 
PROPORTION TO ITS ADVENTURERS 
</P>

 Theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a parent, the words alone can make you feel lightheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're richer than Michael Eisner and more centered than Mother Teresa, 
being a veteran of big theme park outings with the family means you've probably 
groused about lightened pocketbooks and sore feet. Allan Ansdell Jr. says he 
has, and he and his family are betting $4 million that locals would welcome a 
manageable alternative to the "we're-spending-bundle-on-this-so-you- 
dang-well-better-enjoy-it" marathons parents know so well. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Ansdell will open Adventure City in Stanton, a pocket-size 
entertainment center billed as "The Little Theme Park Just for Kids." Geared to 
children ages 2 to 12, the two-acre park will offer 11 rides and attractions, a 
snack shop, a game and party area and live entertainment, as well as programs 
and displays designed to educate children about topics ranging from 
transportation to crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Adventure City is next door to Hobby City, six acres of hobby-oriented shops 
that was started in 1955 by Ansdell's maternal grandparents, Jay and Brea 
DeArmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobby City remains a family business. Ansdell's grandfather died in 1982, but 
his grandmother still operates the center's doll museum. He and his wife, 
Michelle, along with his parents, siblings and various in-laws, also own and 
operate shops in the complex, which include everything from an antique gun 
dealer to a Cabbage Patch Kids shop where employees dress as nurses and give 
free checkups to visiting children's dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception in 1990, Adventure City has been a family project as well. 
Allan Jr. is the park's president; his mom, Yvonne, and Michelle are heavily 
involved on the creative side, and his dad, Allan Sr., handles most of the 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 His 82-year-old grandmother ("She's the head honcho," says Allan Jr., 
laughing) is consulted at their daily family meetings, along with an assortment 
of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In June, general manager 
Kevin Lutz, a former operations manager for a Cleveland-area theme park, was 
brought in to steer Adventure City's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As opening day nears, the family, Lutz and their small administrative staff 
typically begin work before sunrise and end well past nightfall. Locals and 
Hobby City regulars stop by daily to check on the park's progress and snap 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they will operate independently, Hobby City and Adventure City share 
a common goal, said Yvonne Ansdell. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobby City "was never intended to be a mega-sophisticated center," she 
explained as she gave a visitor a tour of the two complexes on a recent 
sweltering afternoon. "We just wanted a homey kind of place where people can 
come and find a hobby, and hopefully spend some time together as a family." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she added, that family-friendly environment was what started the 
Ansdells thinking about the theme park project in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a miniature train that ran around the grounds here, and the 
kids would ride that little train over and over again," she recalled. "Almost 
every time Allan (Jr.) would drive it, people would tell him, 'You know, this 
is so fun, you ought to get some more rides in here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now look at us," she said, standing at Adventure City's main entrance and 
gesturing to the crews of workmen scattered across the park. "I guess they were 
on to something." 
</P>
<P>
 Adventure City will probably never replace Knott's Berry Farm, Disneyland or 
Magic Mountain as a vacation destination, said Allan Jr., but it will fill a 
need for local residents that he believes hasn't been adequately addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not competing with (the big theme parks)," he said. "But with their 
multimillion-dollar rides and shows, their admission prices are pretty high, so 
most people generally don't go to them more than once or twice a year. That 
expense is a problem especially when you have little kids, because they conk 
out quicker. If you're paying a big price, you feel like you have to put in a 
whole day, and everybody ends up dragging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, it's more affordable (admission, including unlimited rides, will be 
$9.95; free for under age 2), so you don't have to take out a loan every time 
your kids want to go to a theme park. And it will be smaller and less crowded, 
so you can do the whole thing in a few hours at a more relaxed pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though most of the area's major theme parks have places designed for 
young children, Allan Jr. maintains that Adventure City will offer something 
they don't -- namely, an environment that can be enjoyed simultaneously by 
children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to take my nephews to the kiddie sections at those parks, and I found 
that I wasn't allowed to go on the rides with them, and they were too young to 
go on the big roller coaster kinds of rides with me," he recalled. "I started 
thinking, 'Wouldn't it be nice if there were a place where you wouldn't have to 
pay the high price and you could both have fun?' " 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, almost all of the rides that the Ansdells have selected were 
built to accommodate children and adults. They include the Adventure City Bus, 
which rotates at the end of a larger weighted arm, similar to the Camp Bus ride 
at Knott's Camp Snoopy; a 1946 Allan Herschell carousel with 20 full-size 
horses that Allan Jr. and Yvonne found in a Philadelphia park; the six-car 
Giggles Wheel of Fun Ferris wheel; a Balloon Race ride that simulates hot-air 
ballooning and the Barnstormers miniature plane ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is about the same size as some of the small "family fun centers" 
scattered around the county, the theme of the new park will be more in line 
with Disneyland's Toon Town. The site was built to resemble a small city, with 
the rides and attractions designed to work together to create the look and 
atmosphere of a small town in a children's book. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors enter the park through a town square with brightly colored facades 
painted to resemble storefronts. Nearby is the "grocery warehouse," through 
which visitors cruise on scaled-down police cars and fire trucks on the 9-1-1 
ride. Across the way, the Adventure City Airport, complete with tower, serves 
as a waiting area for the plane and balloon rides. There's also a city train 
station where visitors board the miniature train relocated from Hobby City and 
the Crank & Roll kid-powered trains. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just to keep you grounded in reality, Adventure City also has its own 
traffic jam. The Kids' Coaster offers "bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic" on a 
track that winds over and around a faux rock tunnel, waterfall and a spreading 
75-year-old pepper tree. (This ride is scheduled to be installed this week and 
may not be operational by opening weekend.) 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the waiting areas, hands-on exhibits and signage have been 
integrated to teach children such topics as personal safety, aviation and, of 
course, hobbies. Modified firemen's turnouts (the coats, hats and boots used in 
firefighting) and a mock fire pole wait in the miniature fire and police 
department next to the 9-1-1 ride. 
</P>
<P>
 A changing display of toy train collections will be housed in the depot, and 
an aviation expert from John Wayne Airport helped put together a display on 
aircraft history and facts for the Adventure City airport. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, representatives from local police and fire departments will give 
demonstrations in an outdoor special events area, and a theater will host daily 
puppet shows. Plans are in the works to bring in children's performers from the 
area as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the park's hiring policy reflects the efforts to create the feeling of a 
real community, said Yvonne Ansdell. By opening, the park will employ some 115 
people of various ethnic groups, who will range in age from 18 to 80. Most of 
them will be in the 30- to 50-plus range. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bastrup of R&R Creative Amusement Designs Inc., the Anaheim firm that is 
the primary architectural consultant on the project, said the park's "total 
community" flavor will be its saving grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've seen this done anywhere else in the country," said 
Bastrup. "The idea of building a city that involves parents and kids together, 
and that is partially a teaching environment, is really what's going to set 
them apart from the competition. And the competition in this business is 
stiff." 
</P>
<P>
 To gather ideas for their project, Allan Jr. and Yvonne set out in the summer 
of 1990 on a national tour of amusement parks of all sizes, a journey that 
would continue on and off for nearly three years. Encouraged by the results of 
a feasibility study, family members continued their research until last fall, 
when they brought their ideas to Bastrup and his partner Richard Ferrin, whose 
company has worked on projects for Magic Mountain, Six Flags Over Texas, Wild 
Rivers and Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they had done all their homework and knew what they wanted," 
Bastrup said. "They had their ideas in place, they handled the purchase of the 
rides, and we helped them bring it together and brought in all the whip cream 
topping (like) the music, the sound effects and the building designs." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, it takes a lot more than good ideas and intentions to build even a 
small park; it also takes lots and lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne and Allan Ansdell Sr. sold their waterfront home in Seal Beach and put 
in nearly $1 million of their own money. ("Make sure you tell people we're 
tapped out," Allan Sr. said with a rueful grin. "There's no more where that 
came from.") 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the funding, Allan Sr. went first to the area's major banks. 
Although many of them showed initial interest, they turned down their requests 
because of the family's lack of experience as theme park operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked at the risk factor and said, 'How do you know how to run a theme 
park?' " he recalled. "To me, business is business. It doesn't really matter if 
it's a theme park or selling pianos, if you hire the right people, give 
customers what they want and make it affordable, it's going to work. But (the 
major banks) had a hard time with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it was the small community banks and ITT's Commercial/Financial 
division that came through for them, said Allan Sr. And in January, they 
approached the Stanton Redevelopment Agency and received a 10-year, fixed-rate 
loan of $500,000. In addition to paying off the loan, Adventure City's 
management had to guarantee the park would generate $50,000 per year in sales 
tax revenue for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stanton City Manager Greg Hulsizer, the City Council saw the 
Adventure City project as "clean, family-oriented commerce . . . that is in 
sync with the council's goal for the community." Stanton is one of the county's 
smallest cities, with a population of 32,000 and a median household income of 
$33,000 according to 1990 census figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't expect his city to become another Anaheim or Buena Park, 
given the new park's proximity to attractions such as Disneyland, Knott's and 
the beach, Hulsizer says the project will position Stanton more prominently on 
the county's entertainment map. And that's just fine with the folks at the 
county's two largest amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Knott's and Disneyland said they weren't concerned about the 
much smaller Adventure City pulling any prospective visitors from their gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most travelers consider going to Disneyland first, but any park that 
brings more visitors down to this area is going to benefit all of us," said 
Disneyland's John McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ochsner of Knott's agrees. "I think the only impact that could come from 
this is positive," he said. "The proximity (Adventure City is about three miles 
south of Knott's, five miles west of Disney) will probably increase the 
desirability of this part of the county to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, it's definite proof that the days of the family-owned theme park are 
not over."

OFFSPRING MAKE US PROUD; SMASH HIT OF HOME-GROWN BAND SPEAKS WELL FOR THE LOCAL 
SCENE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Offspring return to their Orange County home turf this weekend, having 
acquired most of the trappings of rock stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are MTV omnipresence (via the band's breakthrough video, "Come Out 
and Play") and, just four months after its release, the platinum certification 
(over 1 million copies sold) of the Offspring's new album, "Smash." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling last week from a gig site in Minneapolis (the First Avenue club of 
"Purple Rain" fame), the band's co-founder, bassist Greg Kriesel, reported that 
singer Bryan Holland has had to resort to semi-disguise -- concealing his 
distinctive, long blond braids beneath a baseball cap -- to get some respite 
from autograph seekers. Kriesel also confirmed that the Offspring -- two of 
them, anyway -- have joined the Keith Moon club, having worked off the 
pressures of the rock 'n' roll road with room-trashing behavior that got the 
band evicted from hotels in Virginia and Illinois. If that isn't rock stardom, 
what is? 
</P>
<P>
 While the Offspring were out on their six-week summer tour of 500- to 
1,500-capacity venues, "Smash" rocketed toward the Top 10 on the Billboard 
albums chart (earlier this week it was at No. 11 with a bullet). Virtual 
unknowns until KROQ began pumping "Come Out and Play" in April, the Offspring 
have come so far that, in Orange County pop annals, their success on the albums 
chart is now surpassed only by the Righteous Brothers, who rang up a remarkable 
string of three Top 10 albums in 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
 In the realm of independent-alternative rock, the Offspring's sales are 
unprecedented. While independent rap labels have scored numerous chart hits, 
the Offspring are the first band on an independent-alternative rock label 
(Epitaph Records) to have gone platinum without at least a distributional push 
from one of the major record conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring's sold-out show at UC Irvine's Crawford Hall on Saturday is 
their first headlining gig in Orange County since fame struck (in June, they 
played a short but rapturously-received set at Irvine Meadows on the KROQ 
"Weenie Roast" bill). The homecoming show is not the end of the road for the 
band, just a pit stop during a nine-day, between-tours break. Kriesel said the 
Offspring would use the time to rest, shoot their second video, "Self Esteem" 
(a sardonic tale about a guy who lets himself be trampled upon in love), and 
gird themselves for a monthlong European tour. Another six-week U.S. tour is 
set for the fall, this time in theaters holding 2,000 to 3,000 fans. Kriesel 
said the Offspring also may tour in Australia and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a band that, as recently as December, could draw no more than 150 
fans to a club gig in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring took root in 1984 when Holland and Kriesel, two buddies from the 
cross-country team at Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, decided to start a 
punk band. Their main inspirations and influences were such early-'80s Orange 
County punk heroes as Agent Orange, the Adolescents and T.S.O.L. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike such punk-rooted local contemporaries as the Cadillac Tramps and Big 
Drill Car, the Offspring never attracted a large following in the sparse Orange 
County club scene. But they had the good sense to hit the road in search of an 
audience. In 1989, they set off on their first cross-country tour in Holland's 
pickup, sleeping in schoolyards and public parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 1990 debut album, "The Offspring," was on the tiny Long Beach label 
Nemesis Records. It led to a deal with the highly regarded Epitaph for 1992's 
"Ignition," which, by early this year, had raised the Offspring to 
legitimate-contender status in what appeared to be a solid but limited punk 
rock market where sales of 150,000 would be considered a major hit. "Ignition" 
also gave strong, if sporadic, indications of the winning, melodic-punk 
songwriting that informs every song on "Smash." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new album having shocked everybody by living up to its name on the 
charts, the Offspring now play to a fan base far beyond the hard-core 
underground of punk partisans who came out for previous tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night we had these two 30-year-old motorcycle guys," Kriesel reported. 
"One brought his 9-year-old son. Actually, they were kind of annoying. They got 
on the bus and wouldn't go away. They kept singing the one line (the 'you gotta 
keep 'em separated' hook from 'Come Out and Play') and hugging Ron. The father 
and the friend wouldn't leave us alone." A band lunch break at a fast food 
restaurant in Virginia was interrupted when a girl recognized Holland and asked 
if she could bring in her entourage -- a busload of people on a church outing 
-- to meet the band. The Offspring managed to duck that request. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriesel said that he and Holland were asleep in other rooms when the two hotel 
trashings took place. In Virginia, he said, Ron Welty, Kevin Wasserman and some 
of the road crew hurled a chair and a bed's headboard over a railing and into a 
parking lot, which led to the whole entourage being ousted before dawn and 
forced to sleep on their bus. Similar revels by the same duo, joined by members 
of opening act Guttermouth, led to another eviction in Chicago. Kriesel said 
that he and Holland were not amused at being rousted from their beds by police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next morning (after the Chicago incident), there was a note with a 
cartoon showing the desk people crying and us with beers in our hands," Kriesel 
said. "It said, 'From the crusty old Meat Puppets.' We think they were staying 
in the same hotel, and they heard about it. Bryan and I had a little talk (with 
the errant band mates) the other day: 'You don't need to be doing this, because 
it's affecting a lot of other people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By consistently citing their geographic and musical roots in Orange County, 
the Offspring are doing what they can to have a positive effect on a local 
music scene long overshadowed by Los Angeles and dismissed because of a 
prevailing stereotype of Orange County as a strait-laced, suburban Stepford 
incapable of spawning authentic rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring took Guttermouth, a band of their O.C. punk rock buddies, as 
opening act on their U.S. tour, and also fit Big Drill Car onto the bill for 
nine of the dates. Kriesel said that he and Holland used a chunk of their first 
royalty check from "Smash" to fund their own label, Nitro Records, which is 
about to release Guttermouth's debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 There is speculation that the Offspring's success could have a ripple effect 
on the rest of the Orange County rock scene (where promising bands are as 
plentiful as stable, high-quality grass-roots venues are scarce), and in the 
wider world of melodic-punk. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's going to start a new scene," Kriesel said. "But it still comes 
down to whether a band comes up with a good record. It could help a band get a 
foot in the door. It seems like things are turning around for the better." 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: The Offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Aug. 20, at 7 p.m. With the Red Aunts and Farside.

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THE PLIMSOULS "EVERYWHERE AT ONCE" (1983) / GEFFEN  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By all rights, this sterling effort should have catapulted the Plimsouls into 
national prominence. Instead, it proved to be their swan song. 
</P>
<P>
 Power pop doesn't get much better than this. Their second full-length album 
showed the Plimsouls (based in Los Angeles) to have a remarkable facility for 
merging high octane rock 'n' roll with the type of choice melodies they should 
have been able to hum all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc opening "Shaky City" is an immediate grabber, with razor-sharp guitar 
lines and crackling drum accents that are the ideal complements to Peter Case's 
way cool singing. "Magic Touch" is another seemingly radio-ready rocker with 
plenty of old-fashioned heart and grit. Without question, though, the album's 
centerpiece is "A Million Miles Away," a re-recording of a single the band had 
released independently. It's a stunning pop dynamo. 
</P>
<P>
 It is evident that the Plimsouls were feeling their oats throughout 
"Everywhere at Once." Whether delivering a stormy rave-up or playing at subtler 
mid-tempo, they displayed all the infectious exuberance of a bunch of kids 
trying out their new toys on Christmas. Case shone especially bright as he 
slung out the terse lyrics with plenty of raw nerve and youthful verve. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like the Dream Syndicate and the Blasters and a number of other 
outstanding L.A. bands of the early '80s, the Plimsouls never received their 
commercial due. After "Everywhere at Once" the band split, and Case embarked on 
a career of his own as a folk troubadour. JON MATSUMOTO

MUSIC TO BOOT; TOE-TAPPING IS JUST PART OF THE FUN AT TWO OUTDOOR FESTIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Big stars, home-grown talent and a bovine with an attitude are among the 
entertainers lined up for two outdoor country music festivals coming to South 
County this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlene Carter and Juice Newton will headline Saturday's eighth-annual 
CotoFest, with live music and dancing from 2 p.m. to midnight at Coto de Caza 
Equestrian Center in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Chris Gaffney, a regular at Yorba Linda's Canyon Inn, will join 
nationally known singers Doug Stone and Lari White and some two dozen other 
musical acts for the California CountryFest & Rodeo, Friday through Sunday at 
San Juan Capistrano's Buchheim Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter event will also include open-air dancing and a nightly rodeo 
featuring Utah's Ricky the Bull, who has bucked all but four cowboys in his 
last 1,000 rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the toughest bulls in the world," says CountryFest promoter Eric 
Jensen, "like no bull the rodeos in Orange County ever get." 
</P>
<P>
 The local Bounty Hunter Band will kick off and conclude CotoFest with music 
for two-stepping and other honky-tonk dances throughout the day. Carter and 
Newton are part of an all-female concert, dubbed "Women of the Wild West," 
which begins at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of roughly 5,000 is expected, and all proceeds from CotoFest, 
organized by the Rotary Club of Coto de Caza-Trabuco Canyon, will benefit such 
charities as Women's Shelters of Orange County. For eats, the Rotary's sister 
club in Mexico, Ciudad de Obregon Rotary Club, will prepare and sell "killer 
tacos." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten area restaurants, including Costa Mesa's popular Taco Mesa, will sell 
munchies at the second annual CountryFest, and 50 vendors will hawk 
Southwestern-style merchandise. Contests in the nightly rodeo, which drew 
15,000 spectators last year, include calf roping, barrel racing and bull 
riding, with Ricky and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Free dance lessons and dance contests will be held at both festivals.

WANNA DANCE?: BUENA PARK'S BACK-TO-BASICS KOKO'S KEEPS THE LOCALS IN '50S TIME 
WARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hang need not be trendy, flashy or much of anything to claim a place in the 
hearts and daily lives of a community. Take, for example, Koko's in Buena Park. 
Call it a dive, but it's a favorite hideaway among the locals. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a "3-D" establishment, where drinking, dancing and diversion don't 
have to aspire to anything but no-frills fun. They even celebrate customers' 
birthdays on the last Sunday of the month with a potluck. 
</P>
<P>
 Koko's has changed little since it opened in the late '50s. (No one is sure of 
the year, though they put it around 1958.) You'll still find wood paneling, 
ruby-colored velvet drapes, black vinyl booths, strands of white Christmas 
lights (shining year 'round), red spotlights and stiff drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 More modern additions include a 52-inch television, hidden much of the time 
behind the red drapes at the stage. The set satisfies the sports fans who would 
probably otherwise visit one of the dozens of sports bars cropping up nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the narrow stage Thursday through Saturday is the five-piece Bob Chance 
Band, cranking out R&B, country and lounge-style tunes from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. 
All members of the quintet contribute vocals, with any one of them taking the 
lead on selections such as "Lay Down Sally" and "Someone to Watch Over Me." 
There's nothing glamorous about these musicians; just close your eyes and get 
into the groove. 
</P>
<P>
 The same applies on Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. with the Old Time Rock 'n' Roll 
Band, which performs, as the name implies, golden oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance floor sees plenty of action on any of these nights, with couples 
two-stepping, swing dancing and making it up as they go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so busy is the game room in the back. A pool table and dart board see 
little action some nights. Maybe it's the abrasive decor of lighted and 
colorful beer ads, trophies and other items that clutters the tiny room. It's 
quite a contrast to the soothing darkness of the bar area. 
</P>
<P>
 Around that long rectangular bar, patrons camp out and catch a glimpse of 
themselves in the gold marbleized mirror tiles covering the opposite wall. 
Drafts and imports are not poured here -- just domestic beers by the bottle for 
$2. Glasses of wine and wells are $2.25, and sodas are $2. Drink prices rise 
after 9 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, when beer goes up 50 cents and 
other drinks go up a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * KOKO'S 
</P>

DO IT!: THE CYCLERY LEADS IN TRAILS -- AND ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of the Times Orange County 
Edition staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Sparkman moved his bike shop, a nine-year institution in Long Beach, 
to Garden Grove only a few months ago, but already he's making his presence 
felt in local cycling circles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Orange County Trails Coalition, Richard's Cyclery is the 
first local bike shop to adopt a local trail, this one in Whiting Ranch 
Regional Park (near Lake Forest). The county-sponsored Adopt-a-Trail program 
encourages organizations and businesses to take charge of the maintenance of a 
specific park trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude is, no trails, no sales," said Sparkman. "We're avid riders, and 
we want to keep the parks open." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has regular Sunday work parties, in which it organizes volunteers for 
trail clearing, rebuilding and a bit of riding (the next work party is in 
September). 
</P>
<P>
 The shop also organizes a number of free, weekly rides for both road riders 
and mountain bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday evenings offer a couple of different options. At 5:30 p.m., a 
women's trainer leads a road ride for women. She offers training tips and other 
guidance besides leading the one- to two-hour ride through the streets of 
Orange County. Routes vary, so it's best to call ahead for meeting place and 
other particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:45 p.m., a mountain-bike ride is usually held in Whiting Ranch Regional 
Park. This time of year, about half of the two- to three-hour ride is in 
darkness, but in winter the whole ride is after sunset. The shop has a limited 
number of loaner headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our night rides have been really fun," Sparkman said, adding that the Aug. 10 
ride at Whiting Ranch included a hunt for a missing person after the scheduled 
ride. The shop owner left around midnight, however, when the search-and-rescue 
copter took over and he never learned the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just do the same ride we would in the daylight," Sparkman said, adding 
that group leaders know the trails intimately, so there is no danger of getting 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Because everyone rides more slowly, recreational riders can keep up with 
more-skilled riders. If anything, Sparkman said, the night rides boast "more 
camaraderie, because we're all riding tight." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening rides sometimes move to Crystal Cove State Park and other 
locations.  
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of bounce around, but we meet at Whiting 90% of the time," Sparkman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, it's best to call ahead for meeting location and time. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational road and mountain bike rides are also held on weekends. Call for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Group bicycle rides. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Wednesdays: 5:30 p.m. for women's road rides and 6:45 p.m. for 
mountain-bike rides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Meeting places vary. Richard's Cyclery is at 11943 Valley View, 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Call for meeting location and directions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 379-2717.

SURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil.Parties Really Roll During Op Pro, U.S. Open 
Contests 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whew! 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks of back-to-back major surfing contests, Orange County is 
nearly normal again, and Rockin' Fig and I are glad. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, things are almost normal except for this major heat wave, Fig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides plenty of surfing, the Op Professional Surfing Championships and the 
U.S. Open of Surfing had some hot social evenings. Fig, who locked up an 
announcing job after filling the shoes of a co-anchor who failed to show, also 
got wrapped up in the social whirl. 
</P>
<P>
 So Fig, did you go to the Surfrider Foundation's benefit that first week at 
the Hard Rock Cafe in Newport Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup. It was like a $100-per-person dinner, but all I saw were hors d'oeuvres. 
Everybody was all suits and ties and it was kinda funny going from the beach 
contest to this thing. But I checked out Chris Isaak for a few songs.  
</P>
<P>
 How was he? 
</P>
<P>
 He was kinda rockabilly. P. T. (Peter Townend), who announces surfing events 
on Prime Ticket, was there, too, auctioning stuff. I was trying to get a 
signature model surfboard and a few other things, especially a trip to Fiji -- 
but I had to give up after the bill got up to $500.  
</P>
<P>
 I can't believe you backed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, it just got too expensive. I jammed over to the other party at Old World 
in Huntington Beach. They had the beach bands -- Penny Wise, Sprung Monkey. Tom 
Curren's band played and fellow pro surfer Donovan Frankenreiter's band, Sun 
Child, was also playing there.  
</P>
<P>
 So how did that go?  
</P>
<P>
 It was totally the opposite. A much younger crowd and people slammin' in the 
pit on stage. All the pro surfers were hangin' in the bar at this party.  
</P>
<P>
 Did you hang with the pros? 
</P>
<P>
 Naw. I had to pack it in because of an early curfew. The next morning I was at 
the contest at 5:30, and it was quite painful for the first couple of hours. I 
also went to the Waterfront Hilton for the U.S. Open party after that contest 
ended.  
</P>
<P>
 Did the winner, Shane Beschen of San Clemente, show? 
</P>
<P>
 Naw. He's Mr. Shy, but Kelly Slater was there and guess who he was hanging out 
with?  
</P>
<P>
 Dunno. I heard he broke up with his friend from Florida. Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Anderson, that actress from "Baywatch"! They were on the same TV show 
together.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, what was the best part of the U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
 I just wanna say it was like one of the hottest finals ever between Beschen 
and Slater. Beschen was leading the heat. Slater needed a high score and with 
two minutes to go, he got this right. Well, somehow he found a barrel right 
there and pulled himself in it. Then, somehow came out of it, through a big 
air, and then hit a front - side re - entry.  
</P>
<P>
 The judges gave him two 10s, two 9.5s and a 9, but that wave, it had 60,000 
people standing!  
</P>
<P>
 Did you get over working with Nuno Jonet, the World Tour's main announcer? I 
know that a big part of your announcing style is pumping up the crowd, getting 
them amped on the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was great. I was stoked to work with him. I learned a few things off him. 
Yet I think he learned a few things off me, too. But I think that I can hang in 
with the big boys. The only thing is, after that party at the Hilton, the Fig 
blew his voice out and couldn't talk for a week.  
</P>

 Joker: During the installation of the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame, filmmaker 
Bruce Brown introduced Georgia Zachariah, the young girlfriend of his friend 
Robert August, as August's daughter. Both Brown and August, who go way back, 
were installed in the sidewalk on Main Street near PCH. Luckily, they're 
friends. For the record, Zachariah is 23. August 49. 
</P>
<P>
 South County: It seems that Bill (Bulldog) Barnes, ace waterman and Blue Water 
Task Force director for the Doheny Longboard Assn., is riding a much heavier 
board these days. Barnes recently spent a day riding jet skis, the mechanical 
nemesis of Doho members. What's next, Bill? Becoming a consultant for an 
upstream polluter? 
</P>
<P>
 Pier Paddle: Saturday, National Clean Water Day, surfers and other friends of 
the ocean will paddle around Aliso Pier to bring attention to chronic sewage 
problems at Aliso Creek. The paddle out is at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Luau: Mike Emery, Doheny Longboard Assn. board member, reported that more than 
500 people attended last weekend's luau. In addition to carving a huge pig 
cooked Hawaiian-style, they ate 400 chicken breasts and 100 pounds of mako 
shark. The Eliminators played tunes on the beach. Emery said the event raised 
about $2,000: $1,000 for the Doheny Interpretive Society, which coordinates 
Doheny's aquarium, and another $1,000 for the Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Save a Wave: During August, the Southern California Shore Shops, Hennessey's 
Taverns and Coors Pure Water 2000 will team up with the Surfrider Foundation 
for a campaign to help save California's coastline. The public can buy $1 
"waves" at the Shore Shops or Hennessey's Taverns, with the money going to 
Surfrider. The wave tickets will be entered in a drawing for an airplane ticket 
for two to Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Save a Pizza: As the U.S. Open of Surfing was winding down, director Ian 
Cairns didn't waste time celebrating a successful contest. He ordered a 
mid-size pizza piled high with the works. Did he share? Nawwww. He offered but 
quickly scarfed half while Beschen and Slater were battling during the finals. 
After witnesses gathered, Cairns closed the box and marched off . . . with his 
pizza.

VIDEO REWIND: '1000 CLOWNS': IN PRAISE OF NUTTY UNCLE WITH HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We haven't had a true movie iconoclast for some time -- one of those guys who 
delight in telling the world to go to hell out of one side of his mouth while 
giving it a big smooch with the other. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's about time to pay another visit to Murray Burns, brought to giddy life 
by Jason Robards in 1965's "A Thousand Clowns": a human tonic for Angst of all 
sorts, the scourge of pomposity and convention, friend of the shirker, the 
hooky-player, the goofball. 
</P>
<P>
 The squarest of square pegs, Murray has thoroughly indoctrinated his nephew, 
whom he is raising, with his anti-work, pro-nuttiness ethic but finds he may 
lose the beloved Nick to the child-welfare authorities if he doesn't agree to 
knuckle down and get a real job. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has done time in the trenches as a TV gag writer and looks on his 
current state of unemployment as a kind of deliverance from purgatory. A Mr. 
Micawber ("something will turn up") with the sensibility of a holy fool, Murray 
sits in his alcove and plays the ukulele while below in the street the world 
scuttles by. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that reality is closing in. Murray believes with all his heart that 
there isn't a problem so big or so complicated that it can't be run away from. 
</P>
<P>
 Robards plays Murray as a confetti-spewing juggernaut who flings paper 
streamers at cruise ship departures just for the heck of it and whose 
philosophy is neatly summarized in the way he answers the phone: "Hello, is 
this someone with good news or money? No? Goodby!" He's the fool with the heart 
of a lion, but even he can't maintain his grin in the face of Bureaucracy, 
played with priggish relish by William Daniels, and a sympathetic but insistent 
brother (an Oscar-winning role for Martin Balsam). Fortunately, along with 
Daniels comes Barbara Harris, ripe for conversion to careless glee at Murray's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, orbiting around the action like a pint-sized Jerry Seinfeld is 
Barry Gordon as Nick, wise beyond his years but panicked at the thought of 
leaving Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 If at the end of this picture you aren't inspired to take your sweetie down to 
the dock and yell goodbys to all the people you don't know on the Love Boat, 
you just haven't been paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Thousand Clowns" (1965), directed by Fred Coe. 118 minutes. Not rated.

IN THE DOGHOUSE FOR CANINE REFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Patrick Mott's Kids on Film review of "The Mask" (OC Live!, Aug. 11), he 
states: "Diminutive Milo, Stanley's pet (who ought to have 'The Wonder Dog' 
appended to his name), finds the mask, shoves his lovable beagle/mutt face into 
it and turns into the Ah-nold of the canine set." 
</P>
<P>
 While Mott was properly appreciative of Milo's talents, his reference to the 
dog's "beagle/mutt face" is entirely off base.In real life Milo is Max, a 
purebred Jack Russell terrier, a breed known all over the world as particularly 
lively, intelligent and appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the thousands who belong to the Jack Russell Terrier Club of 
America, I am offended by Mott's obviously ignorant remark. The Jack Russell 
terrier is a sturdy little working terrier of a type created and developed in 
the early 19th Century by the Rev. John Russell, widely known as Parson Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 This has truly been the year of the Jack Russell. Max's counterpart, Eddie (in 
reality, Moose), stars on the TV series "Frasier." JRs also appear in countless 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 My own Jack Russell terrier is Cheeky, and Mr. Mott can expect to hear from 
her agent if he makes any further inappropriate references to "beagle/mutt 
faces."

SPECIAL SCREENING: SURREAL 'JULIET' OF THE SYMBOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There were a few wags who thought Federico Fellini's "Juliet of the Spirits" 
should have been named something like "8 1/2: Her Story" when it came out in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
 This grandly garish, joltingly hyperbolic movie entered the scene just two 
years after Fellini's acknowledged masterpiece "8 1/2," and it, too, gazed long 
and uproariously at the hopes, doubts and fantasies of a complex protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 But where the autobiographical "8 1/2" fixated on a male filmmaker (Fellini's 
stand-in), "Juliet of the Spirits" was from a woman's perspective, that of a 
mousy housewife all dressed down and nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the earlier movie, "Juliet of the Spirits" (which screens Monday night 
as part of the Muckenthaler Cultural Center's outdoor "Celestial Cinema" 
series) shows off the playfulness of Fellini's mind. Phantasmic images collide 
throughout as Juliet (played by Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina) slips into a 
dream landscape as her despair over a lousy marriage and cheating husband 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
 In "8 1/2," we see clowns and other circus performers leading the hero to 
heartache, insight and laughs, and in "Juliet of the Spirits," the heroine is 
guided by even stranger creatures. Bhishma (Waleska Gert), for instance, is a 
bizarre-looking oracle of undetermined sex who keeps showing up to soothe and 
cajole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juliet of the Spirits" is even more flamboyant than "8 1/2," and this leads 
to its biggest flaw. The movie lacks the defining self-awareness Fellini 
brought to "8 1/2" and, along with it, a more assured control. Even when 
Fellini takes us down a puzzling path in that movie, we come out at the other 
end knowing what the little side-trip was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Juliet of the Spirits," though, the excursions can feel gratuitous, as if 
the great director is tossing out inspirations without a subtext. This doesn't 
detract from the film's fertile imagination, which is mostly fascinating, but 
it may have you wondering what all the visual commotion is meant to convey. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if not one of Fellini's best, the picture is still mesmerizing. It's 
problematic in many of the same ways as his even more outrageous and indulgent 
"Fellini Satyricon" (1970), but, like that movie, it presents an environment 
completely different from any you can find in other films. Even when 
unsettlingly ambiguous, Fellini is always an entertaining trickster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juliet of the Spirits" is also interesting because it marks the first time 
Fellini tried color. And wow, does he use it. The picture is so bold as to be 
almost blinding -- costumes, scenery and makeup take on party-mad hues, all 
adding to his carnival interpretations of psychological distress. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong point is Masina, whose lost child's vulnerability makes Juliet 
instantly likable, no matter how much brilliant chaos is spinning around her. 
Masina can also be seen tonight at the Bowers Museum in "La Strada" (1954), 
perhaps her most recognized performance and one of Fellini's seminal films.

KIDS ON FILM: 'LITTLE RASCALS' RUNS ON A GANG PLANK OF OLD-FASHIONED FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Little Rascals," the love-struck Alfalfa falls out with his buddies in 
the He-Man Womun Haters Club but joins forces with them in a soap box derby to 
vanquish bullies Butch, Woim and snobby rival Waldo Aloysius Johnston III. 
(Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy for kids to detail what they liked about this recent foray into 
nostalgia that reproduces scenes from the 1920s "Our Gang" comedy series in 
modified '90s style. 
</P>
<P>
 But the younger ones at least hooted and howled with each broad-brush mishap 
and wide-eyed, gasping reaction of Porky, Darla, Buckwheat and the ring-eyed 
dog, Petey -- the gang their parents remember only in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 The young boy behind me had obviously seen it before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the funny part," he said, alerting his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scene, Porky and a buddy are fishing back-to-back when, unbeknown to 
them, their hooks become tangled, setting up a seesaw that ends with a 
narrow-eyed Porky in the drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh-oh," the boy said when a tree branch snags a girl's wig off Porky, who has 
disguised himself as a ballet student to escape the bullies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no!" he cried when Alfalfa climbs out of Waldo's swimming pool in front 
of Darla and discovers he has left his underpants in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was similarly hooked. Nine-year-old David Katz, an action-film 
buff, said, "It seemed kind of slow." 
</P>
<P>
 But for most, the chuckles began early with the mere appearance of Petey 
galloping full speed with his tongue hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the characters don't look or sound like anyone kids today might find 
on their block, what could be more fun than a world without adults, where kids 
make the rules, have access to endless supplies of costumes, and the worst 
thing that can happen is being sloshed with a bucket of pickle juice? 
</P>
<P>
 There's little to offend, and the well-cast and -coached actors are as 
adorable as the originals, even if their edges are smoothed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really good," said Megan Dolan, 10. "It was really funny and 
stuff." She said she laughed hardest when Alfalfa lost his briefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick McMahon, 9, said his favorite characters were Alfalfa and Petey, who both 
have a talent for ear-wiggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is modern-day Los Angeles, but director Penelope Spheeris 
carefully reproduced the gang's Depression Era-look. Alfalfa still has his 
cowlick, bow tie and suspenders holding up the too-short pants. Buckwheat still 
has braids. 
</P>
<P>
 Spheeris also obviously took pains to find vacant lots, palm trees, brick 
buildings, cracked sidewalks and chain-link fences with a time-neutral feel 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The humor is kiddie slapstick having to do mostly with whoopie cushions, frogs 
in ballet class, kitty-litter sandwiches and creative name-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the several celebrity cameos makes an adult crack (Reba MacIntire 
asks Alfalfa, "Is that a cowlick or are you just glad to see me?"). Mostly, the 
kids' pranks are gentle '90s replays of the originals; for instance, putting 
dish soap in Alfalfa's drinking water so bubbles come out of his mouth when he 
sings a love song to his amour, Darla. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1994, he sings, "All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you . 
. . "  
</P>
<P>
 He also makes 1994 remarks such as, "I'm a sensitive male in touch with my 
feminine side." Darla talks modern too, calling Waldo "a hunk." The snob Waldo 
forgets Alfalfa's name, confusing it with a more trendy grain, Falafel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the modern rascals don't tolerate bashing males or females. In the 
film's only stab at moralizing, the woman-haters learn to love and respect 
females, agreeing even to integrate the club. 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed about right to the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan remembered when boys and girls hated each other way back in the old 
preschool days. Now the boys have slacked off some, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for what girls think about boys now, she said, "They're OK, I guess."

NEWSBITES: MAN OF STEELE PRESIDES AT JOHN DOMINIS

<P>
 Jed Steele, owner and winemaker at Lake County-based Steele Wines, will attend 
a five-course dinner featuring his wines at John Dominis restaurant on 
Wednesday. He'll also comment on the pairing of those wines with dishes created 
for the occasion by the restaurant's chef, Lasse Sorensen. 
</P>
<P>
 How, you might wonder, did they hit on Steele's 1992 California Chardonnay to 
go with sauteed Hawaiian onaga crusted with Italian parsley and served on a bed 
of fried lemon linguine with mango-vanilla bean beurre blanc? Or his "Catfish" 
Zinfandel to complement Colorado rack of lamb stuffed with apples, cherries and 
Sonoma fois gras, roasted with fresh herbs and topped with a fresh cherry 
glaze? 
</P>
<P>
 You can find out for $60 per person, including tax and gratuity. Hors 
d'oeuvres will be served at 7 p.m., with Steele's 1993 Nacido Vineyard Pinot 
Blanc Bien.

 Why wait until October? Why not Augustfest? A beer-tasting dinner at the 
Hobbit on Sunday will feature five styles from Fullerton Hofbrau brewmaster 
Andreas Moerle and as many courses from Hobbit chef Michael Philippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Weizer and Pilsner-type beers will accompany a selection of more than a dozen 
different hors d'oeuvres; lager pairs with beer-steamed shellfish (cockles, 
shrimp, mussels and clams); ale accompanies ale-braised duck leg, and dark bock 
goes with the leg of lamb with garlic and pastina. It's your choice for the 
chocolate almond ganache, but we'd say sweets for the sweet, stick with the 
bock. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening begins at 6. Cost of $42 is inclusive; it even covers a 
commemorative glass and favors.

 If five beers just whets your whistle, you can sample 21 -- three flights of 
seven reds, wheats and pales -- at a Micro-Brew Fest at Sfuzzi bistro on Aug. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 The tasting is hosted by Hi-Time Cellars. The reds are not only visually more 
colorful, but check out the names: Red Fox Ale, Red Tail Ale, Jamaica Red Ale, 
Rogue Red Ale, Red Seal, Red Roost and Old Red Eye. Why, the wheat beers and 
other ales pale by comparison.

THERE'S NO TOFU LIKE SOFT TOFU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soft Tofu Restaurant is a small, ramshackle Garden Grove place with a menu 
printed almost entirely in Korean. It aims for a Korean clientele, although the 
staff is quite welcoming to other diners -- considering how surprised they are 
to see any. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently ate at Soft Tofu with some friends, and we all came away thinking 
it was our best Orange County meal of the year. As I write this, nearly a week 
later, I realize the impression was more than a casual one. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you rush out to Soft Tofu Restaurant -- and I hope you plan to -- here 
is a brief description of Korean food, probably the least known and least 
appreciated of the major Asian cuisines. You may have eaten Korean barbecue, 
but that's just the beginning. Korean cuisine is distinctive: more substantial 
than Japanese, more rustic and strongly flavored than Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 As in neighboring China and Japan, rice is the staple of the diet. It's always 
accompanied by a variety of side dishes known as panch'an , which can be 
anything from humble boiled bamboo to highly spiced oysters. The most famous 
accompaniment is kimchi, vegetables highly seasoned with red pepper and garlic 
and pickled with dried shrimp. There are dozens of kinds of kimchi, the most 
common being the crimson-colored, fiery-hot cabbage version. Western diners 
often recoil from kimchi when they first encounter it (the aroma can be pretty 
strong), but many are surprised to find themselves falling in love with it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no courses, per se, in a formal Korean meal. The table fills up 
gradually, and guests are expected to begin eating as soon as the first dishes 
arrive (you don't wait for everyone to be served, as in a Western meal). At 
Soft Tofu, the biggest hurdle is getting the waitress to give you advice. If 
you don't come here with a clear idea about what you want, chances are she will 
be shy about counseling you. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the natural place to begin is with soft tofu, an increasingly popular 
item in the restaurants of L.A.'s Koreatown and one of the most elegant light 
foods in the world. Those who have eaten tofu only in a Chinese or Japanese 
restaurant are in for a major attitude adjustment here. They only know the 
usual squares of soybean curd. Eaten alone, that kind of tofu -- nutritious and 
digestible though it is -- has a neutral taste and a texture not unlike that of 
an undercooked omelet. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there is soft tofu, made by screening liquidized soybean through silk 
(yes, real silk). I first ate it in Japan, and the difference astounded me. 
Soft tofu has a slippery, mousse-like, downright silken texture; it's a magical 
foodstuff that absorbs the flavors of whatever is cooked with it with unmatched 
grace. By comparison, commercial tofu is rough, stiff and gelatinous. 
</P>
<P>
 There are essentially three ways to eat your soft tofu here: with fresh 
oysters, sliced beef or both. I had the combination, served with (natch) rice 
and panch'an, and it was astonishing. Delicate little clouds of tofu swim to 
the surface as you spoon up the hot broth. Underneath, more firmly cooked (but 
still delicate) chunks await the edge of a spoon to scrape them up. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual begins here when the waitress brings you bowls of iced rice tea ( 
poricha ) in cold stainless steel cups. That is followed by hot bowls of rice 
(also in stainless steel -- the Korean steel industry is booming) and assorted 
panch'an, which might be, say, boiled spinach with a fermented soy dressing, 
two kinds of kimchi (cucumber and cabbage) and a dish of marinated seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft tofu itself comes in a special iron crock known as a duk bekki . The 
tofu is boiled inside it, and it rests on a wooden base, remaining hot 
throughout your meal. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is plenty besides soft tofu to be had. Sunde (pronounced soon-day ) 
is a long, thin-sliced tube akin to andouille , the French sausage made from 
tripe, and every bit as delicious. This one contains pig stomach, rice, spices 
and a bit of blood in the forcemeat to darken it. Koreans slice it into thin 
rounds and eat it with spiced salt. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like chili, tomato and rice, consider the dish called chik sak duk poke 
(pronounce it chick-sock-duck-po-kay and you will be understood). Here you get 
a boiling pot of red soup that reduces and slowly caramelizes as you linger 
over it. The main component is rice cakes, which are cylindrical and pasta-like 
-- not flat, as you might expect from the name. The rice cakes are al dente. 
Let them boil long enough, though, and they get as soft as baby food. 
</P>
<P>
 The best cold dish here is naeng myun (nang mee-un). This cold, refreshing 
vegetarian noodle dish is popular on hot summer days in Korea. The noodle used 
here is close to angel hair pasta, but it's tossed with sesame oil, red pepper, 
thin-sliced cucumbers and more than a hint of garlic. Koreans like it bordering 
on ice cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant also makes a mean mandu kuk , the Korean won ton soup. Mandu is 
a thick-skinned, more garlicky won ton than you are probably used to, with a 
finely ground meat filling. The broth loaded with garlic and cabbage and may 
look like minestrone, but watch out -- its red color comes from dried chilies, 
not tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 The complimentary dessert, if you want to call it that, is chikkei , a sugared 
rice liquid that is almost as refreshing as the cold noodles. Few Koreans leave 
here without downing their bowl of chikkei.  
</P>
<P>
 How is it that a restaurant like this goes largely unnoticed, while Chinese 
steam-table takeouts spring up in every corner mini-mall? This must be one of 
those mysteries of the inscrutable West. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft Tofu restaurant is inexpensive. Dishes run between $4.99 and $6.99.

PARKER'S PLACE: WHEN ARMS FIRED ORANGES, NOT BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of

<TEXT>
<P>
 When old friends gather, old stories prevail. The past nudges out the present, 
and it's not until later that you begin to wonder what those stories say about 
you now. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, five old friends and their spouses came together at my house to 
celebrate a 40th birthday. We ate, drank and told stories about our teen-age 
years growing up in Tustin. Those 25 or so years ago we were mean little 
fellows, suburban guerrillas always looking for a mean little thrill; brats. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus: 
</P>
<P>
 One summer day we decided to assassinate the Helm's Bakery man with water 
balloons. We conspired. My little brother, Matt, stopped the truck as it 
lumbered down our block and asked the Helm's man -- a tall, distinguished and 
not very friendly gentleman -- to see his doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt then asked to see the cakes. Matt then asked to see the breads. So, as 
the regal Helmsman stood there on the blazing summer asphalt with all the 
drawers of his truck opened to show his wares, Bob and I peddled our Stingrays 
past as fast as we could and unloaded two untucked shirttails' worth of heavy 
water balloons onto him, his baked goods and his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 A low-speed chase resulted, at the end of which my bike dangled from the 
Helm's truck like a captured enemy, and the Helm's man duly reported us to our 
parents. I am fairly sure we all caught hell for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Or: 
</P>
<P>
 One fall night during football season we each gathered up a shopping bag full 
of oranges (easy to do in Orange County, then) and eased beneath cover near the 
Tustin High School football field. We had recruited volunteers, so grand was 
the scale of our offensive. That night the marching band was rehearsing, led by 
a music teacher who was unpopular with us for vague, hypothetical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 There they were, the effete marching band being drilled under the lights. When 
this pompous, strutting musical body got as close to us as it was going to, we 
stood and unloaded approximately one ton of ripe Valencia oranges on them -- 
pulp, tubas and orange juice arching through the stadium lights. 
</P>
<P>
 They screamed. They scattered. Led by their furious director, they gave chase. 
We vanished into the groves like ground squirrels and learned the next day that 
the principal had offered a reward for information on who would do such a 
thing. Some of us got caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Or: 
</P>
<P>
 On three successive days, we used more fresh oranges to bomb 1) the Columbus 
Tustin Intermediate School bus; 2) an Amtrak passenger train passing through 
Santa Ana, and 3) a throng of shoppers heading into a Sav-on drugstore, several 
of whom actually fell to the ground under the intense shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fourth day, still thirsting for mayhem, we got into a water fight with 
neighbor boys, who finally fled to the safety of a house. We got up on their 
roof, fed the garden hose down the chimney and blasted them out. We were 
rounded up later and summarily beaten by our respective fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tales went on and on, late into the night. As I listened, it struck me 
that all of us had gone on to enjoy relatively interesting adult lives that had 
no doubt produced stories more pertinent than these, but few were offered. 
There we were, 40-year-old former juvenile delinquents relishing each thrown 
orange, launched bottle rocket and hurled firecracker of our barefoot, 
bucktoothed, pimple-faced pasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, boy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a true dolt could have gotten up the next day and not been bewildered by 
the way the teen-age violence quotient has multiplied so dramatically since 
then. There was Robert Chan, 19, on the front page of this paper, just 
sentenced to life in prison without parole for murdering an acquaintance two 
years ago. Fresh in memory was the boy killed in San Clemente recently when a 
paint roller was thrown through his skull. There have been too many Orange 
County teen-agers shot in gang altercations to even remember all their names. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan wrote in letters to the court that he had read Albert Camus' "The 
Stranger" some nine months before the murder and claimed that the book 
encouraged him to kill his victim because "everything (is) meaningless and 
nothing matters because we are all going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 I clearly remember reading "The Stranger" as a sophomore in high school, the 
same high school where we bombed the marching band a year later. Frankly, in my 
lack of sophistication, I thought that the book lacked zest and that Camus' 
dreary killer, Meursault, was much more of an abstraction than a character. My 
English teacher said as much, explaining that the existentialist view of life 
as meaningless sprung from the horrors of World War II, and that Meursault was 
meant to embody this philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 My teacher implied that I was probably unable to grasp Meursault's despair 
because I had not experienced the horrors of World War II, and that throwing 
water balloons at Helm's men was hardly a good primer for existentialism. I 
think that was a sagacious observation, which leads me to wonder just what in 
Robert Chan's life loosened his grasp of the larger, more obvious things, such 
as right and wrong, good and bad, decent and indecent. It's not for me to even 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting around the party table as the evening wound down the night before, I 
had begun to realize that these stories of misdemeanor and misadventure were 
valuable to us precisely because the acts they recount were so small, so 
particular, but so loaded with, yes, meaning.

 These acts meant breaking the law. These acts meant the thrill of flight. 
These acts -- no matter how well we planned them, it seemed -- meant getting 
caught. These acts meant getting punished. I can remember the first time I held 
a good firm orange in my hand with the intention of hitting an innocent 
stranger with it -- how perfectly functional the orb seemed, how impossible it 
was not to throw such a well-made projectile at somebody. What the orange meant 
was pure, forbidden, rebellious, myth-of-the-West excitement. My friends and I 
were very clear on that. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan grew up in a different county than I did, though less than two 
decades separate us in age. I juiced the school bus; Chan destroyed a living 
teen-ager. Somewhere along the line, the ante got upped, the stakes got higher 
and "meaning" got harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Rereading Chan's words a few days later, I was struck by how close he was to 
the mark, and at the same time how far away. Because we are all going to die, 
he reasons, everything is meaningless and nothing matters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth is: Because we are all going to die, nothing is meaningless and 
everything matters. Even oranges. Old stories and old friends remind me of 
this. I am thankful for both.

3-HOUR TOUR: A FEAST OF TREATS ON THE HALF-SHELL

 There's no better place to start a crawl through Fountain Valley than Casa de 
Tortuga. From the street it may look like an ordinary residence, but inside are 
more than 700 tortoises and turtles, drawn from 100 species including Argentine 
side necks and Chinese big heads. And because turtle soup is not on the menu, 
you'll need to head over to Richard Jones Pit BBQ. There are no Texas 
tortoises, but they do offer smoked armadillo tails. After a quick bite, the 
latest mutant turtle comic can be found at the Land of Oohs and Ahs. 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 11:15: A turtle-shaped doorbell gives you a hint that Casa de Tortuga is 
a casa unlike any other. Beyond the front gate, Walter Allen's turtles, 
tortoises and related collectibles fill two large homes on three city lots 
landscaped with cactus, hibiscus and a 5,000-gallon pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours are booked well in advance, but you can attend its annual open house 
this Saturday and Sunday, no appointment needed. (The neighbors don't mind the 
tours because the animals are so quiet, the operation is educational and 
humanitarian, and there's normally only one tour a day.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a hobby I ran into, and it got out of hand," said Allen, 67. "You 
buy two, then you got 10, next thing you know it's 28 years later, and you got 
600." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs warn, "Danger, beware of stampeding turtles" and "These premises 
patrolled by attack tortoise." The tour starts with red-eared sliders and 
Argentine side necks, whose heads are too big to retract. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the world's larger tortoises are the Kalahari Desert's sulcata, the 
Burmese and the Galapagos: "That male was 6 months old and weighed 4 1/2 ounces 
when I got him," Allen recalled. "Now he weighs 350 pounds. He's cantankerous, 
but he's our mascot because I feel so proud to raise him up. I've had him 23 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest is the aldabara, from the Seychelles Islands; Allen's, still 
young, weighs 450 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the house are the collectibles: turtle hot plates, graters, cookie 
jars, coffee cups, teapots and baby-powder shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You name it, it's been made into a turtle," Allen said. Some sport slogans 
such as "Turtles do it slower" and "My shell or yours?" 
</P>
<P>
 One room is a veritable Ripley's Believe It or Not of turtles, where wonders 
include snake-neck turtles and the spine-covered mata-mata. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese big heads are good climbers: "I was watching a travelogue, and one 
went from the bottom to the top of a 200-foot-high waterfall," Allen said. 
"Turtles have claws. If a turtle can grab on, he can climb. They're just not 
all interested in doing it." Allen also owns two albino turtles, yellow-orange 
with pink eyes, and even a freeze-dried turtle. 
</P>
<P>
 11:15-11:35: No goldfish are in sight, but even a mata-mata might be 
interested in taking a few moments to check out the varied spread at A-Unique 
Bazaar, Indo-Pak Grocery & Video. 
</P>
<P>
 Turmeric, coriander, garlic, fennel, tamarind and cardamom are a few of the 
spices lining the shelves. Less odoriferous, but no less enticing, are jars of 
mango and chili pickle, fresh carrot pickle and lime pickle, extra hot. 
Chutneys include fresh mint and others made from such mangoes as chunda and 
katke. Basmati rice is big here; it comes in 44-pound bags. Among a bevy of 
beans for soups are garbanzo, black eye and mung. The store also stocks 
Indian-language videos, though some have names like "Boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 11:35-12:35: Turtles don't have ribs, but Richard Jones Pit BBQ does, and the 
beans transcend all language barriers. What's in them that makes them so good? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes beef, sometimes pork, you never know," the waitress said. 
</P>
<P>
 One bite, and everything else went on hold. Armadillo tails, hickory-smoked 
chicken strips with barbecue sauce and fries, are $4.50; lunch with the fixings 
is $5.95 for beef or spare ribs, half-chicken or smoked ham, $6.95 for baby 
back ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Combination platters are generally $10.95; I chose beef brisket, "smoked up to 
16 hours," and baby back ribs (add $1.25). A pail was provided for bones, and a 
request for water brought a glass the size of the Panhandle. Other barbecue 
sauces can turn a perfectly good meal into a tomato-y mess, but Jones' bottled 
sauce might make a perfectly good meal itself. 
</P>
<P>
 12:35-1: The Land of Oohs and Ahs carries comic books, 25 cents and up, 
guaranteed to bring you out of your shell: "Freex," "Lobo/Infanticide" ("Say 
yer pwayers, cweep," says a baby on the cover, milk bottle and guns at his 
side) as well as the more G-rated "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Robert Lugibihl said that a reorder of "Tortuga!" was possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about a turtle that got caught in an experiment, kinda like Spiderman 
did, and he turns into a giant turtle," Lugibihl said. "There was a museum show 
for kids, and one of the kids carried his little pet turtle with him wherever 
he went, and they were doing some sort of atomic tests in front of these kids, 
like with an experimental growth ray, and the kid trips and drops his turtle 
and it gets bathed in the beam, and it starts growing and growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets as big as Godzilla, and it's like stomping through the city, and a 
couple of superheroes fly down to try to stop it. Its brain grows really big 
too so that it gets really intelligent. Finally the little kid appeals to it, 
and says, 'Please stop,' and the turtle says, 'Forgive me, I didn't know what I 
was doing, I was confused and my brain was growing,' and then he flies off into 
outer space and says he's going to go be with higher life forms."

SPURRED BY FED, BANKS LOWER RATES ON FIXED MORTGAGES; FINANCE: BUT COST OF 
ADJUSTABLE-RATE LOANS GOES UP, MAKING THEM LESS ATTRACTIVE TO NEW HOME BUYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major lenders nationwide, reacting to the Federal Reserve Board's latest move 
to tighten credit, cut rates on their fixed mortgages Wednesday while raising 
rates on adjustable loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves, which make fixed-rate mortgages more attractive to new home buyers 
and to those refinancing their loans, could trigger a resurgence in the 
fixed-mortgage market, which had recently begun to lose ground to 
adjustable-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fixed rates have definitely gotten more attractive in just the past week," 
says Earl Peattie, president of Mortgage News Co. in Santa Ana. "If you're 
going to spend some time in the same home, a fixed-rate mortgage looks 
increasingly viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what happened at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank. On Wednesday, 
Wells Fargo cut the cost of its fixed-rate loan to 8.5% from 8.65%. But it 
hiked charges for a popular adjustable loan product -- the so-called "one-year, 
T-bill ARM" -- dramatically. The initial rate on this loan soared to 6.75% from 
6.25% the day before.  
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers choose between fixed and adjustable loans based on the "spread", or 
difference, between the two, experts note. That's because the rate on 
adjustable loans can rise, but only by set amounts each year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the standard adjustable loan, the interest rate can only rise by 2 
percentage points each year and by a maximum of 6 percentage points over the 
life of the loan. Consequently, if the start rate on the adjustable loan is low 
enough, the ARM borrower could save thousands of dollars during the first 
several years of the mortgage. If they sell or refinance within that time, they 
stay ahead permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just that type of analysis that caused adjustable loans to surge in 
popularity during the first several months of 1994. While fixed-rate mortgages 
have long been the darling of home finance, adjustable mortgages snapped up 
more than 40% of the market by the end of May versus just 25% of the market in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 That's mainly because the cost of fixed loans soared during the first few 
months of the year, while the start rates on adjustable loans moved far less 
dramatically. The result: The spread between fixed and adjustable loans hit an 
all-time high in April, with ARMs 3.45 percentage points lower, on average, 
than comparable fixed-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if interest rates rose as rapidly as possible, given the annual interest 
"caps," ARM borrowers would pay less than fixed-rate borrowers for at least 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of Wednesday, that trend appeared to be put in reverse as lenders upped 
charges for ARMs and cut charges for fixed loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wouldn't rates on both types of mortgages go in the same direction at the 
same time? Because adjustable loan rates are affected by swings in short-term 
interest rates; they're frequently tied to one-year Treasury bills. But fixed 
mortgages move in concert with the long-term bond market, which is swayed by 
inflation fears more than current interest rates.

OIL IMPORTS UP SHARPLY IN JULY AMID FALLING U.S. DEMAND; ENERGY: THE LATEST 
STATISTICS ILLUSTRATE A TREND: MAJOR U.S. PRODUCERS ARE SHIFTING FROM DOMESTIC 
TO OVERSEAS SOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. imports of raw crude oil and its derivatives toppled a 17-year-old record 
last month, though overall demand for petroleum products declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The import level, described in a monthly report released Wednesday by the 
American Petroleum Institute, is an indication of a well-established trend in 
the U.S. economy: Business and individuals are becoming increasingly dependent 
on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, imports of crude oil and petroleum products in July, at an 
average of 10.059 million barrels daily, were up 9.1% from the previous July, 
according to the API, the trade group for major U.S.-based oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Imports last month accounted for about 58% of domestic demand, another record. 
It was also the first time imports exceeded the level of 10 million barrels a 
day. The previous high mark occurred in 1977, when imports briefly surged to an 
average volume just short of 10 million barrels daily. The API said declining 
domestic oil output was mostly to blame for the extra imports. 
</P>
<P>
 "In contrast with the surge in imports in July, domestic deliveries lagged 
behind recent trends and actually declined," the API said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliveries of oil products -- a key measure of demand -- amounted to 17.260 
million barrels a day last month, 0.6% below the level reported for July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's dip notwithstanding, the API said that "the strength of the 
economy and other indicators suggest that underlying growth in petroleum 
consumption has not slackened to any significant degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Among oil products, the biggest percentage decline was registered for 
residual, or heavy fuel oil, which is burned by electric utilities. Demand for 
residual dropped 10.1% from the year-ago period to 970,000 barrels a day, 
mainly because of cooler weather across the nation and a price shift that gave 
natural gas an advantage in the utility fuels market. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline demand was also down. It slipped 0.7% from July, 1993, to 7.733 
million barrels daily. The institute pegged that decline to a short-term 
fluctuation. "It seems unlikely that the month's decline in (gasoline) 
deliveries corresponded with any major slackening in underlying demand," the 
API said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, demand for kerosene, or jet fuel, rose 7.7% in July to 1.441 
million barrels daily compared to July, 1993, and orders for "distillates" such 
as diesel fuel and home heating oil rose 2.5% to 2.740 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kerosene market, airlines are cutting fares and moving more passengers, 
and the military is completing a conversion from naphtha-based fuel to 
kerosene, the API said. Distillate use rose on extra demand from trucking 
companies and railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. oil output declined 1.9% in July to an average of 6.56 million barrels a 
day. American oil production is down sharply from the early 1970s, when the 
nation was pumping more than 9 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline is attributable to several major trends. U.S.-based oil companies, 
frustrated with environmental laws and prohibited from drilling in many 
promising areas, are shifting the focus of exploration activities overseas. 
Also, major oil fields are being depleted.

BILL WOULD ALLOW WORKERS TO SUE OVER HARASSMENT; WORKPLACE: UNDER THE 
CONGRESSIONAL MEASURE, ARBITRATION IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES WOULD BE OPTIONAL 
INSTEAD OF MANDATORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill introduced Wednesday would give workers on Wall Street and elsewhere 
the right to sue their bosses over sexual harassment and other disputes instead 
of having to go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) said the bill was partly prompted by 
"disturbing reports about the handling of sexual harassment by the securities 
industry." She cited an article in the Wall Street Journal that described how a 
woman lost a sexual harassment claim in arbitration even though her boss 
physically threatened her and threw condoms on her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder said the bill she is sponsoring is aimed at restoring employees' 
rights to a fair hearing in employment disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would amend seven federal laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 
to prevent employers from forcing workers to resolve employment discrimination 
claims through arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers could still voluntarily choose arbitration, but they would have the 
option to pursue their grievances in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In arbitration, two sides choose an independent person or panel and agree that 
the intermediary's decision will resolve their dispute. In theory, arbitration 
can be faster and less expensive than court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, an industry self-policing group, 
requires stockbrokers and other salespeople to agree to submit any employment 
disputes to arbitration as a condition of obtaining an NASD license. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sponsor of the bill, Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), said a number of 
other industries began making similar requirements following a 1991 Supreme 
Court decision on age discrimination, known as Gilmer vs. Interstate-Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The court held that workers may be barred from suing their bosses for alleged 
age bias if the employees previously agreed to submit such claims to binding 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, what we're doing is reversing the Gilmer decision and saying you 
cannot make employees give up their federal rights at the time they are hired," 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey also said the racial and gender makeup of securities arbitrators don't 
reflect the gender and racial diversity of the work force. A General Accounting 
Office report earlier this year said 89% of arbitrators were men and 97% were 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Myers, a NASD spokesman, said that in sexual or racial discrimination 
cases, the association looks for arbitrators of the same sex or race as the 
employee.  
</P>
<P>
 "Arbitration has proven to be a very fair process for all involved, and it has 
worked well," Myers said. He had no immediate comment on the proposed bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities Industry Assn., Wall Street's main trade group, said that while 
it doesn't agree with the proposed bill, "we do believe the existing system can 
be improved." The association said in a statement that it supports better 
education and training of arbitrators.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; TRADERS PAUSE TO EVALUATE IMPACT OF RATE HIKE BY FED 
</P>

<P>
 Blue chip stocks closed lower and bond yields rose Wednesday as investors 
pulled back to assess the impact of the Federal Reserve Board's decision to 
aggressively boost short-term interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Smaller-company stocks performed better than the broader market, rallying amid 
investor belief that the issues might have a better chance than larger shares 
in a slow-growth environment. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.15 points to 
742.66. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, however, fell 8.09 points to 3,776.48 on the 
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 312.84 million, up from 304.47 
million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 9 
on the NYSE. In its fifth interest rate increase of the year, the central bank 
raised the federal funds rate to a 2 1/2-year high of 4.75% from 4.25%, where 
it had been since May. It also said it raised the discount rate to 4.0% from 
3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields ended moderately higher, rising in late trading after 
falling earlier in the day. The market decline eroded earlier speculation that 
a bull market had been aroused by the Fed's action.  
</P>
<P>
 "It remains to be seen whether investors will now put cash to work in light of 
the Fed's aggressive move to raise interest rates," said Kathleen Camilli, 
chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The yields on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 7.40% from 7.36% on 
Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 13/32 point, or 
$4.06 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the central bank's credit tightening was seen as an aggressive 
move against inflation. On Wednesday, however, investors worried that higher 
rates could choke the economy, said Lawrence Rice, chief market strategist at 
Josephthal Lyon & Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are sitting back and re-evaluating the impact of higher interest rates 
on the economic outlook for the next six months to a year," Rice said. "Growth 
is likely to slow and corporate profits could suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, that sentiment was balanced by significant relief that the 
Fed's much-anticipated move was at least out of the way and that another is not 
likely anytime soon. Michael Metz, chief strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., said 
consumer non-durable stocks such as food and drug issues performed better. That 
was partly a reaction to continued takeover rumors in those sectors. But it was 
also tied to a belief that if the Fed's rate increase proves to be a drag on 
the economy, these stocks would do better than so-called cyclical issues, Metz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks also advanced sharply and with drug stocks helped pushed the 
Nasdaq and other smaller-company indexes sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sluggish economy, investors often look to smaller, more agile companies, 
believing they can do well despite a slower economy, constantly reinventing 
themselves and delivering the biggest profit gains, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, stocks rose in reaction to the Fed move. Prices closed in London 
with robust gains on a healthy turnover after British inflation data calmed 
fears of a near-term rise in domestic interest rates. The Financial Times-100 
share average shot up 43.0 points to close at 3,190.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average gained 19.15 points to finish at 2,162.29, 
while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended up 38.20 points at 20,824.56. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index finished up 5.05 points at 2,699.65.

WESTSIDE WATCH: GETTING WIND OF PRIMO WEATHER FOR BOARD-SAILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gone with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what some of Eugene Fama's academic friends think when the avid 
windsurfer's pager starts beeping in the business faculty lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fama, a part-time resident of Pacific Palisades and a visiting professor of 
finance at UCLA, from the University of Chicago, has wired himself into a new 
paging service, "Call of the Wind." It beeps him when local wind conditions 
reach 13 m.p.h. -- perfect for board-sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-year-old service, based in Ventura, monitors wind conditions at 14 
of California's most spectacular windsurfing locales, from Seal Beach to the 
Sacramento River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 The company measures wind speeds using an anemometer, a monitoring device that 
sends digital information to an automated voice machine that is updated every 
eight seconds. For $16 to $21 a month, users can either call in for wind 
information, or when conditions become prime, receive an automatic page with 
specific information. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a windsurfer's dream -- to have access to these instant wind reports," 
said Fama, who often drives 25 miles to Leo Carillo State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without my pager I used to do a lot of driving for nothing -- winds in this 
area are not reliable," he said. 
</P>

 THE FALL OF THE FLAKES: When we first heard about Santa Monica businessman 
Larry S. Lipsman's campaign to rid Southern California of flakes, we thought he 
was talking about certain people in Venice or Malibu or Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turns out Lipsman is onto something far broader. "Your cleaning wasn't 
ready when promised; your important lunch appointment across town never showed; 
your 2 o'clock meeting was an hour late, and your mechanic still hasn't 
finished the brake job. Is this some sort of conspiracy? Punishment for some 
wrongdoing? Don't be too alarmed, it might be just the case of the flakes," he 
said recently in announcing his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Flakes, he said, are "the kind of people that find it difficult to live up to 
the commitments they make." 
</P>
<P>
 So Lipsman, an ad man, is selling T-shirts, decals and bumper stickers that 
depict a snowflake in a red circle with a horizontal bar over the words "No 
Flakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the heat wave this week, we're not sure how many people will welcome 
that message.

 MUDDY WATERS: For a little while last week, they were singing the blues at the 
hot new nightclub, House of Blues, on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 With the group War on stage and Liza Minnelli, Richard Pryor and Jerry 
Seinfeld reportedly among the 800 in the audience, a water pipe burst on Sunset 
Boulevard, releasing more than a million gallons of water. At least eight 
businesses were closed temporarily, and the nightclub patrons had to be 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 The water flowed over a dirt lot near the House of Blues, churning up mud and 
spilling it over the hillside, said Metropolitan Water District spokesman 
Robert Gomperz. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, built downhill from where the break occurred, sustained minor damage 
from the water and mud flow. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the club said the establishment's closer-than-usual brush with 
the Mississippi Delta blues did not stop the music. The club, he said, reopened 
the next day.

RESIDENTS TARGET AIRPORT SAFETY, NOISE AT MEETING; TRANSPORTATION: COALITION OF 
NEIGHBORS ALSO LEVIES COMPLAINTS TO LOCAL AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS ABOUT FLIGHT 
PATTERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 residents packed a recreation center Tuesday night to complain 
angrily about increased air traffic, flight patterns over neighborhoods and 
low-flying aircraft associated with Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting at the Penmar Recreation Center in Venice was called by Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), 
whose district includes the Marina del Rey and Venice areas near the airfield, 
one of the busiest single-runway facilities in the nation. Federal and local 
authorities also attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which lasted three hours and included heated testimony from 
homeowners living under the airport's flight paths, was called to address a 
list of safety and noise control recommendations from an ad-hoc safety 
committee composed of residents, pilots and airport officials. It was formed 
after three fatal plane crashes in the densely populated neighborhoods near the 
airport in the last nine months. Nobody on the ground was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-member committee has asked federal and airport officials for increased 
pilot education, an evaluation of the airport's complaint process, more 
aggressive distribution of noise abatement and safety policies to pilots, and 
additional aircraft inspections (many recent crashes have been blamed on engine 
trouble). 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wirth, a Harman aide, said the congresswoman's staff is working with the 
Federal Aviation Administration on the recommendations. "We have received a 
letter from the FAA committed to dealing with these proposals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kruger, a Galanter aide, said the councilwoman has received dozens of 
complaints in the past few months about the airport, primarily concerning 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical complaint from many at the meeting was the 95-decibel limit at the 
airport set by a 1984 agreement between the city of Santa Monica and the FAA. 
Many say the level is too high and is violated on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work at home, and the planes are always over us -- you can't even think," 
said Frieda Marlin, a resident in the 795-unit Lincoln Place Apartments, just 
southwest of the runway. "We've always had lots of birds, but they sure don't 
sing anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport manager Tim Walsh said the decibel limit was reached after arduous 
negotiations that included residents, airplane manufacturers' and pilots' 
associations, and was unlikely to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, we will make a commitment to put sound-monitoring equipment on 
houses west of the airport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents griped about pilots who fail to adhere to the airport's 
recommended flight pattern, which remains a "tricky little maneuver," Walsh 
said. Shortly after takeoff, pilots must veer left over the Penmar Golf Course 
to avoid residential neighborhoods. After flying over the course, they must 
continue to Lincoln Boulevard before they can turn south. Planes going north 
must fly out to the ocean before turning. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents said they want all pilots to make their primary turns over the 
ocean and not over nearby residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighbors want the airport to scale back student flight patterns that 
they consider most bothersome and dangerous. In these flights, which make up 
28% of the airport's air traffic, the planes often remain under 1,400 feet and 
execute a landing followed by an immediate takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said the airport has already cut back on such traffic, which made up 37% 
of total flights in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport has averaged one crash per 200,000 air operations, or about one a 
year -- a better record than the U.S. average of five per 100,000 takeoffs and 
landings. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials said they hope to build on that record and will implement a 
"safety room" at the airport in September that will feature additional pilot 
instruction. Recent Fatal Crashes 
</P>
<P>
 April 20, 1994: Pilot Patrick Dean Brinnon, 36, died after his single-engine 
plane developed engine trouble shortly after takeoff and crashed into the 
garage of a house in the 2300 block of Ashland Avenue in Santa Monica, about 
100 yards from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 March 11, 1994: Passenger Gregory Leslie, 35, was killed, and student pilot 
David Thompson, 22, suffered a broken arm and second-degree burns on his arm 
and hands after a four-seat Piper 28 developed engine trouble shortly after 
takeoff and crashed into an unoccupied house at 2734 S. Barrington Ave. in West 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 26, 1993: Pilot Roy Belzer, 40, and two passengers, Steven Pollack 34, 
the son of film director Sydney Pollack, and David Lyon, 35, were killed after 
their single-engine plane stalled while circling above the Santa Monica Pier 
and crashed in a residential neighborhood in Venice, 1.5 miles west of the 
airport.

BRIEFLY; EDUCATION: STUDENTS WILL EXPLORE RACE, SEXISM ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 Southern California high school students, including some from 
eight Westside schools, will meet in the San Bernardino Mountains Sunday to 
discuss race relations, sexism and homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong camp, called Brotherhood/Sisterhood USA, is sponsored by the 
National Conference of Christians and Jews. Students from about 30 Southern 
California high schools will address racial stereotypes, gender issues, 
homophobic attitudes and cultural differences that can cause tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get prejudices out on the table. Students learn how harmful and 
hurtful their prejudices are," said National Conference communications 
consultant Jerry Freedman Habush. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Beverly Hills, Crossroads, Fairfax, Hamilton, Daniel Murphy, 
Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica and University high schools will be 
participating.

TOPICS / PETS; ALL THE CREATURE COMFORTS FOR CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a perfect kitty world, catnip and stinky fish-shaped snacks would flow like 
water. Scratching posts you could really sink your claws into would look like 
the dog next door. And cushy, fuzzy mouse rugs -- with head and tail attached, 
please -- would be stacked mattress-high for the recumbent feline. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is not a cat's hedonistic dreamscape. This is real-life stuff at the 
Crazy Cat Lady store in West Los Angeles, where Susan Lee, the doyenne of cat 
lovers, presides over a stock only Fifi could love. 
</P>
<P>
 With a "No Dogs Allowed" welcome mat at the door, the place is geared to 
feline-inclined shoppers, who can choose from an array of designer kitty chic 
ranging from faux leather jackets trimmed with metal rivets and chains ($40) 
complete with matching hats ($18) to posh, velveteen lounging thrones trimmed 
with gold fringe ($79) -- crowns not included. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pet store . . . it's not a gift store . . . it's really sort of a 
kitty experience," said Lee, whose store is on West 3rd Street just east of La 
Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this dog-eat-dog world, this is a kitty utopia where you can imagine life 
as a cat. It's an environment scaled down to their size, a place where cats 
feel comfortable shopping . . . where they can sit in a club chair ($325) 
without getting yelled at or try out a (faux) mouse-skin rug ($49)." 
</P>
<P>
 The brains behind the business are her cats, Lee said, who "tell me the ideas 
they have and I translate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a former advertising copywriter who parlayed her kitty passion into a 
witty, Crazy Cat Lady mail-order catalogue business four years ago, has let her 
own sybaritic, urbane cats -- all five of them -- lead the way in merchandise 
design. For instance, when two of her cats snoozed on a bath towel, she came up 
with the idea for monogrammed miniature cat towels. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Clementine and Tiny E -- the E is for Elvis -- bedded down on 
oversized floor pillows, Lee was inspired to design kitty lounging thrones. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how cats like to be elevated off the ground because they feel that 
they are above it all?" said Lee, talking over a recording of songs that 
include such feline favorites as "Three Blind Mice," "Three Little Fishies" and 
"The Pussycat Song." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee constructs the product prototypes, then graphic designer Jay Vigon, known 
for the man/fish icon he created for Gotcha Sportswear, conjures up the 
ultra-hip geometric cat images that adorn the kitty-ware. 
</P>
<P>
 Earrings and pendants -- for people -- as well as food dish trays and kitty 
beds are decked with a panoply of cat shapes and other images. A mock cardboard 
house complete with windows, a door and potted plants transforms a mundane 
thing like a litter box into the upscale Antoinette's Chateau & Toilette 
($125). 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the Crazy Cat Lady on because I found it intriguing," Vigon said. "I 
don't mind cats. I have two little girls who each have a cat."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Lee is given to hyperbole, as most parents are. 
</P>
<P>
 Clementine, who has been brought from home to pose for a photographer, is 
hiding deep in the recesses of the store. But Lee, who holds one of the gold 
crowns ($10) decked with multicolored rhinestones she has designed for the fall 
catalogue's "royalty theme," insists that "Clemmy" loves to wear the crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, after much arduous coaxing, Clementine comes out and the crown is 
propped on her head, secured by elastic straps around the chin and ears.  
</P>
<P>
 "She has PMS or something," Lee said, with a wry smile. "Normally she is 
transformed by the crown into a princess with regal manners." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said the mail-order catalogue did so well -- it has a circulation of 
50,000 -- that she decided to open the store, satisfying customers' desires to 
see the merchandise while drawing a walk-in clientele as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a recent survey I mailed out in my catalogue, I asked, 'What products make 
your tail stand straight up?' (in cat patois: products that are highly 
desirable). Or, 'What products make you want to use the litter box?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The market for chic cat-ware is sizable. Consider that cats are the No. 1 pet 
in the United States, with 63.2 million felines in households nationwide, 
compared with 54.5 million dogs. Lee, who addresses catalogues to the cat of 
the house, established a substantial customer base through advertising in 
national magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take Robyn Ray, a thirtysomething casting director, who just moved into a new 
apartment in Beverly Hills. To celebrate the move, Ray bought her beloved cat 
Shadey a 1950s-style, pink-with-black-trim "Kitty Dinette set" ($159). 
</P>
<P>
 "Who needs a big orange cat condo (scratching post and house) in their living 
room?" said Ray, who keeps her cat indoors. "I bought the dog scratching post. 
And I bought the leather jacket. . . . It was a moment of insanity, and quite 
frankly, I didn't have the money."  
</P>
<P>
 And as the seasons turn, so does the kitty fashion beat. This fall, fashion 
writers report that elegance (for people) is in. And Lee is ever ready to rise 
to the style-makers' forecast. So she has created a new litter box cover, a 
Biedermeier-inspired screen and a kitty-size "shabby chic couch." The tiny 
bed/couch comes complete with oversize pillows and damask, tone-on-tone neutral 
slipcovers with a box pleat trim at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks just like our couch," Lee said. "I can't blast (my cat) out of it. I 
made it because they are always sitting on our couch. As far as they're 
concerned, it is the same thing."

 Pieces of burning charcoal set fire to the roof of an apartment house in West 
Los Angeles on Sunday night just eight minutes before a fire of unknown origin 
destroyed three units of another residential building nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said there was no apparent connection between the $3,000 
rooftop blaze at 10917 Rochester Ave.-- which broke out during a rooftop 
barbecue -- and the later, more serious fire at 11520 Wyoming Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents and a firefighter were treated and released for minor injuries 
suffered during the second fire, which caused an estimated $540,000 worth of 
damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday, yet another fire was reported in an empty four-car garage at 
1516 Westwood Blvd. Damage to that structure was estimated at $55,000. 
</P>

<P>
 Demolition has begun on the earthquake-damaged Henshey's department store, 
ending the hopes of historical preservationists who had sought to save the 
landmark building, parts of which date to 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials last week had ordered the building to be torn down because the 
un-reinforced masonry was a threat to public safety. Preservationists were 
disappointed at the outcome, but did not strenuously object. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saddened the building is going down. But I also know that it has been 
thoroughly evaluated in the proper process," said Pam O'Connor, who heads a 
coalition created to save quake-damaged historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outcome was not what we had hoped for, but we're confident that 
(demolition) was not a casual decision," said O'Connor, also a Santa Monica 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists had hoped the building, designated as a landmark on June 20, 
could be repaired and remodeled as an example of early 20th-Century 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jan. 17 earthquake and aftershocks have severely damaged the Henshey, 
which has stood empty since the store closed in July, 1992, after 67 years, 
because of economic pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews began to remove asbestos and bricks at three corners of the building 
this week in the first phase of the demolition work. The corners are nearing 
collapse and have continued to weaken from the vibrations caused by the steady 
stream of buses and cars roaring by on Santa Monica Boulevard and 4th Street, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition is expected to take several weeks, said city planning director 
Suzanne Frick. What will become of the 2.2-acre site remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days before the earthquake, representatives of the Toys R Us chain signed 
an agreement to buy 30,000 square feet of the site fronting 4th Street from the 
H. C. Henshey Co., according to Henshey Co. consultant William A. Spurgin. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the quake, toy store representatives decided they would need to have 
a new store built, and the negotiations required Henshey Co. to have the old 
building demolished. SUSAN STEINBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who police believe set off an explosion that destroyed a vacant house 
last week remained in critical condition on Wednesday with second- and 
third-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion and resulting fire occurred Aug. 11 at 309 N. Foothill Road, 
just blocks from the headquarters of the Beverly Hills police and fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, in his mid-40s, allegedly doused the one-story residence with 
gasoline and then ignited it with a match, apparently while he was still inside 
the house, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Joe Lombardi. The resulting explosion 
virtually blew the house off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi said police had not determined a motive and knew of no connection 
between the man and the residence.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; WOMAN HURT, 9 ARRESTED IN NIGHTCLUB MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have arrested nine people on charges of 
stomping a woman and assaulting two other people during a melee Monday at a 
popular West Hollywood nightclub. 
</P>

 Four juveniles, four men and a woman were booked on suspicion of assault in 
connection with the melee at the Whiskey a Go Go on Sunset Strip, according to 
a sheriff's official. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, the incident occurred shortly before 11 p.m., when 
the suspects began to push people. One of the men threw a woman down and the 
others began stomping her.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; GOURMET COFFEE FRANCHISE IS PERK FOR COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a phenomenon that took hold first in the Fairfax district, Hollywood and 
other points west: a gourmet coffee operation that sells 40 kinds of joe and an 
array of pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 But ensconced in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, entrepreneur Eric Wilson 
sees his coffee business as nothing less than a moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 37, said he encountered resistance from several coffee- store 
franchisers before Michigan-based Coffee Beanery Ltd. gave him the go-ahead to 
open an outlet in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a year after Wilson decided to get serious about starting a business 
that could stimulate the local economy by catering to the well-heeled denizens 
of Baldwin Hills, Windsor Hills and View Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined. I thought, 'Why should I have to drive somewhere out of the 
neighborhood to get a good cup of coffee?' . . . It was time to do this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Robertson, director of franchising development for the Coffee Beanery, 
said he agreed with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that some people's reluctance to open in L.A. was absolutely wrong," 
he said. "The store, and Eric, has been a very good asset to us. It's doing 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coffee Beanery operates three other outlets in the South Bay and on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The store offers a range of flavored coffees, from Hawaiian hazelnut to German 
chocolate to African coffees, as well as scones, cakes, biscotti and other 
sweets.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy it's here. I was dying," said Cheryl Tyers as she ordered her 
usual: black coffee with a shot of Irish cream syrup. "I had to go to the 
marina for this. I think people are finally realizing that black people like 
the finer things in life too." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; 2 AREA MURALS TARGETED FOR RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit Venice arts group is launching a major fund-raising drive to 
finance the restoration of murals throughout Los Angeles, including two on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social and Public Art Resource Center has targeted 16 murals for 
restoration, including the landmark Ocean Park Pier mural in Santa Monica and 
the St. Mark's Hotel mural in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The center identified the murals most in need of restoration with funding 
support from the city of Los Angeles' Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration of the 16 murals is expected to cost about $300,000, with the work 
on the Westside murals estimated at $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although organizers expect to receive more support from the city, most of the 
funds for the project will have to come from private contributions, said Krissy 
Kuramitsu, the restoration project's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also hope that residents who live near the murals will volunteer to 
paint and raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always believed that working on art with communities is the only way 
you can ensure care for the project," Kuramitsu said. "If people have a 
personal stake in it they will look out for it." LORENZA MUNOZ

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; ON THE RISE; BREAD, ONE OF THE OLDEST COMFORT FOODS, 
HAS GONE FROM RUN-OF-THE-MILL TO THE LATEST HOT COMMODITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of the newly-opened Great Harvest Bread Co. in Brentwood say their 
moist, honeyed loaves are rolling out the door by the hundreds every day. And 
small wonder: With business rising at numerous specialty bakeries on the 
Westside, bread makers have yet to satiate consumer demand for upscale 
varieties of the staff of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the cheapest luxury there is," said Mark Peel, a partner in the La 
Brea Bakery, an offshoot of the Campanile Restaurant on La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 La Brea's two-year-old commercial bakery provides potato rolls, 
cherry-chocolate loaves and other exotic creations to supplement the more staid 
offerings on supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that good bread should be like chewing gum, not Cartier 
watches," Peel said. "You shouldn't have to travel to Rodeo Drive to get great 
bread." 
</P>
<P>
 Bread, like coffee and pasta, has transcended its earlier homely self to 
become an icon of the good life for a generation educated in food during the 
restaurant boom of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demographic trends are driving some of it. Baby boomers are eating less but 
eating better," said Bruce Winner, who tracks food trends as a continuing 
education specialist in Agriculture and Food Science at the University of 
California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't guzzling beer or eating white bread; they're eating fine breads 
and drinking fine beer," he said. "Cocooning, but still interested in that fine 
dining experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike beer or coffee, bread has been declared officially good for you (as 
long as you don't slather your slices with too much butter); grain products 
make up the biggest category in the government's food pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, specialty breads come at a steep price. La Brea Bakery's 
one-pound sour cherry chocolate loaf goes for $8. But surprisingly, perhaps, 
many of the new, pungent loaves being produced by boutique bakeries are 
competitively priced with similar products from large-scale commercial 
bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Harvest's most expensive product, for example, Cinnamon Raisin Walnut, 
costs $4.25 for a round kilo loaf, while a pound of Northridge brand Raisin 
Walnut costs $2.39 at Vons -- 3 cents more an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarket white bread is still cheaper, however, at 5 cents an ounce 
compared to 9 cents for Great Harvest's Old Fashioned White. "Of course the 
prices are competitive," said Tony Di Lembo of Breadworks, another restaurant 
spinoff with a bakery and retail counter in the Fairfax District. "This is a 
business, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 After opening a cafe-style outlet in Santa Monica's trendy Montana Avenue 
shopping district six months ago, Breadworks is ready to expand next month by 
opening another branch on Larchmont Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bread wave has hit," said Di Lembo, who recently installed a burglar 
alarm at the bakery but finds the place does so much all-night baking these 
days that he rarely needs to activate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the old-line Pioneer French Baking Co. is thinking of expanding its 
retail operations, encouraged by the success of its recently-opened bread shop 
on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have experienced how bread is supposed to be eaten and they like it," 
said John Garacochea, vice president of the Venice-based company, which closed 
its Boulangerie open-air restaurant last year but supplies sourdough loaves and 
other products to restaurants and supermarkets across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our old competitors have ceased to do business, although we have a 
lot of new competitors," he said. "It's a fun product . . . there's some 
romance to it and some history to it, and it tastes good." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, customer demand has been so great that the products of specialty 
bakeries now appear on the bread racks of major supermarkets, especially in 
Jewish neighborhoods, which have long harbored small bakeries specializing in 
rye, challah, cookies and cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Fairfax Avenue bakery began selling to Ralphs two decades ago, 
and others have joined in recently, according to Vi Pulliam, assistant bakery 
buyer for Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it is kosher and some of it is a little bit more upscale," she said. 
"We're buying a lot of product out of the bakery that way, so we don't have to 
charge that much, and the customer gets that product and doesn't necessarily 
have to go to the bakery, which is good for them and good for us." 
</P>
<P>
 At Trader Joe's, which uses La Brea Bakery and Breadworks, among others, to 
produce house brand loaves for its 63 stores, buyer Richard Baltierra said 
bread sales have increased 20% over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there are so many interesting breads out . . . olive, dried tomato, 
rosemary . . . suddenly, the energy of bakeries went trendy," he said. "Some of 
the larger baking companies that do make sandwich-type breads aren't making the 
new flavored-type breads. These people have a new niche." 
</P>
<P>
 Identifying the niche is one thing, exploiting it is another. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an easy buck. 
</P>
<P>
 In debt? "Up to here," said Jason McKinley, co-owner with his wife, Gina, of 
the Great Harvest store in Brentwood, which offers thick sample slices to all 
who venture inside. 
</P>
<P>
 What with the franchise fee, ovens, mixing machines and other costs, setting 
up their operation cost nearly $200,000, McKinley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the cost of labor to carry out Great Harvest's handmade ethic. 
Customers watch as everyone from owner to trainee joins in the daily routine of 
weighing, kneading and shaping the bread. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting for a suitable time to rise, the bread is plopped into the oven, 
a shiny steel affair of long trays that circle around like a Ferris wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the bake-by-moonlight, sell-by-daylight schedule of the typical 
bakery, the product emerges hot all day, and that's fine with customer Frances 
Doran of Westwood, who has been coming in once or twice a week since Great 
Harvest opened its doors two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a baker, so I know good bread," she said. "I've made bread at home, but 
not (like) this." 
</P>
<P>
 Other steady customers include everyone from secretaries to traffic cops to 
homeless people, but going from a busy storefront to bigger things is a chancy 
proposition -- even despite the recent surge in demand for all kinds of 
specialty foods, bread included. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of La Brea Bakery, including Campanile co-owner and chef Nancy 
Silverton, took that chance two years ago, moving most of their production from 
a cramped side room at Campanile to a warehouse-like facility on West 
Washington Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to run out of bread all the time. Now we don't," said Peel, 
Silverton's husband, recalling scenes of customers screaming for bread after 
Campanile opened for business five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While business at the restaurant weakened along with the rest of the Southern 
California economy, he said, the bakery "never noticed the recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Its product, derived from wild yeasts that Silverton harvested from organic 
grapes on a ranch in San Diego County, is baked in oil-powered ovens imported 
from Hamburg, Germany, and delivered in a fleet of trucks to places as distant 
as Orange County and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the complexity of bread-making, experts often do not see eye to eye on 
some of the finer points. 
</P>
<P>
 At Great Harvest, co-owner Jason McKinley says, "We strongly believe wheat 
loses all its flavor within 72 hours of being ground." But the La Brea Bakery 
favors a grind that has been aged two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Is fresh-milled flour better? One man who ought to know isn't saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are different theories on this," said Doug Levi of the Capitol Milling 
Co., which supplies flour to most of the commercial bakeries in Los Angeles 
from its historic mill north of downtown. "It depends on the bakery and how 
they're set up." 
</P>
<P>
 Such nuances have only created more cachet for a product that appears to have 
successfully made the transition from cutting edge restaurants to retail 
storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the food fashions get started on the restaurant level and then move 
into the straight retail sector," said Shermain Hardesty, who teaches an 
extension course on getting started in the specialty food business at UC Davis. 
"We've gone to comfort foods, and bread is certainly one of those."

A KNEAD TO KNOW BASIS FOR BAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mix some flour with enough water to form a dough, a touch of salt perhaps; 
shape it, bake it, the result is bread in its simplest, most fundamental form: 
coarse, crusty . . . everything else is extra." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus begins Edward Espe Brown's Zen-minded "Tassajara Bread Book," first 
published in 1970 and once a fixture in commune kitchens. In later editions, 
the introduction has been softened to read, "everything else (in a way) is 
extra." 
</P>
<P>
 The extras make a difference: yeast to lighten the bread, milk to smooth its 
texture, sugar or honey for sweetness, oil for moistness, eggs for cake-like 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 So do flavorings: bakeries now offer loaves made with everything from anise 
and figs to Jalapeno Cheddar cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 While commercial bakers are reluctant to reveal how they make their bread, 
they all rely on basic techniques that have served humanity since the ancients 
first slapped dough on a hot rock. 
</P>
<P>
 First take flour, generally made from the western-grown wheat that has a high 
content of gluten, a plant protein that mixes with water to form an elastic 
network of cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Add yeast, a living organism that feeds on sugars in the dough and produces 
carbon dioxide that fills the cells and makes the bread rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes oil, butter or some other form of fat, although health-conscious 
bakeries are doing without it these days. According to Bernard Clayton's "New 
Complete Book of Breads," fat gives bread richness, tenderness and flavor, 
while also lubricating the gluten in the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Milk is an option that will make a loaf soft; bakers often use non-fat dry 
milk for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 The final ingredient is hard work: elbow grease for most home bakers, electric 
horsepower for commercial bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kneading the bread stretches the gluten and lets the bread expand. Let it rise 
once, twice or three times before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dough comes of age when it rises," Clayton writes. "Now comes the quiet time 
when it grows and matures." MATHIS CHAZANOV

OUT AND ABOUT / A LA CARTE FOOD FESTIVAL: STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the chef's version of a kitchen tour -- a taste of some of the city's 
most delectable delights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the "L.A. a la carte" food and music festival, a three-day sampling of 
specialties from some of the city's most exclusive restaurants. The third 
annual festival, which this year moves from Santa Monica to Westwood, takes 
place from Friday to Sunday at the northeast corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 
Veteran Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Chefs from more than 35 restaurants, including the Bistro Garden, Tommy Tang's 
and Cafe Del Rey, will prepare samples of their most popular dishes. Seafood 
jambalaya, pecan pie, prime rib sandwiches and crab cakes will be featured. 
Samples will be available for $1 to $5 at booths and grills. Wine, beer, 
champagne and non-alcoholic drinks also will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have food from the best restaurants in Los Angeles all in one place," said 
event spokeswoman Kristin Brief. 
</P>
<P>
 As visitors savor gourmet delights, the festival also will offer 
entertainment. Starting things off on Friday at 9:30 p.m. is Los Lobos, a group 
that plays everything from Mexican-American folk music to rock 'n' roll. The 
music continues through the weekend with more than two dozen bands playing 
gospel, blues, jazz, oldies, country, reggae and rock on three stages. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival also will include a pavilion geared toward children. It showcases 
hands-on activities such as mural art. Sponsored by the Museum of Tolerance, 
the idea is to let kids use art to create their own idea of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers expect more than 40,000 people to attend. Presented by the J. 
W. Event Group, UCLA and the Westwood Village Assn., organizers hope it will 
play an important role in boosting the community's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an effort to revitalize the city of Westwood," Brief said. "We want 
to let people know that Westwood is a safe and pleasant area." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be held Friday (8/19) from 5 p.m. to midnight, Saturday from 
noon to midnight, and Sunday from noon to 10 p.m. Free parking is available at 
the Veteran's Administration Building on Wilshire Boulevard. Admission is $6 
for adults, $3 children age 3 to 12 and free for children under 2. Information:

ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST; FOR BEARS, PICNICS MAKE EASY PICKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is the time city folk head to the Angeles National Forest with their 
Twinkies, hot dogs and potato chips -- and that means party time for black 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
 There are as many as 24,000 black bears in California, one of the highest 
populations ever recorded in the state, said state Department of Fish and Game 
officials. The bears are usually most visible in the summer, prompting state 
officials to issue guidelines on how to avoid them and what to do if the wily 
animals show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've been hungry for four days and they find a bag of Twinkies: Boom. 
They've hit a honey hole," said Bob Stafford, a black bear specialist for the 
fish and game department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear sightings are uncommon in the Angeles forest and foothill communities, 
officials stressed. But bears occasionally wander through campgrounds and 
picnic areas, snatching whole cakes off tables or tearing off car windows like 
banana peels to get to an ice chest. In May, police officers shot a 350-pound 
black bear that wandered from the foothills onto a residential street in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 Black bears rarely attack people, Stafford said. But last year, one black bear 
mauled a 12-year-old Fullerton Boy Scout on a camping trip, and another 
attacked a 13-year-old boy in the San Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 More typically, mother bears teach their cubs that most campers and hikers 
will abandon their food when the animals come around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen little cubs do this little bluff charge," Stafford said. "Their 
whole thing is a show." 
</P>
<P>
 The bears are attracted by the faintest of odors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone opens up a can of sardines, and it's like waving a red flag in front 
of a bull," said Armand Denis, co-owner of a store at the forest's Crystal Lake 
recreation area. "They can smell it a mile away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bears eat almost anything, including whole, unchewed cantaloupes, entire 
yellow jackets' nests and large kitchen sponges, according to reports by state 
biologists. A black bear once broke into Denis' truck to drink the 
sweet-tasting antifreeze, and another ate 40 pounds of dog food from a Forest 
Service garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials offer these tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Never feed a bear. Once a bear gets food from someone, it will associate all 
humans with food. When a bear loses its natural fear of people, it may become 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the campground neat. Bears are attracted to garbage, pet food and 
anything smelly or edible. Don't leave uncleaned cooking utensils in camp. Even 
the clothes worn while cooking should be put away. Store garbage neatly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store food and toiletries. While camping, keep food and toiletries in a car 
trunk or suspend them from a tree limb. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not run from a bear. If you see a bear, yell, whistle or honk your car 
horn. Back away slowly if it does not retreat. Running provokes a bear to 
chase.

SOUTH BAY; SATELLITES TO TRACK LANDSLIDE MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes, a bluff-top community plagued by landslides, has turned 
to satellite technology to measure how much the Earth's surface is moving. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday the city began surveying 58 sites inside the 1,100-acre landslide 
area in which building has been restricted since 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials are working with the Torrance office of electronics company 
Leica Inc. to utilized the Global Positioning System, 24 satellites that relay 
navigational signals to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 An antenna at each of the 58 sites will provide the satellites with readouts 
on their latitude and longitude. By tracking changes in those coordinates over 
time, the city hopes to get a more accurate projection of where slides will 
occur and what can be done to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 For $15,000 this year -- the same amount Rancho Palos Verdes has paid county 
surveyors to annually monitor 18 sites -- the city will receive quarterly 
readouts on the landslide area's movement, said Trent Pulliam, the city's 
director of public works. Movement also can be measured during and after 
landslide prevention measures, such as grading, to test their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's high-tech for a 100,000-year-old landslide," said Councilman Lee Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, road construction triggered the 270-acre Portuguese Bend landslide, 
destroying at least 102 homes. Creeping earth has damaged or destroyed nearly 
100 more homes since then. In 1978, after another slide, the city created the 
1,100-acre building moratorium area near Palos Verdes Drive South. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say 130 acres of land in the moratorium area near upper Narcissa Drive 
has not moved as a result of landslides in hundreds of thousand years, and area 
homeowners there would like to expand or modify their homes. The area also 
contains about 40 vacant lots that some would like to see developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County developer Barry Hon, who owns another 427 acres within the 
moratorium area, is considering developing a golf course and up to 50 homes, 
said spokesman Michael Mohler. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk of lifting parts of the moratorium met with opposition in the past. 
Although the satellite readings alone will not prove that swaths of land are 
stable enough to support homes and golf courses, Byrd said, he hopes they will 
inject some facts into an often emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew Sargent, a local environmentalist, said the satellite readings will 
not provide city officials with any new information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The land is moving. We know it's moving," Sargent said. "This is going to 
confirm it's moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent added that the effects of anti-landslide measures, which include wells 
to remove ground water and prevent the earth from become wet and slippery, may 
not be felt immediately. He suggested that building only be allowed on land 
that has not moved in at least 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 County surveyors have tracked the land movement since 1956, and the city has 
informally tracked 18 sites over the past two years with the satellite system 
to test the technology's accuracy. But Byrd said this will be the city's first 
comprehensive use of the system, which originally was designed to help the 
military move troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Landslide readings will have a minuscule margin of error: 3 millimeters, 
approximately 3/25 of an inch, said Charles Abbott, president of Charles Abbott 
Associates, which contracts with the city for engineering services.

 With Big Trip Nearing, Beverly Hills Gets an Early Start on Football Season 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having to practice in 90-degree heat, nearly 80 football players 
showed up Monday for two-a-day practices at Beverly Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Although organized practice officially begins Thursday for other Southern 
Section teams, the Normans began a week ahead of schedule because they have 
been invited to play in the Shawn Akina Memorial Classic in Honolulu, where 
they will play Chugiak High of Alaska on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally we get around 60 players," Beverly Hills Coach Carter Paysinger 
said. "Eighty football players. That's pretty high for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans return 39 varsity lettermen, including 19 starters, from last 
season's 2-8 team. The sophomore team went undefeated and won the Ocean League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Dick Schreiber said that players who participated in spring 
and summer workouts and new students are eligible to make the trip to Hawaii. 
He estimates about 60 players will go. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to make a commitment to the team," Schreiber said. "We're not taking 
players who are coming out just to join the bandwagon (to Hawaii)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica College sophomore quarterback Jorge Blanco, who passed for 1,637 
yards and 14 touchdowns last season, spent the summer working in the weight 
room and the results are evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's made so much improvement we don't believe he's the same player," 
first-year Coach Robert Taylor said. "We asked him to get physically stronger 
and he is. We asked to work on his passing game and he did that. He has really 
blossomed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs, who finished 3-6-1 in 1993, are scheduled to began practice 
today.

BETTY BALLARD; UNION LEADER SOUGHT EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Ballard, union leader who worked successfully for equal wages for women 
and family leave, has died at age 51. 
</P>
<P>
 She died Friday of cancer in Los Angeles, union spokesman David Miller said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Ballard had served as president of Local 3090 of the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ms. Ballard was credited with advancing wage and benefit provisions 
for men and women, she campaigned most strenuously for family leave, workplace 
child care and equal pay for women performing the same or comparable work as 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Ballard negotiated a 1985 pay equity agreement that narrowed a historical 
pay gap between male and female city workers, and negotiated agreements on 
family leave and child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Ballard is survived by a daughter, DeLonda Lewis; a son, Troy Smith; four 
sisters and a brother, and one grandson.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOS-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; RESCUER PAYS HIGH PRICE BUT 
HAS NO REGRETS 
</P>

 The saying that no good deed goes unpunished may seem to apply to James A. 
Clark, the man who broke his wrist when he came to the aid of a California 
Highway Patrol officer as she struggled with a suspect over her gun. But that's 
not the way he sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that people need help," said Clark, 41, who was injured when he 
slipped and fell during the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury prevented the unemployed Clark from taking a job with the U.S. 
Postal Service the following week, he said. "I believe everyone has a mission 
in life, maybe this was mine." 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Aug. 1, just after 8 a.m., Clark was headed north on the 
Antelope Valley Freeway driving a limousine for a friend who had offered him a 
one-trip job. He had dropped off a client at Burbank Airport and was on his way 
home to Lancaster when he saw CHP Officer Amy Bonilla struggling with a man 
later identified as Ronald A. Coleman, 33, of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was punching Bonilla in the face while trying to wrench her gun out of 
her hands, authorities said. Clark stopped the limo about 80 feet past the 
scene and ran back to Bonilla's aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other motorists -- including two off-duty Burbank police officers -- also 
stopped. But for a few crucial seconds Clark was the only one who could reach 
Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw he was pounding on her, pounding on her face. I thought he was going to 
kill her," said Clark, who has a brown belt in tae kwon do. So, he put a 
chokehold on the man and pulled him off Bonilla. But then he slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was falling back, I was thinking I should get up as fast as I can," 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Clark thought he was the only one who had stopped. But three 
other motorists -- two brothers who run a helicopter parts company and an auto 
glass installer -- reached the scene a few seconds later and subdued Coleman 
with the help of the two off-duty officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Clark thought his right wrist was only sprained, but later found out 
it was broken so severely that it may have cut off the needed blood flow into 
the bone. His cast may have to stay on for as long as six months, doctors have 
told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The post office called the day after that," Clark said. All he needed to do 
to get a job as a night clerk was pass a physical. Postal officials have told 
him they may try to hold the job open for him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping in to balance the scales when someone is being victimized is 
something Clark has done since he was a boy in San Fernando, relatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Once while driving through Lancaster with his wife, Elisa, Clark saw a man 
roughly pulling a woman out of a car. He broke up the confrontation to find out 
what it was about. It was a marital dispute. Satisfied, Clark left, but his 
wife was upset that he had intervened so quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 Stepping into disputes used to be Clark's job. He worked for three years as a 
bouncer at O'Hara's Cantina in Lancaster. He quit in May after five patrons 
jumped him during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his 6-foot, 5-inch, 220-pound frame can make him seem intimidating, 
Clark said he prefers to talk his way out of a fight. "It's not that I like to 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's good with people," said Alberto Lucera, a manager at O'Hara's. "He can 
handle things before they get too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's wife was not in the least surprised about her husband's action. "He's 
always doing this sort of thing," she said Monday after Clark and the other 
motorists who came to Bonilla's aid were given CHP commendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we know when someone does something good it gets recognized," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a hero," he said, although the CHP has dubbed him one. To Clark, a 
real hero is his 24-year-old son, Anthony, who fought in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite his broken wrist, Clark said he has no regrets about stopping to 
help the CHP officer. "Oh, no, I'd do it again," he said. "I'd be more than 
happy to."

 Jenny Thompson, the bionic woman of American swimming with a plate and seven 
screws holding her left arm together, scored her second victory Wednesday in 
the National Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson won the 100-meter butterfly in 1 minute 0.34 seconds, catching 
runner-up Amy Van Dyken just before the finish with a final split of 32.04 
seconds.Van Dyken was second in 1:00.57. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really nervous coming into this meet. I didn't know what to expect," 
said Thompson, who had surgery June 3 to repair the arm she broke while riding 
a waterslide on the Stanford campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's competition, Chad Carvin and Seth van Neerden recorded their second 
victories in the competition, used this year to select the U.S. team that will 
participate in next month's World Championships at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli King-Bednar won the other event, completing the 100 backstroke in 
1:10.46. 
</P>
<P>
 Carvin, who set American records while winning the 500- and 1,650-yard 
freestyle events for Arizona in this year's NCAA meet, had a personal best of 
3:49.83 in winning the 400 freestyle. He also won the 200 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Neerden, the 26-year-old from Wilmington, Del., who swims for the Ft. 
Lauderdale Swim Team, added the 200 breaststroke title to his 100 breaststroke 
victory earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Neerden won in 2:13.27, the fastest time in the world this year.

SOCCER; U.S. WOMEN WIN EASILY, EVEN WHEN IT GETS ROUGH

 Mia Hamm scored four goals as the U.S. women's national soccer team trounced 
Trinidad & Tobago, 11-1, in Montreal Wednesday night in a regional qualifying 
match for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Championship in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a rough affair in which three players and Tony DiCicco, the U.S. 
assistant coach, were ejected. Afterward, DiCicco blamed Jamaican referee 
Charles Barrett for allowing the game to get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a frustrating game," DiCicco said. "It just got more and more 
nasty as the game wore on. The official was totally oblivious to what was going 
on out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids never retaliated. They were angry, (so) they didn't want to stop 
scoring on them. They felt they were hitting us with cheap shots. The referee 
never took control of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States opened the scoring in the fourth minute on a right-foot shot 
by Hamm off a pass from Tisha Venturini and was ahead, 5-0, after 34 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinidad & Tobago then entered the record books by scoring the first goal 
against the United States in world championship qualifying play when Delia 
DeSilva beat goalkeeper Briana Scurry. In the first CONCACAF tournament in 
Haiti in 1991, the Americans outscored their opponents, 49-0, and had scored 14 
goals without reply in Montreal before DeSilva's strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second half, DeSilva took a swing at U.S. winger Carin 
Gabarra and a brawl erupted. Trinidad & Tobago defender Margaret Andem had been 
red-carded in the first half, and DeSilva and U.S. defender Thori Staples were 
ejected after the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 DiCicco was tossed out shortly afterward for letting the referee know what he 
thought of him in a rather colorful way. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team also got two goals apiece from Gabarra and Venturini and one 
each from Michelle Akers-Stahl, Christine Lilly and Amanda Cromwell.

 Thousand Oaks took another step toward the Little League World Series 
13-and-under baseball title Wednesday night with a 10-4 victory over 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory puts Thousand Oaks (16-2) in the semifinals of the winners' 
bracket of the double-elimination tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight Thousand Oaks faces Hamilton, Ohio, which defeated Surrey, British 
Columbia, 5-4, in Wednesday night's other game. The winner moves into the 
championship round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got some timely hitting today," said Craig Frazier, Thousand Oaks manager. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the qualifying tournament, we've had close games the whole way. 
It's nice to be able to relax a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks catcher Doug Hutton went two for three with three runs batted in 
and threw out a runner attempting to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton's two-out single in the first inning scored two runs -- one on the hit 
and another on a throwing error by Florida third baseman Derrick Nunley.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks added three runs in the second with the help of two wild pitches 
by Jacksonville pitcher Brett Myers and put the game away with three more runs 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks right fielder Wes Munyon hammered the first pitch he saw in the 
fourth inning to the deepest part of Sheridan Municipal Field, bouncing the 
ball off the facing of the 360-foot marker in dead center field for a double, 
driving home two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched (Myers) warm up, and we knew he had a good fastball and curve," 
Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited for his fastball and adjusted for the curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks added two runs in the fifth and shook off a two-run Florida 
uprising in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the first of the tournament for Florida (17-3) and relegated 
Jacksonville to the losers' bracket and an afternoon game today against 
Matamoros, Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks beat Puerto Rico, 3-0, Monday in the first round on a combined 
one-hitter by Chris Strauser and Kevin Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauser pitched five innings Wednesday night, giving up one run and four 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The run came on a solo home run by Myers, who was four for four. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got here, I just wanted the kids to be competitive and have a good 
time," said Frazier.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think we're capable of winning the championship. We're right there."  
</P>
<P>
 In the Wednesday afternoon game, the Latin American team from Matamoros, 
Mexico, defeated the European team from Kaiserslautern, Germany, 4-3, in 10 
innings on a single by Andrei Briones with none out and a runner on third.  
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Jimenez pitched all 10 innings for Mexico, giving up eight hits and 
three runs while striking out nine.  
</P>
<P>
 The European team is a collection of children of American service personnel at 
military bases in Germany.

LIVING HER LIFE HAS MADE BELL REALIZE THAT POOL IS JUST A GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Bell of Garden Grove has overcome so many of life's challenges that the 
fear of failure rarely enters her mind when she is playing pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, ranked third on the Women's Professional Billiards tour, reflected about 
her life while her opponent Ewa Mataya cleared the table in the first game of 
the $50,000 Gordon's 9-Ball Championship Saturday in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Mataya, the tour's eighth-ranked player, sank the one-ball, then the two and 
three with the accuracy of a marksman. As the balls traveled across the green 
felt table and disappeared in the pockets, Mataya presented an obstacle that 
would overwhelm most opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, 38, the mother of three, overcame a three-year heroin addiction and has 
maintained 18 years of sobriety. She has remained one of billiard's top players 
despite mourning the loss of her mother, who died of cancer in March. 
</P>
<P>
 At Gotham Hall on the Third Street Promenade, Mataya offered Bell a challenge, 
but nothing compared to life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a check of my heart and my motives," Bell said. "Am I here to use my 
God-given talents or am I here for the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Money certainly was an issue. First prize was $20,000, the most ever offered 
for a women's professional billiards tournament. A cardboard replica of the 
$20,000 check stood near the main table and served as reminder to contestants 
who are starved for financial rewards and recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-ball is played with a cue ball and nine object balls, which are racked in 
a diamond configuration. After the break, players must hit the lowest numbered 
ball on the table first during each shot. The object is to knock in the 
nine-ball as a result of a combination, carom, or in a sequence after the other 
balls have been pocketed in the rotation. The championship match concludes when 
a player wins seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 During the final, Mataya cleared the table a second time to take a commanding 
two-game lead before Bell took her first shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get out of my seat," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an impressionable teen-ager, Bell rarely remained seated. Raised by her 
mother, a 12-year-old Bell was boy crazy and used to play pinball at 
Westminster Family Billiards, down the street from her house. When her older 
male friends changed hobbies to pool, Bell took her cue and followed them. 
</P>
<P>
 She quickly discovered she had a natural talent and became addicted. She was 
California women's champion in 1972, 1973, and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Her addiction, however, was not limited to pool. Trying to impress her other 
friends -- the ones who didn't hang out at the pool hall -- Bell started using 
pot when she was 14. Soon, pills replaced pot and heroin replaced pills as her 
drug of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was 20, Bell had a three-year addiction to heroin. She also 
was an unwed mother of an infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used and abused every drug I could get my hands on," Bell said. "Once I got 
to heroin, it was my drug of choice. I played pool and gambled to support my 
habit." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Bell sought guidance in a church-sponsored home called Harvest House 
in Santa Ana. It became her home for a 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt empty and miserable," she said. "I cried out, 'God, if you're real, 
help me!' " 
</P>
<P>
 A born-again Christian, Bell has remained sober for 18 years. After a 
five-year break, Bell returned to playing pool and won her first professional 
title -- The Miller Lite Championships in Las Vegas -- in 1984. She's also a 
two-time Women's Pool and Billiards Assn. world champion, winning consecutive 
titles in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Bell had a banner year, winning tournaments in Tucson, Boston and 
Riverside. She won more than $48,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's professional career continued uninterrupted until 1994. While competing 
in the 1993 World Championships in Germany last December, Bell was informed 
that her mother had vaginal cancer and was undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't talk to my mom so I called my sister," Bell said. "She told me 
that mom was going to be OK and not to worry. She lied to avoid distracting 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell missed the first two stops of the 1994 tour to remain with her mother 
until she passed away on March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't understand what dying meant," she said. "Her body just shut down. It 
was a very emotional time for me, but I felt I had to be strong for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after her mother's death, Bell returned to the tour to escape her 
emotional loss. She won the St. Croix Press San Diego Classic in her 1994 
debut. It was a tearful victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reality hit me because she wasn't there," Bell said. "Every time I would win, 
I used to call her. I miss her very much." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an emotional time not only for Bell, but for her opponents who shared 
her grieving. As she approached the victory stand, Bell's friends and fans 
began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up there and I started crying," she said. " 'Mom this one is for you. I 
really love you." 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting her turn to shoot, Bell's memories of her mother were 
interrupted by a gasp from the audience at Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
 Mataya made a bad shot trying to position the cue ball away from the two. Bell 
was given an opening to start playing and she eventually won her first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, however, did not have her rhythm and game four proved to be pivotal. The 
two women each made their share of shots until three balls were left. Bell sank 
the seven and eight, but left herself in poor position to make the nine. She 
tried to leave the cue ball as far away from the nine as possible, but was 
short with her shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mataya had a chance to sink the nine, but accidentally touched the cue ball 
while lining up her shot. That mistake cost Mataya the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell won five of the next six games and the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 When she is not competing on the tour, Bell spends time at her Garden Grove 
home with her children. She also runs a pro shop at Danny K's Cafe and 
Billiards in Orange where she gives private one-hour lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think pool is beginning to take off because people think it's fun and a 
great way to socialize," Bell said. "Pool halls are one of the few places where 
you can take a date and talk. You can't talk at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there are so many rooms opening up. Some really nice ones."

 PICTURE PERFECT: Huntington Beach author Elizabeth George received an 
unexpected bonus in People magazine this week: Not only did her latest British 
mystery, "Playing for the Ashes," get a rave review ("an infinitely engrossing 
story"), her photo ran with the story. . . . George's reaction: "I'm sure every 
single thing positive about a novel helps its sales." She's on vacation in Big 
Sur and hasn't seen the magazine yet: "I'll drive up Highway 1 and see if I can 
find a store." 
</P>
<P>
 HELPING MEDIA: The Denise Huber murder case continues to grab media interest. 
TV tabloid shows like "Hard Copy," "America's Most Wanted" and "Inside Edition" 
have lined up to interview the Huber family of Newport Beach. . . . Unlike some 
in the O.J. Simpson murder case who were paid for tabloid TV interviews, the 
Hubers are not accepting money for their comments. The family explains that 
these shows had shown interest when Denise Huber disappeared.

 DUELING GUITARS: Men still dominate the charts in country music, but Coto de 
Caza is delighted it signed two of the top women in the business for its annual 
CotoFest on Saturday. Juice Newton (above) and Carlene Carter, who both play 
guitar (OC Live! Page 6) will headline the charity event. They're not on until 
dusk, but other live music and dancing starts at 2 p.m. at the Coto de Caza 
Equestrian Center. The eight-hour event is $25. 
</P>
<P>
 THREE-LEGGED STAR: Cheryl Saremi of Orange was desperate to find a home for 
Jezebel, the three-legged cat owned by a neighbor who was moving to Florida. A 
co-worker of Saremi's saw a sign put up by Dale Hilbert of Tustin, looking for 
his three-legged cat. Saremi called him: Would he mind taking this three-legged 
cat as a replacement? Unfortunately, Hilbert had already gone to an animal 
shelter to get a replacement cat. Fortunately, Hilbert has a soft spot for 
three-legged cats: This week, he took in Jezebel anyway.

 HOMELESS: Candles will be lit, and the names of the dead may be read -- there 
won't be a dry eye in Santa Clarita Saturday night as the homeless are honored. 
Well, maybe a few dry eyes. This is a vigil for animals, not for people, which 
has raised some questions. . . . It's part of Homeless Animals Day. The idea is 
to encourage people to get their animals spayed or neutered (B16). 
</P>
<P>
 PLAY BALL: The Dodgers' Mike Piazza and Eric Karros will play some ball 
Friday. But it'll be OK with the union because they'll face a championship 
Santa Clarita fast-pitch softball team of 9- to 10-year-old girls. . . . Still, 
they could be embarrassed. "We don't think the professionals will get a bat on 
the ball," says Greg Owen, whose daughter, Erika, plays for the team. The event 
was put together by a local radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE'S ARMED: Dot Jones (above) of North Hollywood knows how to throw her 
weight around. Jones, at 233 pounds, has won 11 consecutive heavyweight world 
arm wrestling titles. . . . But she has consistently beaten women over 300 
pounds. "There's also a lot of strategy and technique involved," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 MAKING UP: Bobcat may do some time . . . on TV, that is. Comedian Bobcat 
Goldthwait has agreed to record a 15-second public service announcement as part 
of a settlement to take care of charges filed by the city of Burbank that he 
set his chair on fire in May during "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." The court 
still has to approve the deal. . . . The message would promote the Alisa Ann 
Ruch Burn Foundation in Canoga Park (B3). 
</P>
<P>
 TEAM EFFORT: Pooling their resources is nothing new for Harry Pantelas, 57, 
and his colleagues. They belong to the Friends of Pierce Pool, which raised 
about $10,000 last year to reopen the Woodland Hills facility. . . . Later this 
month (B3), they'll swim laps as part of a fund-raiser to upgrade the pool. "It 
means a great deal to me and a lot of people," says Pantelas. Michael Arkush

CITY HALL NEWS; COVINA; ANTI-TAX COUNCIL MOVES TOWARD FIRE FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Covina City Council members, who helped recall the entire previous council 
last year for implementing a utility tax, took the first step Tuesday toward 
enacting a fire assessment fee that would cost the average homeowner nearly 
twice as much as that tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Mayor Thomas O'Leary, a leader in last July's successful recall effort, 
the council in a 3-2 vote approved an engineer's report outlining a proposed 
Fire Suppression Assessment District to pay for the Fire Department. The 
council also directed that a public hearing be held on the issue in the next 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council gives final approval to the assessment after the hearing, the 
average homeowner would pay $265 a year -- about $23 a month -- compared to an 
average of $12.60 under the 6% utility tax rescinded last winter, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fire assessment district is the best way for this city to keep up the 
quality of service in our Fire Department," O'Leary said. "This city must by 
next July come up with a way to maintain services." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of their former allies in the anti-tax movement, O'Leary 
and council members Linda Sarver and Thomas Falls voted to proceed with the 
required public hearing. Councilmen John Wilcox and Chris Christiansen 
dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.5 million that would be generated by the assessment would allow funds 
going to fire services to be used to shore up the ailing budget of the city, 
whose reserves have been depleted since the city abandoned the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's deja vu . It's just another tax and this time it's going to cost a lot 
of us twice as much," said Hank Vagt, a leader of last year's recall whose 
group helped elect O'Leary, Sarver and Falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Vagt and others in the city's various anti-tax groups, who gave momentum to 
last year's successful recall of all five council members, say this council is 
moving toward getting recalled itself if it does not cut the city budget or 
tries to implement any increase in taxes or fees without the approval of 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Leary said he supports a fire assessment because -- unlike a utility tax 
-- it requires the public's input before it can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, if the owners of more than 10% of Covina's property object to 
the assessment, the council must put the issue on the ballot. The law also says 
the city must abandon the idea if owners of more than 50% of the property 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary also said that unlike the previous council, this council -- under his 
leadership -- is holding numerous town hall meetings and public hearings to 
discuss all the options for rescuing the financially troubled city. The options 
include a utility tax -- favored by supporters of the former council -- and 
allowing the city's first card club. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two weeks ago, O'Leary, Christiansen and Falls voted not to put 
either a utility tax or a card club on the November ballot, moving the city 
instead toward a fire assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vagt said many of Covina's largest property owners have already told him they 
will object to the fire assessment. "We've stopped a landscape and lighting 
assessment district before a few years back and we'll stop this," Vagt said.

 ARCADIA: Beginning next week, City Hall will extend its hours Monday through 
Thursday and close on alternate Fridays, beginning Sept. 2. The new hours 
Monday through Thursday will be 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The City Council 
approved the change to comply with the regional air quality board requirements 
to reduce employees' vehicle trips.On the Fridays that City Hall is open, the 
hours will be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: After seven months as interim city manager, William Kelly has been 
appointed permanently to the $86,000-a-year position. The appointment came on a 
unanimous vote of the council. Kelly replaces Donald Duckworth, who resigned 
amid controversy that he was not following council directives. 
</P>
<P>
 BRADBURY: Council members have hired David D. Meyer as city planner and Dan W. 
Hell as city engineer on a contract basis at a combined cost of $1,600 a month 
to help its staff of three full-time employees. The 839-resident city has a 
city manager, a city clerk and an administrative aide. It also has a contract 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 DUARTE: The City Council again has voted to withdraw a November ballot measure 
that would have allowed voters to decide whether to implement a 3% utility tax. 
The council took the action because the county clerk's office required a 
written resolution. Last month's vote -- reversing a June resolution to place 
the tax on the ballot -- was taken without its being placed on the council's 
formal agenda. Leaders of the Duarte Taxpayers Group called that vote a 
violation of the state's open meetings law and have vowed to recall the council 
if it implements the tax without the approval of voters.

Bar, at 1912 Foothill Blvd., are sponsoring a festival, cooking contest and 5K 
run Saturday to raise money for a proposed Leigh's Center at UC San Diego 
Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50,000 treatment, education and research center would be the first of its 
kind, Greenlee said. "The government hasn't granted any money for research 
because they said not enough kids were dying from it," she said. "It's an 
orphan disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh's syndrome is a genetic disease that quickly degenerates the central 
nervous system and causes loss of motor control and breathing control, 
retardation, brain seizures and dementia. It strikes one child in 50,000, with 
500 to 1,000 diagnosed cases in the United States, said Denine Hagen, a UCSD 
spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 Greenlee said she first became aware of Cory's disorder when he was 9 weeks 
old. "I went into his room in the middle of the night to feed him, and he 
wasn't breathing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Cory not been revived that evening, doctors told Greenlee, they would have 
incorrectly diagnosed the problem as sudden infant death syndrome. "I wonder 
how many of those children with SIDS really died from Leigh's syndrome?" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili's manager, Nora Lang, decided to sponsor an event for the center after 
she heard that Greenlee had walked 30 miles -- through the San Gabriel Valley 
-- on each of Cory's last two birthdays, raising a total of $31,000. "We wanted 
to help out," said Deborah Torti, a Chili's employee who helped organize the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, seven people have signed up for the chili cooking contest and 75 
people have registered for the 5K run, but organizers expect more people to 
register on the day of the festival. Runners will pay a $10 registration fee 
($15 if they want a Chili's T-shirt), and cooking contestants will be charged a 
$30 registration fee. All proceeds will go toward starting up the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes Cory asks me if I can go with him when he dies," Greenlee said. 
"But I tell him I have to stay and take care of his sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenlee's 8-year-old daughter, Erika, also has a 50% chance of developing 
Leigh's syndrome by the time she is an adolescent, doctors have told Greenlee. 
</P>
<P>
 She is determined to see the Leigh's syndrome center opened. 
</P>
<P>
 In a steady voice, she said, "I refuse to stand at his grave site and ask 
myself, 'What else could I have done?' "

PASADENA COUNCIL DELIBERATES CITY ATTORNEY'S FATE; POLITICS: SPECIAL SESSION 
WAS CALLED TO CONSIDER RESIGNATION OF VICTOR KALETA. INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT 
HE HAD DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FEMALE ATTORNEYS IN HIS OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Pasadena City Council was to have met in special session Wednesday night 
to consider the resignation of City Atty. Victor Kaleta, who has come under 
fire recently because of an investigation that found he discriminated against 
female attorneys in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 While no council action had been taken at press time for this edition, 
officials at City Hall said they expected Kaleta and lawmakers to reach 
agreement on the terms of his departure from the $117,500-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what is occurring is a meeting to discuss the terms of his 
separation from the city. If that is worked out, he will resign," said 
Councilman William E. Thomson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta's future with the city was all but decided Friday, when Mayor Kathryn 
Nack called for his resignation in a speech to the National Women's Political 
Caucus in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Nack's comments were a reversal of her previous support for Kaleta and created 
a 4-3 council majority in favor of his resignation. Last month, Nack's support 
allowed Kaleta to survive a "no confidence" vote by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the majority of the council, including the mayor, feel it's time for 
a change of city attorney," said Councilman Rick Cole, who supports keeping 
Kaleta, 56, on the job.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta, who has been with the city attorney's office 17 years and has been at 
its helm since 1984, refused to say whether he will resign. "It's not something 
I wish to comment on right now," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials said Kaleta's departure was a certainty. Several 
officials, for example, said that Kaleta and two officials representing the 
city met Tuesday to hammer out the terms of his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nack said her decision to join Councilmen Bill Crowfoot, Chris Holden and 
Isaac Richard in calling for Kaleta to step down was a matter of principle. "I 
was left as the swing vote on the council and I decided the time had come for 
me on this issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her speech came two days after the local chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People called for Kaleta to resign or be fired from his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta is not guaranteed a severance package because he has no contract, but 
he may be entitled to retirement benefits. However, the council was expected to 
give him some severance in recognition of his years with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Kaleta, City Manager Phil Hawkey and Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol 
all have come under criticism from council members and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey has been blamed for incomplete staff reports, the city's disappointing 
World Cup soccer festival and alleged problems with affirmative action hiring 
and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pekerol is under investigation by the city's Public Safety Committee after 
Cal-OSHA issued eight safety citations against his department last month. Among 
other things, the department was cited for a lack of training on handling 
hazardous materials in the workplace and because firefighters battling last 
fall's devastating Altadena wildfires did not have so-called fire shields, 
which are flame-retardant blankets of aluminum and fiberglass. The shields, 
Pekerol said, were in storage but were not issued, largely because a city 
committee had not approved their use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pasadena has slipped into a state of mediocrity. More heads could roll if we 
get the votes, like with Kaleta," said Councilman Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cole said he doubts there will be other changes in management at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kaleta controversy stems from an April 14 report by a work-conflict 
consultant hired by the city's affirmative action office. The consultant's 
investigation found female attorneys in the civil branch of the city attorney's 
office suffered discrimination in promotions, salaries and fringe benefits, 
particularly since a 1992 reorganization. The probe was ordered by Kaleta and 
the city's affirmative action director after a female staffer wrote a memo 
complaining about disparate treatment for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the report, all four female attorneys have filed formal claims of gender 
discrimination with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing and the 
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous interviews, Kaleta has denied discriminating against female 
lawyers in his office. He has said the 1992 reorganization was approved by the 
council and that his office met affirmative action guidelines for hiring women 
and minorities. But he acknowledged that the reorganization did leave the 
impression of inequity because two male attorneys won promotions after 
threatening to resign. And those promotions may not have been properly 
explained to female attorneys in the office, Kaleta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a council majority -- Nack, Cole, Paparian and Thomson -- voted to 
give Kaleta six months to address the problems in his office rather than join a 
"no confidence" vote by Crowfoot, Holden and Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council issued other directives: The city attorney's office 
policies would be reviewed by a consultant, one female attorney would be 
promoted and Kaleta would no longer serve as city prosecutor. One unidentified 
employee was disciplined for a role in promoting the two male attorneys.  
</P>
<P>
 But last Friday, Nack criticized the council's earlier action as "too little, 
too late" and she accused the male councilmen of ignoring the female attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard praised Nack's speech. "It was the right place to tackle the issue," 
he said. "Katie had misgivings about Kaleta all along. . . . When it became 
apparent the public thought it was wrong to keep him on, she came around."

GOP FRONT-RUNNERS TRADE JABS IN HEATED RACE FOR STATE SENATE; POLITICS: 
TENSIONS RISE AS RICHARD L. MOUNTJOY, GARY G. MILLER AND PAUL HORCHER LEAD A 
PACK OF 29TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES IN THE SEPT. 13 ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With three area Republican officeholders viewed as the front-runners, tensions 
are rising and the mud is starting to fly in a special election campaign for 
the state Senate's 29th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the candidates, Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), recently 
called GOP challenger Gary G. Miller a liar. Miller, a Diamond Bar councilman, 
responded that Mountjoy should quit his crying. 
</P>
<P>
 The third prominent GOP candidate, Assemblyman Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar, is 
portraying Mountjoy as a political turncoat who helped elect Democrat Willie 
Brown of San Francisco as speaker of the Assembly more than a decade ago. And 
Horcher has declared that Miller is unfit for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, Miller and Horcher are among seven candidates vying in the Sept. 13 
election to fill the remaining two years of the term of the district's former 
senator, Republican Frank Hill, who resigned in early July after a federal jury 
found him guilty of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth Republican, Edward D. Ortell, also is running, but so far has raised 
little money. The sole Democratic candidate is Sandra K. Hester, who lost to 
Hill in 1992. Additionally, two minor party candidates, Libertarian Matthew J. 
Piazza and Walter R. Sheasby III of the Green Party, are on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in September's election, 
the top finishers from each party will square off in a runoff Nov. 8. Given the 
strengths of Mountjoy, Miller and Horcher, most observers predict a runoff will 
be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29th Senate District includes parts of Arcadia, Bradbury, Claremont, 
Covina, Diamond Bar, Duarte, Glendora, Hacienda Heights, Industry, La Canada 
Flintridge, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, La Puente, La Verne, Monrovia, Pomona, 
Rowland Heights, San Dimas, Sierra Madre, Temple City, Walnut, West Covina and 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican is expected to win the seat because the district's voter 
registration is 46% Republican and 42% Democrat. But a bloodletting among the 
GOP front-runners could leave a weakened survivor and create an opportunity for 
Hester. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinarily, that's a district the Democrats would forget about," said Joe 
Cerrell, a veteran political consultant. "But if these guys all kill each 
other, (some Republicans) will vote Hester" in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that prospect, Mountjoy, Horcher and Miller have not hesitated from 
trading rhetorical punches. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaign literature, Horcher has attacked Mountjoy as a member of the 
old-boy network; he blames him for casting the deciding vote that made Brown 
the Assembly's most powerful member in 1980 in the culmination of a fight among 
Democrats for the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy dismisses Horcher's attack, saying he voted for Brown, as did other 
Republicans, because he was preferable to his challenger, Howard Berman, who is 
now in Congress. Mountjoy added that he stands by his conservative credentials, 
which include being a force behind Proposition 187, a measure which would cut 
medical and other benefits for illegal immigrants if approved by voters in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher sent out another mailer in which he called Miller a phony for 
presenting himself as an ethical candidate when he had to pay a $6,000 fine to 
the State Fair Political Practices Commission. Miller, who lost a bid for state 
Senate in 1990, failed to promptly report $260,000 in personal loans to his 
campaign, an FPPC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he did not promptly report the campaign loans in 1990 because he 
misunderstood campaign reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, meanwhile, has attacked Miller, accusing him of hiring a firm to 
phone constituents and tell them, under the guise of a survey, that the 
assemblyman supported a 37% pay raise for legislators. Mountjoy said he opposes 
the raise, which takes effect Jan. 1, and will donate the extra money to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's just a liar," Mountjoy said of Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller denied that his campaign was responsible for such calls to 
constituents. "It seems I have Dick Mountjoy crying about everything right 
now," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is making an issue of the pay raise, however, saying the lawmakers do 
not deserve it and that he will not accept it if elected. His campaign 
literature attacking the pay raise does not mention Mountjoy or Horcher, but 
Miller said he blames them for not moving quickly on legislation to keep it 
from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, who once declined to address the issue, now says he opposes the raise 
and will donate a portion of the money he receives to the financially strapped 
Los Angeles County Library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy and Horcher have an advantage in terms of name recognition among 
voters. Mountjoy's 59th Assembly District, which he has represented since 1978, 
covers the northern half of the 29th Senate District. Horcher's 60th Assembly 
District covers the other half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller also has a solid base to run for higher office, having served on 
the Diamond Bar City Council since 1989. And as of July 30, Miller had the 
largest war chest with $176,000, all but $1,000 of which came in a loan from 
his wife, according to his campaign disclosure statement. He and his wife, 
Cathleen, own a real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher was next with $21,224, while Mountjoy reported raising $15,354. Hester 
reported raising about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, a former aide to Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park), is hoping 
that voters who decline to state a party affiliation -- about 10% of those in 
the district -- will support her. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (voters) are looking for a change," Hester said. "I offer them 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot are Libertarian Matthew J. Piazza and Green Party candidate 
Walter R. Sheasby III.

TOPICS / EDUCATION; CAMPERS TO CONFRONT PREJUDICES; WEEKLONG RETREAT PROMOTES 
TOLERANCE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. ABOUT 100 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO 
ATTEND. 
</P>

 Ana Viruetta, a 16-year-old Latina, is not the sort of student usually 
targeted by the Brotherhood/Sister Camp. After all, she says, she is 
open-minded and accepting of all types of people, no matter their race, gender 
or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Azusa High School senior will be among 100 students from Southern 
California at the weeklong camp beginning Saturday designed to encourage high 
school students to admit, confront and change racist, sexist or homophobic 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be difficult to entice students with deep-seated prejudices, said camp 
spokesman Jerry Freedman Habush so a fair number will be open-minded youths 
such as Viruetta. Most who attend learn of the program through school 
counselors, multicultural groups or ethnic studies teachers. Others hear about 
it from friends or through word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not racist, but I want to voice my opinion," Viruetta said. "We're all 
equal, and no one should have different treatment because of who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Wong, a senior from Monterey Park who will also attend the program, said 
she expects to deal with racism as a Chinese American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like it for no one to see differences, but that's impossible," she said. 
In Wong's family, at least, ethnic divisions are not an issue: Her mother is 
dating a Latino man, and her brother's best friend is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racism is not as bad as it could be," Wong said of her experiences. "But even 
I sometimes have preconceived notions about people because of their race." 
</P>
<P>
 At the camp, located north of Yucaipa, students meet in both racially divided 
and racially mixed groups to discuss their prejudices. The program has been 
criticized by some parents for dividing students by race, but Habush said the 
practice is important in learning tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't teach kids to respect someone else's racial and ethnic identity 
until they learn to value their own," he said. "We encourage them to identify 
themselves within a group, so they can feel secure in opening themselves up to 
other groups." 
</P>
<P>
 The $200 program, sponsored by the non-sectarian National Conference of 
Christians and Jews, will be held in the San Bernardino Mountains from Saturday 
through Aug. 26. In most cases, the tuition is split by the schools and public 
or private organizations that sponsor students. Other students pay their own 
tuition or reach some arrangement with organizers if they can establish they 
cannot repay the tuition.

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; FOR BLACK BEARS, SUMMER MEANS FUN; FOOD BROUGHT INTO THE 
MOUNTAINS BY PICNICKERS MAKES THE LIVIN' EASY FOR THE STATE'S 24,000 BEARS. 
LOCK UP THOSE TWINKIES, SAY OFFICIALS. 
</P>

<P>
 Summer is the time city folk head to the Angeles National Forest with their 
Twinkies, hot dogs and potato chips -- and that means party time for black 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
 There are as many as 24,000 black bears in California, one of the highest 
populations ever recorded in the state, said state Department of Fish and Game 
officials. The bears are usually most visible in the summer, prompting state 
officials to issue guidelines on how to avoid them and what to do if the wily 
animals show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've been hungry for four days and they find a bag of Twinkies: Boom. 
They've hit a honey hole," said Bob Stafford, a black bear specialist for the 
fish and game department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear sightings are uncommon in the Angeles forest and foothill communities, 
officials stressed. But bears occasionally wander through campgrounds and 
picnic areas, snatching whole cakes off tables or tearing off car windows like 
banana peels to get to an ice chest. In May, police officers shot a 350-pound 
black bear that wandered from the foothills onto a residential street in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 Black bears rarely attack people, Stafford said. But last year, one mauled a 
12-year-old Fullerton Boy Scout on a camping trip, and another attacked a 
13-year-old boy in the San Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 More typically, mother bears teach their cubs that most campers and hikers 
will abandon their food when the animals come around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen little cubs do this little bluff charge," Stafford said. "Their 
whole thing is a show." 
</P>
<P>
 The bears are attracted by the faintest of odors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone opens up a can of sardines, and it's like waving a red flag in front 
of a bull," said Armand Denis, co-owner of a store at the forest's Crystal Lake 
recreation area. "They can smell it a mile away." 
</P>
<P>
 Bears eat almost anything, including entire yellow jackets' nests and large 
kitchen sponges, according to reports by state biologists.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials offer these tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Never feed a bear. Once a bear gets food from someone, it will associate all 
humans with food. When a bear loses its natural fear of people, it may become 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the campground neat. Bears are attracted to garbage, pet food and 
anything smelly or edible. Don't leave uncleaned cooking utensils in camp.  
</P>
<P>
 * Store food and toiletries. While camping, keep food and toiletries in a car 
trunk or suspend them from a tree limb. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not run from a bear. If you see one, yell, whistle or honk a car horn. 
Back away slowly if it does not retreat. Running provokes a bear to chase.

 CLAREMONT: A man who allegedly robbed a local bank in June turned himself in 
to Ontario police Monday, Claremont police said. On June 24, a man robbed 
Household Bank in the 400 block of North Indian Hill. He approached a teller 
with a demand note, told her that he had a gun and escaped with an undisclosed 
amount of cash. The incident was captured by the bank's surveillance camera. On 
Monday, Richard Raul Campos, 39, walked into an Ontario storefront police 
station and confessed to the crime, police said. When he surrendered, Campos 
was apparently wearing the same multicolored baggy shorts that he was wearing 
when he allegedly robbed the bank.

 COVINA: An unidentified man was shot and killed after an argument at a party 
on the 700 block of Armel Drive early Sunday morning. The man, who had been 
shot once in the chest, was taken to Inter-Community Hospital, where he was 
pronounced dead shortly after the 1:30 a.m. incident. Another man, who 
apparently argued with the victim on the front lawn, pulled out a handgun and 
fired once, sheriff's deputies said. He then fled the scene, deputies said. 
After a search by Covina police, the suspect was spotted at Covina High School. 
Salvador Camarillo,19, was arrested on suspicion of murder, deputies said. He 
was taken to Covina City Jail and authorities recovered a weapon believed to be 
the one used in the shooting.

 MONTEREY PARK: A dispute between a man and his girlfriend ended in a 
murder/suicide Saturday afternoon, sheriff's deputies said. A man shot and 
killed his girlfriend after an argument at the VIP Motel at 2619 North San 
Gabriel Blvd. at about 2 p.m., deputies said. According to witnesses, the 
couple were arguing on the sidewalk in front of the motel when the man pulled 
out a semiautomatic handgun and shot the woman numerous times in the upper 
body, deputies said. The man then walked to his pickup truck and headed north 
on San Gabriel Boulevard. When authorities followed the man, he stopped his 
truck in the middle of the 500 block of Gladys Avenue. And when sheriff's 
deputies ordered him out of the truck, the man put a gun to his head and pulled 
the trigger. Deputies believe the gun the man used to shoot himself was the 
same one used to kill his girlfriend. The man was identified as 28-year-old 
Rodrigo Gamboa.Authorities have not identified the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Police are searching for two men who allegedly beat and stabbed to 
death a transient found in the bushes in the 1500 block of West Mission 
Boulevard on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who has not been identified by authorities, is known in the area 
as Jesus Capo, 25, police said. The suspects are also transients. They have 
been identified as Jose Ramon Chavez, 25, and Saul Servin Zavala, 22, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capo and the suspects apparently frequented the 1600 block of West Mission 
Boulevard and worked at odd jobs for contractors in the area. Capo had a 
5-year-old son named Jessie and both were known to sleep in makeshift shelters 
in the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim is described as Latino, 5 feet 10 inches tall and 170 pounds. He 
had a tattoo of a spider web on his right elbow, a tattoo of Asian writing on 
his left forearm and three dots on the web of his right hand. He may have had 
relatives in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Chavez is 5-foot-9, 190 pounds, with black or dark brown 
hair, and Zavala stands 5-foot 9, 160 pounds, with dark hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the victim or the suspects is asked to call Lt. 
Ron Frazier at (909) 620-2095. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN MARINO: A 57-year-old San Marino man was robbed Thursday night by two men 
who apparently followed him to his home in the 1100 block of Oak Grove Avenue, 
police said. The robbers, who were wearing ski masks, pointed a revolver at the 
man and took a gold Rolex watch, valued at $2,000. The robbers fled in a black 
1980 Cadillac El Dorado with a landau, or fold-down, top.

COMMUNITY NEWS: DIAMOND BAR; HORCHER AIDE CHANGES VOTING REGISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald G. Brand, chief of staff for Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar), 
said he has changed his registration to Rancho Cucamonga, where he lives, after 
it was discovered that he had registered to vote in Diamond Bar, where he had 
rented a mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand said he did not realize he was not allowed to register at the mailbox 
address, although the registration instructions state: "Print your complete 
address (not P.O. Box)." 
</P>
<P>
 He voted in Diamond Bar in the June 7 primary election. At that time, an 
election monitor informed Brand of his mistake. He corrected the registration 
on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand was living on a boat, where postal workers do not make deliveries, in 
Long Beach when he registered in Diamond Bar. He moved to San Bernardino County 
five months ago.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEREY PARK; COUPLE'S SUIT ACCUSES POLICE OF RACIAL BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chinese couple from Monterey Park, who allege they were arrested after 
defending themselves in a confrontation with three teen-age girls, have filed a 
lawsuit accusing Montebello police officers of racial discrimination and 
mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jinshu Zhang, his wife Yuan Fu and their 4-year-old son were accosted 
by three teen-agers at a Burger King at Montebello Town Center mall, according 
to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.But instead of 
arresting the girls, police jailed Zhang and Fu, both 35, on battery charges, 
the suit said. They were in custody about an hour, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks damages of at least $1 million and names the city, Police Chief 
G. Steve Simonian and officers Daniel Barron and Stacy Heckers. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang, a securities attorney, contends the arresting police officer, a Latino, 
never interviewed him, and believed the teen-agers' version of events because 
they also were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and a deputy district attorney said Zhang and Fu were arrested 
because other witnesses supported the teen-agers' claims that the couple 
initiated the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy District Atty. Alexis de la Garza said the couple agreed to complete a 
course in cultural sensitivity in exchange for having the battery charges 
dropped. Paul L. Hoffman, an attorney representing Zhang and Fu, said their 
agreement to take the course was not an admission of guilt.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monrovia Police officers will be on the lookout for kids wearing their bicycle 
helmets. Every child they find will receive a special ticket that will have 
words of thanks and encouragement from the issuing police officer.The effort is 
part of a bicycle safety program that started in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Project HELP, or The Helmet, Education and Law Program, was designed to 
promote good habits in young bicycle riders. The program encourages them to 
wear their bicycle helmets in accordance with a law that requires all riders 
under 18 to wear helmets by Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is supported by a dozen local businesses that offer awards for 
kids who visit their stores and present their ticket. Plans to expand the 
ongoing program will depend on its initial success. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of Project HELP is to keep bicycle riders safe as well as build 
positive relationships between the police and youth.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CLAREMONT; HARVEY MUDD EXCEEDS FUND-RAISING GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvey Mudd College, one of the Claremont colleges, has surpassed its 
fund-raising goal by accumulating $75.5 million during a five-year campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The total is $5.5 million more than the college's fund-raising goal and 
accounts for about $120,000 per student.The private school, which has been 
rated the top undergraduate engineering facility in the nation by U.S. News & 
World Report surveys, has 630 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely gratified to have met, and exceeded our goal," said Henry E. 
Riggs, the school president. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Mudd officials say the money was used to add new majors in biology and 
computer science, hire 17 new faculty members and boost enrollment by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school was able to reconstruct the F.W. Olin Science Center 
and Beckman Hall and renovate several other buildings, expanding the physical 
plant of the campus by 24%.

GOVERNMENT: COMMENTS ABOUT MONTEREY PARK LIBRARY TRUSTEE DENOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is very scary to see racism and bigotry publicly spoken by a city official 
The comments from Board President Kathleen Brzozowski of the Monterey Park city 
library concerning the other trustee, Marina Tse, are not only racist, but, 
unfortunately, have been used as an excuse behind racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski has viciously attacked a prominent community leader who has 
successfully completed many great projects in promoting intergroup 
relationships and is the winner of the prestigious 1993 L.A. County John Anson 
Ford Award.She was presented awards by the cities of Monterey Park, Alhambra, 
Rosemead, San Gabriel and the Alhambra School District, etc. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Brzozowski's racist comments have stirred up racial tension in 
our community.

<P>
 On your July 28, 1994 article, "Accusations of Racism Plague Monterey Park 
Library Board," I am saddened that such a racist comment came from a public 
figure. I happened to have learned English from Marina Tse who has been a 
public school teacher for 17 years and the only Asian on the California State 
Special Education Commission. Tse received a masters degree from USC. I am not 
aware that USC is using the Chinese language to teach. We've got to stop nasty 
attacks on the Asians who have tried so hard to better the community. 
Communications go both ways -- perhaps, it is (Kathleen) Brzozowski) who has 
the problems.

MARTIAL ARTS THE 'GENTLE WAY'; JUDO: PHYSICAL CONTACT FOSTERS RESPECT AMONG 
PARTICIPANTS, INSTRUCTORS AT NONPROFIT SAN GABRIEL SCHOOL SAY. THE SPORT 
PROMOTES DISCIPLINE AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Novice judo student Kang Yue, 16, bowed respectfully to Elliot Tsujiuchi, a 
third-degree black belt. Then, without hesitating, she grabbed Tsujiuchi's 
white robe with both hands, twisted to the left while bending her knees and 
threw her 180-pound partner over her head and onto his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping away the sweat that dropped like tears from his eyes, Tsujiuchi stood 
up and smiled. Flushed and breathless, Yue tightened her body in defense as 
Tsujiuchi lunged for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Thud! 
</P>
<P>
 The deep, loud sound of bodies hitting plastic mats continued for two hours as 
instructors at the San Gabriel Judo Dojo in Temple City taught children -- of 
all ages, ethnicities and skill levels -- the martial art whose name means the 
"gentle way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although throwing one's partner to the ground and clamping his head between 
your legs may not sound gentle, there is an intimacy in judo that is not found 
in other forms of martial arts, said Mike Noriega, a head instructor at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judo is a much less aggressive sport than karate," he said. "There's no 
kicking or punching. You must get close to your opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega, who has trained and taught at the school for 22 years, exudes the 
serenity and control of a martial arts master as depicted on television and in 
movies. He describes the nonprofit school as a place where children can 
simultaneously learn self-confidence and humility, and where coordination and 
finesse are more important than strength and size. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Judo Dojo first opened in El Monte in 1930 as part of the San 
Gabriel Japanese Community Center, but it was closed during World War II and 
some members were sent to internment camps. It reopened in Temple City after 
the war and ranked fourth in the nation last spring at the U.S. Judo Federation 
Junior, Youth and Team Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have dedicated instructors and our kids are really determined," Noriega 
said about the school's high ranking. "We don't only focus on competition and 
winning; we want the kids to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you learn more through losing anyway," he said. "It's like life, 
you learn not to give up." 
</P>
<P>
 The school sits behind a dog kennel at the end of a narrow dirt road. Dogs 
bark wildly as youths arrive for Monday and Friday night classes. The school 
has 65 boys and girls whose families come from all over the world: Vietnam and 
Mexico, India and Ethiopia. They all wear the white judo uniform of robe-like 
tops and pajama-like pants, with belts of various colors indicating their level 
of competency. Students have mastered judo when they receive the first of 10 
possible black belts. 
</P>
<P>
 Before entering the mirrorless, rectangle-shaped room, students leave their 
sandals at the door and bow in respect for the sport. Noriega and at least four 
other instructors, including two-time world champion Tadashi Hiraoka spar with 
students to help them develop the timing, coordination, concentration and 
discipline necessary to master judo. 
</P>
<P>
 "In karate, you can practice in the mirror, against a wall or with a bag," 
Noriega explained. "But in judo, you need a partner. It teaches you respect for 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 That respect can be a crucial safety factor when practicing. In a room filled 
with action and noise, students must be aware of how their partners are doing. 
Ray Nishikawa, 17, quickly releases Sam Ohta, 31, from a headlock when Ohta 
taps the mat twice lightly with his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes bulging, Ohta shakes his head to reorient himself. "He's not just 
holding me down, he's got my arteries and veins, so it chokes you," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohta rejoined the school two months ago after quitting judo during college. 
"Judo teaches you discipline, which is something I lacked in my 20s," he said. 
"But now I'm ready for it again. It's calm, spiritual and a great way to get 
into shape."

EDUCATION / MARY LAINE YARBER: GRADUATES KNOW THEY'LL FACE HARDSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches high school English. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several years now I've read media reports about how much tougher it is 
these days for high school graduates to succeed in college or in the job world. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But when such reports go on to say that graduates are naive or ignorant about 
life's hardships, I beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a recent survey of my own graduating students shows just the 
opposite: Although my students are hopeful about their futures, they are well 
aware that many difficult and even frightening obstacles lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what some of them had to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't yet know much about life, and people are already expecting me to make 
decisions," said Cecilia Wong, who is struggling to decide on a college major. 
"If I make the wrong decision, I'll have to live with it for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the path will include college. Richard Zheng is eager "to learn 
more, to have fun and to have more friends," he said. "When I talk to 
middle-aged people, 90% of them talk about their college life. Their stories 
really excite me."  
</P>
<P>
 The students are already aware, however, of the trials of college life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, there is too much competition between students," Wendy Arbeit 
said, "and C's are considered utter failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Elva Gonzalez sees money as a potential problem. "My fear is that I won't be 
able to make it through college because I will have to work," she said. "If I 
don't get a good-paying job (while in college), I'm going to have to choose 
between college and work." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of students worry that they may not be able to attend college at all 
because they are not legal residents and thus cannot qualify for scholarships 
or other monetary help. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, who asked to remain anonymous, dreams of studying science at 
UCLA. "When I (found out) I couldn't have the money to pay for college, I felt 
very sad," she said. "I work very hard to get good grades, and now I can't do 
anything to continue my studies." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of raising a family was mentioned by many of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to end up with a good husband who has a good career, doesn't drink or 
smoke, and is a great and supporting father, like my dad," Laura Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to put my whole life into my children," Sigrin Torres explained. 
"They'll be loved and nurtured throughout their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many adults, most of these teen-agers are haunted by the unpredictable 
job market. For example, Huvishka Mustamandy wants a career in criminal law but 
worries that he'll "go through years of college and won't find a job." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid of being unsuccessful; I don't like to depend on others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving a general contentment with life is a concern of my students too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know and have heard of many people who aren't happy in the life they 
are living," Randie Flower said. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, she's afraid of unknowingly choosing the wrong career. Likewise 
for Jenny Reifel-Saltzberg, who is headed to Portugal as a foreign exchange 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest fear is that I won't get a job I like, or I'll be stuck in a city 
or town I don't like," she said. "I'm also afraid I won't be happy with the 
person I want to marry." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Cueva worries about bad choices too. "My main fear," she said, "is 
that I don't become a teacher and end up being something else which I don't 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 Some grads have a more basic (and chilling) fear: violent death. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main fear is dying before I accomplish all of my goals," Hugo Ramirez 
said. "I want to get married, finish college, travel and design my own house." 
</P>
<P>
 Said David Aghai: "With the way society is today, I hope to make it past my 
college life. A big worry for me is to stay alive."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: BASIL HELPS ADD TO THE SPICE OF LIFE, THAI STYLE

<P>
 Basil is not your average mom-and-pop Thai restaurant. It looks less like an 
eatery and more like an airplane hangar that happens to be tucked away in an 
Arcadia mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-gray walls and floors contrast with vivid red chairs. A counter zigzags 
through the space like a broken fuselage. A Cubist sculpture in wood softens 
the space-age colors but maintains the restaurant's sharp-angled design. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Prasikiew, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Poky, originally 
envisioned the place as a Thai fast-food buffet -- a Bangkok version of 
Souplantation. Her sister, Harvard-educated architect Raveevarn Choksombatchai, 
took it from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent was to provide a backdrop for frantic lunch-hour forays. The 
concept, according to an article in Interior Design magazine, was " 'the 
glance'; the brief, fleeting, stolen view that cuts a path across forms and 
space as diners survey the room." 
</P>
<P>
 "The disjointed forms . . . begin to suggest the splintered texture and 
chaotic skylines of the urban spaces beyond the world of the cafe," the article 
continues. But while the decor may suggest the cold, fractured landscape of a 
metropolis, the warm service and food provide a brief respite from that hectic 
world. In the end, the Prasikiews decided to provide more leisurely table 
service in addition to the buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner and chef Poky Prasikiew is the second generation in a family of Bangkok 
restaurateurs -- his family owns two other restaurants in Thailand. Prasikiew 
cooks up recipes passed on by his mother, using imported Thai curry and chili 
powder, as well as lemon grass and the ginger-like root galangal that he grows 
in his Duarte back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu consists of a wide range of noodles, stews and curries, mostly based 
on meat or seafood, but also includes a handful of vegetarian entrees. 
Stir-fried noodle dishes ($4.75-$5.95) combine shrimp, chicken and broccoli 
with spices and thick noodles. A pineapple-shrimp curry ($6.25) came in a 
steaming pot of tangy coconut sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Basil offers the Thai standards like pad Thai as well as more offbeat dishes 
such as crispy fried catfish. House specials include gang garee gai , a chicken 
and potato curry for $6.95, and prik pow ta lay , sauteed seafood in a sweet 
and spicy chile sauce for $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The original vision of an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet, available on weekdays 
at $4.99, includes items such as steamed and fried rice, curry, pad Thai and 
fried chicken. The tables and counter are usually jammed at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees rate mild to medium -- 4 or 5 -- on the scale of chile hotness, 
Prasikiew said, but taste slightly spicy to the American palate. Prasikiew will 
adjust the spice level to the diner's taste, but he adopts a hands-off approach 
to the hottest requests -- if you want a dish spiced at, say, the 8.5 or 9 
level, you'll have to doctor it yourself with the tray of chile sauces 
Prasikiew will bring out.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Prasikiew grew up with the restaurant business, he came back to the 
family trade in a roundabout way. He and his wife Nina both have law degrees in 
Thailand, and came to the U.S. to take the bar exam. They abandoned that plan 
when the cost of the additional law courses they would need proved too 
expensive, and Prasikiew took a job with a trucking company instead. When he 
was laid off in 1990, Nina suggested he return to his inherited vocation, and 
Basil was created. 
</P>

 Basil, 411 E. Huntington Drive, Suite 103, Arcadia. (818) 447-8845. Entree 
prices range from $4.50-$9.95; most are $5-$7. Open daily 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

THEATER REVIEW; NOW IN ITS 3RD DECADE, 'FANTASTICKS' DESERVES ANOTHER LOOK; 
AFTER NEARLY 35 YEARS, THE PLAY, NOW AT OCCIDENTAL THEATER FESTIVAL, STILL 
CONVEYS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE YOUNG AND IN LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's only one thing in life that remains constant, it's got to be "The 
Fantasticks." The fragile parable about love, now at the Occidental Theater 
Festival, came into the world in 1960, the same year Occidental College staged 
its first summer theater festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have enjoyed strapping health ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 As the longest-running musical comedy in American theater history (it's still 
playing the Sullivan Street Theatre in Greenwich Village, where it opened 
nearly 35 years ago), "The Fantasticks" is a phenomenon worth a repeated look. 
</P>
<P>
 The Occidental Festival production, in a kind of 35th anniversary birthday 
present to itself at the indoor Keck Theater's wedding cake of a venue, is a 
spirited revival that manages to strike the necessary tuning fork. That is, the 
show captures and sustains what it is like to be young again and in love. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always tempting to test the preciousness in the Tom Jones-Harvey Schmidt 
fable against prevailing fancies. One production in Los Angeles' inner city 
turned it into a rock musical. But director Alan Freeman, the artistic director 
of the festival's Hillside Repertory Company, remains loyal to the material's 
original style and the result is endearing despite a few imbalances. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, with its presentational style, bridges a tight-wire act 
between worldliness and naivete. That's the key to the show's artful simplicity 
-- a veritable Goldilocks and her young swain surviving their romantic dreams 
after withering escapades with the dark and dashing bandit/balladeer El Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Saturnalian El Gallo is crucial and Nick Paone's Mephistophelean figure is 
vital and seductive. As the 16-year-old heroine Luisa, Gretchen Weiss, with a 
voice so high that it's tremulously close to squeaking, catches just the right 
number of moonbeams and pearly obbligatos in her white frilly dress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the standout is the 19-year old Romeo to her Juliet, Fred Voss as the 
smitten Matt, whose performance proceeds from innocence to charm to ebullience 
to poignancy. He's terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 The mute stage manager (Ellen Gersh Lerner), onstage conductor/pianist Philip 
Orem and the exceptional scenic and lighting designers (L.J. Houdyshell and 
Trevor Norton, respectively) help instill the proper sense of timelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The two points where the achievement stumbles are in the vaudevillian 
approaches of the lovers' two papas (Gary Davis and Skip Ludwig) and their 
overly broad routines as the two characters who aid El Gallo in his seduction 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the production reaffirms the musical's delicate spell and mirrors 
why it has gone from a faddish cult hit to a classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is performed in repertory with "Anything Goes," "Romeo and Juliet" 
and "Charley's Aunt." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 McCullough signed a letter of intent to enroll at USC after gaining 2,142 
yards and scoring 36 touchdowns in his senior season in 1992.

<P>
 The dispute went to arbitration, but the challenge was upheld. Last fall, 
McCullough took the American College Testing exam but scored a non-qualifying 
14.

3 CITY WORKERS HURT BREAKING UP ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of city sanitation workers in North Hollywood were praised by police 
Wednesday for risking their lives in a fracas with suspected gang members -- 
some armed with knives and ice picks -- who had attacked a homeless couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "These city employees came out, and good citizens that they are, tried to 
intervene and nearly got murdered," said Detective Gil Uribe of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three of the workers were injured, one seriously, in the fight that 
broke out about 3 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker, Alfredo Diego, said he was waiting for his wife to pick him up 
outside the sanitation yard on Chandler Boulevard, just east of Vineland 
Avenue, when he saw a group of teen-agers begin to punch and kick a homeless 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 He yelled at the assailants to stop and tried to distract the attackers so 
that the bloodied couple could run away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the teen-agers turned their attention to Diego, witnesses told police, and 
Diego's friend Jesus Reynoso stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Three or four of the teen-agers attacked Reynoso, "beating him and stabbing 
him," Uribe said, adding that Diego thinks that Reynoso saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were going to stab Diego, so I went to help," said Reynoso, 47, who was 
hospitalized overnight and recuperating at home Wednesday. "I didn't even know 
I was stabbed because I was fighting. He is my friend, and I wanted to protect 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the crowd of teen-agers drew their weapons, and some began throwing 
rocks and debris, Uribe said. The fight moved into the sanitation yard as other 
city employees -- looking for tools that could be used as weapons -- took steps 
to help, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker, Glen Atkinson, was hit in the head by a brick and knocked 
unconscious as he walked over to see what was happening. Atkinson did not 
regain consciousness until Wednesday afternoon. His condition stabilized, Uribe 
said, after doctors removed skull fragments lodged in his brain, but he remains 
in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Diego, 35, who was treated for minor scrapes and bruises, was back at work 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all were scared," Diego said. "We weren't ready for this. Everything 
happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Diego's wife, who arrived to pick him up in the middle of the fight, drove 
away after one of the assailants broke her front windshield. The attackers fled 
when they learned that police had been called, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their injuries, Diego and Reynoso said they would not hesitate to go 
to someone's aid again. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects and say they have very few descriptions to work with 
because the attack occurred so quickly, but they believe that gang members were 
involved.

TEACHERS CALL BOARD'S 7% OFFER UNACCEPTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a salvo designed to crank up the pressure on the Los Angeles school board 
for a full 10% restoration of salary cuts, the teachers union president on 
Wednesday sharply criticized the board's offer to give back 7%, calling it "a 
guaranteed strike."  
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of reviewing the school district's offer, officials of United 
Teachers-Los Angeles went into private negotiations with school officials. 
Publicly, union leaders were sticking to their demand for a full restoration of 
the salary cut imposed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the offer stands now, it's not going to fly. I would recommend a 
strike," said union president Helen Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolute insult, a slap in my face," said Lila Dawson-Weber, a member 
of the UTLA board of directors and a teacher at Fulton Middle School in Van 
Nuys. "Teachers are going to do some hard thinking about a strike. . . . We are 
asking for a restoration of what is ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education President Mark Slavkin, in announcing the $162.4-million 
contract proposal on Wednesday, called it "our best offer, our best shot." 
Supt. Sid Thompson said he and the board "wrung out the budget" to come up with 
the offer to reinstate 7% of the 10% reduction in pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education approved the offer on a unanimous vote Wednesday 
morning after lengthy discussions in closed sessions over several days. The 
current base pay of a teacher with 25 years experience would increase by $3,361 
a year under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said that in order to remain 
solvent under strict state laws, the board offer guarantees that only 4% of the 
restoration will continue into the 1995-96 school year. The remaining 3% cannot 
be promised beyond the coming school year because it is financed with money 
that is only available this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin said the board intends to look for ways to provide a full restoration 
of salary cuts in the next year, but cannot make that assurance now. Employees 
have suffered cuts for two years as a result of deep district fiscal woes that 
have slashed nearly $1.2 billion from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone the full mile -- to the limit of our financial resources -- in 
addressing the needs of teachers and other employees," Slavkin said. "We wish 
it could be more and we would have liked to make more of the restoration 
ongoing and permanent. Financial and legal restraints do not allow us to." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's offer includes the use of $42 million in surplus funds from the 
employee health benefits account. The school board wants all employee groups to 
agree to use the money for salaries -- a move that was soundly rejected by 
teachers in their counteroffer and could fuel divisiveness among employee 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, leaders of one union representing clerical workers have said the 
money should be held as security to pay for potential future rises in the cost 
of their health benefit package. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the board fashioned the $162.4-million offer by using 
surpluses in various accounts set aside for other uses, such as custodial 
services, utilities and the operation of the district's children's centers. A 
$27-million chunk of money is from a state refund on integration expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $16.6 million comes from lower-than-expected claims in the district's 
self-insurance funds. Budget chief Henry Jones said use of those funds for 
salaries is somewhat risky because claims could unexpectedly rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a conservative offer," Thompson said. "We have stretched it." 
</P>
<P>
 The union intends to put an offer to a vote of its members soon after most 
schools reopen Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Warren Furutani said the rapid-fire exchange of positions 
by the board and union Wednesday "establishes a floor and ceiling" for future 
talks. "Our offer is one place," he said. "If they counter with 10%, then we 
know the ballpark range in which to talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to make the deal more palatable, Thompson reminded teachers that 
they will be working five more days next school year, thanks to a grant from 
the U.S. Department of Education to make up the weeklong cancellation of 
classes after the Jan. 17 earthquake. This translates to an additional 2.5% in 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the base pay for a 25-year veteran is $48,349, ranking the Los 
Angeles district next to lowest among the county's 47 unified school districts. 
According to district figures, the 7% pay restoration would boost a veteran 
teacher to $51,710 and 18th place. If the additional five days are added, that 
instructor would earn $53,003, and rank seventh in the county earnings list.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? A LOT AT CITY HALL; BUREAUCRACY: MAYOR'S EFFORT TO STREAMLINE 
1,500 JOB TITLES CAUSES STIR. CRITICS SAY HIS STAFF DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE 
SPECIALIZATION NEEDED TO RUN A COMPLICATED METROPOLIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are 1,500 job titles in the city of Los Angeles' massive bureaucracy -- 
straightforward ones such as "plumber" and "mayor" and nebulous ones such as 
"asphalt raker" and "wharfinger." 
</P>
<P>
 The job classifications have become so specialized over the years that only 
the most entrenched City Hall denizens appreciate the subtle difference 
between, say, an "office equipment repairer" and a "typewriter repairer" or a 
"clerk," "clerk typist" and "data entry operator." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, for one, considers the web of city job classifications 
too complicated and has ordered a major restructuring as part of his attempt to 
streamline City Hall. Slashing the number of job titles, the mayor says, would 
free the city's 40,000 workers to handle a wider variety of tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although wary of Riordan because of his plans to have private firms take over 
some city work, union representatives agree that some reform in job 
classifications may be necessary. But they are raising numerous concerns and 
contend that Riordan aides -- many of them newcomers to the city scene -- do 
not understand the specialization needed to run a city as complicated as Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you call a plumber to fix your toilet you don't expect a construction 
worker to show up," said Brian D'Arcy, business manager for Local 18 of the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "And you don't call a plumber 
to fix your electricity. I would have to be a lunatic to say the system is 
perfect now, but they haven't thought this through." 
</P>
<P>
 There is quite a bit to think through. Salaries are tied to job titles, and 
changing workers' paychecks requires collective bargaining. And a city as 
massive as Los Angeles does require numerous specialists. Not to mention that 
the Civil Service system was designed to protect workers from unscrupulous 
bosses by very clearly defining who does what. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is general agreement that the system can be streamlined. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, James Works is an "asphalt raker," according to the city. But 
Works, who fills potholes, prefers to call himself a "street maintenance 
worker." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems more dignified to say 'street maintenance worker,' " said Works, an 
18-year veteran. "If I say 'raker,' people don't know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 And union officials say there are some titles that remain on the city rolls -- 
such as "Venetian blind repairer," "laundry worker" and "seamster" -- even 
though the jobs were phased out long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the review, officials have been looking at other municipalities. 
They discovered that two cities known for their obstinate bureaucracies -- New 
York (with more than 2,000 job classes) and Chicago (with 1,900) -- are both in 
the midst of similar consolidations. Tokyo, by contrast, has more workers than 
Los Angeles but only about 100 job classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has 1,496 job classes -- which is down significantly from the more 
than 2,000 different jobs that existed before the last streamlining in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 During the current stab at consolidation, however, city personnel officials 
are more ambitious, attempting to cut the number of job titles by roughly 
two-thirds. Although they doubt they will reach that goal, a draft report 
prepared by the city Personnel Department proposes combining as many as two 
dozen jobs into a single job title. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, "secretaries," "clerks," "senior clerks," "wharfingers," "senior 
tellers," "clerk stenographers," "data entry operators" and "municipal bond 
registrars" would all be known by the rather straightforward title of 
"administrative assistant." 
</P>
<P>
 (A wharfinger is an all-purpose clerk in the Harbor Department who must be 
able to lift up to 15 pounds, and have good arm, hand and finger dexterity with 
both hands, according to a city job description.) 
</P>
<P>
 An issue that remains to be worked out is how salaries would change. As it is 
now, a "utility accountant" starts at $34,556, an "accountant" starts at 
$28,188 and a "tax auditor" starts at $35,327. How much would they all be paid, 
the unions wonder, if they all became "accountant auditors"? 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan aides say that salary concerns will be handled in negotiations with 
the unions after agreement has been reached on which jobs ought to be 
consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions also are concerned that consolidating job titles could affect 
livelihoods by taking members now represented by one union and transferring 
them to another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the questions, Riordan aides say the consolidation could not be more 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all aimed at greater efficiency," said Deputy Mayor Mike Keeley, who is 
in charge of the consolidation. "All that the classifications do is to limit 
what people can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs now are so narrowly defined, they say, that it interferes with 
productivity -- bogging down the city in a muddle of specificity. 
</P>
<P>
 One general manager has complained that an assistant refused to make 
photocopies because it was not in her job responsibilities. Police Chief Willie 
L. Williams wanted to transfer some analysts from one task to another within 
the Police Department but was told that city rules do not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Limiting workers to specific tasks has its purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 It discourages bosses from arbitrarily moving workers around and forces 
management to promote workers to different job titles if their responsibilities 
increase. And specific job titles bring with them specific Civil Service tests 
and training requirements, which are essential in a city that operates a port, 
a utility and an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But some union officials complain that the draft document produced by city 
personnel officials went too far in its proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they took a huge plate of spaghetti and threw it up against the 
wall and looked to see what stuck," D'Arcy said. "We have people who deal with 
high voltage. Do you want to put them in the same classification with someone 
not used to working in dangerous situations?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the specificity can also hurt workers, said Faye Washington, general 
manager of the city Personnel Department. Workers often get stuck in career 
paths because of the established bureaucratic routes for promotion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unions are grudgingly joining in Riordan's effort, knowing that the city 
can impose some of the consolidations without them.

COURT DATE OF THE CENTURY; LAW: SIMPSON AND FLEISS ARE BOTH SCHEDULED TO GO ON 
TRIAL SEPT. 19 IN THE SAME BUILDING DOWNTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the harmonic convergence of the mid-1990s. Call it a national holiday 
-- Court Day, say -- and let everyone stay home and stare at their TV sets. 
Call it anything you like. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is, the murder trial of O.J. Simpson and the pandering trial of 
Heidi Fleiss are both scheduled to begin on the same day, Sept. 19, in the same 
place, the Criminal Courts Building in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tantamount to hitting Lotto or going to Vegas and having all the coins 
fall in your lap," said KCBS Channel 2 cameraman Carl Stein as he viewed 
Wednesday's contentious Simpson pretrial evidence hearing in a news van outside 
the 19-floor courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The confluence of the two ongoing media "cases of the century" came about this 
week when Fleiss' defense team was granted a continuance because defense 
attorney Anthony Brooklier will be engaged in another trial on the East Coast 
on the previously scheduled date of Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was coincidence," said district attorney's office spokeswoman Sandi 
Gibbons. "When (Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter, who is prosecuting the accused 
Hollywood madam) came marching down to tell us, I said, 'Do you realize what 
day that is?' and he said, 'No.' It didn't dawn on him at the time the defense 
made the motion." 
</P>
<P>
 But some courthouse denizens are more than a little skeptical. They believe 
Brooklier and Carter agreed on the new date at least in part to deflect media 
attention from the Fleiss proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd call it deliberateness," said defense attorney Leslie Abramson, whose 
retrial of the Menendez brothers murder case, the third current Los Angeles 
"case of the century," is due to begin in late October. "Nobody wants publicity 
on their cases (and) I'm quite sure that they are both intelligent enough to 
have figured it out."  
</P>
<P>
 For their part, TV executives can draw on their industry's history as they 
weigh the perils of cutting away to Heidi. In 1968, after all, NBC drew the 
undying wrath of football fans when it shifted from the final minutes of a 
seesaw New York Jets-Oakland Raiders contest to begin airing the movie "Heidi" 
at its scheduled time. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the Simpson case is concerned, no Heidi -- neither Alpine waif nor 
accused Hollywood madam -- is likely to preempt live coverage of the 
ex-football superstar's court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, we are talking about a murder case that's national in scope," said 
Sheryl Fair, news director for KABC TV Channel 7. 
</P>
<P>
 KTTV Channel 11 news director Jose Rios agreed: "O.J. will continue to be the 
high-profile case." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's not to say there would not be plenty of cutaways if the 
Simpson jury selection process continues ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can imagine editors saying, 'While you're waiting, why don't you do the 
'madam to the stars,' " KABC TV Channel 7 reporter Mark Coogan said as he stood 
on the courthouse steps along with nearly two dozen TV and still photographers, 
waiting for Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro to leave the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Coogan, like many courthouse observers, said the joint trial date is bound to 
give new meaning to the term "media event," particularly at his outdoor perch, 
where TV and print photographers regularly battle for position to shoot trial 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine two rugby scrums for the price of one?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, if both trials are proceeding at full steam in the days before 
November's state election, "Kathleen Brown, Pete Wilson, Dianne Feinstein and 
Michael Huffington will have to be picketing out in the street here because 
that's the only way they will be on TV," Coogan added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the courthouse Wednesday, some officials said they were unfazed by the 
dual trial dates of the case of the brown glove and the case of the black book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sept. 19 is just another day," said Criminal Courts coordinator John Iverson. 
"It's a big court system and there are 35 Superior Court criminal judges in 
this building alone." 
</P>
<P>
 But others conceded that the circumstances are more than a little amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been kidding among ourselves about what would be the ingredients to 
turn this building into the mass media event of the century," said district 
attorney's office spokesman Mike Botula. "We figured it was the convergence of 
the Heidi Fleiss and O.J. Simpson trials. Then all of a sudden, the prosecutor 
tells us the dream may well become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Change that word dream , " Botula added, catching himself, "to nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 For some at the courthouse, two trials will probably mean more work. "People 
have suggested they just ought to rent a stage at Paramount -- then you don't 
have to dress it up here every day," said Stein of KCBS as he packed two milk 
crates worth of cables, mixers and light stands after the Simpson hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteenth-floor snack bar operator Zohrab Bedikian feared that the double 
trials could actually cost him business. "The media people don't bring in that 
much," he said. "And regular customers in the building don't stop in if they 
know the floor will be jammed." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the trial date of either case is subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fleiss date has been continued many times already and who is to say it 
won't be postponed again?" said Gibbons of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not stop at least two people from savoring the possibility of the 
dual trial dates. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Deputy Sheriff Keith Brown, the bailiff in the 13th-floor courtroom 
where the Fleiss case is scheduled. The Simpson case, he said, will draw far 
more media attention. "Thank you, Lord," he said, looking up at the ceiling. 
"Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 The other was Aziz Muhammed, who was hawking "Cut the Juice Loose" T-shirts 
outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to call Heidi," Muhammed laughed, "and ask her if she wants to 
think about T-shirts of her own."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; MTA CONFIRMS 
TUNNELING BUCKLED WALK OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confirming claims by a property owners' group, a Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority official said Wednesday that tunnel machines boring under Hollywood 
Boulevard had caused sections of the Walk of Fame to buckle and crack. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roger Dames of the MTA's construction department said, "We consider these 
items repairable and not unusual for tunnel construction of this nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Dames showed up at an anti-subway construction news conference outside the 
Pacific Theatre, where a water main break on Saturday forced temporary closure 
of the theater and buckled the terrazzo sidewalk tiles. The theater, in the 
6400 block of Hollywood Boulevard, had four feet of water in its basement and 
remained closed Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 John Walsh, a spokesman for United Riders of Los Angeles, said property owners 
are "demanding . . . an immediate cessation of tunneling and an investigation 
into all the damage to the building foundations and the sidewalk by the Army 
Corps of Engineers." The Hollywood Boulevard Community Council made the same 
demands on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the Walk of Fame is part of a federally historic district, Walsh said 
he called U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Xavier Becerra (both D-Los Angeles), but 
neither has pledged support.  
</P>
<P>
 Dames said the damage outside the theater "was not so much the result of 
tunneling, but a ripple effect of . . . settlement caused by tunneling, which 
caused an old fire water line feeding the theater to break."  
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood line is part of the second phase of the Metro Red Line and will 
connect Hollywood to Downtown.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; EMBATTLED 
CITY ATTORNEY TO TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena City Atty. Victor J. Kaleta, whose decade-long tenure had been 
upended by an investigation that concluded he had discriminated against women 
attorneys in his office, announced Wednesday that he would take early 
retirement after he lost the support of the majority of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council in a special session voted to accept his resignation. Kaleta, 56, 
will serve as an adviser to an interim city attorney until his retirement takes 
effect March 8, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta said he resigned "in the interest of calming the waters," adding that 
he has not "intentionally discriminated against anyone in my office." 
</P>
<P>
 An investigator found that women attorneys in the city attorney office's civil 
branch were discriminated against in promotion, salaries and benefits -- 
particularly since a 1992 reorganization overseen by Kaleta. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women in that branch have since filed gender discrimination claims 
with state and federal agencies.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE BLOCKS 
SUSPENSIONS OF COUNTY HEALTH INSPECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health inspectors, who have been on a work slowdown since 
last week, won a crucial court victory Wednesday that will prevent the county 
from suspending inspectors who refuse to drive their private cars on county 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien granted a temporary 
restraining order against the county in response to a plea by lawyers 
representing about 350 inspectors, about 50 of whom have been suspended from 
their posts because they rode bicycles, walked or took public transportation to 
assignments instead of using their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said the decision was a boost for their job action against the 
county, a protest begun on Wednesday of last week because they have had no pay 
raise for three years, no contract for nearly two years and no increase in 
their 25-cents-per-mile auto expense allowance for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go at it with a vengeance now," said Jim Somers, a negotiator for the 
Los Angeles County Assn. of Environmental Health Specialists, the inspectors 
union. "You know how hard it is to get a temporary order? We're dancing in the 
aisles over here." 
</P>
<P>
 In his four-page decision, Judge O'Brien also ruled that inspectors who have 
already been suspended for refusing to drive their own autos to assignments 
since the job action began must be paid for the days they were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials expressed surprise at the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Lester Tolnai, senior deputy county counsel. "I 
don't think the facts warranted the issuance of a temporary restraining order." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to regroup and see what we can do next," said Elliot Marcus, 
director of labor relations for the county chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both Tolnai and Marcus said the county Department of Health Services, 
which oversees the inspectors, will comply with the judge's decision and 
rescind the driving-related suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Somers, who said his Monterey Park Environmental Health Office erupted in 
cheers at the news of the judge's decision, said he would call dozens of 
inspectors who expected to be suspended today and tell them to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began last week, the number of inspectors participating 
in the protest has dropped from about 320 to 200 because of a combination of 
the suspensions and the heat, Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the action began, work by the inspectors -- who examine public 
facilities from fast-food restaurants to apartment house swimming pools for 
disease risks -- has dropped by 95%, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing before O'Brien on Wednesday, union attorney Sylvia E. Kellison 
cited two cases relating to past disputes with the county over use of 
employees' personal vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, she argued, a state appellate judge in Los Angeles ruled that county 
employees had the right to refuse to use their private vehicles if they thought 
the reimbursement rate was inadequate. And in 1982, a Los Angeles County 
Superior Court judge held that county employees could decline to use their cars 
if the contract obligating them to do so had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary restraining order will remain in effect until Aug. 31, when both 
sides will again go before O'Brien to learn whether he will replace it with a 
preliminary injunction.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; PLANNED 
NAME CHANGE FOR TAIWAN OFFICES SPURS PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a name? Plenty, when it comes to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a group of Taiwanese Americans protested plans by their 
government to change the name of its diplomatic offices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the U.S. policy of recognizing only one China -- the People's 
Republic of China -- when setting up offices in this country, Taiwan's 
government has been forced to call itself by a long, euphemistic name: The 
Coordinating Council for North American Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 With relations now warming between the United States and Taiwan, the Taiwanese 
government is mulling over new names, including Taipei Institute in America. 
</P>
<P>
 That angers Taiwanese Americans who want the name changed to Taiwan Institute 
in America. "Taiwan is Taiwan and we should promote that name and not confuse 
the general public," Jack Liu, a prominent Taiwanese American activist, said at 
a Wednesday news conference in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's ruling party, the Kuomintang, whose leader, Chiang Kai-shek, fled the 
mainland when the Communists took over in 1949, maintains that it is the only 
legitimate government and hopes one day to reunite with the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liu and others say that cannot happen and that their homeland should 
accept the new name of Taiwan to reflect that political reality. A spokesman 
for the coordinating council said his government is studying every option and 
that the final decision will be made after discussions with the U.S. 
government.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD 
OFFICER ARRESTED IN ALLEGED MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Los Angeles Police Department officer has been arrested on sodomy charges 
stemming from the molestation of a 16-year-old former Explorer Scout at the 
department's Southeast Division station, detectives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin A. Jackson, 35, a member of the LAPD for about 4 1/2 years, was taken 
into custody at his home in Hawthorne at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday by officers 
from the department's Sexually Exploited Child unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit took action after the teen-ager filed a complaint Tuesday morning, 
officers said. Detectives said a search of Jackson's home turned up evidence 
that corroborated the boy's claims. Jackson was being held on $100,000 bail.

DEMOCRATS SAY HARMAN CHALLENGER BROKE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Democratic Party charged Wednesday that Rancho Palos Verdes 
Councilwoman Susan Brooks violated federal election rules by taking out a 
$50,000 unsecured loan to help finance her campaign to unseat Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey) in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint delivered to the Federal Election Commission, party officials 
said that the Bank of California granted loans to Brooks that were backed only 
by her "history of excellent business relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was expected to further a war of words between the candidates, 
who are running in a district that is split almost evenly between Democrats and 
Republicans. The district stretches from Marina del Rey to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Brooks called the charges "completely baseless" and a 
"political ploy." 
</P>
<P>
 The FEC in general requires that campaign loans be secured, either with 
sufficient collateral or with a special campaign account set up to repay the 
loan. However, there is also a provision, an FEC spokesman said, that allows 
the commission to consider "the totality of the circumstances" in individual 
cases that could make a loan without collateral legal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brooks' case, an FEC spokesman said the complaint would be reviewed by the 
commission and if found valid could lead to imposition of fines, but it was not 
known if that might happen before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 State Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press said in a statement, "Susan Brooks 
has taken out illegal loans, and the Federal Election Commission should take 
immediate action to rectify the situation." If a candidate cannot repay a loan, 
party officials said, the bank's money instead becomes a contribution and only 
a corporation's political action committee can contribute to a campaign, with 
donations limited to $5,000 per election. 
</P>
<P>
 FEC spokesman Ian Stirton said he could not comment on Press' complaint. But 
he said that in general, banks can give loans to candidates as long as there 
are "no special exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Loans have to be given "in the same way as any other loan," he said. "It 
cannot be a handshake." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign manager, David Bohline, said that the method of guaranteeing 
the loan was sufficient and "is considered a traditional and accepted method by 
the FEC." Campaign officials said the loan was discussed with the legal 
department at the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of California spokesman John Kaufman said he could not comment on Brooks' 
loan, but admitted it was "rare" for the bank to loan money to a political 
candidate or a campaign. The bank would loan only to credit-worthy individuals, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to finance reports, Brooks' campaign received three loans from the 
Bank of California of $20,000, $14,500 and $15,500 from May 27 to June 3. The 
loans were made, according to bank documents, on a "history of excellent 
business relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have put all of my personal assets on the line, and have placed myself 
deeply in debt because I truly believe in the principles and message of this 
campaign," Brooks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks campaign officials point to another FEC provision that allows loans to 
be secured through a guarantor or co-signer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan guaranteed it," said her husband, Jim Brooks, a campaign adviser. The 
loan, he said, actually was a "line of credit" his wife drew upon in the final 
days of her successful primary race against former Palos Verdes Estates 
Councilman Ron Florance. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign filed a complaint of its own with the FEC in June, claiming 
that Harman and Hughes Aircraft Co. improperly raised funds for Harman's 
campaign. Harman and Hughes deny the charges, and the FEC has yet to rule on 
the matter.

GLENDALE PLANS EVENING HIGH SCHOOL TO EASE CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fall of 1995, a new kind of high school is scheduled to open in 
Glendale, one where classes for the teen-age students begin about 2 in the 
afternoon and end at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected to be one of the first of its kind in California. Less than a 
dozen schools that hold evening classes for regular high school students are 
known to exist in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Glendale Unified School District -- which is ready to burst 
at the seams with about 29,000 students -- hope that the innovative new high 
school will relieve overcrowding by making better use of the district's three 
high school campuses, one of which may house the evening school. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggering the school day is just one way of coping with overcrowding, but 
some say that Glendale's program and others like it offer a look at how many 
secondary schools will operate one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need their institutions to be as flexible as they are. What you're 
seeing is schools starting to respond to that," said Michael Casserly, who 
heads the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's 
largest public school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, district officials had considered a year-round program for their 
three high schools to cope with rapidly rising enrollment. But they decided 
against offering year-round sessions, which are sometimes unpopular with 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option -- installing portable classrooms -- was weighed, but the 
district determined that its high schools lacked enough space. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of parents, students, teachers and school officials helped 
develop a preliminary plan for an evening high school in Glendale that was 
unanimously approved by the school board in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the voluntary afternoon-to-night school program has been mixed 
within the school system. The Glendale Teachers Assn. backed the plan. But on 
at least one campus, Glendale High School, the issue has polarized parents and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is students think this is a school for people who don't have a 
clue, and the parents don't want their children home all day without 
supervision," said Candace Hakonsson, 16, a task force member who read more 
than 100 responses to a recent survey about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about the new high school are still subject to change, but are not 
likely to be altered much. 
</P>
<P>
 A site will be chosen by October from among the three high schools: Crescenta 
Valley, Glendale and Hoover. A principal will be named the following month. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment will be voluntary and all Glendale students in grades nine through 
12 are eligible to attend. Classes would begin in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects to draw a wide range of students -- from those who are 
college-bound to those at risk of dropping out. The evening high school will 
accommodate between 200 and 600 students. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical set of classes will be offered in English, math, science, history 
and physical education. The evening school's core curriculum will meet entrance 
requirements for the University of California, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Placement and English as a second language instruction will probably 
be available, but shop classes and interscholastic sports will not be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 At other schools, extracurricular clubs meet during lunch or after the end of 
the day. Evening high school students will have similar choices to gather 
during dinner break, and before and after classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the program succeeds or fails depends largely on how well everyone 
involved adapts to the change, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of this is related to how the community feels it can best address the 
problems of overcrowding," said Harry Handler, former superintendent of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, now an adjunct professor of education at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a key point here: It is voluntary," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and administrators in Glendale cite several advantages that students 
have in attending school late in the day: the chance to hold part-time jobs in 
the morning, easier access to school supplies such as computers, more personal 
attention from teachers and the ability to come to class wide awake. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As Glendale School Board President Sharon Beauchamp put it, "Young people are 
just like adults. There are day young people, and there are night young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 It is rowdy young people -- and continuous noise and traffic at night -- that 
has some residents near Hoover High School worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with the concept of it," said Madeleine Hibbs, 45, a 
mother of two who lives across the street from the campus. "This could well be 
the perfect solution for us. My concern is if this will be at Hoover High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the profile of these students is going to be. I can only 
think it will be a cross-section of students already in Glendale schools." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey of 719 parents and 1,182 students indicates that 76% of 
parents would not send their children to evening high school, and 67% of 
students do not want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, Susan Nowicke, told the task force that she wanted to stop the 
program for fear that students will not learn as much and will not see their 
families at home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale school officials point out that 302 students showed an interest 
in attending -- more than enough for Evening High School to open as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to go back and ask the question, 'Is there any reason why facilities 
should only be used during the day and not be in operation on weekends and at 
night?' " said district Supt. Robert Sanchis. 
</P>
<P>
 The only state requirements for opening such a school are that no one under 
the ninth grade can be enrolled; parental permission is mandatory, and a 
certain amount of time in the school day must be reserved for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no law that says (high school) has to take place during a certain 
time of day," said Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of 
Education. "Our opinion is this is what local control is designed for." 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, Sunset High School was created 22 years ago as an evening school 
to provide an alternative that would help curb the dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the concept of evening education piqued the interest of other 
students looking for more personal attention, Principal Frank Roqueni said. 
Today, the high school's 700 to 800 students say that is the No. 1 reason why 
they attend night classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lacey, Wash., River Ridge High School becomes New Century High at night for 
about 200 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Desiree Monroy does her homework either after school or first 
thing in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learn a lot more," she said. "I don't sleep through classes anymore. I'm 
more alert by that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover Principal Don Duncan visited Sunset and New Century high schools this 
year and last year to learn more about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, the biggest challenge is to show students the advantage of going 
to school at night," Duncan said. "This is not a continuation school. . . . 
That is not what this is."

AROUND THE VALLEY: WHAT DOES A GENTLEMAN SAY TO A NAKED LADY: CARE TO DANCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In England, one must be born a gentleman. In an industrial part of Van Nuys, 
just slap down a few quid at Bob's Classy Lady and there you are, a member of 
what the owners describe as "the largest legal gentleman's club in the Los 
Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not because it caters to large gentlemen. Not even large legal 
gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking raw square footage here -- 12,000 raw square feet of voyeurism, 
where men pay to see nude and semi-nude women on stages, in private rooms, even 
under showers. What they don't get to do is drink while they ogle, because the 
law prohibits commingling booze in places with total nudity, or vice versa, and 
mandates that they be located in commercial zones. From this comes the 
euphemism "gentleman's club," which means a place where the patrons must 
abstain from one vice while indulging another. It is legal in the sense that it 
is located in the proper zone, which some others are not. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular night, Bob's Classy Lady was celebrating its first year of 
survival, while satisfying this odd combination of legal mandate and social 
hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this as a piece on social behavior patterns, tying into the safe-sex 
thing," explained Bob Fisher, a publicist whose job for the past month has been 
to drum up attention for the club. "You got married men who are bored to death, 
or single men who can't find a woman. . . . These gentlemen's clubs kind of tie 
in with what's going on today in the male-female relations thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Uhhhhhh, yeah. Right. Maybe I should get back to you on that, Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob, who is not the Bob in the club's name, is experienced at this sort of 
verbal legerdemain. His other PR clients, he said, include the Chicken Ranch 
(reputedly the world's largest brothel and the inspiration for the play "The 
Best Little Whorehouse in Texas") and six local law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between lawyers and prostitutes, which is the more socially acceptable?" 
Fisher asked. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed an honest question. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hard at work trying to put a positive spin on the club's birthday 
party, at which Nikki Dial was even then emerging from a cake in black bra and 
panties. That was apparently still too much clothing because she was soon out 
of them. Ms. Dial is what is known as an adult film star, which is to say she 
appears in movies ("Sodom and Gomorrah," "A Tail of Two Cities") that are adult 
in the same sense that Bob's is a club for gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ms. Dial was replaced on the catwalk by a woman named Rachel who 
sashayed about to "Nights in White Satin," sending several patrons into a moody 
blue swoon. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sign above the catwalk, in Day-Glo colors, is painted the club's mantra: 
"Touching our ladies is illegal. Tipping is appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 A deejay advised the torpid crowd: "Don't be shy! Go crazy, guys! Throw your 
money in the air! Put it on your forehead! She loves it when you do that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, what she wanted was for her currency to be draped over the rope 
between her and the customers, where she could scoop it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the patrons seemed exceedingly shy, even as the night wore on and the 
crowd thickened with rosy-cheeked collegians. By Ms. Dial's second dance -- 
which featured what appeared to be a tricky double-axel, triple lutz combo -- 
it was crowded at the edge of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars of sport and music frequent the club, although usually in back rooms, 
boasted general manager Neil Blitstein, who literally grew up in this business. 
The club is co-owned by his mother and his stepfather, Bob Gressman, who is the 
Bob in the club's name. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Marilyne, got into the business tending bar at a topless 
establishment because it was that or starvation for her five kids, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for this business, I wouldn't be able to pursue my dreams," said 
Blitstein. "I don't knock this business. I'll do it for the rest of my life, 
until maybe I get a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Blitstein rattles off stories of club dancers making upwards of a quarter of a 
million dollars a year. Most stay about five years and some go on to 
professions of higher social standing, like veterinarian, accountant -- even 
attorney, said Blitstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normal, everyday people who say you're a pervert for watching the women are 
renting videos and watching them at home," Blitstein insisted. "The way the 
sexual revolution has taken a nose-dive, there's no other place to go to get a 
thrill. Every time a new disease comes out, this industry gets a kick." 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of dancers in string bikinis, one yellow, one orange, bravely defended 
their trade, although like some other dancers they did not reveal their names. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not half as bad as they (critics) think," said Ms. Lemon. "I used to 
think they were all whores, on drugs or runaways. But most of the girls go to 
college. Some are single parents going to college." 
</P>
<P>
 The citrus sisters agreed, however, that the job affects their social views. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are seeing men at their worst," Ms. Lemon said. "They're all the same. I 
don't care who they are, what job they have, they're all the same." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those men on this particular night was Darrol Houser, 37, of Lancaster. 
On the cusp of his 11th wedding anniversary, he claimed to be faithful to both 
his wife and the dance clubs, which he visits once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be keeping my marriage together," Houser said. "This is the safe sex 
of the '90s. Look but don't touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunland resident Wally Ann Wharton said she aimed for Hollywood almost two 
decades ago, but wound up stripping, had bit parts in sex films and now writes 
reviews of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 No one gets hurt and no one is forced to do anything, she insisted. "It's 
harmless entertainment, not only for bored husbands and wives. There have been 
women dancing nude since the cavemen!" 
</P>
<P>
 One supposes she meant cave gentlemen.

 ARRESTING TWIST: President Clinton was indirectly responsible for the arrest 
of a woman who appeared by his side in the Rose Garden last Monday in an 
emotional plea for passage of the Administration's crime bill. Janice Payne of 
Gretna, La., whose 9-year-old son was the victim of a drive-by slaying on 
Mother's Day, was invited to the White House to help dramatize the need for new 
anti-crime legislation. Her son had sent Clinton a poignant letter imploring 
the President to "stop the killing" just nine days before his death. After 
Jefferson Parrish, La., authorities saw a newspaper photo of Payne with 
Clinton, they tracked her down and arrested her for unspecified violations of 
the terms of her probation on drug charges. White House aides said that, before 
she was invited to Washington, her name was run through the National Crime 
Information Center computer and "nothing (was found) that would have prohibited 
her from coming here" -- despite an arrest warrant pending since September. She 
was booked Tuesday and then released because of jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HELP WANTED: Backing the notion that the less time lawmakers spend in 
Washington, the less damage they can do, several conservative candidates are 
proposing a part-time Congress, with shorter sessions and smaller paychecks. 
Capitalizing on anti-Washington sentiment, Virginia Republican Senate nominee 
Oliver L. North, Tennessee GOP Senate candidate Fred Dalton Thompson and former 
Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, a likely presidential candidate, have 
offered plans for such changes as cutting back the session to six months a year 
and forcing lawmakers to take second jobs. "Anybody who's watched C-SPAN knows 
lawmakers spend a lot of time giving speeches to empty rooms and not actually 
passing legislation," North spokesman Dan McLagan says. Since the early 19th 
Century, Congress has met eight to nine months a year, and for good reason, 
some say. Maureen S. Steinbruner, president of the Center for National Policy, 
a Washington think tank, says that a proposal to cut hours and salaries "is 
flat-out wrong. You get what you pay for. . . . We want Congress to be able to 
do what it does better, not do it less." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HOSTAGE OF THE HILL: According to plan, President Clinton was supposed to be 
relaxing on a beach by now, not haggling with members of the House over details 
of the crime bill. But the vacation has not gone according to plan. Officials 
now say their hope is that, if Congress finishes work on the crime bill this 
week, Clinton will leave town toward the end of next week -- perhaps leaving 
the Senate behind to drone on in its health care debate. Among Clinton's 
exhausted, somewhat strung-out staff, not everyone has taken the delay calmly. 
"You think you want a vacation," scoffed one aide who had been called as a 
witness in Congress' Whitewater hearings, "I've just been through six months of 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LUKEWARM APPROVAL: President Clinton's tepid approval ratings of late are not 
necessarily bad, if history is any indication. At roughly 50% approval, which 
is where Clinton stood in June public polls, he is more popular than Presidents 
Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan were at the equivalent points of 
their tenures. Carter scored the worst after 17 months in office -- 42% 
approval in the Gallup Poll of June, 1978. After 17 months in office, Reagan 
was at 44% and Ford at 46%. Approval after 1 1/2 years in office has proved a 
poor barometer of reelection. Despite his low standings, Reagan won reelection. 
George Bush, who was at 69% in the polls in June, 1990, lost.

3 CANDIDATES WANT TO VOTE THEMSELVES OUT OF JOBS; CAMPAIGN: THEY VOW THAT IF 
ELECTED TO TRI-CITY WATER DISTRICT BOARD THEY WILL SEEK TO DO AWAY WITH THE 
AGENCY, WHICH THEY SAY IS UNNEEDED AND WASTEFUL.

 The three candidates -- Kenneth Mullen, Philip Crocker and George Key -- know 
a lot about water, how it should be delivered and how it should be stored. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trio won't need much expertise about pipelines and reservoirs to carry 
out a unique campaign pledge if they're elected to the Tri-Cities Municipal 
Water District board. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because, if elected in November, Mullen, Crocker and Key vow they will 
take their oaths of office, then promptly put themselves out of a job by 
dissolving the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's dissolution, they contend, will save ratepayers money by 
eliminating an unnecessary layer of government created in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The three San Clemente residents lack a catchy campaign slogan but have been 
raising eyebrows with a political suicide pact that may be the first such 
candidacies of their kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's . . . different," Mullen said of their approach. "It's a major change. 
We fully plan to carry through with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Key said the trio's campaign platform has drawn bewildered responses. The 
three are among six candidates, including two incumbents, running for the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Are you going to put yourselves out? That's not good politics' " 
Key said. "I say, 'Well, I'm not a politician.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about getting rid of the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District isn't new. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Clemente, one of the water district's wholesale customers, 
supports the dissolution, believing it will save customers money. The City 
Council last spring called for the district's demise and suggested that the 
city buy its water from another source. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to San Clemente, the Tri-Cities district sells water to San Onofre 
State Park, San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant and the Capistrano Beach County 
Water District, which serves parts of San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point and 
Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the district serves 70,000 people, most of them in San Clemente. The 
district's current yearly budget is $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Mecham, Tri-Cities board president, said he favors dissolving the 
district if it can be proved the move is the best way to serve customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mecham said the district's critics have yet to provide numbers to support 
their position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who says, 'We're running to dissolve Tri-Cities' is running on 
emotion and not facts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mecham said Tri-Cities should be allowed to survive if a consolidation of 
special water and sewer districts takes place in South County, as recommended 
by the county's grand jury.  
</P>
<P>
 Mecham is being challenged in the election by Crocker and another candidate, 
Esther Shillman, who says she favors a review of the district before saying 
whether it should be dissolved or remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time for a good assessment," Shillman said. "Do we need what we 
did in 1959? Maybe we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth candidate in the election is incumbent Jim Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
 The three candidates who hope to bring about the district's demise, and their 
backers, say the Tri-Cities' administration and board can eliminated from the 
water-delivery process because the district serves as a "middleman," receiving 
water from the Coastal Municipal Water District in Dana Point, which gets its 
water from the state's wholesaler, the Metropolitan Water District of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long sequence of events and indicates that there are a lot of people 
dipping their fingers into the financial trough," said Jim Hill, an electrical 
engineer who has become an advocate of abolishing the district.

OFFICER SUES POLICE CHIEF IN PAY DISPUTE; COURTS: HUNTINGTON LAWMAN WANTS 
COMPENSATION FOR TIME HE SPENT FIGHTING DISCIPLINARY ACTION THAT ULTIMATELY WAS 
DISMISSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Huntington Beach police officer took an unusual approach to settling a beef 
with his boss: He took Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg to small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 In dispute is about $750 that Officer William Murphy says he is owed by the 
department for time he spent fighting a disciplinary action that ultimately was 
dismissed. He also wants about $400 in interest on the back pay that the 
department was required to give him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's miserable to have to go this far," said the 15-year police veteran.  
</P>
<P>
 In Municipal Court in Westminster Wednesday, Lowenberg and the city's risk 
manager, Karen Foster, argued that the police chief owes Murphy nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the officer is not entitled to compensation for the three days he 
spent in the disciplinary hearing, because the hearing did not occur during 
Murphy's normal work shift, which is at night, and attending it instead of 
working the night shift was Murphy's choice. They also claimed the officer 
ought to have exhausted established grievance procedures before taking his case 
to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Thomas J. Borris took the arguments under submission and is expected to 
issue a decision in seven to 10 days. But he indicated he could not find 
Lowenberg personally liable in the case unless Murphy could prove the chief 
acted in bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, for his part, said he tried everything else he could think of before 
going to court. He said he tried to make appointments with Lowenberg four times 
to discuss the matter but was rebuffed. He also was denied reimbursement by the 
city's personnel director, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said that other officers who work day shifts get paid for attending 
disciplinary hearings, and he ought to get the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint stems from a 1993 disciplinary action against Murphy, who was 
accused, among other things, of using excessive force during an arrest of a 
22-year-old who had been involved in a police chase during which shots were 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said he had hit a suspect twice in the head with the butt of his 
shotgun, first when the suspect was trying to throw another officer off his 
back and again when the suspect reached for his waistband. Murphy said he 
didn't know at the time whether the suspect was armed, although it was later 
determined that he was not. 
</P>
<P>
 An arbitrator overturned Murphy's one-month suspension and ordered the city to 
reimburse him for lost wages, Murphy said. In response, he said, the city paid 
him $5,000, but not the 10 months of interest he believes he is owed. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer said more than 100 other officers have complaints against the 
chief -- mostly related to denial of time off -- that they either have filed or 
plan to file in small claims court. He said he learned of the plans during a 
police officers association meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said the city had been served with no other small-claims actions 
similar to Murphy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Officer Richard Wright, president of the Huntington Beach Police 
Officers Assn., said Wednesday night that there is a plan to initiate more than 
20 small claims cases against Lowenberg. He confirmed that most related to the 
denial of officers' requests to use accumulated time off, stressing that they 
were entirely unrelated to Murphy's action.

PLAYING BALLPLAYERS AT THE BIG A; CREW OF NEW FOX SERIES TAKES ABANDONED FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It may just be the biggest baseball crowd Anaheim Stadium will see the rest of 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the 6-day-old strike by major league baseball players, about 100 
people caught a glimpse of the national pastime Wednesday at the Big A. Of 
course, the "fans" were paid to show up -- and the baseball game they were 
watching was all a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks in the stands were Hollywood extras earning about $65 each for their 
background roles as baseball fans in Fox Television's new sports sitcom 
"Hardball." The cast and crew used Anaheim Stadium to film episodes for the new 
half-hour comedy series, which premieres Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the hot afternoon sun, extras watched as the show's fictional team 
called the Pioneers threw some pitches and swung a few bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think we'd see any baseball, but here we are," said Toni Reed, 32, 
a TV extra from Long Beach. "I'm a closet Angels fan because they never seem to 
be doing that well." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bummed there's a strike," she added. "I hope it ends soon." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the show's story line, the Pioneers not only wear uniforms 
similar to the California Angels', but they also play like them. The team is 
struggling, about five games below a .500 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a team with a great deal of talent," said actor Dann Florek, who plays 
the new hard-nosed team manager. "But they have no direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Filming at Anaheim Stadium is a key to the show's success, said the producers 
of "Hardball." Historically, baseball sitcoms have struck out with television 
audiences. But the producers feel the $10,000 they shelled out to rent the 
stadium for the one-day shoot will pay off in viewership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure we are getting the actual look and feel of baseball," 
said executive producer Kevin Curran, who wrote for five years for "Late Night 
with David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium may have seen more actors than baseball players lately. Fox 
Broadcasting Co. recently shot scenes there for the TV movie "The O.J. Simpson 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Curran said that in addition to a realistic setting, he wants "people who you 
can believe are athletes and not just a bunch of actors on a sound stage." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sitcom without a couch," Curran added. 
</P>
<P>
 Television's creative process can sometimes be a mystery to those outside the 
industry. But the spark of innovation that put this show on the air is easily 
explained, said executive producer Jeff Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox wanted something after football," said Martin, who has written for "The 
Simpsons" and played Flunky the Clown on the old Letterman show. "They told us 
they wanted a baseball show." 
</P>
<P>
 For actor Mike Starr, "Hardball" represented a step up in his fictional major 
league sports career. In the film "The Natural," which starred Robert Redford 
as an aged rookie, Starr portrayed a backup bullpen catcher. But on the new 
show, his character is the starting catcher and a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got his injuries and a little more weight than his rookie season," said 
Starr about his character. "But he still knows all the pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 For actor Charles Cyphers, the show will be a quick foray into baseball. 
Cyphers plays the team's first manager who gets fired in the opening episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a meat-and-potatoes actor. I go to work and do my stuff," said Cyphers, 
who would say only that he is in his 50s. "I'm not into ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may bring him back anyway, you never know," added Cyphers, who also has 
a recurring role as a drunk cop in another Fox sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the show debuted earlier, would the realism of the show extend so far as 
to have the Pioneers go out on strike? 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball players have taken a bit of the shaft," Florek said. "I think the 
salary cap is wrong. Yeah, I think this team (Pioneers) would walk." 
</P>
<P>
 But Starr wasn't so sure about the moral direction of his fictional team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a TV show, this isn't real," he said. The character he plays wouldn't 
"really get involved in issues like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's filming was real enough for stadium usher Lynn Lonn, who was just 
happy to be working again. Lonn said he will lose as much as $1,000 because of 
the players' strike if they sit out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only job I have right now," said Lonn, 42, of Anaheim. "This 
strike is really tough on me."

LATER DEADLINE BOOSTS BALLOTS FOR NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Thousand Oaks voters will have to choose from among 17 candidates for City 
Council this November -- the largest field in Ventura County in the fall 
election -- and a last-minute rush of candidates in Oxnard and Port Hueneme on 
Wednesday has produced two other crowded races. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of Wednesday's extended deadline, seven new candidates filed 
papers to run for three open seats on the Thousand Oaks City Council. In Oxnard 
three candidates filed for City Council, bringing to 11 the number of 
candidates seeking two available seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of candidates for three Port Hueneme City Council seats doubled 
from seven to 14 by Wednesday. Filing by Wednesday's deadline were candidates 
Al Ingersoll, Valorie Morrison, David W. Goodman, Billy Kimberling, Madeleine 
A. White, Terry Bruno and Reno Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The three races were among several in Ventura County in which last Friday's 
deadline was extended to Wednesday because incumbents decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those races was for the Simi Valley City Council, for which only one 
new candidate, Dean Kunicki, filed papers Wednesday, increasing the number of 
candidates to seven. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Thousand Oaks race, Mayor Alex Fiore decided not to seek reelection 
after 30 years of service. Incumbents Elois Zeanah and Judy Lazar are running 
to keep their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven candidates who filed after Friday's deadline are former councilman 
Lee Laxdal, Lance Winslow, Ekbal Quidwai, Michael Friedman, David Hare, Irving 
Wasserman and Seth Menin. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders speculated Wednesday that there is widespread interest in 
the election because control of the council -- especially regarding growth 
issues -- is up for grabs.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski have repeatedly opposed new 
development, but have found themselves outnumbered by Fiore, Lazar and Frank 
Schillo in several major decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Alex Fiore stepping down, the pivotal shift of power to (Zeanah and 
Zukowski) becomes a real possibility," said Steve Rubenstein, executive 
director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. "I think a lot of people are 
interested in gaining that controlling position." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, Leticia Alvarez, Dale Maulhardt and Lawrence Paul Stein have 
entered the City Council race since Friday, raising the number of candidates to 
11 for two open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, who is running for his third time, said he considered entering the race 
when incumbent Michael Plisky decided to run for the Oxnard Harbor District 
instead of the council, but waited to see who the competition would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited to see what the field was, and I thought I had a good chance this 
time," Stein said. "The first time I ran I spent $14 and received 2,000 votes. 
People think I can help the small businessmen of Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez will run unopposed for his second straight term after his 
only challenger failed to submit the required 20 signatures from registered 
voters with his application last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the large number of candidates in the City Council race figures to 
improve the reelection chances of incumbent Tom Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more people there is, the more advantage incumbents have because of name 
recognition," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues in the Oxnard race figure to be growth and redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Extensions for several school board races yielded only a handful of new names. 
But for the tiny Santa Clara School District, two late entries were more than 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one person -- Deann Hobson -- had registered to run for the district's 
three available seats by the Friday deadline, and the district threatened to 
fall under the control of county schools officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, incumbent Shirley Diamond decided to run again, and Lynne 
Peterson, a college psychology professor, also stepped into the race, giving 
the one-school district three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, businessman John D. Wisda and Leslie H. Maland decided to run 
for one of three City Council seats, raising the number of candidates to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two Camarillo races that were unaffected by the deadline extension 
have attracted a number of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District, a total of six candidates 
filed for three seats. Those candidates are incumbents Carol Schau and Nancy C. 
Bush, and challengers Susannah Fitzgerald, Charlotte A. Farrens, Kadi Kiisk and 
Kevin Kildee. The district board is responsible for providing facilities and 
recreation services in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 And nine candidates filed for three seats on the board of directors of the 
Camarillo Health Care District, which provides services to residents of 
Camarillo and Somis.

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; COUNTY FAIR OPENS WITH EXCITEMENT; ENTERTAINMENT: KIDS,

 Moments after officials sliced a long green ribbon with sharp metal scissors 
at 11 a.m. Wednesday, a crowd of hundreds rushed through the turnstiles -- and 
the 1994 Ventura County Fair began. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Westlake equestrians Molly Davis, 11, and Lexi Shaw, 9, headed 
straight for the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like the Cervantes family of Ventura, raced for the exhibit buildings 
to see if their projects won any ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got up really early this morning and counted the hours," said Linda 
Cervantes, 38, as she and daughters Katie, 11, and Megan, 7, hurried into the 
Youth Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, teen-agers and the iron-stomached bolted straight for the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here for the rides," said Loren Holland, 15, eyes gleaming as he 
anticipated the blood-curdling amusements he and buddies Ian Huling and Donnie 
Fuller would enjoy that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 From now until Aug. 28, the three Ventura boys intend to scream their way 
through every mechanized attraction, gorge on all the corn dogs their stomachs 
can bear and chat with all the girls they get up the nerve to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to come every day," Ian, 15, pledged as the trio trooped off to 
blow their collective pool of $120. 
</P>
<P>
 Over in the Commercial Building, vendor Bradley Leyman peddled his wares to a 
different sort of clientele as he extolled the wonders of the Super Salsa 
Maker, a clear plastic container fitted with a whirring metal blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyman went through his shtick before a small audience of giggling children 
and their curious mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make pico de gallo," he told the group. "That means 'beak of 
the rooster' in Spanish and 'big chunky salsa' in English." 
</P>
<P>
 The blade chopped the tomatoes, bell peppers, onions and cilantro inside the 
container into ever-smaller pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped churning and held up a commercial jar of salsa. "See this here? 
They made it last year so you can eat it this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladling the freshly made salsa onto tortilla chips and offering them to the 
group, he urged them to purchase the gadget quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell this machine only through demonstrations," he said. "If you buy right 
now, I will give you a second whipping blade, great for making scrambled eggs 
and whipped cream, for the same price of $19.95. But you have to buy it now. 
You can't come back later." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling but not convinced, Leyman's audience of 10 or so ate their tortilla 
chips and dwindled away. He cleaned up the counter for the next demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, in pressing, muggy heat, crowds milled around the food and outdoor 
exhibit booths. 
</P>
<P>
 June Smith, 70, of Santa Paula, purchased three dozen elephant ear pastries 
from one concessionaire. She plans to store the fried, sugary treats in her 
freezer, then come back for more later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get some large ones and some small ones," she said, explaining 
how she thaws the elephant ears periodically over the year to eat for breakfast 
or to give away as presents. "They freeze well, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Molly Davis buried her head in her hands and shrank from the sight of 
food. After Molly, her friends and family viewed the horses at the fair's 
outset, they had headed over to the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at lunchtime, Molly was feeling the effects of the rough-and-tumble 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've ridden everything they can possibly get on," said Molly's mother, 
Susie Davis, who waited on the sidelines as Molly, her brother, Austin, and 
friends Lexi Shaw and Sean White, all 9, banged about the whirling attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw for Molly was a ride that spins its customers around and 
around, faster and faster, until gravity glues them to the machine's side. 
</P>
<P>
 She emerged green in the face and sick to the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too much," Susie Davis said. "I think next we'll take a walk, 
take it easy for a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival defeated bravado-meisters Loren, Ian and Donnie of Ventura as 
well, but for different reasons. By noon, one hour into the fair, every penny 
of their $120 bundle was gone on a jumble of rides and three-throws-for-$5 
carnival games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fair is too expensive," Loren groused, as the three headed out of the 
midway in search of free entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 They wandered from building to building and figured out that they could eat 
for free if they accepted gratis food samples from the concessionaires, drink 
for free at the agriculture area water coolers and have a modicum of free fun 
at the contests announced over the fair's loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, they could check out the girls passing by. They meant to talk to 
some, Ian said, "but we really haven't gotten a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 They figured over the course of the fair that their chance would probably 
come. After all, it wasn't like they were in any hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do whatever," Ian said as they wandered past the face-painting booth. 
"It's, like, all up in the air." 
</P>

BERRY PETROLEUM PLEADS NO CONTEST IN OIL SPILL; PENALTY: COMPANY ORDERED TO PAY 
$600,000 TO SETTLE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT OVER DECEMBER PIPELINE RUPTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent company of the Ventura oil firm that spilled 84,000 gallons of 
heavy crude into McGrath Lake near Oxnard last December agreed Wednesday to pay 
$600,000 to settle a criminal complaint brought by local prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry Petroleum executives pleaded no contest Wednesday in Ventura County 
Municipal Court to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to report the spill, 
effectively ending the criminal side of the lengthy court case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plea does not insulate the company from an ongoing civil case being 
prepared by the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Edmonds of Ventura, the chief foreman on duty during the spill that 
lasted four days, also pleaded no contest Wednesday through his attorney to a 
misdemeanor charge of illegally releasing oil into marine waters. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ordered to perform 320 hours of beach cleanup and serve 18 months 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both no contest pleas amount to guilty pleas, although they cannot be used as 
evidence against either Berry Petroleum, which owns Bush Oil, or Edmonds in the 
civil case now being pieced together by state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 They also eliminate the possibility of prison time for Berry Petroleum 
executives or Bush Oil Co. workers, a threat made by local prosecutors in the 
early days of the two-month cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement money will be divided among Ventura County courts, the district 
attorney's office and two environmental enhancement funds operated by the state 
to restore damaged habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea agreement, the district attorney's office will receive more 
than $200,000 of the penalties -- reimbursement for attorney fees and 
prosecution costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $300,000 will go to the state Department of Fish and Game's Office of 
Oil Spill Prevention and Response, which will fund various environmental 
projects. About $27,000 will be given to the state treasury's environmental 
fund, and the courts will get about $73,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement does not include potential costs to Berry for the government's 
response and investigation of the massive spill, which closed seven miles of 
beaches, killed hundreds of birds and soiled the environmentally sensitive 
McGrath Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it preclude federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection 
Agency or the U.S. Coast Guard from proceeding with criminal charges against 
Berry principles or employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen M. Reiser, the Oxnard attorney retained earlier this year by the district 
attorney's office to prosecute the case, said the settlement was a good deal 
for Ventura County, which suffered significant environmental damage because of 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Berry Petroleum failed to adequately ensure the safe transport of its 
crude oil, and that the company was "absolutely" cutting corners to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their economic performance was not as substantial as they wanted it to be at 
that time," Reiser said of Delaware-based Berry Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, the company opted to use a long-abandoned pipeline to 
move its oil across Harbor Boulevard instead of trucking it, the prior lease 
operator's method of transport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berry officials accused the district attorney of denying the company a 
fair opportunity to prove its innocence. Vice President Raymond Hatch said the 
company would have preferred to take the case to trial, but said it was cheaper 
to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case presents a situation in which the almighty dollar blurred the 
vision of those in government who are obligated to seek the truth and do 
justice," Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch and his lawyers complained at a news conference Wednesday that the 
district attorney never conducted metallurgical tests on the ruptured pipeline, 
thereby never proving Berry's negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unthinkable that our government officials can assert to its citizens 
that they have 'investigated' this accidental pipeline rupture when they have 
refused to test the actual pipeline," Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reiser said it would have been a waste of taxpayer money to spend $10,000 
or more testing the ruptured pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every indication we have leads to the inescapable conclusion that this leak 
was the result of excess pressure in a corroded, unprotected pipeline," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the monetary fines, Reiser said: "If enhancing the environment is 
bowing to the almighty dollar, then I'm on the wrong planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Berry Petroleum already have filed claims with at least six 
local and state law enforcement agencies, claiming that those agencies failed 
to respond to earlier reports of the spill, which was not discovered until last 
Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims say that visitors to McGrath Lake in the days before Christmas told 
state park rangers and other officials about oil sightings, but that 
investigators neglected to check out those reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said that apparent oversight does not alleviate Berry's 
liability, in part because they failed to report or adequately repair another 
leak in the same pipe on Dec. 16 -- five days before the more serious spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company was in control of the operations," said Gregory W. Broce who 
heads the environmental unit at the district attorney's office. "This whole 
event would not have occurred if the company had done what it should have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investigators may order further cleanup at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Broce said he found clumps of oil just underneath the sand at McGrath Lake 
last month. He displayed photographs taken in July that show thick globs of 
what appears to be crude oil just beneath the surface at the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't dig up the whole beach," he said. "Mother Nature has to take its 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fish and Game attorney Stephen L. Sawyer, who is assembling the civil case 
against Berry Petroleum, said he might order another cleanup effort "very soon" 
after viewing the photographs for the first time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we may do is go back into a cleanup mode and order Berry to go back in," 
Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry maintained Wednesday that its cleanup efforts, which cost the firm $8.3 
million, were complete and effective in restoring the habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials offered photographs taken last month of endangered Western 
snowy plovers returning to the area as proof that the lake and beach are clean.

WOMAN, 85, DIES AFTER BUS MISHAP IN VENTURA; TRANSIT: LILLIE NEIL FELL AND HER 
LEGS WERE CRUSHED BY VEHICLE'S WHEELS. POLICE SAY IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE ACCIDENT 
HAPPENED.

<P>
 An 85-year-old Ventura woman died Wednesday after her legs were crushed by the 
wheels of a bus as it pulled away from her neighborhood bus stop about 20 yards 
from her home, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Ventura resident Lillie Neil was waiting at her bus stop on Telephone 
Road and west of Petit Avenue at about 8:25 a.m. Wednesday morning, when for an 
unknown reason she fell and was run over by the South Coast Area Transit bus, 
police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow," said Sgt. Gary Atkinson, "she ended up under the bus." He said it 
was unclear if she was running and tripped or was standing on the bus' step and 
fell when the bus started to move. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident marks the second fatal accident for South Coast Area Transit, 
which serves the western communities of Ventura County. A pedestrian was struck 
and killed by a SCAT bus in the early 1980s, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a passerby apparently motioned to the driver to stop after 
noticing an elderly woman trying to board the departing bus. "I don't believe 
that (the driver) saw this person waving," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rear wheels of the bus rolled over both Neil's legs, he said. She suffered 
a compound fracture to her left leg and was taken to Ventura County Medical 
Center, where she died five hours later after surgery Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver and passengers on the bus were unaware the woman had been struck, 
Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bus driver did not realize there had been an accident," Atkinson said. "A 
person sitting immediately behind the rear door did not realize there had been 
an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Ventura police and SCAT are continuing to investigate. SCAT officials 
would not comment on the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're still waiting for an investigation to be completed," said 
Maureen Hooper-Lopez, a spokeswoman for SCAT. "I'm real sorry to hear that that 
woman died." 
</P>
<P>
 SCAT bus drivers are trained to watch for elderly passengers who may need 
additional assistance, Hooper-Lopez said. She said east Ventura tends to have 
more older passengers than other areas that SCAT serves.  
</P>
<P>
 "In our training programs we do instruct our drivers to be especially watchful 
for seniors both getting on and off of the bus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors said Neil was an active woman who relied on the bus 
system for transportation to and from her home at the Buena Vida Apartments, 
where she had lived since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lost her license and her car a couple of years ago," said Cora Seymore, 
71, who lives in the same housing complex and worked with Neil at Camarillo 
State Hospital many years ago. Neil was a retired psychiatric technician, 
Seymore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Jennings, 33, who has lived in the apartment next door to Neil's for more 
than a year, was angered and saddened by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked," she said, tears welling up in her eyes. "I just feel, why her? 
Why did it have to happen to a nice lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was friendly and cheerful," Jennings said, adding that Neil's favorite 
subject of conversation was her family. "She talked about her son and her 
daughter and her family."

NEW GAS STUDIED IN DEATHS; TESTS: CARBON MONOXIDE IS NOW FOCUS OF STUDY IN 
RINCON OIL FIELD ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Analysts studying tissue and blood samples from three men killed in a Rincon 
oil rig accident last week said Wednesday they are now focusing on carbon 
monoxide as the most probable cause of the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Lab tests on samples taken from the workers who died are due today, but if 
they do not confirm carbon monoxide as the cause of death, more tests will have 
to be conducted, Senior Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying these deaths were caused by any specific gas," he said. 
"Anything is a possibility at this point. We're ruling out nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports from rescue personnel who tried to resuscitate the three men and 
four others who breathed the deadly fumes indicated that they may have inhaled 
hydrogen sulfide, a colorless gas that often exists in oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the accident eight days ago, medical examiners have downplayed the 
probability that hydrogen sulfide killed the oil rig workers because no one at 
the scene remembers smelling the rotten-egg stench that usually accompanies 
that gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials and state investigators said they have no idea how toxic 
carbon monoxide could have contaminated the Vintage Petroleum oil field about 
10 miles north of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot of theories from our people," said John Duncan, who is 
heading up the investigation by the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (Cal-OSHA). 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Furrow of Pride Petroleum, which employed the three men who died, said 
there was no visible source of carbon monoxide at the scene of last week's 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no big engines anywhere nearby there, and it would naturally 
dissipate into the atmosphere anyway," Furrow said. Nonetheless, he said he 
does not believe hydrogen sulfide killed the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the firemen got there, they recorded just trace amounts of (hydrogen 
sulfide), when there should have been some very high concentrations," Furrow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the other four guys were able to pull the three workers out of 
the pit (is questionable)," he added. "I'm not sure they would have left (the 
work pit) if they'd gotten a dose of hydrogen sulfide." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran said hydrogen sulfide gas is 
typically the first suspected in an oil field-related accident because it is a 
poisonous gas known to exist in and around underground crude oil deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 But interviews with the four men who survived the fumes and the emergency 
response crews who arrived on the scene have not yielded the usual evidence, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide "seem to be the only two reasonable 
gases" that could have killed the workers, O'Halloran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests for hydrogen sulfide already are being conducted at a laboratory out of 
state, the coroner said.

ELECTRICAL EXPLOSION IN BOILER ROOM CAUSES POWER OUTAGE AT ST. JOHN'S; 
HOSPITAL: UNEXPLAINED BLAST AT MEDICAL CENTER INJURES NO ONE. LACK OF POWER 
LEAVES PATIENTS WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING FOR HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An electrical explosion in the boiler room at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center in Oxnard Wednesday forced the hospital onto emergency power, darkened 
patients' rooms and caused cancellation of all non-emergency surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the 9:11 a.m. blast that sent smoke streaming into the 
air at the new northeast Oxnard facility. The loud boom it created was not 
discernible in patients' rooms situated in another building on the large 
medical campus, said Rita Schumacher, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other hospitals have called and offered assistance, but we're still taking 
emergencies," she said. "They are just being rerouted to the outpatient surgery 
building." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the eight patients scheduled for surgery Wednesday were transferred 
about six miles to St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, and others 
were rescheduled for today. But none of the 150 patients was evacuated, 
Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers from Southern California Edison, which supplies power to the hospital, 
and a private contractor, Taft Electric, were expected to work through 
Wednesday night to try to repair damage and restore the hospital power source, 
said Mike Montoya, area manager for Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Wednesday afternoon, no cause for the explosion had been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fault in their main panel," Montoya said. "It could have been a hot 
wire that touched another metal object, a hot lead that went to ground, or a 
number of things. They will have to investigate that." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred in the central plant, which is the terminal for all 
Edison power that comes into the facility, which opened in October, 1992. From 
there, the power is distributed throughout the facility.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when maintenance workers noticed smoke coming from the 
plant, said Capt. Ray Shaw of the Oxnard Fire Department. Soon afterward, there 
was an arc of electricity and a large flash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a pretty good bang, so it shook the (boiler) room a little and created 
quite a bit of smoke," he said. Although there was no fire, the force blew a 
wind turbine off the top of the building, allowing smoke to stream into the 
air, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency power generators kicked in seconds after the explosion, 
providing lighting in critical areas and keeping all necessary parts of the 
hospital functioning, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the power outage left patients without air conditioning for part of the 
hot day and with no television to entertain them. But workers managed to hook 
up air conditioning to the emergency power generators and the hospital was 
cooling off by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of our time today just informing patients about what was going 
on," said Vickie Lemmon, a nurse at St. John's. "Some patients just worried 
that they would have to be evacuated." 
</P>
<P>
 Without normal power, the kitchen switched gears as well, serving patients 
sandwiches and salads instead of normal fare such as roast beef and mashed 
potatoes, Lemmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 As evening fell, hospital nurses and administrators were visiting patients' 
rooms and searching for a means to supplement the dim emergency lights, 
Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thinking of battery-powered lanterns," she said. "We're exploring all 
the options."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 6 INJURED IN 2 RUSH-HOUR CAR CRASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two traffic collisions, half a mile and 45 minutes apart, combined to leave 
six people injured and rush-hour traffic snarled Wednesday near South Coast 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The first crash occurred just before 4 p.m., on the northbound San Diego 
Freeway between Fairview Road and Harbor Boulevard, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Six vehicles were involved in the chain-reaction collision in the car-pool and 
adjacent lane, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people were injured, including one person who was extricated from the 
vehicle with the help of a metal cutter, according to Costa Mesa Fire 
Department spokeswoman Susan Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The most seriously injured victim was taken by ambulance to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. Two others were taken to other area hospitals, Woods said. 
Two lanes of the freeway were closed for 30 minutes to remove the vehicles, but 
by 6 p.m. northbound traffic was still backed up to University Drive in Irvine, 
the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4:40 p.m., a second collision took place near the intersection of Bear 
Street and South Coast Drive, across from South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Three people also were injured in this crash, one seriously, according to the 
Costa Mesa Fire Department. That victim was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that a late-model Mercedes, traveling south on Bear 
Street, was turning on a green arrow into the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 A white, 1992 Pontiac Sunbird, traveling north on Bear, "blatantly ran the red 
light and hit the Mercedes," according to Officer George A. Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was cited, but an investigation is continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear Street was closed and "we had to divert a lot of traffic," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic around the shopping center was snarled for more than an hour, 
compounded by vehicles leaving the San Diego Freeway at Fairview Street to 
avoid traffic from the earlier accident.MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HEAT WAVE CONTINUES TO LOSE ITS STEAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Temperatures in the county continued to inch downward Wednesday, with 
indications that the heat wave may continue ebbing into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can expect temperatures to be close to normal over the next couple of 
days, not nearly as warm as it's been in the last few days," said meteorologist 
Dean Jones of WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures in the county Wednesday were equal to or slightly lower than 
Tuesday's, extending the cooling pattern. Anaheim recorded an 85, Santa Ana an 
88, Fullerton 87, Lake Forest 90, Irvine 93, Newport Beach 75, Laguna Beach 83 
and Dana Point 86. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast for today calls for low clouds and patchy early morning fog. By 
afternoon it should be mostly sunny, with highs ranging from the 70s along the 
coast to the low 90s inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones credited the cooling trend to the easterly movement of a high-pressure 
system to the southern Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's moved farther east, we're back into the normal summertime 
temperature regime for Southern California," he said. Marginal Cooling High 
temperatures were still in evidence Wednesday, leaving the county only somewhat 
cooler than Tuesday. Some selected readings: Anaheim: 85 degrees Santa Ana: 88 
degrees Newport Beach: 75 degrees Lake Forest: 90 degrees Irvine: 93 degrees 
Laguna Beach: 83 degrees Dana Point: 86 degrees Source: WeatherDataMARK I.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS WRONGFUL-DEATH 
PLEA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District board has rejected a $1-million 
wrongful-death claim filed by Scott and Jackie Hubbard, who alleged that the 
district negligently let a classmate stab their 14-year-old son to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Hubbard was killed last winter after schoolmate Phillip Hernandez stabbed 
him during a fight at Valley View Junior High School.Hernandez, 14, was 
sentenced to four years in a California Youth Authority prison for involuntary 
manslaughter last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubbards' administrative claim alleged that the school staff knew or 
should have known about an ongoing conflict between their son and Hernandez. 
They sought $1 million in damages from the Simi Valley school system and 
another $1 million from Ventura County because that is where the district is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board rejected the Hubbards' claim at its meeting Tuesdaynight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is normal procedure to reject claims made to the district," Assistant 
Supt. E. Leon Mattingley said. "The district will send (the Hubbards) a written 
notice that their claim has been rejected, and then it is up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hubbard said the family will go to court to file a lawsuit against the 
school district and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured they'd reject it," he said Wednesday. "We'll just go ahead with 
the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires plaintiffs to file administrative claims before filing a 
lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court. TRACY WILSON

 Officials at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation announced Wednesday 
that it has named a former Pepperdine University official to become its new 
deputy director and director of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry G. Bumgardner, a former associate vice chancellor at Pepperdine, has 
taken over the financial post at the foundation soon after the launch of a 
$20-million "Legacy Campaign" to support programs at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library and Center for Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumgardner, 37, of Thousand Oaks, worked 11 years in fund raising and public 
relations at Pepperdine. He also served as an assistant professor of 
communication and adjunct professor of law there and will continue to teach 
there on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of David Lipscomb University and the Vanderbilt School of Law in 
Nashville, Tenn., Bumgardner was a reporter and copy editor at the Nashville 
Banner before moving to Pepperdine in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legacy Campaign's goal is to raise $20 million for new permanent and 
temporary museum exhibits at the Reagan library and to endow conferences, 
lectures, research and other programs. MACK REED

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; DRUG LAB DESTROYED AFTER MAN'S ARREST 
</P>

<P>
 Police arrested an Irvine man Tuesday night and dismantled a drug 
manufacturing laboratory he was thought to be running in the converted garage 
at his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco A. Gutierrez, 25, was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of 
manufacturing methamphetamines and violating the conditions of his probation 
after police discovered about four ounces of drug crystals and chemicals and 
equipment used to make it, Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 After stumbling onto the suspected lab on Hermosa during a routine probation 
check, authorities advised several neighbors in the gated community to evacuate 
in case the chemicals exploded, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these are very volatile and explosive and they can cause a lot of 
damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and state hazardous waste units were called in as state narcotics 
officers dismantled the laboratory, where Gutierrez had been heating the liquid 
chemicals used to make the drug crystals when police arrived, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The room, a garage bay that doubled as Gutierrez's bedroom, was kept tightly 
sealed with soundproof walls and locks all around, he said. Gutierrez's parents 
apparently were unaware of the lab, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother was at the residence and claimed no knowledge of what was going on 
in her son's bedroom," Allevato said. "They even had a remote system to call 
him when it was time to go to dinner." A switch inside the house flashed a red 
light in the garage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was sentenced to a year in Orange County Jail and three years' 
probation last year for dealing drugs, according to court records. KEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL COMPUTER LINK IN THE WORKS

 Call it education without boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District is nearly halfway through a $10-million 
fund-raising campaign that aims to create a public education prototype for the 
age of information. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of engineering giant Fluor Daniel, the school district is 
designing a computer system that will link schools with local, national and 
international computer networks. Organizers hope that the "Foundations of the 
Future" project becomes a model for school districts throughout the country. It 
already has attracted the attention of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, which is planning to film a documentary about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most ambitious program of its type in the state," said John F. 
Dean, superintendent of the Orange County Department of Education and a member 
of the project's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine schools will be linked by computer to universities, libraries and other 
public schools throughout the country in addition to information data bases 
available through Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say the day will come soon when students working at 
home will be able to connect to the school district's computer system to 
complete homework assignments. They even will be able to send their teachers E 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the school board created a nonprofit organization to govern 
Foundations for the Future and revealed that the district has raised $4.9 
million in donations and pledges since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Working through the Russ Reid Co., a Pasadena marketing and fund-raising firm, 
the school district has secured a $3-million pledge from the Irvine Co. and 
major donations from Fluor Daniel, Dimension Cable, Pacific Bell, Standard 
Pacific Corp., the Irvine Health Foundation and others. Fund-raisers hope to 
reach the district's $10-million goal by the end of 1995, but some Irvine 
teachers already have begun training. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel is designing a computer system for the school district that 
initially will be "piggy-backed" onto the company's worldwide computer system. 
Dimension Cable will provide a fiber-optic network to interconnect Irvine 
schools and link them to worldwide computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is not the first school district to seek outside donations during a 
time of limited state education funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any district wants to go beyond the basic education package, they almost 
always have to go outside for extra funding," Dean said, "because there isn't 
research and development money available at the state level." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Greer, president of the Irvine Co.'s home-building division, has been 
active in calling on potential corporate donors. He said the school district's 
concept of how to use computer technology to develop students' critical 
thinking skills has loosened corporate purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology has been available, but the integration of this technology 
into the curriculum is what's really new here," Greer said. "This really is a 
model for the entire country." RUSS LOAR

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; FARM WORKERS THREATEN STRIKE FOR WAGE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 United Farm Workers at Moorpark's Muranaka Farms on Wednesday threatened to 
strike if the company does not approve wage increases and health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Tyre, a Los Angeles labor lawyer representing the company, and UFW 
President Arturo Rodriguez have been arguing over terms of a new contract for 
more than a week.Muranaka employs about 150 field workers, packinghouse 
employees and farm laborers on 450 acres of Ventura County farmland, Tyre said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Muranaka, the company's director, said it was too early in the process 
to comment on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers are divided into hourly earners and those paid for how much they 
pick in a day. The union is demanding a salary increase for all workers of 9% 
to 12%, said Mario Brito, the regional manager for the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a salary increase in four years," he said. "The cost of living 
has increased over that time, and a lot of people are just breaking even after 
paying for gas and food." 
</P>
<P>
 Brito said Rodriguez, son-in-law to the late Cesar Chavez, came to Moorpark to 
negotiate because the Muranaka contract was one of the last contracts Chavez 
had worked on before he died in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Brito said the union members, who flew banners and posted signs on their cars 
Wednesday, were considering taking other actions before striking, but would not 
specify what those actions would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyre, who said the company expects to make an offer to the union soon, said he 
did not expect a strike. The farm workers will meet Friday to discuss the 
latest developments in the contract negotiations, Brito said. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CALMAT MAY REPLACE STRIKING DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a strike by the local Teamsters Union against a construction materials 
company entered its fourth week, officials at CalMat Co. said they have begun 
interviewing new drivers to replace the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the process of interviewing and screening," said CalMat spokesman 
Mason Dickerson."But we haven't made any hires yet. It will probably take us 
several weeks to replace all the drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters have refused to accept a new contract with CalMat that includes 
a $2.20-an-hour pay cut and a reduction in health insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal mediator was brought in almost two months ago to aid negotiations, 
but talks broke down July 26 and have not resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters business agent Lyle Barnett said the strikers were aware that CalMat 
was conducting interviews Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did see new people being driven in earlier this morning," Barnett said 
Wednesday. "They're saddened to see it, but it has given them new resolve to 
stick together." 
</P>
<P>
 CalMat mailed letters to striking drivers last week telling them they would be 
replaced permanently if they did not return to work by Wednesday. MARY F. POLS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL ENDORSES SOS BALLOT MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city in which Proposition 187 was born has endorsed the controversial 
statewide initiative that targets illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Save Our State, the November ballot measure would bar illegal 
immigrants from attending public schools and prevent them from receiving social 
services or non-emergency public health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show widespread voter support for Proposition 187, which has been 
endorsed by the California Republican Party. Opponents include Latino rights 
organizations, immigrant activists and a broad coalition of religious leaders, 
health care professionals and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where the initiative began, almost one year (ago) today," Ron Prince 
told the City Council on Monday. Prince, a Tustin accountant, co-authored the 
ballot measure and is co-chairing its statewide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing Prince's presentation, the council voted unanimously and without 
comment to support the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came two weeks after the council unanimously passed a resolution 
urging Congress to address as a top priority issue "the escalating numbers of 
illegal immigrants crossing the border into California." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, which is similar to one adopted by the League of California 
Cities, cites the "severe negative fiscal and social impacts" that illegal 
immigrants create for state and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution also notes that the proximity of the Border Patrol checkpoint, 
which it contends is "inadequately equipped to detain illegal immigrants," has 
resulted in high-speed chases that endanger the lives of Orange County 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In his presentation to the council, Prince said that "we would like to 
determine who is here legally and who is not." He estimated that there will be 
3 million illegal immigrants in the United States by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that number, about 40% come from Mexico, he said, and the rest are from 
"virtually every country in the world." Many of these people tend to be 
uneducated and unskilled, Prince contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince seemed especially concerned about the estimated 400,000 undocumented 
children he said are attending U.S. public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking money away from our own children to give it to others," Prince 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have characterized Save Our State as an invitation to officially 
harass foreign-born people. The measure could result in undereducated children 
roaming the streets, prone to contagious diseases and drawn to crime, critics 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Save Our State also point out that illegal immigrants help 
support California's economy by providing low-wage labor and paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Proposition 187 passes in November, the provision barring illegal 
immigrants from receiving public education might never be implemented. In a 
landmark case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that illegal immigrant 
children are entitled to attend public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis by the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst's office found that 
the initiative could put at risk as much as $15 billion in federal funds now 
provided to California for health, education and welfare programs. ALAN EYERLY

<P>
 Orange County jumped to 73rd in Money magazine's ranking of the 300 "Best 
Places to Live in America," in the September issue released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was No. 185 in last year's ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside-San Bernardino area made a similar leap in this year's ratings, 
from 156 to 86. Ventura shot from 84th last year to 42nd. Los Angeles ranked 
66th in this year's survey, a drop from 58th last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 25 California metropolitan areas were included in the 300 U.S. cities 
ranked by Money magazine. The highest ranked was San Jose, which jumped from 
110th to fifth. The lowest California city was Yuba City, which climbed from 
296th last year to 291th. 
</P>
<P>
 Raleigh-Durham, N.C., was rated as the top place to live in the country.

 Firefighters extinguished a carport blaze Wednesday before wind-borne embers 
could ignite a nearby apartment complex, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-year-old boy and a 21-year-old woman suffered smoke inhalation and were 
treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire is "suspicious in origin and under investigation," according to 
Battalion Chief Kent Mastain. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim firefighters were aided by several units from the Orange County Fire 
Department at the blaze in the 1300 block of Fashion Lane at 2:45 p.m. Damage 
was estimated at $75,000 to the structure and $30,000 to the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky we got (hoses) onto the apartment roof to put out the embers," 
Mastain said. MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; CARWASH APPROVED DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will get a third carwash despite opposition from most of the 200 
residents who crowded into a City Council meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 4-1 vote for the project Tuesday night produced angry mutters 
from the large audience, which overflowed into the lobby of the council 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wally D. Linn, who favored the project, told the audience that he did 
not think the carwash was so unpopular with the overall city of 16,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think this was a nuclear plant we are approving here tonight," Linn 
said. "But it is only a carwash." He added that the central issue was land use 
and that conditions the city was placing on the carwash site made the project 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most in the audience indicated their disagreement with Linn and the 
council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, among other things, noted that La Palma already has one carwash and 
a second one received city approval about 18 months ago. A third carwash would 
be just too many for such a small town, the opponents contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who spoke against the project belong to a new citizens' 
organization called the Save the Vision Committee, which contended that the 
site at Moody Street and Crescent Avenue is too small for the carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also said the project would increase traffic congestion and 
would be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the project, however, responded that the city's conditions on 
the project include traffic safety measures. The project, supporters predicted, 
will be safe and financially successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicant for the project is Paul Son, who proposed both a carwash and a 
small convenience store on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 City public works director Ismile H. Noorbaksh recommended approving the 
application. Noorbaksh said the city had attached more conditions to the 
carwash project "than I have ever seen in the years I have worked for the city 
of La Palma." 
</P>
<P>
 Beside Linn, council members voting for the project were Larry A. Herman, 
David Lim and Duane F. Schuster. The opposing vote was cast by Councilwoman Eva 
G. Miner.BILL BILLITER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; EX-WORKERS AT DEFUNCT ABEX START OWN FIRM 
</P>

<P>
 Abex Aerospace shut down its Oxnard plant last December, but Louis Carrizales 
wasn't ready to give up the work he was doing there. 
</P>
<P>
 So he asked his father and his boss to join him in a new business. Together 
they bought the equipment they had used for years in Abex's hydraulics-testing 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now their tiny Oxnard firm, Custom Hydraulics & Instrumentation, does testing, 
design and repair work on everything from airplane valves to barber chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to make this a manufacturing center and employ other people and 
get some of that aerospace work back," said Carrizales, 33, who served as union 
president before Abex moved out of town. "You can never give up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the center of their work garage sits the group's latest project, a test 
simulator for an airplane valve. The machine, designed and built by the 
four-man business, will test the valve's ability to perform functions such as 
operating aircraft rudders and flaps. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away sit two barber's chairs with broken hydraulic lifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do anything," said Dale J. Filkins, the firm's vice president and 
Carrizales' former boss. "As of right now, none of us are making any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't capitalized very well. It's hoping that the check comes from the 
last job before we have to take the money out of our savings accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Carrizales works another job. Every morning at 6:30, he heads to a 
job in Camarillo, repairing and maintaining hydraulic equipment for Astrofoam 
Molding Co. After work, he heads over to his firm's small garage/office in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the firm has not advertised. Instead it relies on word-of-mouth and a 
network of former Abex workers to bring in projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A just-completed valve simulator will go to Pacific Hydraulics Systems in 
Santa Maria, another firm made up of former Abex workers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere we've been, we've found some Abex employees," said Al Carrizales, 
who worked nearly 30 years at the Oxnard plant before joining his son in the 
business venture. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

 Relatives of a teen-ager stricken with a deadly disease are appealing to the

</P>
<P>
 Ali Hussain, 13, has aplastic anemia, a condition in which bone marrow stops 
producing vital blood platelets. A bone marrow transplant from his twin 
brother, Zeshan, can save Ali, but the family has only $51,000 of the estimated 
$150,000 cost of the surgery. 
</P>

 "We are desperate to collect enough funds for treatment," said Tariq Rashid, 
the boy's uncle. "The only barrier left between this child living or dying is 
money."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; ACTION ON BILLBOARDS, SMOKING BAN PUT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council delayed decisions this week on proposals to break a 25-year 
city ban on freeway billboards and another to toughen a smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the absence of Councilman Frank Feldhaus, the council postponed a 
vote on a proposal by Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc., which wants to erect 10 
new freeway signs in the city. Regency has failed four times in the past 10 
years to receive city approval to put up freeway billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Their proposal calls for scattering the signs throughout the city, but 
concentrating four signs at the junction of the Orange and Riverside freeways. 
The signs would be up to 60 feet above the roadway, and would be up to 950 
square feet and at least 500 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for approval, Regency would tear down 13 existing billboards on 
smaller roadways in the city. The removal of the "old and unsightly structures" 
would improve street appearances, said Regency President Brian Kennedy in a 
letter to the city council last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Department opposed Regency's plan, arguing the roadway signs 
would diminish freeway appearances and could ruin a $1-million landscaping 
project. Planning staff also said the Regency proposal would interfere with 
ongoing efforts to enhance the appeal of the city's resort zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The council probably will consider Regency's proposal Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council put off a vote on a proposed smoking ordinance, 
which would prohibit smoking in all city-owned buildings, including Anaheim 
Stadium and the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly wanted to hear from city business and tourism officials before 
casting a final vote. Some city officials fear if smoking is further 
restricted, the city's tourist business will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are pussyfooting around," said Councilman Irv Pickler, who 
introduced the measure. "I think we need to take a stand." MARTIN MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CSUN ADMISSION DEADLINE IS TODAY

<P>
 Residents who want to take classes at Cal State Northridge's Ventura campus 
have until 7 p.m. today to apply for admission, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To take upper-division courses offered at CSUN's satellite campus in Ventura, 
students must have at least 56 college credits and must have already ordered 
transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 For those students already accepted for admission, registration continues 
until the first day of classes on Sept. 29, with late registration continuing 
until Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators are again expecting record numbers of students to sign up for 
courses at the Ventura campus, where more classes are being offered this fall 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a new record almost every fall and we are expecting that this year," 
said Joyce M. Kennedy, director of the campus. "We have added a bilingual 
teaching credential for the first time and are very pleased with the response. 
We also have added several more classes as a result of our fund-raising 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 State budget cuts in recent years forced the campus to cancel classes, 
dropping the total offered to 94 at one point. But through fund raising, 
including a telethon and solicitations to large corporations, the campus now 
offers 110 courses, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging to see that the fund raising we're doing for classroom 
instruction is really making a significant difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration this year has already reached just under 1,400 part-time 
students, or the equivalent of 558 taking full-time courses. Last year, the 
campus carried the equivalent of 605 full-time students. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy couldn't predict the final registration tally, but she said: "I expect 
that it will exceed that number." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the campus at 654-4575. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN IN 3-STRIKES CASE FACES NEW CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man facing a possible sentence of life in prison for petty theft 
under the state's "three-strikes" law must now stand trial for allegedly 
attempting to forcibly sodomize his cellmate, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III set an Aug. 31 Superior 
Court arraignment for Roosevelt C. McCowan after the alleged victim testified 
that McCowan chased him around his cell at Ventura County Jail for an hour and 
tried to sodomize him. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis ordered McCowan, 51 of Oxnard, to stand trial on two counts of 
attempted sodomy -- a ruling the defense called a partial victory because 
McCowan had been accused by prosecutors of one count of forcible sodomy and one 
count of sodomy committed in a correctional facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with his ruling because that significantly changes what this case 
is all about," Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily said. "And I think at 
trial, we are going to be able to demonstrate that this alleged victim is no 
victim at all. Nothing happened to this man." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have said that McCowan sodomized the man one day after being 
convicted of stealing 18 bottles of cologne and qualifying for a three-strikes 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the three-strikes statute, judges must sentence anyone who has two prior 
violent or serious felonies and who is convicted of a third felony to at least 
25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old alleged victim is serving a short jail term for petty theft.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to build a 13-unit, low-income housing complex in Camarillo's 
southwest corner has been approved by the Camarillo Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing complex, composed of two-story townhomes, will be near the corner 
of Barry Street and Glenn Drive.The commission voted unanimously to approve the 
project during its Wednesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, to be known as Casa Velasquez, was proposed by the Cabrillo 
Economic Development Assn. and will charge rents ranging from $580 to about 
$730, according to Jesse Ornelas, Cabrillo's project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornelas said the units will have two, three or four bedrooms and range in size 
from 903 to 1,201 square feet.  
</P>
<P>
 The project will be developed on a lot owned by the city, which has issued a 
55-year lease to the developers.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction is due to start in November, with completion expected sometime 
next spring. J.E. MITCHELL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PLAN FOR SCHOOLBOOK OBJECTION 
CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents who have complaints about books used in the Capistrano Unified School 
District will soon have a way to formally voice their displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed policy, considered by the school district board this week, requires 
that parents first notify their child's principal about concerns.If that 
doesn't resolve the complaint, a parent then could make a written complaint, 
which would be forwarded to the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary the district superintendent would appoint a reviewing committee, 
made up of five members, including a district administrator, the district 
librarian, a school-site administrator, teacher and parent. The parent would 
not be selected from the school where the complaint was lodged. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said on Monday that they wanted a few wording changes made in the 
proposed policy so parents would not feel discouraged from appealing any 
administrative decisions to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees also said they didn't think the policy would be used by parents to 
attack books or other materials they deem offensive. In the past, parents in 
the district have objected to materials about AIDS and other 
sexually-transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Anderson, president of the district teachers union, told trustees she was 
concerned that the policy could become a tool for a small but vocal group of 
parents intent on steering teachers away from using potentially controversial 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said such tactics could result in an "unofficial censorship" because 
teachers might avoid using certain materials altogether rather than take on the 
extra burden of assigning and grading alternate work for students whose parents 
ask to have them excused from regular assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Marlene Draper said, "I don't feel we are going to get into any 
major problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is expected to be back before the board next month. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; 4 TEEN-AGERS HURT IN GOLF CART 
MISHAP

<P>
 Four teen-agers suffered minor injuries late Wednesday morning when a golf 
cart they were riding in overturned on a residential street in a gated 
community, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four teens -- a girl and three boys -- were passengers in a cart driven by 
another teen-age girl, who was unhurt, California Highway Patrol Officer Mike 
Bernardin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four injured teen-agers were taken by paramedics to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Their names, and that of the driver, 
were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened about 11:30 a.m. on a downhill section of Rancho Cielo. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a witness, the golf cart rolled over after swerving. No other 
vehicles were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, Michael Lucas, said the golf cart was going about 35 m.p.h. when 
it toppled in the middle of the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardin said no citations would be issued because the crash occurred on 
private property. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; HOMEOWNER GROUP BOWS TO QUADRIPLEGIC

<P>
 A homeowners association has agreed to work with the family of a quadriplegic 
who needs to modify her home to accommodate her disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Darleen Dano, 59, requested permission to add an extra room to her first floor 
and build a wheelchair lift on her garage in early July, but the association 
did not respond to her request. 
</P>
<P>
 Dano suffered severe injuries in a car accident in January and has spent 
months learning how to live with a broken spine. On Monday, Dano was released 
from St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton but went to a nursing home until her 
home is modified. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Highland Greens Homeowners Assn. asked for more details on the 
additions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board of directors advised Ms. Dano that it could, in concept, agree to a 
room addition but required greater detail" about its architectural design, said 
a statement released Tuesday by the association's attorney, Janet Powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The board asked Dano to submit her plans and agreed to "expedite approval," 
the statement said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY WILL CONSIDER BAN ON CLOTHESLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members tonight will consider adopting an ordinance that would 
prohibit clotheslines on front and side yards visible from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents oppose the ordinance and call it unfair to poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us don't have back yards and we have to hang our clothes in the 
front," said Maria Lopez, a longtime Lois Street resident. "Telling us that we 
can't do that is just plain wrong. For as long as I can remember, people have 
dried their clothes on clotheslines in La Habra neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 She said clotheslines don't look bad or ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us don't have the money to dry our clothes at Laundromats or buy 
dryers," Lopez said. "The city shouldn't even be considering (prohibiting 
clotheslines). Most of the people who have clotheslines are Mexican and this is 
just pure racism." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the proposed ordinance is meant to keep residential and 
commercial areas clean and safe and have denied the move is racist. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council was expected to approve a slightly different version of the 
ordinance last month, Mayor David M. Cheverton said it was an attempt to curb 
blight in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as discriminatory against anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Bird, a Grace Avenue resident, said the ordinance "is going to be 
interpreted by a lot of people as being discriminatory toward Latinos and poor 
people, and I don't understand why it has to be adopted. It's only going to 
cause strife in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the law be adopted, Bird, who has a clothesline on the side yard of his 
home, would be in violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no back yard," he said. "Where am I supposed to dry my clothes?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is adopted, clothes could not be dried on fences, trees or shrubs. 
Hanging clothes on temporary clotheslines in yards not visible from the street 
would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed clothesline prohibition is part of a larger anti-blight 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some supporters of the anti-blight ordinance don't agree with the section that 
would outlaw clotheslines. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Rush, a City Council candidate, said she will ask the council to let 
people have clotheslines in their yards even if they are visible from the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 No public hearing is scheduled but the council is expected to vote on the 
ordinance at its meeting at 7 p.m. MIMI KO

LIST OF COUNCIL, MAYORAL CANDIDATES SWELLS TO 260; ELECTION: EXTENDED FILING 
PERIOD COMES TO CLOSE. ANOTHER 209 PEOPLE ARE ATTEMPTING TO WIN SEATS ON SCHOOL 
BOARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The small army of candidates vying for seats on city councils and school 
boards throughout Orange County grew even larger on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 260 people will vie for the 73 available council seats and six mayoral 
posts on Nov. 8, and 209 people will run for election in 30 school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because eligible incumbents in 20 cities chose not to run for reelection in 
November, including the mayors of Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Orange and 
Garden Grove, last Friday's filing deadline for their council or mayoral races 
was required by state law to extend through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for filing in 10 school board races was extended for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing extension meant that already crowded fields in some cities grew 
even more crowded. Most notably, in Anaheim 17 candidates are vying for two 
open seats; in Huntington Beach, 23 candidates are competing for four seats, 
and in Santa Ana, eight people are seeking the seat vacated by Mayor Daniel H. 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The county registrar of voters said Wednesday that it is impossible to know 
whether a record number of people are running in Orange County races or whether 
a record number of incumbents are sitting it out. 
</P>
<P>
 The only cities not forced to extend the filing deadline were Irvine, Newport 
Beach, Placentia, Stanton and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, where there are four open seats, City Clerk Connie 
Brockway said it is unusual to have two eligible incumbents opting not to run. 
Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson is running for the 2nd District seat on the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors, and Councilman Earle Robitaille chose not 
to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 The changing of the guard is apparent in other cities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Patterson, other mayors not up for reelection are Santa Ana's 
Young, Garden Grove's Frank Kessler and Orange's Gene Beyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime council members not running again include Yorba Linda's Henry W. 
Wedea, Laguna Beach's Lida Lenney and Robert F. Gentry, and San Juan 
Capistrano's Gary L. Hausdorfer. School Board Candidates 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees will be elected Nov. 8 in 30 school and community college districts. 
Last Friday's initial filing deadline was extended to Wednesday because some 
incumbents decided not to seek reelection. Here are the candidates in eight

WIFE OF OXNARD MAYOR TO RUN FOR HARBOR DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irma Lopez, the wife of Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, announced Wednesday that 
she will seek one of three open seats on the Oxnard Harbor District's board of 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't an overnight decision," Irma Lopez said of her desire to join the 
board that governs the deep-water Port of Hueneme."I've been looking at that 
position for two years. I think I can bring another dimension to the 
commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, an employee at the Oxnard Employment Development Department 
unemployment office, was seriously injured last year during the shooting 
rampage by unemployed engineer Alan Winterbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez has been on leave from work while she heals, but said her condition 
would not affect her longtime plans to run for the harbor district. In fact, 
the incident enhanced her desire to run for office, according to the written 
statement she issued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm well on my way to recovery," she said.

COURT BACKS CITY BID TO SELL WATER IN CREEKS; THOUSAND OAKS: RULING OVERTURNS 
1992 DECISION CITING INADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT. FARMERS SAY THE BATTLE 
HAS NOT BEEN LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city of Thousand Oaks has the right to take treated sewage water from the 
Calleguas and Conejo creeks and sell it for agricultural use, an appeals court 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal, overturning a lower court decision, ruled 
that an environmental report prepared by the city on its plan to sell the creek 
water to the Pleasant Valley Water District is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's plan was initially blocked after Santa Rosa Valley farmers filed a 
lawsuit challenging the city's right to the water. The farmers use the treated 
water, discharged from a municipal sewer plant into the creeks that cut through 
their land, to help irrigate crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a Ventura County judge sided with the farmers on the issue nearly two 
years ago, the city had entertained the possibility of modifying its water 
project, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with Wednesday's victory, the city should have more leverage in those 
discussions, according to an attorney for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the legal dispute arose, a city-commissioned environmental study had 
found that taking 10,000 acre-feet of the water from the creeks would not harm 
the environment. The plan was to sell the water to the Pleasant Valley Water 
District, which in turn would use it to supply growers of the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County Superior Court Judge Frederick A. Jones ruled in December, 
1992, that the environmental report did not adequately analyze the project's 
effect on the 1,400 acres of agricultural land owned by, among others, Camlam 
Farms, Fitzgerald Farms and B-H Farms in the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' ruling said the report did not consider alternative projects that would 
share the water with the farms. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, the Ventura-based appeals court disagreed with the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the city's (report) is not a model of precision or clarity, it does 
meet the requirements of CEQA," wrote Justice Pro-Tem Ronald Schoenberg in the 
unanimous decision, referring to the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the farmers involved in the case do not believe they have lost their 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been, and continue to be, ongoing discussions between all the 
public agencies involved, and we believe that notwithstanding this decision, 
those discussions will continue," said attorney David Lamb, who represents the 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb, who was aware of Wednesday's decision but had not read it, said the 
farmers also expect the project to be modified so it is "beneficial to all of 
the parties involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark G. Sellers could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Johnson, a Sacramento-based attorney representing the city, was 
pleased with the reversal of the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 She verified that the city has been discussing alternative solutions to the 
dispute with the farmers. She also said that Thousand Oaks may have more 
options in solving the dilemma now that the appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she also had not read the ruling and would only say that now the city 
"may be free to go forward with the project that was the subject of the 
environmental dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 After the farmers won their initial victory in the lower court, they hoped the 
city would be willing to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, the farmers said one option the city had was to revise its 
environmental report to comply with Jones' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city responded by filing a complaint with the state Water Resources 
Control Board to stop the farmers from irrigating their crops with the free 
waste water. The outcome of that complaint was unclear Wednesday.

JUDGE AGAIN CONTINUES ARRAIGNMENT IN WESTLAKE SHOOTING CASE; COURTS: DEFENDANT 
JOHN YI, 17, OF THOUSAND OAKS IS GRANTED SECOND TWO-WEEK CONTINUANCE THIS 
MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than six months after three Westlake High School students were shot in a 
brawl, the case against the defendants hit a new delay Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the latest snag triggered a charge from the mother of one of the victims 
that the slow-moving justice system is preventing the injured from returning to 
normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous, it really is," said Kathryn Behling, mother of 17-year-old 
David Behling, who was shot in the back of the head. "These kids can't get on 
with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County Superior Court on Wednesday, Judge Bruce A. Clark continued 
the arraignment of defendant John Yi of Thousand Oaks. It is the second 
two-week continuance this month that has been granted to Yi, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi told the judge that he needs more time to raise money to pay his private 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with four felony counts, including assault with a firearm, Yi has 
declined the judge's offer of court-appointed legal counsel. William T. 
Graysen, Yi's attorney, said Wednesday he expects to be rejoining the case 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yi's financial dilemma is just one in a string of delays in the case -- 
which entered the judicial system in Juvenile Court before being moved to adult 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Other delays in the case have been prompted after defense attorneys 
disqualified two judges from holding pretrial hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the four defendants caused several court hearings to be postponed 
after he disappeared. James Lee, 16, of Thousand Oaks, is believed to have gone 
to Taiwan, his homeland, to avoid prosecution, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defendants were charged after a melee at North Ranch Park near the 
high school on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court testimony, Lee and football player Curtis Simmons agreed to 
meet at the park for a fistfight to settle a dispute. Lee, the other three 
defendants and other supporters allegedly emerged from five different vehicles 
and announced: "We're the Asian Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
 By late April, all four boys were ordered to stand trial as adult 
co-defendants. But Lee skipped out on his $5,000 bail shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark heard the preliminary hearing and ordered Yi and defendants Oubansack 
(Andy) Sonethanouphet, 16, and William Huang, 17, to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonethanouphet, of Brea in Orange County, and Huang, of Rowland Heights in Los 
Angeles County, were given Sept. 9 trial dates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yi was never arraigned and given a trial date. At the Aug. 3 hearing, Yi 
made his first request to delay his arraignment for two weeks, until Wednesday, 
so he could come up with the cash to pay his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Behling said that she understands the many delays considering there 
are multiple defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the wait is especially infuriating considering so many other 
cases have been settled or seem to be moving along well during the same time. 
For instance, she noted that Phillip Hernandez -- a Simi Valley eighth-grader 
who fatally stabbed a 14-year-old classmate two days before the Westlake brawl 
-- has already been tried and sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it seems to be going pretty fast for O.J. Simpson," the mother added of 
the high-profile Los Angeles murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the condition of her son, who was away with a church group and not 
available for comment Wednesday, she said he spent five days in the hospital 
after being shot in the back of the head at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 He continues to suffer from headaches, but will still try to play football his 
senior year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to cure the headaches, and he still has some vision 
impairment. Not enough to keep him down," she said.

GARDEN GROVE TIGHTENS RULES ON FOODS SERVED AT FESTIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council has approved tougher restrictions on food and drink sold or 
given away at the Strawberry Festival, the Korean Festival and other community 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an ordinance approved by a 4-1 vote Tuesday, only food prepared in 
restaurants or at the festival grounds -- and inspected by health officials -- 
may be sold at the events. The council passed the law to minimize improper food 
handling. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions would cover the annual chili cook-off, a popular contest for 
the best chili recipe, and the Strawberry Festival held each year during 
Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should not be a problem for us," said Barbara Burch, president of the 
Strawberry Festival, where food and drinks are prepared on site. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Tindall said the ordinance would make current Orange 
County health regulations tougher and allow city officials to close food booths 
that do not meet health standards. 
</P>
<P>
 No alcohol may be sold at the festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the ordinance for final approval Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 A provision to require police officers or firefighters to check the 
temperature of the food at the food booths was deleted from the ordinance. 
Instead, county health officials will be required to make sure that spoiled 
food is not sold. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ordinance requires workers at each food booth to have a food 
thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a problem with cops and firemen being (on) a hot dog patrol," said 
Mayor Frank Kessler, a former Garden Grove police chief. "We can't have them 
around checking" thermometers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes, who voted against the ordinance, said that the law did 
not provide a way for the city to recover the cost of inspecting the food 
booths. He added that the ordinance did not define clearly what constitutes 
"potentially hazardous food" that must be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Health and Safety Code, potentially hazardous food is 
defined as any food capable of "supporting rapid and progressive growth of 
microorganisms that may cause food infections." 
</P>
<P>
 Hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, baked potatoes, chili and other foods are sold in 
booths operated by the Kiwanis, Girls and Boys Clubs and other local service 
groups at the Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the festival raised more than $100,000 for local charities, Burch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Festival will be held Oct. 14-16 on Garden Grove Boulevard. 
Sponsored by the Korean Chamber of Commerce of Orange County, it has been held 
for the past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to food booths, the festival features cultural shows and a parade 
by members of the county's Korean American community.

CONVICTED MOLESTER BEGINS PAROLE; CRIME: KYLE HOCHSTRASER REPORTS IN PALMDALE. 
HIS VICTIM SAYS SHE'S SENTENCED TO A 'LIFETIME OF NIGHTMARES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Kyle Hochstraser, known as Richard Streate when he entered the state prison in 
Tehachapi a year and a half ago, was released Wednesday and immediately 
reported to his parole officer in Palmdale, three years after molesting his 
goddaughter, a former Newbury Park girl.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Desiray Bartak, the 14-year-old victim, said in Los Angeles that it 
doesn't matter what name he uses; she said she knows him as the predator who 
abused her trust to steal her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to prison, but he's the one who got off easy, she said during a news 
conference at her lawyer's Wilshire Boulevard office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Streate has served his time, but I am sentenced to a lifetime of 
nightmares he caused me when he murdered my childhood," Desiray said. In the 
nightmares, he appears in a blond wig and red lipstick, and she is always 
running from him, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 She told reporters she wants the world to know how he crept into her bed when 
she was 10, making her "perform sexual acts that only a husband and wife would 
do." If the world knows her story, she said, maybe he won't be able to molest 
another child. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she said, the criminal justice system let her down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very angry at the justice system, that they let him out," she said. "I'm 
mad at the judge for not giving him the maximum sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray was molested twice, during the July 4 weekend in 1990, and again in 
August, 1991. After Hochstraser was charged in June, 1992, Desiray, her mother, 
Wayanne Kruger, and her attorney Gloria Allred pleaded with Lancaster Superior 
Court Judge Haig Kehiayan to impose the maximum eight-year sentence. Instead, 
he sentenced the defendant in 1993 to the minimum, three-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison work and good-behavior credits further reduced his sentence by half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Desiray, in her own way, struck back. In January she won a $2-million 
verdict in an unprecedented lawsuit against her molester. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is now common for victims of sexual abuse to sue their abusers, 
Desiray's case was believed to be the first where a child victim sued and 
prevailed. So far, the case hasn't brought her a dime, but it had earned her 
national recognition as a symbol for children's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to grow up," Desiray said, appearing poised and gravely serious at the 
news conference. "I had to become an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray and her mother have moved to Northern California, and have obtained a 
restraining order to keep Hochstraser from coming within 35 miles of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Hochstraser has found a job in Palmdale, moved in with a 
relative "in a remote location," and will be closely monitored, state parole 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has two weeks to register as a sex offender at the Antelope Valley 
Sheriff's Station. Neighbors with children will be notified about his record. 
And, he will not be living with his wife and his own children because the terms 
of his parole forbid contact with minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hochstraser also will be required to attend an outpatient clinic for parolees, 
meeting weekly with a psychiatrist, said Jerry Di Maggio, a regional parole 
administrator. He will be barred from places where minors congregate. "If we 
catch him around a school, he will go to jail," Di Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, just knowing Hochstraser was free was enough to jangle Desiray's 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard for me to get to sleep last night, knowing he's getting out 
today. I felt as though I had my life back. Now, I'm back in the same 
predicament I was in two years ago."

COUNTY LIBRARY'S SUMMER READING PROGRAM A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County library officials are proclaiming their summer reading program a 
success, saying that the storytelling sessions and musical performances have 
drawn more than 12,000 children during the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's program, "Western Tales and Trails," highlights books 
and songs about cowboys, gold and living in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading series runs through Aug. 27. Children and their parents can still 
catch several performances at library branches around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Today , stagecoach rides will be offered at 2:30 p.m. at La Palma Library, 
7842 Walker St. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Samba N'Go Pop will give two musical performances at the San Juan 
Capistrano regional library, 31495 El Camino Real. The performances will be at 
7 and 9 p.m. On Aug. 27, that library will present Latin jazz concerts at 7 and 
9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, K.C. & Company will perform cowboy songs and stories at 2 p.m. 
at the Laguna Beach library, 363 Glenneyre St. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading program has been going on for three months. As of mid-July, 12,500 
children had taken part in activities, county library spokeswoman Cheryl Pruett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to encourage children to read and look at the library as a source 
for reading and entertaining and exploring the world," Pruett said.

WILSON URGES PENALTY FOR DEADBEAT PARENTS; POLITICS: GOVERNOR PROPOSES LAW TO 
SUSPEND DRIVER'S LICENSES OF THOSE WHO FAIL TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT. ATTORNEY 
GENERAL ALSO ADDRESSES ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday called for a new law that would allow the 
suspension of driver's licenses of "deadbeat" parents who fall behind on their 
child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a spokesman for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown 
contended that Wilson had borrowed a page from Brown's policy book, saying she 
had proposed last April that parents who fail to pay child support be 
"ineligible for all state licenses or colleges and universities." 
</P>
<P>
 Child support enforcement was also discussed Wednesday by state Atty. Gen. 
Daniel E. Lungren at a separate campaign stop in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 During a speech before the Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach Chambers of 
Commerce at the Waterfront Hilton, Wilson said the plan to suspend driver's 
licenses was the latest addition to a package of welfare reforms he has 
advocated during his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are delinquent on your child support payments, we will suspend your 
driver's license or even your professional license," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot casually father a child and walk away, no strings attached; you 
cannot pass your child and his mother onto the welfare rolls for the taxpayers 
to support. That's simply not fair, and we will not tolerate it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed driver's license suspension -- which is expected to be introduced 
during the next legislative session -- would occur once parents are found to be 
more than four months behind on their child support payments, according to a 
statement released by Wilson's office. The license would be returned when the 
payments are made or the parents "have an agreement in place to make payments." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of professional licenses to recover child support payments was 
approved by the Legislature two years ago. The law also allows the denial or 
non-renewal of commercial driver's licenses.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst criticized the governor's 
proposal. "The welfare system has gotten worse, not better," he said. "Pete 
Wilson is trying to reinvent his record at this stage of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy he's accepting our platform," Whitehurst added, contending that 
Brown's proposal goes even further than Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wilson's luncheon speech, eight former welfare recipients talked about 
how they got off welfare, during a public round-table discussion led by the 
governor's wife, Gayle Wilson. Most of the women credited the state program 
known as GAIN (Greater Avenues for Independence) with helping them move into 
the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 While praising the program, the group suggested that more attention be given 
to helping women meet child-care expenses as they try to re-enter the job 
market; that counselors do more to motivate women; and that solutions be found 
for women who do not speak English but could be trained for work. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor was initially scheduled to attend the meeting with the former 
welfare recipients but was instead near San Luis Obispo surveying the area 
consumed by a firestorm that claimed more than three dozen homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's forum was the latest in a series of meetings the governor's office 
has sponsored in Orange County to call attention to Wilson's major policy 
initiatives. Past meetings have included discussions with victims of rape and 
other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also told the luncheon audience that within the next month his 
administration will file a third lawsuit against the federal government. It is 
part of a package of lawsuits partly aimed at recovering the costs of 
incarcerating, providing health care and educating illegal immigrants. The 
third lawsuit will specifically address the education of illegal immigrant 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Wilson told reporters that the lawsuit will not ask for reimbursement 
of providing public education to children who were born in the United States 
but whose parents are illegal immigrants, even though the state is lobbying 
Congress for those funds. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the previous two suits concerning the imprisonment and health care of 
illegal immigrants, the next lawsuit will attempt to require the federal 
government to "actually enforce the law, to secure the border," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who is being challenged by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), 
told the Orange County Bar Assn. at the Hyatt Regency in Irvine that 
white-collar crime, including non-payment of child support, "costs the economy, 
the government and deeply erodes the confidence in the (criminal justice) 
system." The costs "are staggering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren criticized the Clinton Administration's crime bill -- which has 
stalled in Congress -- because it does not target white-collar crimes such as 
money laundering, counterfeiting, grand theft and the failure to pay child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a defined effort (in the bill) to deal with crime in a targeted way? 
I have doubts," Lungren told reporters afterward. "This thing doesn't have a 
single focus to it. I guess you can say I'm not overly enthusiastic about the 
bill."

<P>
 He was instrumental in creating the Civic Center. The improvements made to the 
median along Beach Boulevard are also his doing -- not to mention synchronizing 
the traffic signals on Katella Avenue and the development of a comprehensive 
capital improvements program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city will soon have to find a replacement for Fred Wickman, the public 
works director who announced he will retire Sept. 11 to take a job with an 
engineering consulting firm in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also have to find a new city engineer, for Wickman wore two 
hats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have enjoyed my years of employment," Wickman said. "The city has given me 
the opportunity to be involved with a wide variety of projects that have been 
beneficial to my professional growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Wickman has worked for the city since November, 1989, and was appointed public 
works director and city engineer in 1991. He is responsible for reviewing the 
particulars of all private development and public works projects and is also in 
charge of maintaining all city infrastructure and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Greg Hulsizer said he will miss Wickman and his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a valuable member of our team," Hulsizer said. "His practical 
approach to development and maintenance issues have left a positive mark on the 
community. We wish him the very best in his new position." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hire an interim public works director and city engineer. 
Recruitment for a permanent replacement will begin in the next couple months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickman will work for Willdan Associates, an engineering consulting firm that 
provides engineering services to public agencies. TOM RAGAN

TASK FORCE SEEKS TO BOLSTER FIRE PREVENTION MEASURES; REPORT: IT RECOMMENDS 
ADOPTION OF TOUGHER BUILDING CODES AND INCREASED TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO BATTLE 
BLAZES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to prevent catastrophic wildfires, like the one that devastated 
Laguna Beach last year, Orange County fire officials are asking the Board of 
Supervisors to endorse more stringent building and fire codes, as well as 
increase training for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we could learn from" last October's fire, said Orange County Fire 
Chief Larry J. Holms, who headed a task force that studied the blaze. "We 
looked for information that we could apply for next time or to prevent another 
such incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Wildland / Urban Interface Task Force analyzed the causes of 
Orange County's 1993 firestorm and looked for ways to improve fire prevention 
measures and firefighting techniques, Holms said. The firestorm destroyed or 
damaged 441 homes at a cost of $528 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force consisted of more than 70 people representing the fire 
departments, the county, cities, developers and others. The group's report has 
been forwarded to the board for adoption Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very comprehensive package," said Michael M. Ruane, director of the 
county's Environmental Management Agency. "We're looking at the county being a 
model and creating a uniform fire strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real credit to Chief Holms and other fire department chiefs in the 
cities who decided not to just deal with the fire, but also to be proactive for 
the future," Ruane added. 
</P>
<P>
 Holms said the task force is recommending that tougher building codes be 
adopted throughout the county to require that houses in fire hazard areas have 
enclosed roof eaves. Houses on stilts also should be enclosed to "prevent 
trapping of heat and burning embers" underneath them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the task force's recommendations are aimed at making "a house more 
defensible" in the event of a wildfire, Holms said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommendations in the report include supporting "vegetation management burn 
projects," encouraging the insurance industry to give premium credits to 
homeowners in fire hazard areas who implement fire safety measures, and 
evaluating minimum training levels for county fire agencies to handle wildfires 
that encroach on urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October's firestorms destroyed more than 1,200 structures, burned nearly 
2,000 acres, and left four people dead in Southern California.

 Things to know about Ralph Tamm, a San Francisco 49er guard: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He succeeded Roy Foster as a starter on the right side last season and by 
December had earned a three-year, $2.75-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He can bench press 490 pounds, about 50 more than any teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He doesn't know much about football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralph is funny," tackle Harris Barton told the San Francisco Chronicle. "He 
knows what me and him are supposed to do, but he really doesn't know the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we were playing the Raiders in the preseason and Bill Musgrave 
was leading the team downfield, and he threw an interception in the end zone. 
Everybody groans. Ralph goes, 'What's that mean?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Touchback. Their ball on the 20.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He says, 'Don't we get any points?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No, Ralph, geez.' He yells, 'I don't know the rules, I just line up and 
play ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Add Tamm: Then there was one of the first practices after the 49ers signed Tim 
McDonald. The Pro Bowl safety was coming across the line when Tamm chopped him 
at the knees with a vicious block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Young took Tamm aside and said, 'Don't you know who that is?' " Barton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yeah, I know,' Ralph said. 'That's No. 46.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Ralph, that's Tim McDonald,' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says, 'Who's Tim McDonald?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Besides being NBA head coaches last season, what do Pat Riley, 
Rick Adelman, Rudy Tomjanovich and John Lucas have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball crazy, indeed: In North Carolina, there is now proof that the love 
for basketball knows few limits. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Charlotte Hornet newsletter, the rights to eight season 
tickets were recently sold at a bankruptcy auction for more than $160,000. The 
buyer still needs to purchase the tickets for another $21,648, assuming they 
are in the prime location described. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets have about a 98% renewal rate among season ticket-holders, who buy 
about 21,000 of the 23,698 seats in Charlotte Coliseum. So those wanting to be 
close to the action are eager for a chance to be given better seats through 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike zone: New York Met Manager Dallas Green's take on striking baseball 
players: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't anticipate many of them going out and getting jobs. A few of them 
might have to fire their gardeners and chauffeurs." 
</P>
<P>
 Dynasty: Florida State's football team has won 16 consecutive conference 
games, outscoring its opponents, 679-173. Even worse for the rest of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference, there is nothing to indicate a change is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not talking about humans here," North Carolina Coach Mack Brown said. 
"It's not an ACC problem, it's a national problem. Those guys are really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: All were drafted by the San Diego/Houston Rockets.

<P>
 Backup quarterback Chris Chandler had some problems with the audiblizer, the 
new helmet headset that links the quarterback to the coaches, during the Rams' 
28-10 exhibition loss to the New England Patriots on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's headset went dead on one series, leaving him stranded because he 
hasn't learned the coaches' hand signals used to send in plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still getting used to that voice in our helmets," Chandler said. " 
Chris (Miller) and I haven't learned the signal system because we didn't think 
we needed to. When it (the headset) went dead on me, there was a second of 
panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Microphones on the headsets are live until 15 seconds are left on the play 
clock, allowing coaches to radio in plays, which "speeds up the game," Chandler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' search for a defensive end continued when they worked out Jeff 
Bryant, a free agent who played for Coach Chuck Knox in Seattle. Bringing in 
Bryant indicates the team's waning interest in four-time Pro Bowl defensive end 
Charles Mann, who worked out Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have yet to make a contract offer to Mann, 33, an 11-year veteran who 
has undergone nine knee operations, including two arthroscopic surgeries in the 
last year. Mann also wants to be an every-down player, but the Rams want to use 
him strictly as a pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Miller said he expects the first-team will get nearly three quarters of work 
in Saturday night's exhibition game against the Raiders. . . . Starting tight 
end Troy Drayton, who has yet to catch a pass in the exhibitions, made two 
tough catches in practice Wednesday. . . . Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, who

 Former Ram Jim Everett has apparently won the starting quarterback job with 
the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans broke training camp in La Crosse, Wis., with Everett having beaten 
out Wade Wilson for the job, Coach Jim Mora said. Doug Nussmeier, a No. 4 draft 
choice from Idaho, will be the No. 3 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real good about quarterback," Mora said. "I liked those guys before 
camp; I like them better now that I've seen them."

 Commissioner Paul Tagliabue restored Tony Casillas' unrestricted free-agent 
status after a two-hour meeting with the former Dallas Cowboy defensive lineman 
and his agent, Tom Condon. 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas signed a four-year, $6-million contract with the Kansas City Chiefs 
in the off-season. He then did not report and returned his $1.2 million signing 
bonus, citing concerns about his health. He had been found to have borderline 
hypertension and was under the care of an internist and cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs, alarmed over reports that Casillas wanted to return to the 
Cowboys, who now are coached by his former college coach, Barry Switzer, asked 
for a tampering investigation. 
</P>

<P>
 Miami Dolphin middle linebacker John Offerdahl signed a one-year contract 
loaded with playing-time incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury-prone Offerdahl agreed to a base salary of $162,000 with a rising 
scale of incentive pay based on playing time.

 Quarterback Shawn Moore was angry after being cut by the Denver Broncos, who 
decided on Tommy Maddox and Hugh Millen as John Elway's backups. Moore said his 
$273,000 salary is the reason he lost the battle to Millen, a former Patriot 
quarterback who signed for the minimum of $162,000. . . . New York Jet receiver 
Rob Moore underwent surgery designed to speed up the healing process for his 
broken left wrist. The surgery could make Moore available sooner than the 
originally announced four to six weeks. . . . Kicker Scott Sisson, cut by the 
New England Patriots this week, was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers, who are still expected to go with Michael Husted this season. . . . 
Philadelphia Eagle running back Charlie Garner, the team's second-round draft 
pick, will be sidelined indefinitely because of a stress fracture of the rib. . 
. . Chicago Bear wide receiver Terry Obee suffered a broken leg and dislocated 
ankle and will sit out the season.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL SMILING AS CAMP ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the final practice of the Raiders' final day in Oxnard ended Wednesday, one 
coach, a smile on his face, said, "Hear that sound. They've got the motors on 
their cars running in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 And when a smiling Coach Art Shell cut short the traditional sprints at the 
end of practice, a cheer went up. 
</P>
<P>
 No more two-a-day workouts. No more long days and nights away from the family. 
No more Camp Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a killer," said defensive lineman Anthony Smith. "It was a monster. 
But, you know, everything turned out just about right. This is just about the 
time to leave. Everybody is tired of two-a-day workouts. They can be physically 
and mentally draining. But then players aren't happy unless they are 
complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell couldn't be happier with the results of 5 1/2 weeks in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to go home," he said. "This has been a good camp. This has been a 
really good camp. But then, we have better players than we've had in recent 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to single out younger players who impressed him in Oxnard, Shell 
mentioned linebacker Rob Holmberg, who led or shared the team lead in tackles 
in each of the last two games, linebackers James Folston and Rob Fredrickson 
and running back Calvin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell also singled out the elements for praise, thrilled that the Oxnard 
weather was hotter and more conducive to training than it had been in recent 
summers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if the Raiders are going on vacation. They are due to report to 
their year-around headquarters in El Segundo about 8 this morning, attend 
meetings, take part in a walk-through drill and then a full workout in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still two exhibition games remaining, starting Saturday night in 
Anaheim against the Rams, followed by the long, 16-game grind. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least Camp Shell is in their rear-view mirror. STEVE SPRINGER

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: FATHER-DAUGHTER ENTRY ONE OF A KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father and son racing against one another has become commonplace -- the 
Pettys, Unsers, Andrettis, etc. -- but how about a father and daughter in the 
same race? 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Pankratz, 48, a veteran U.S. Auto Club competitor from Orange, and his 
daughter, Randi, 23, a three-quarter midget racer from Cayucos, are both 
entered in a USAC western regional midget race Saturday night at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Randi's first full midget race after having competed in 
quarter-midgets from age 9 until she was 16 and three-quarter midgets since 
then. She will be in the midget owned and usually driven by her father. He will 
be in one owned by Ron Weeks of Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she beats me, she's fired," Pankratz said. "Of course, I've given her an 
80-pound weight advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Randi, 5 feet 2 and 105 pounds, was an all-league point guard for Anaheim 
Canyon High before giving up basketball to concentrate on a racing career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is terrible enough to get beat one-on-one (in basketball) by your 
13-year-old daughter," said Pankratz, a former Fullerton JC and Idaho State 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleepy Tripp, a two-time national and seven-time regional midget champion from 
Costa Mesa, observed Randi in a TQ race and told her father, "She always looks 
like she's in command of her car." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Jordan, USAC communications director, said he believed it would be the 
first father-daughter competition in the organization's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Pankratz, a second-generation driver who did not become a racer 
until he was 27 because of his mother's objections, has been competing on the 
USAC midget, super modified and Silver Crown dirt car series this year. He won 
a midget main event at Bakersfield Speedway in Oildale and was fast qualifier 
in a super modified race at Provo, Utah, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Before driving at Ventura on Saturday night, Pankratz will be in a Silver 
Crown race at Springfield, Ill., that afternoon. Then he will take a private 
plane with fellow racers Billy Boat, Robbie Flock and Tony Stewart to Oxnard, 
where a helicopter will be waiting to take them to Ventura -- hopefully in time 
for the first heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Wally was a late starter, racing has been a way of life in the 
Pankratz family. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Bob, was a popular driver during the midget racing heyday of the 
'40s at Gilmore Stadium. He suffered a serious head injury in a 1948 accident 
and turned to building cars for drivers such as Troy Ruttman, Jimmy Davies and 
Eddie Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
 His uncle, Wally, won the first California Roadster Assn. main event at 
Carrell Speedway in Gardena in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only 3 when my dad got hurt and my mother didn't want me to race," 
Pankratz said. "I was too involved later with football anyway, so I didn't 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 27, I decided I wanted to try racing. I talked a friend into 
telling another race-driver friend, Porky Rachwitz, that I had raced once. 
Porky believed him and gave me a tryout in his midget at the old Whiteman 
Stadium in Pacoima. I did OK, so he entered me in a race in Barstow. Then I 
drove at Saugus Speedway and the throttle stuck and I flipped five or six 
times. The car was destroyed and no one would give me a ride for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I can't imagine how lucky I was. That was the last year the 
cars ran without cages. Not many guys flipped like that without a cage and 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
 Pankratz estimates he has won "about 100 main events" in all types of racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Randi started racing when a neighbor had a quarter-midget that he didn't want 
to drive, so he told Randi she could try it. She drove it well enough to win a 
number of races at Pomona and finish third in the nationals in Colorado. One of 
her rivals was Kara Hendrick, who was killed in a USAC midget racing accident 
in 1991 at Cajon Speedway in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 16 and no longer eligible for quarter-midgets, Randi was hired by 
Kara Hendrick's brother, Danny, who had been paralyzed from the waist down from 
a racing accident, to drive his TQ midget racer. 
</P>
<P>
 In three seasons of limited racing, Randi has six top-five finishes. Last 
fall, she went to Paris and beat the top French female driver in a TQ match 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rahal-Hogan racing team will no longer use the Honda V-8 engine in the 
1995 PPG Indy Car World Series, ending a two-year association. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine failed to yield an Indy car victory. Bobby Rahal finished second in 
Toronto and sixth in Detroit and Mike Groff finished sixth in Phoenix with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we have made good progress (with the engine), we have not achieved 
the results we anticipated," co-owner Carl Hogan said in a statement. "We have 
complete confidence that, given a reasonable amount of time, Honda will develop 
a competitive engine." 
</P>

DEL MAR; EL ALERTA SAVES THE DAY FOR DESORMEAUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux believed his most successful horse Wednesday was going to be 
Inner City, a 5-year-old running in the seventh race. The field was strong, 
especially favored Journalism, but Desormeaux and trainer Gary Jones had a good 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole camp," Desormeaux said, "thought this was going to be a major, 
major turf player." 
</P>
<P>
 But Inner City got his Irish up, literally, in the gate and finished last in a 
six-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones camp had a two-horse entry in the eighth race, the $60,000-added 
Real Good Deal Stakes for 3-year-olds. But Luthier Fever was scratched, leaving 
El Alerta, the more lightly regarded of the two. The odds jumped from 3-1 to 
5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux was on El Alerta. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of those twists that baffles bettors, El Alerta came from last place on 
the turn to beat favored Argolid by a neck.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," Desormeaux said, "this makes up a little bit for the last one." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not Luthier Fever instead of El Alerta? 
</P>
<P>
 "Luthier Fever wants to go long," Jones said. "I've got a better race for him 
next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Why El Alerta? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's green," Jones said, "but he has some ability. He was running up north 
and he had some shin troubles. We brought him down and put him out and he's 
been like a different horse." 
</P>
<P>
 El Alerta raced twice at Hollywood Park, both maiden races, and won the 
second. This was not a major stakes victory, but it was definitely a step up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," Desormeaux said, "he still doesn't know what's going on. He has to 
learn everything because he doesn't know anything. It's really quite scary 
thinking how good he could be." 
</P>
<P>
 El Alerta began as if he did not know he was in a race and was last behind a 
six-horse pack. He made his run wide around the last turn and caught Argolid at 
the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It set up nice for us," Desormeaux said. "When I pushed the button, he said 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula, Del Mar's horse of the meet in 1993 as a 2-year-old filly, will make 
her first start of the meet Sunday in the Del Mar Oaks, a Grade I invitational 
on the turf for 3-year-old fillies. She won the Del Mar Debutante last year and 
the Kentucky Oaks this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Jerry Moss and trained by Brian Mayberry, Sardula has earned 
$878,083. She has three workouts on Del Mar's turf course, where she has not 
previously run. Her last race was a second to Lakeway in the Hollywood Oaks on 
July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sardula will undoubtedly be the favorite, the field also includes the 
first four finishers in the July 30 San Clemente Handicap for 3-year-old 
fillies. Work the Crowd, Pharma, Dancing Mirage and Malli Star were separated 
by three-quarters of a length. Twice The Vice, second to males in the Oceanside 
Stakes on opening day, will also run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's match race between Soviet Problem and Mamselle Bebette, a pair of 
4-year-old mares sprinting 5 1/2 furlongs, will not be the first match race at 
Del Mar since Seabiscuit nipped Ligaroti in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent match race was run one morning, an exact date has not been 
determined, without a crowd and without media. Security guards discouraged -- 
unsuccessfully -- a writer and photographer from witnessing the event. 
</P>
<P>
 This was one of those made-for-TV events, likely for either "You Asked For It" 
or "That's Incredible," and it matched Stanley Floyd, a world-class sprinter at 
the time, against a thoroughbred ridden by Pat Valenzuela. The race was run at 
50 yards with Floyd running on a specially built track. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there was no parimutuel betting, it might have been interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd won. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani has been named to ride Mamselle Bebette in the match race. . . 
. Eddie Delahoussaye is the regular rider for Sardula and Twice The Vice, but 
he has the call on Sardula in the Del Mar Oaks. . . . Saturday's Pat O'Brien 
Breeders' Cup Handicap, a Grade III event for 3-year-olds and up over seven 
furlongs, has come up a little light. Top-weighted Memo is not running and 
Slerp is scheduled to run Friday. Another early entrant, Journalism, ran 
Wednesday and was a runaway winner of the seventh race at even odds. 
Top-weighted now is Thirty Slews at 118 pounds.

COACHES HAVE TAKEN A MORE CAREFUL APPROACH TO CONDITIONING.

 "I think they are trying to build us up more," said linebacker Rod Smalley, in 
his fifth preseason practice. "There isn't as much running, and my legs feel 
stronger than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Terry Donahue said Wednesday after the Bruins' first practices in pads 
that the idea is to cut down on injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a little bit of a slower pace in shorts," Donahue said. "I 
wanted to make sure that we had most of the kids out here in the first day in 
pads. It doesn't mean we don't have tired legs. We do. But we wanted to look at 
them in pads." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue is happy about what he has seen of his defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more encouraged now than I was in the spring," Donahue said. "We're not 
deeper in experience, but we're deeper athletically, which is important. In the 
spring, it was woefully thin. It's coming around now." 
</P>
<P>
 With only two starting defensive backs returning -- cornerbacks Carl Greenwood 
and Teddy Lawrence -- the Bruins are counting on freshmen to provide depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue singled out freshmen defenders Shaun Williams, Glenn Thompkins and 
Javelin Guidry for praise based on their performance in early practices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's contract has been extended one year, to 1998, as a reward for taking 
the Bruins to the Rose Bowl. Beyond that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be around to coach against the Irish," said Donahue, 50. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is scheduled to play Notre Dame in 2006 and 2007. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Akil Davis is getting a long look at running back after being 
recruited from Mesa, Ariz., as a wide receiver and defensive back. "I think his 
transition to college will be quicker as a running back," Donahue said. "We 
need depth at running back, and he is competing with Thaddeus Massey for the 
No. 3 job." 
</P>
<P>
 Nos. 1 and 2 are Sharmon Shah and Derek Ayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA coaching staff shifted its ideas about Davis after he rushed for 140 
yards in 12 carries in the Arizona state high school all-star game. JIM HODGES

JAZZ REVIEW; JAZZ EXPLOSION: ANOTHER BLAST FROM ITS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jazz Explosion Superband brought much the same bang to the Coach House on 
Tuesday as it did 13 months ago when the heavyweight collaboration appeared at 
the same club. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did their first set shadow last year's performance, it followed, 
almost to the letter, the group's new "Live at the Greek" recording that's been 
issued under bassist Stanley Clarke's name. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean there weren't any fireworks. To their credit, Clarke, 
guitarist Larry Carlton, drummer Billy Cobham, saxophonist Najee and new member 
keyboardist Brian Simpson worked as a unit, without apparent one-upmanship or 
the clash of egos that one would expect when four headliners (and one upstart) 
are brought together. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, this show was more polished than the last, and the principals 
seemed more comfortable with their improvisational space, resulting in some 
truly electric moments. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened, as they did last year, with a slicked-up version of Charles 
Mingus' tribute to Lester Young, "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat." Opening on ethereal 
chords from keys and guitar suspended over Cobham's rolling tom-tom sound, the 
band fell into a respectful version of the somber theme, then took to 
straightforward rhythm section support as each of the heavies took a solo turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Najee, who opened on soprano sax, switched to his wind-controlled synthesizer, 
which vaguely resembles a clarinet. He developed the theme in swirling, 
whistle-pitched tones that, unlike last year, avoided riffing and cheap 
emotional appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton picked up that lead nicely, breaking up lines of cream-colored tones 
with sharp exclamations and bluesy embellishments. Clarke followed, working the 
high register of his instrument, dropping in an "off to the races" quote as if 
to foreshadow what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just as last year, the band switched gears as it dropped into "Stratus," 
a Cobham tune pulled from his 1973 album "Spectrum." This was followed by 
Najee's romantic "Buenos Aires," and Miles Davis' "All Blues," which found 
Clarke switching to upright bass and Najee to flute. 
</P>
<P>
 The only new tune in the set, Cobham's "No Looking Back," was one of the most 
interesting, with each soloist using the simple riff to build impressive, 
narrative statements as the support of his partners built behind him. The group 
closed on a long version of Clarke's "School Days" before coming out for an 
encore with Carlton's pleasant ditty "Minute by Minute." 
</P>
<P>
 All the principals gave impressive improvisations throughout the show, with 
Najee's tenor work and Carlton's fine chordal presentation on "No Looking Back" 
standing out. Cobham continues to be a fireball of energy, though he sometimes 
resorts to too much tom-tom foolery to make a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Clarke seemed continually predisposed to showing off, firing up with 
technically impressive but musically hollow outbursts of strums and furious 
fingering. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Keyboardist Simpson, on the other hand, played reservedly, never challenging 
his mates, who often nodded in encouragement during his improvs. Only during 
"All Blues" did Simpson shine with dissonant touches and some Bill Evans-like 
sensitivity from the upper reaches of his keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Explosion scores point for the range of material they cover -- a jazz 
standard, blues, the lesser-known Mingus tune and a wide array of contemporary 
styles and rhythmic formats -- but they need to keep adding new and different 
tunes, rather than repeat the same show year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 Without some updating, their big-bang theory will go out with a whimper. And 
that would be a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Jazz Explosion Superband with Stanley Clarke, Larry Carlton, Najee, 
Billy Cobham and Brian Simpson plays Saturday at the Greek Theatre, 2700 N. 
Vermont Ave., Los Angeles. 7:30 p.m. $27.50. (213) 480-3232.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'LA STRADA' TAKES THE SPIRIT TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federico Fellini the fabulist, the director who provoked and sometimes 
perplexed with his hallucinatory imagery, had yet to emerge when "La Strada" 
was released in 1954. But Fellini the fable-ist was fully evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps his most sentimental movie and a favorite among more mainstream 
audiences, "La Strada" is an urban fairy tale done up in the conventions of the 
famed Italian neo-realist style. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty, social distortion, people in flux, a country still shellshocked by 
war -- all are elements in this touching film, being shown tonight as part of 
the Bowers Museum's Italian film series. But it is the romance, tragedy and 
lyricism of the heroine that holds us. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellini chose his wife, Giulietta Masina, to play one of his most memorable 
characters, Gelsomina, the Harpo Marx-faced waif. Sold to Zampano, a brooding, 
often brutal circus strongman played by Anthony Quinn, she is the innocent on 
the road, facing despair as fate stands tough against her, breaking down her 
optimism and purity. She is resilient but only to a point; the film is fueled 
by her growing losses in the face of a cynical world. 
</P>
<P>
 We first meet her as she clings to her mother during negotiations with the 
grimacing, grunting Zampano. He bought her sister years ago, and now that she 
is dead he needs someone to replace her in his meager traveling show. Gelsomina 
is the answer. Her mother sells her for 10,000 lire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zampano's act, which be brings from town to town, centers on a ridiculous feat 
of strength: Laying on the clumsy theatrics, he breaks a chain wrapped around 
his chest. Gelsomina bangs the drum and tramps about like a clown. It suits 
her; she is enlivened by the crowd's laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zampano's cruelty begins to erode her, until she is befriended by the 
Fool, an artful acrobat played by Richard Basehart. The dynamics among the 
three provide "La Strada" with its themes of man's complexity: Zampano, the 
sensualist, represents the body while Gelsomina, a dreamer, is the spirit and 
the Fool, a thinker, is the intellect. 
</P>
<P>
 As strength overcomes more refined impulses, Fellini doesn't capitulate to 
pessimism. He is only playing the realist (a far cry from his preferred role as 
the romantic). But even as Gelsomina and the Fool suffer, they remain true to 
themselves, and there lies their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Masina is an unlikely heroine, the most fragile of leading ladies. It's easy 
to be distracted by her acting, which is an acquired taste: She represents 
feelings, like a silent-movie star, instead of expressing them as most modern 
actresses would. Indeed, she can be annoyingly jejune. But Fellini felt, 
correctly, that hers was the right approach to convey a sort of trampled 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 She also can be seen Monday night in another, much odder Fellini movie, 
"Juliet of the Spirits" (1965). The finale of the outdoor "Celestial Cinema" 
series at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton, this film (Fellini's 
first in color) presents Masina as a distraught housewife exploring her garish 
fantasy life. 
</P>
<P>
 * "La Strada" (1954) by Federico Fellini is being shown tonight at 7:30 at the 
Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. $4, $3.50 for 
seniors and students, $1.50 for children 12 and under. (714) 567-3600. "Juliet

SOCIAL DISTORTION: RUSTY BUT ROCK SOLID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the Los Angeles area's early punk bands, Social Distortion mixed the 
basic swing of blues and country with punk-rock and delivered some of the best 
underground tunes of the early '80s. The quartet from Fullerton stood apart 
from speedy hard-core bands by doing such songs as Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" 
with a cool patience, and separated itself from older punk bands by trading in 
anarchy for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Distortion hadn't played live in more than a year when it came onstage 
Tuesday at the sold-out Troubadour, and its set was slightly rusty. It also was 
inescapably strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Mike Ness had his hair slicked back and wore overalls that exposed his 
multiple tattoos, and sang to a crowd with a similar look. Despite some recent 
throat problems, he made it through the set, smoothing out his usual gravelly 
drone and dropping the volume. Even though there weren't as many rough edges, 
his voice still dug into the music and grabbed hold. 
</P>
<P>
 SD's trademarks -- slippery guitar, stalking hard-core bass lines, swaggering 
rock 'n' roll rhythms -- all were intact. The band played mainly old material 
-- from "Mommy's Little Monster" to "Born to Lose" -- plus a couple of new 
songs from an album due next year. The new material, though not quite mastered 
yet, fit in nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, the group still sounded relevant. Its songs emerged not 
just as great numbers from a bygone era but as good rock songs with built-in 
longevity.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: IN ANY CASE, MOODY'S ENDORSEMENT WILL BE ON THE WINNING 
SIDE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 TOO MANY CHOICES: Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Michael Moody was recently 
listed among the Republicans who are backing the reelection of Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, he's also listed on the campaign letterhead of Rancho Palos Verdes 
Councilwoman Susan Brooks, Harman's Republican challenger in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize it was still on there," Moody said Wednesday, adding that he 
has spent much of the past two months on business trips. "Really, that was my 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody said that although he supported Brooks in the primary, he switched to 
Harman because he is impressed by the connections she has in Washington and her 
efforts to retain aerospace jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old adage: if it isn't broke, don't fix it," he said. "Susan's a 
very nice lady. But you can only make one choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Brooks chalked up a few high-profile names to her endorsement list, 
including former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, Senate minority leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Jack Kemp.

 RENEGADE CARTS: For years, the wheeled nuisances have clogged Lawndale's 
sidewalks, traffic islands and gutters. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that hundreds of shopping carts are stolen and 
abandoned each month, and they worry that loose carts could cause accidents or 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is like a magnet for shopping carts," complains William Woolard, 
director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, determined to get tough on the shopping-cart problem, city officials are 
exploring ways to remove them from public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has considered impounding carts -- which cost about $125 each -- and 
charging stores to get them back. Since Lawndale just trimmed its work force, 
however, it may not have enough staff to round up all the errant carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the largest supermarkets in Lawndale -- Alpha-Beta, The Boys and 
Value Plus -- employ a cart-retrieval service, but most abandoned carts 
reportedly come from stores that don't use the service. So former councilwoman 
Carol Norman has suggested drafting Boy Scouts and making cart retrieval 
grounds for earning a merit badge. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, some supermarkets have guarded against wayward carts by installing 
concrete barriers, attaching a fifth wheel that, when activated, makes the cart 
turn in circles, and even adding electronic sensors that lock the wheels when a 
cart leaves a parking lot. But such remedies have led to problems and lawsuits, 
said Don Beaver, president of the California Grocers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to do," said Mike Price at the Value Plus supermarket on 
Hawthorne Boulevard. "If I knew, I wouldn't be a grocery store manager, I'd be 
a millionaire." 
</P>

 UNDER THE SEA: For years, tourists who wanted to gaze at Avalon Bay's marine 
life settled for glass-bottom boats.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Santa Catalina Island Co. is taking sightseers to the ocean's depths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Starlight, a semi-submersible vessel, started sailing earlier this month 
in Lover's Cove. The 36 passengers in the sub are underwater while a captain 
pilots the craft from a topside deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we needed to replace two old wooden (glass-bottom) boats," said Joe 
Caliva, director of sightseeing for the Santa Catalina Island Co. "We wanted 
something new that no one else had." 
</P>
<P>
 At least no else in Southern California. The vessel is similar to a vessel in 
Monterey Bay and several in Hawaii.  
</P>
<P>
 Visitors have spotted flying fish, horn sharks and giant lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many visitors have never been in a sub -- save for the Submarine Voyage at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "On opening day, people were wondering where we put the track," he said. "We 
have no track. We can go anywhere." QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything ourselves. We had something like a hair dryer to 
shrink-wrap the titles. On Thanksgiving, the whole family worked all day 
assembling the product."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: IN AQUARIUM-BUILDING RACE, IS THREE A CROWD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fish gotta swim -- and judging by the popularity of public aquariums -- people 
gotta watch 'em. In the last dozen or so years, aquariums have become major 
tourist attractions wherever they have been built. And now it is the dawning of 
the Age of Aquariums on the Central Coast. Three cities -- Ventura, Oxnard and 
Santa Barbara -- are in a feeding frenzy to get their own facilities built. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so we're all interested in marine life, and who among us hasn't nearly 
crashed a car while trying to get a better look at the bottle-nosed dolphins 
cruising just offshore? 
</P>
<P>
 But three aquarium proposals? 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity of aquariums has contributed to the public's awareness of the 
fragile ocean ecosystem," said staff writer Jeff Meyers, the author of this 
week's Centerpiece story on the area's Tank Wars. "One marine expert told me 
that nobody cared about the plight of whales or dolphins until people began 
encountering them in oceanariums like Sea World. A local aquarium would no 
doubt make us more sensitive about what happens in the Santa Barbara Channel." 
</P>
<P>
 So imagine the heightened consciousness we would achieve from three aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you do, don't call Ventura's project an aquarium," Meyers said. 
"When I talked to designer Al Fiori, he said, 'We're not developing an aquarium 
per se.' And Jean-Michel Cousteau, who is also part of the Ventura project. 
called it 'a marine facility.' " 
</P>
<P>
 All right, whether we call it an aquarium, a marine facility or a big fish 
tank, the question remains: Will the tourists come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if one of the three aquariums becomes a reality, there's no guarantee it 
will be a big winner," Meyers said. "Marineland was considered the finest 
oceanarium in the world when it opened in the early 1960s on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, but it went out of business in 1987. Even Jean-Michel Cousteau came 
up a loser when his Living Sea Museum aboard the Queen Mary, opened about 1970, 
lasted only a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why savvy city and county planners need to come up with something 
original, a plan that enables each of the cities to catch the trend and ride it 
into economic prosperity. Meyers thinks he has just such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not combine an aquarium with a minor league baseball stadium?" he said. 
"Or an aquarium with a factory outlet mall? Or how about a combination 
aquarium/sushi bar?" 
</P>
<P>
 It all sounds a bit fishy to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Life: For those of you who like your fish gutted, boned and on a 
plate, with a nice butter-lemon sauce, restaurant reviewer David Goldman will 
tell you about the dishes (seafood and otherwise) being served at The Greek, 
which has recently moved from Oxnard to the Ventura Harbor.

TWO CASES OF HATE CRIMES STIR CONCERN IN LAWNDALE; VANDALISM: POLICE ARE 
INVESTIGATING RACIAL SLURS FOUND PAINTED NEAR THE HOMES OF TWO AFRICAN AMERICAN 
FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are investigating two hate crimes committed in Lawndale 
against African American families. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, the Marshall family found racial slurs spray-painted in 
black letters a foot tall across a fence and wall near their townhouse in the 
4600 block of 153rd Place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disgusted and frightened," said Diann Marshall, 46, who lives with her 
husband, three children and five grandchildren in the townhouse. She took the 
children to relatives' homes for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marshalls are one of several black families on the block, Marshall's son, 
Derald, 21, said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We really didn't know what was going on," Marshall said. "That's the first 
time something like that has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 A gang insignia was painted next to the slurs. The predominantly Latino gang 
linked to the moniker often fights with gangs from neighboring cities, said 
Sheriff's Detective Jacques Laberge. However, no one in the house is affiliated 
with a gang, Derald Marshall said. In a separate incident Aug. 9, the words Ku 
Klux Klan and another racial slur were painted in foot-high red letters on an 
apartment building on Rosecrans Avenue just west of Prairie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 It was discovered by Rene Wells, a resident of the apartment building. Because 
there were no fingerprints near the slurs, police have no leads in the case, 
Laberge said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives do not believe the two incidents are related, and say 
racial slurs are uncommon in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember too many incidents like this," Laberge said. "And I haven't 
seen a lot of White Power stuff going on." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was little comfort to the Marshall family. Marshall said her 
23-year-old son, Gerald, discovered the slurs as he left for work Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned neighbors stayed up much of the night Tuesday to make sure the 
incident was not repeated. Many African Americans were troubled by the graffiti 
as they drove by the home earlier in the day, Marshall said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was huge lettering," she said. "And the fact that it was directed at all 
blacks got everybody into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall hypothesized that the graffiti could be related to a drive-by 
shooting that occurred recently a block from her home. Or, she said, perhaps 
the racial slurs stemmed from the videotaped beating of a Latino teen-ager by a 
black Compton police officer in July.  
</P>
<P>
 When her family moved to the townhouse two years ago, the fence on the side of 
her home was frequently the target of taggers, but the graffiti stopped after a 
year, she said.

RANCHO PALOS VERDES USING SATELLITES TO TRACK LANDSLIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes, a bluff-top community plagued by landslides, has turned 
to satellite technology to measure how much the Earth's surface is moving. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday the city began surveying 58 sites inside the 1,100-acre landslide 
area in which building has been restricted since 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials are working with the Torrance office of electronics company 
Leica Inc. to utilized the Global Positioning System, 24 satellites that relay 
navigational signals to Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 An antenna at each of the 58 sites will provide the satellites with readouts 
on their latitude and longitude. By tracking changes in those coordinates over 
time, the city hopes to get a more accurate projection of where slides will 
occur and what can be done to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 For $15,000 this year -- the same amount Rancho Palos Verdes has paid county 
surveyors to annually monitor 18 sites -- the city will receive quarterly 
readouts on the landslide area's movement, said Trent Pulliam, the city's 
director of public works. Movement also can be measured during and after 
landslide prevention measures, such as grading, to test their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's high-tech for a 100,000-year-old landslide," said Councilman Lee Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, road construction triggered the 270-acre Portuguese Bend landslide, 
destroying at least 102 homes. Creeping earth has damaged or destroyed nearly 
100 more homes since then. In 1978, after another slide, the city created the 
1,100-acre building moratorium area near Palos Verdes Drive South. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say 130 acres of land in the moratorium area near upper Narcissa Drive 
has not moved as a result of landslides in hundreds of thousand years, and area 
homeowners there would like to expand or modify their homes. The area also 
contains about 40 vacant lots that some would like to see developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County developer Barry Hon, who owns another 427 acres within the 
moratorium area, is considering developing a golf course and up to 50 homes, 
said spokesman Michael Mohler. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk of lifting parts of the moratorium met with opposition in the past. 
Although the satellite readings alone will not prove that swaths of land are 
stable enough to support homes and golf courses, Byrd said, he hopes they will 
inject some facts into an often emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew Sargent, a local environmentalist, said the satellite readings will 
not provide city officials with any new information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The land is moving. We know it's moving," Sargent said. "This is going to 
confirm it's moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent added that the effects of anti-landslide measures, which include wells 
to remove ground water and prevent the earth from become wet and slippery, may 
not be felt immediately. He suggested that building only be allowed on land 
that has not moved in at least 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 County surveyors have tracked the land movement since 1956, and the city has 
informally tracked 18 sites over the past two years with the satellite system 
to test the technology's accuracy. But Byrd said this will be the city's first 
comprehensive use of the system, which originally was designed to help the 
military move troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Landslide readings will have a minuscule margin of error: 3 millimeters, 
approximately 3/25 of an inch, said Charles Abbott, president of Charles Abbott 
Associates, which contracts with the city for engineering services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes is not the only municipality to find uses for the 
satellite system. The Port of Los Angeles recently purchased $104,000 worth of 
equipment to help select sites for piers, said Harry Yamatsuka, the acting 
survey supervisor. And the city of Rolling Hills is considering using the 
satellites to map land parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 Other non-military uses include tracking automobiles and buses and monitoring 
prime fishing spots.

 Mention the name Roger Kellaway, and the reaction you get may vary widely, 
depending on whom you're talking to.

 Is he the jazz pianist, who has worked with Sonny Rollins and numerous others, 
and had his own respectable jazz career? Is he the studio musician/hip 
player-about-Los Angeles whose workload included a stint with Joni Mitchell? Is 
he the classically trained musician whose ambitious Cello Quartet intertwined 
jazz and classical notions? Is he a forefather and/or culprit of the new-age 
scene? 
</P>
<P>
 What, exactly, is Roger Kellaway all about? It's a complicated question with 
an answer that's still evolving. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a crowd flocked to the Ladera ranch on the outskirts of Ojai to 
hear Kellaway in a hot, but fairly idyllic outdoor setting. It turned out to be 
a portrait of an artist as an eclectic man. He played a tribute to Stravinsky 
and swung on Duke Ellington's "Creole Love Call." He merged Olivier 
Messiaen-like sonorities with Hoagy Carmichael's "Skylark" and later did "New 
England Transport," with a hymn-like theme tucked, Charles Ives-fashion, into 
more atonal material. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, he also indulged in some simplistic noodlings with new age-y 
banalities that made at least one listener uneasy. Like Kellaway's musical 
career, this concert was all over the map and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellaway's personal map has taken him from his native Massachusetts to New 
York to Los Angeles, where he became a first-call studio player and composer; 
his score for "A Star is Born" won an Oscar nomination. Burned out on the 
musical hustle of L.A., Kellaway returned to New York in 1983 and was based 
there for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Kellaway is one of the most recent artist emigres to Ojai. Once back 
in Southern California, he noted, "I didn't want to move back into the studio 
scene, because you get quite buried. There's no doubt that the years in the 
studios were more secure, financially, than what I'm doing now, but I still 
choose to be out there, performing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he and his wife Jorjana have lived in Ojai for just a year, Kellaway 
is no stranger to the area. In 1972, he was one of four keyboardists to record 
Steve Reich's "Four Organs," along with Reich, Michael Tilson Thomas and Ralph 
Grierson. That year, they performed the piece at the Ojai Festival, with 
Kellaway's own Cello Quartet group playing the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This past June, I went down to say hello to Michael Tilson Thomas when he was 
at the Ojai Festival," Kellaway said. "He saw me and he said 'hey, this is 
where it all began.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of relocating to Ojai came after talking with the Ojai-bound 
guitarist Robben Ford, whom Kellaway first met as a fellow band member backing 
up Joni Mitchell. Kellaway has also long been associated with Ojai-based Gene 
Lees, the songwriter and jazz writer whose monthly Jazzletter recently included 
a two-part chronicle of Kellaway's long, winding career. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the path to Kellaway takes you to a spacious ranch house close to 
Lake Casitas. Art lines the walls of the yawning, sparsely furnished living 
room area. On the coffee table sits a book called "Zen and the Art of Making a 
Living." 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the front door there is an odd-looking Aeolian harp -- a 
wind-activated stringed instrument -- created by Richard Waters, whose odd 
custom-designed instruments Kellaway collects. Asked about it, Kellaway led the 
visitor into his instrument-crammed music room, where you find Waters' 
"Revolving Diatonic Sound Generator," with a huge hubcap as a base. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last week, the Kellaway house was permeated with the enigmatic, 
almost ascetically spare sound of Morton Feldman's music. This might come as a 
surprise to someone who has heard Kellaway in his more lyrical mode. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listen mostly to 20th-Century classical music," Kellaway said. "My interest 
is in how different people design the sound spectrum. My heart's desire is to 
go more toward what we're listening to, not necessarily in terms of the 
abstraction of it, but in terms of music that has less motion to it. If there's 
less motion, there should be more room to just travel on the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in experimenting in that area, which, of course, I really 
can't do from a jazz point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, as the pianist explained, "to call myself a jazz pianist, as most 
people have done, is only partly correct. I'm more like an improviser who uses 
jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellaway was born in 1939, and at an early age was pulled in many musical 
directions simultaneously. "I was learning about Dixieland and modern jazz at 
the same time, plus listening to (Stravinksy's) 'Le Sacre du Printemps,' Woody 
Herman, Andre Previn, and I loved (Schoenberg's) 'Verklerte Nacht.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, look in the Kellaway bin in your music store, and you're likely 
to find his recent jazz standard albums on the Concord label, and his newest 
project, "Windows," on the Angel label. Stylistically diverse, "Windows" 
hearkens back to his Cello Quartet, with cello as a lead melodic instrument, 
singing atop piano and percussion parts. 
</P>
<P>
 However much Kellaway strays from jazz, there is a magnetic attraction that 
won't go away. Last weekend, for instance, he played at a two-night jazz trio 
gig in Hollywood. "I confuse myself, because I feel such a strong pull toward 
experimenting with music, and then I'll go to a jazz rehearsal and feel like a 
5-year old kid again. I think 'boy, I love doing this.' And I can do it, and I 
don't do it like anybody else, so why shouldn't I do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when it's over, I can sit down at the piano, play two notes, and listen 
until the end of the sound goes away." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellaway gestured with his hand at the terse chords floating out of his 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I love Feldman -- the space of it all. I'm not afraid of the 
unknown. 'He knows the tradition and he's not afraid,' that's what Oscar 
Peterson said about me. I love that quote." 
</P>
<P>
 So how does Kellaway account for his multiple interests? "I've often explained 
it as relating to the spokes of a wheel. It isn't that my choices in life are 
any less defined than, perhaps, yours. But in my definition of what I want out 
of life, I have a lot more spokes to the wheel."

MATH BLASTS A NICHE IN VIDEO GAME MARKET; COMPUTERS: TWO SOUTH BAY SOFTWARE 
COMPANIES ARE SUCCESSFULLY BLENDING EDUCATION AND ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Give kids Nintendo and they play nonstop for hours. Throw a few lessons in and 
they start yawning. 
</P>
<P>
 Such has been the thinking in the computer game business. 
</P>
<P>
 But two South Bay computer software companies have capitalized on a growing 
demand for educational software, bucking conventional wisdom that youngsters go 
for bloody fighting games such as Mortal Kombat to the exclusion of programs 
with characters who add and subtract. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies' successes have been a result of combining entertainment with 
education. Recent software products teach children how to do math, find places 
on a map, even balance a budget, but still let them zap asteroids or wind their 
way through a maze. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of such "edutainment" software helped propel Torrance-based Davidson & 
Associates from a small start-up business in 1983 to a company that made almost 
$60 million in sales last year. Davidson's Math Blaster has sold 1.6 million 
copies, making it the world's second-most-successful educational software, 
after the Carmen Sandiego series produced by Broderbund Software. 
</P>
<P>
 And Torrance-based Image Smith is trying to repeat Davidson's success, which 
sales expected to double this fiscal year to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pent-up demand (for educational software)," Image Smith President 
Dominique Claessens said. Parents want tools to supplement their children's 
classwork, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts see the industry growing as more schools move away from traditional 
textbooks and embrace computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The educational software market is not that huge," said Seth Feinstein, a 
research analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. "It's less than $500 
million. But it has a huge potential to be a billion-dollar industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Rancho Palos Verdes educator Jan Davidson tried to sell computer programs 
more than a decade ago, few software companies had considered marketing 
educational games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering if personal computers could have a positive effect on 
learning," said Davidson, 50, president of Davidson & Associates. "At that 
time, there was no software." 
</P>
<P>
 Her goal was to make educational software as exciting as computer games. Among 
the first was Math Blaster. In it, a player who answers a problem correctly 
gets to shoot a man out of a cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 But software giants weren't interested. So Davidson's husband, Bob, encouraged 
her to start a company of her own. In 1983, she used their three children's 
$6,000 college fund for capital and started selling and distributing Math 
Blaster and two other titles from their Rancho Palos Verdes home.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything ourselves," she said. "We had something like a hair dryer 
to shrink-wrap the titles. On Thanksgiving, the whole family worked all day 
assembling the product." 
</P>
<P>
 The company sold $400,000 in software in its first year. Soon Davidson's 
business outgrew her home and moved into a Gardena facility. Its biggest growth 
has been since 1991, when personal computer prices dropped, putting the 
technology within reach of many families, industry executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational software also has started to turn toward CD-ROM technology, 
compact discs that incorporate sound, music and visuals on a personal computer. 
Many mainstay programs, such as Math Blaster, have been introduced in CD-ROM 
versions. Another CD-ROM title allows users to create a computer scrapbook with 
words, pictures and narration. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Davidson signed a deal with Simon & Schuster, a subsidiary of 
Viacom, to develop curriculum-based software with the publisher's educational 
books division. The two companies also plan to create products for Simon & 
Schuster's list of 300,000 consumer titles. Included will be a multimedia 
investment guide based on Peter Lynch's bestseller "Beating the Street" and an 
interactive children's book called "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom," featuring singer 
Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is not to dump a book on a disc," said Bob Davidson, who joined the 
company as chairman in 1989. The Lynch book, for example, will graphically 
describe Lynch's investment strategy, with the Wall Street wizard offering 
anecdotes and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, industry analysts say that store shelves already are flooded with 
software and CD-ROM titles. The Davidsons -- who control their own distribution 
network -- should not have much trouble, but smaller firms might, said 
Feinstein, the research analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more difficult to get established now than it was 10 years ago," he 
said. "It's gotten much more competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Image Smith, which started in 1991, has depended on cartoon characters such as 
those from Peanuts and the Flintstones to grab the attention of children and 
their parents, rather than creating its own characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's tremendous recognition," said Claessens of Image Smith. "No doubt 
that you can save some in advertising. But a lot (of the licensing agreements) 
cost 10% of sales."  
</P>
<P>
 The company's Yearn 2 Learn titles -- one focusing on Peanuts characters and 
another on Snoopy -- have sold more than 150,000 copies since first released in 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Claessens got his start on the design side of the computer business. In the 
1960s, he and his father developed an electronic graphic design system that was 
used by clients such as Heineken, the beer-maker, to develop logos and 
packaging. For a time, they marketed the graphics system hardware to companies 
until they sold the system for $50 million in 1989. Claessens launched his 
software company two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently, there was not money in (educational software), so no one went 
after it. Everyone went after games," Claessens said. "Now the potential for 
growth is faster than other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the former headquarters of a Sepulveda Boulevard machine shop, Image 
Smith's employees put the initial touches on a new Flintstones program. 
Computer animators use Hanna-Barbera guidebooks that describe how the likes of 
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble should look, walk, talk and eat. 
</P>
<P>
 The first title, a Flintstones coloring book, debuted in June, and Claessens 
is encouraged by the sales. It is part of a deal with Turner Publishing, which 
owns the marketing rights to the animated Flintstones. 
</P>
<P>
 Even using cartoon characters, Claessens has not lost sight of educating his 
young customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an upcoming Peanuts program, players try to piece together all 50 United 
States. If a player puts a state in the wrong place, characters say "Oh, 
bummer, man." But when the youngsters get it right, the characters give them a 
cheer.

NIGHT LIFE: MUSIC OF WAYNE TOUPS RISES FROM THE SWAMP; HE PRIDES HIS ZYDECAJUN 
BAND ON ITS HYBRID SOUND. AND REGARDLESS OF THE ORIGINS, IT MAKES PEOPLE WANT 
TO DANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this Wayne's World, there's no heavy-metal dudes, no Led Zeppelin, no 
Queen, but about as much understandable English. This is the world of Wayne 
Toups and Zydecajun, who will have the local yokels grooving twice in front of 
the Miller Stage on Sunday night at the Ventura County Fair in Seaside Park. 
This sweaty guy in a tank top is worth missing reruns of "60 Minutes" and 
"Married With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about taking notes because Toups usually sings in French. Hey, the 
thirty-something accordion player can't help it -- he's from Crowley, La., the 
heart of Cajun and Creole country. Toups mixes Southern rock with the 
indigenous Louisiana swamp rock, and wants to make the whole world dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Toups put out a few small-label albums in the '80s, then got signed to 
Mercury. But Toups hasn't released an album since his fourth, 1991's "Fish Out 
of Water." He still plays a lot, has made some guest appearances on country 
albums and seems in no danger of slowing down, all of which he discussed during 
a phone conversation before a gig in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wayne, no album for three years, wassup? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I got into a bad management deal, which ended up in a big legal hassle. 
But we have kept playing, not as much as we used to, but still 15 to 20 times a 
month. We have a great cult following and our base of support continues to 
grow. We've been all over -- Thailand, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, 
Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador. We played for 5,000 people in Nicaragua, and they 
loved us. You don't have to understand the words because music is for the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 So do you play zydeco or Cajun music, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't do either. We're a zydecajun band, and it's more than just a band 
name, it's a type of music I invented in 1985. We play Cajun, zydeco, R & B, 
rock 'n' roll, plus there's soul influences like Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, 
the Motown sound, plus Creole music. The Creole culture goes back a long way. 
At one time, the Acadian people moved to Louisiana and mixed with people of 
color and created the Creole tradition. They play zydeco music on a full-scale 
accordion and sing in French. I think a lot of Creole music today sounds like R 
& B, but that's just the natural advancement of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time most people under 100 years of age associated the accordion with 
Lawrence Welk, but that's over? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. The accordion is becoming commercial; it's everywhere. It's in Burger 
King and Buick commercials, in country songs, and people are becoming more and 
more accustomed to the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 You're a successful road dog with no airplay. Is that a problem? 
</P>
<P>
 I think that's gonna change with the right songs. I mean, if I sing in French, 
they ain't gonna play it. But if I do a ballad in English, and the song is 
good, then it'll have to be played. The Allman Brothers are a hard-working 
band, but they don't get much airplay. 
</P>
<P>
 When you play, people gotta dance? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, they definitely dance. We just played the Wisconsin State Fair. The 
Platters played first, and they were wonderful. People sat there and clapped 
and sang along to all those old songs. But once we started, everyone stood up 
and started dancing in front of the stage. Our music isn't quite as raw as it 
used to be. We take the music and sand the rough edges off, but we're not gonna 
perfect ourselves out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does Louisiana rock so hard? 
</P>
<P>
 I think there's great music all over the South, and not just Louisiana. I 
never finished high school; I got started playing when I was in eighth grade. 
All I know how to do is sing and play an accordion. The music business is 
concentrated in New York, Nashville and Los Angeles -- that's the inner circle. 
I think they're just starting to notice the outer circle. 
</P>
<P>
 What about a new album? 
</P>
<P>
 I think we'll be in the studio by September or October with a release date in 
1995. We're gonna get the record in the can, then try and shop it. We have the 
band and we have the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 What's up with this country crossover thing? 
</P>
<P>
 We're apparently becoming quite the thing in Nashville. People say what Stevie 
Ray Vaughan was to rock 'n' roll, we are to Nashville. We've done a couple of 
tunes with Mark Chesnutt, then a Christmas song with Sonny Kershaw. I mean what 
are Travis Tritt and Garth Brooks doing? They're making millions playing rock 
'n' roll in the country market. Before, I've always tried to stay clear of all 
that because I'm not a country act. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month you're doing Farm-Aid? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we dug meeting Willie Nelson, he's a really nice guy. I'm from a very 
poor family, so I can relate to the whole thing. It'll be in the Superdome on 
Sept. 18. Details

 City expenses to fight a Department of Justice lawsuit neared $1 million this 
week when the City Council approved payments for services related to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty.John L. Fellows said fees for outside counsel and specialists, 
including the $383,521 approved Tuesday, amount to $920,908. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal civil rights lawsuit, which was filed last year, alleges that the 
hiring policies of Torrance's Fire and Police departments have discriminated 
against blacks, Latinos and Asians and have deprived those groups of employment 
based on race or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows said the city's policies do not discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we are guilty of any wrongful employment practices," Fellows 
said. "We think the tests that we are using are fair and job related." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the city's fight against the lawsuit will be a Price Waterhouse 
analysis of the labor market in Los Angeles County. It will cost $38,275 and 
was included in the amount appropriated this week. MARY GUTHRIE

SCULPTURE MEMORIALIZES NAZI VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rolling Hills sculptor Lucy Bradanovic Agid has donated her latest work to the 
residents of the tiny Italian mountain village of St. Anna of Stazzema. 
</P>
<P>
 The bronze piece, which was cast from clay, commemorates the 50th anniversary 
Aug. 12 of the slaughter of 560 men, women and children by Nazi troops in the 
village. Titled "Let There Be Peace On Earth," the sculpture has five figures 
clinging together, arms wrapped around draped bodies, faces looking skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures in the piece are looking upward for a better world, Agid said. 
"They are in circular movement, arms around each other, holding the world 
together in harmony."  
</P>
<P>
 Agid, 65, learned of the massacre while on an annual monthlong visit to nearby 
Pietrasanta with her husband, Herb, in May. "I was so moved by the enormity of 
the brutality of the killings that it was just something I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-inch-tall sculpture will be displayed at the St. Anna Village Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Anna Mayor Gian Pietro Lorenzoni invited Agid to be a guest at the 
anniversary commemoration of the slaughter.  
</P>
<P>
 German SS troops were camped in the village in 1944 during World War II. One 
day villagers posted flyers in the church piazza proclaiming: "Unite against 
the Nazis. Do not obey the orders of the barbaric Germans any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazi soldiers burned the village to the ground and ordered the villagers 
to march single file in columns. As they marched by, the soldiers killed them 
with bursts of machine gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the church piazza, 132 corpses, 32 of them children, were left to rot. 
Today a plaque in the piazza lists the names and ages of the 560 victims whose 
remains are interred at the base of a stone tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the area captivated her, Agid said.  
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, she has devoted a month each year in Pietrasanta, carving in 
marble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pietrasanta is a gathering place for artists from around the world. Going 
there is like dying and going to heaven. Everything is there. The stone to 
carve. Studios. The history," Agid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculptor grew up in San Pedro. Her father was a fisherman from the island 
of Vis in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Agid, who graduated from San Pedro High School in 1948, earned tuition for the 
Otis Art Institute by packing sardines and tuna in San Pedro canneries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew from the time I was in 4th grade I would be an artist," she said. 
Since then she has sculpted, first in clay and the past 10 years in marble. Her 
studio is in the old Doaks Aircraft Factory in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her creations bring $500 to $20,000 and have been exhibited from Southern 
California to Paris.

 El Camino College instructors began fall classes this week three months after 
contract talks broke off with college administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members have not received a pay raise in three years.Many instructors, 
barred in their contracts from striking, plan toprotest by refusing to permit 
additional students from enrolling in their classes once the roster is full, 
said Lance Widman, a political science professor and president of the faculty 
union. In the past, teachers have permitted students to be added to full 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, faculty members rejected 1% salary increases in July and January and 
called for an additional 2% raise during the 1995-96 school year. But 
administrators said such increases are impossible due to dwindling state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract talks began 21 months ago for college instructors, who earn $29,000 
to $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A state mediator met with faculty representatives three times in the past 
several months and once with instructors and administrators, but little was 
accomplished, faculty and administration representatives said. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; CORRECTED CENSUS MAY BRING CITY $10 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are hoping that a judge's ruling may make the city $10 million 
richer. 
</P>
<P>
 The money may be owed to Inglewood by the federal and state governments 
because the 1990 census undercounted the city's minority populations by about 
13,000 people, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics and city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled last week that the 
Bush Administration failed to justify the undercount and said that, because the 
fundamental right to vote was at stake, corrections should be made, said Los 
Angeles Deputy City Atty. Jessica F. Heinz. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has been given 30 days to respond, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood joined with other cities, including New York and Los Angeles, and 
national minority rights groups in suing the federal government shortly after 
census results were completed in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 California and Arizona stand to gain new members in the U.S. House of 
Representatives if the lawsuit is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many cities, including Inglewood, money also is at stake. Many state 
and federal funding projects are based on population, and some cities may have 
been given too little in federal funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood, with a minority population of 90% and the highest estimated 
undercount in the country, would gain an estimated $1 million a year over the 
next decade if the decision is upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1990 we've been denied what we were entitled to," said Deputy City 
Manager Tony DeBellis. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ruling, city officials are not yet counting on the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The lawsuit) is one of those things that's been grinding on," said City 
Manager Paul D. Eckles. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have not been actively involved in the lawsuit, said Assistant 
City Manager Norman Cravens. They have relied on attorneys from the larger 
cities named in the suit and private law firms to handle the case. However, the 
city has chipped in $25,000 to help pay the legal bill, he said. JON GARCIA

 The Los Angeles Police Department plans a recruitment exposition in San Pedro 
on Saturday for harbor-area residents interested in becoming police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are the focus of the department's campaign, which has a goal of hiring 
more than 900 officers by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 15% of Los Angeles police officers are women, said department spokeswoman 
Theresa Adams Lopez. The City Council has directed that women constitute 43% of 
every new academy class, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the recruitment campaign, meetings will be held in each of the LAPD's 18 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's meeting will be at San Pedro High School, 1001 W. 15th St., at 9 
a.m. Written tests will be given at 10:30 a.m. SUSAN WOODWARD

 Marymount College has a second chance to acquire a vacant research facility 
owned by Northrop Grumman Corp. here.  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop spokesman Jim Hart confirmed Tuesday that the 34.4 acres on Crest 
Road, which has been vacant since 1991, again is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Marymount offered to buy the site for between $14.5 million and $15 million in 
June, but was outbid by an unidentified spa company, which offered about $17 
million. That deal, however, apparently has fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
 Marymount is a two-year liberal arts college with 750 students that sits on 
about 26 acres in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Reeves, Marymount's dean of administration, said the Northrop facility 
would allow the college to offer student housing on campus. The university now 
houses students in San Pedro. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; NO CONSENSUS ON SPECIAL LIBRARY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay cities are in conflict on whether to support a special tax to fund 
local county libraries, library officials said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Carson and Lomita city councils voted unanimously to support a special 
district this week. But officials in Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Avalon 
have rejected the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Alexander, Los Angeles County library regional administrator, has been 
asking city councils throughout the South Bay to support the special district 
to help replace more than $30 million in cuts to the library system. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts have forced many libraries to reduce hours, freeze spending on books, 
computers and reference materials, and rely on donations and volunteers to keep 
operating, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 The special district would cost each household about $28.50. If enough cities 
participate, it would raise up to $8 million, Alexander said. The county 
library district's revenue now comes mainly from property taxes and is 
distributed based on how heavily libraries are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the special district, the Lomita library would be open at least three 
days a week and would be guaranteed a full staff and materials budget, said 
Ruth Herbert, president of the Friends of Lomita Library. "If enough cities 
participate, we could get as many as five days." 
</P>
<P>
 In Carson, two county libraries have been closed and others have had their 
hours slashed. Electing not the participate in the district could lead to 
additional cuts, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic what would happen if we didn't (support the district)," Carson 
Mayor Michael I. Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who spoke out against the tax worry that the money raised would 
never reach local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The county is) greedy, hungry and desperate," said Lomita resident and 
Planning Commissioner Dan L. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach say pulling out of the county 
library district and funding their own local libraries may be better than 
joining the special district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The special district would pay for three days a week, and we already have 
that," Manhattan Beach City Manager Bill Smith said. "We already pay for two 
days out of our own city budget."  
</P>
<P>
 A Hermosa Beach study showed that for every $3 taken in taxes for the library, 
residents only got $1 back in services. The Hermosa library is open only two 
days a week, City Manager Stephen R. Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the amount city residents are already paying for library services, "we 
could run our own library for five days a week," Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hawthorne, Lawndale and Gardena are scheduled to vote on joining 
the special district within the next few weeks, Alexander said. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; MAN HELD AFTER SHOTS ARE FIRED INTO LIBRARY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who was arrested after five shots were fired into the Redondo Beach 
library said he was test firing his .22-caliber rifle, a police investigator 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Ernest, 51, of Redondo Beach was arrested on suspicion of shooting into 
an inhabited dwelling after a half-hour standoff in the 400 block of North 
Pacific Coast Highway on Tuesday afternoon, Sgt. Rick Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Phillip Cerda, 31, was also arrested but was later released.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's shooting did not result in any injuries, police say, although a 
bullet struck the leg of an officer evacuating the building. But because the 
bullet had traveled through a wall it did not have enough force to cause a 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest lives in an apartment inside the Redondo Cyclery store next to the 
library, Petersen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police responded to a call of shots fired at the library about 4 p.m., and two 
officers from the SWAT team were deployed as snipers, police spokesman Jeff 
Cameron said. Police evacuated several dozen people from the library, he said.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; MORMON CHURCH IS ACTIVELY SEEKING MEMBERS AMONG ASIANS 
AND OTHER LOCAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mormon missionaries Yu-Chudn Cheng, an emigre from Taiwan, and Tyler 
Charlesworth, a burly Utah football player, slip off their shoes in the 
entryway and pad through Alex Chen's Lomita home. 
</P>
<P>
 Within sight of a large image of Buddha, Cheng teaches about the Mormon 
church, showing Chen a series of charts, and gives him a Book of Mormon and 
pamphlets -- all in Mandarin Chinese. Charlesworth doesn't speak Mandarin, so 
he studies his own church literature while Cheng teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng, who converted to the church as a teen-ager, believes so fervently in 
his calling that he traveled to Utah to learn English so he could bring the 
faith to Mandarin-speaking people in the United States during his mission. But 
conversion was not without sacrifice. Cheng says that after he became a Mormon, 
his parents told him he "was no longer their son." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng and Charlesworth leave Chen with a promise to call again. 
</P>
<P>
 The missionaries spend six days a week combing neighborhoods in search of 
people willing to learn about the Mormon religion. About four or five people 
each month ask for information in Mandarin, a smAll sign of the larger trends 
that are remaking the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a homogeneous church best known outside its ranks for the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir, Brigham Young University and the Osmond family, the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is expanding and diversifying at a rapid pace 
in Southern California and around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Church membership grew by 22% in the United States between 1982 and 1991, 
while some mainstream Protestant denominations reported declines of up to 40%, 
according to the National Council of Churches. Church membership worldwide has 
climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million, according to church figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the trends have been mixed. The Mormon Church has seen 
some of its white membership age and retire to other regions of the country. 
But in the South Bay, the church has reached out to replace its departing white 
members with Latinos, Pacific Islanders, AsiaNs And others. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is organized into stakes, which are regional units made up of 
congregations called wards, which typically have 400 to 600 members, and 
branches, which range from a dozen members to several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons in the South Bay are served bythe Torrance, Torrance North, Palos 
Verdes and Inglewood stakes. Church facilities house a variety of wards 
specifically for ethnic groups. On Sundays, wards use the facilities in shifts 
to accommodate services, Sunday school and leadership meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Mormons worship each week in a church, but they must travel to West 
Los Angeles to the Mormon Temple for marriage and rites intended to seal 
spouses to each other and to their children in this life and for eternity. In 
California, the only other temples are in San Diego and in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the weekly teachings are the same in every ward around the world, the 
church adapts by offering services in languages in use in local areas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 1/2 years ago, the Palos Verdes Ward established a Japanese branch 
that serves the families of Japanese auto manufacturers and others who want 
services in the language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps them to give them some reFerence point, to feel more accustomed to 
the American culture in general," said Mark Tateuka, president of the Japanese 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the influx of Japanese-speaking people into the area, South Bay 
church officials asked for help reaching them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a request to the mission president that we need the ability to 
communicate to them in their own language," said Martin Slater, president of 
the Torrance North Stake.  
</P>
<P>
 Another fast-growing segment of the church is Pacific Islanders. Titus K. May, 
57, president of the Inglewood Stake, traces his roots to Hawaiian and 
Napoleonic royalty. Besides its English-speaking wards, Inglewood also has 
Tongan wards, where some men come to meetings in long robes and straw belts. 
Church officials say most of the Tongans converted on their home islands, where 
more than half of the population is Mormon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the growth, the church has poured millions of dollars into its 
Southern California facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the church opened a $4-million, 50,000-square-foot worship 
center at 228th and Main streets in Carson. The Huntington Park West Stake 
center is expected to open this fall, and the church is planning to spend $4 
million renovating the Hollywood Ward and the Wilshire Ward in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is also purchasing an eight-acre parcel at 3000 E. South St. in 
Lakewood. Church officials say plans for the site may include a building that 
could house as many as eight congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 The six wards that worship in the Carson church include two Samoan units, a 
Spanish unit, a singles unit and two English units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Stake has two English-speaking wards, a singles ward and 
Chinese, Japanese and Spanish branches.  
</P>
<P>
 Church officials say wards based on language are for the convenience of 
members, but that the ideal would be to hold all services in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be my desire for complete integration, if the language abilities 
allowed it," said Martin Slater, president of the Torrance North Stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographic changes are in striking contrast to a common perception that 
the Mormon church is a predominantly white church that has sought to stay that 
way. After all, the church denied priesthood to blacks for more than a century 
until a "divine revelation" in 1978 ended such discrimination and opened the 
door to "every faithful, worthy man in the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from its inception, the church began sending missionaries to Europe and 
to Mexico. In 1988 the church celebrated its 100th year in SAmoa. Since its 
inception, the church has ventured into 149 countries, "every country that 
allows it to come in," said J. Gordon Melton, director of the Santa 
Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Mormons would be among the five most ethnically and culturally diverse 
churches going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Book of Mormon, the pillar of the church's faith, tells the story of 
immigrants from the Middle East who founded elaborate civilizations in the 
Americas. Visited by Christ after the Resurrection, they prospered for 
centuries, only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and infighting.  
</P>
<P>
 Their story, inscribed on golden tablets, was said to have been found in New 
York by Joseph Smith in 1823, guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni. It 
is an image of Moroni, covered in gold leaf, that can be seen holding a trumpet 
atop the church's temples.

 Smith established for the church a strict code of conduct.  
</P>
<P>
 Mormons are expected to donate one-tenth of their income to the church, wear 
special undergarments with markings that symbolize a covenant with God and 
follow dietary rules banning alcohol, coffee, tea and tobacco, and urge that 
meat be consumed sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the church espoused polygamy in the early 19th Century, it officially 
discarded the practice in 1890.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the church's tight-knit families gather one night each week for a "home 
evening" devoted to prayer, study and other activities that can range from 
board games to night skiing. The church teaches that it is important for 
families to get along because they will meet again in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirits of dead ancestors, identified by zealous genealogical research in 
the church's databank of more than 2 billion names, are also offered a chance 
at glory, and those found worthy are promised resurrection as celestial beings, 
with the privilege to learn at God's feet and eventually to rise to a godly 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Devout Mormons pray, study and socialize every Sunday at chapels, or meeting 
houses. Classes, worship and meetings can fill up to 10 hours a week, with 
volunteer pastors, known as bishops, and higher-ranking church officials 
putting in much more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Faabo Asi, a new bishop in one of Carson's Samoan wards, attends to many of 
the same needs as a parish priest. He offers help and counseling, coordinates 
activities and tends to the spiritual needs of the church members.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you volunteer your service for something, you are blessed for it," Asi 
says when asked about the time he devotes to ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 With no professional clergy, church services are led by members of the 
congregation. Church members can baptize their own children or spouses, they 
practice healing rites, and all male members are eligible for priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith J. Atkinson, a church spokesman who served a mission in Mexico, said the 
church's hands-on approach has attracted many Latinos, who he believes find a 
sense of empowerment in the Mormon traditions that enable them to perform 
baptisms, blessings and other functions in their own families that in the other 
churches would be performed by a priest or minister.  
</P>
<P>
 Other Mormon converts are attracted by the church's commitment to traditional 
family values and stringent moral guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 After a young Mormon from Utah visited her family at their home in the 
Philippines, Tessie Castillo converted to the faith at the age of 17. She 
served her mission in Des Moines, Iowa, and now attends the singles ward in the 
Palos Verdes Stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo believes the focus on familiar icons, strong family values and 
education made it easy for her to convert from Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 The church depends on members such as Castillo and Asi to be examples of 
Mormonism's virtues. Church leaders say many converts are introduced to the 
church by Mormon neighbors. But casual contacts alone do not account for the 
church's rapid expansion. Clues to understanding that phenomenon lie in the 
church's structure and tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 The church promotes a high birth rate among couples. Temple statues and church 
literature depict large families as the ideal, and women's roles as mothers and 
homemakers are emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon children, meanwhile, are groomed for missionary work from the moment 
they are old enough to learn the words to "I Hope They Call Me on a Mission" in 
the Mormon hymnal. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they are 19, the age at which they are eligible to serve, few 
Mormon men consider doing anything else. They send letters to Salt Lake City 
stating their willingness to serve and wait for marching orders. Women are 
eligible at 21 to serve 18-month missions and now constitute 22% of the 
missionary roster, church officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 If a foreign language is required, missionaries are trained at the Missionary 
Training Center in Provo, Utah. The center offers courses in 44 languages and 
trains about 3,300 missionaries each month, church officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu-Chudn Cheng, who learned English at the training center, has taught Mormon 
beliefs to Mandarin- and English-speaking people in Los Angeles for more than a 
year. Cheng said he often spends much of his time explaining the teachings 
relating to Jesus Christ because Taiwanese traditionally are Buddhist and don't 
know much about Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon youngsters often start saving money when they are small to pay for 
their living expenses while serving on their missions. To ease the burden on 
families whose children are sent to high-cost areas such as Japan, the church 
now asks each missionary's family to pay $350 per month in missionary support. 
Those who travel to low-cost areas contribute the same amount, effectively 
subsidizing the others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While serving on their missions, men and women are expected to abide by rules 
of conduct that make everyday Mormon standards seem relaxed: no dating, no 
television, no radio, no movies, no family visits and no more than two phone 
calls home per year. 
</P>
<P>
 They rise at 6 a.m., study religion for a few hours, hit the sidewalk by 9:30 
a.m. and are not permitted to return to their apartments until 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50,000 missionaries are stationed around the globe, church officials 
say. There are 212 missionaries in the Los Angeles Mission, which includes the 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of other local religious leaders to Mormonism's tenacious 
campaign ranges from grudging admiration to restrained irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon missionary activity is "far more aggressive than anything we're 
doing," said Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles. "I don't want to say being aggressive is bad. Maybe we should be 
saying we're not aggressive enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church has begun strengthening its ties to the ethnic communities 
of Southern California, he said. The St. Thomas Aquinas parish in Monterey 
Park, for example, was recently designated a Chinese-speaking evangelical 
center. The move was intended to offer a home parish to the region's Chinese 
population, although the decision also angered a large segment of the parish's 
predominantly Latino membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coiro said he does not believe the Catholic church's Latino stronghold is 
being eroded by the Mormon Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon Church is "one of the many religions, sects and cults that are out 
there trying to attract people," he said. "Mormons ask people to believe in 
some very fantastic things, like they can become the gods of their own planets. 
SoMeone who's well grounded in Christianity is not going to join a religion 
that says you can become God." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mormons say there is nothing fantastic about living by strict moral 
guidelines, emphasizing family and religion, and serving others as a way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if everybody in the world were doing that, it would be a lot 
better," Charlesworth said.

 Fluxus is having a birthday party. The 1960s experimental art movement, 
credited with helping develop performance art, conceptual art, video art and 
other art forms, will be honored on its 30th anniversary in a traveling exhibit 
opening Sunday at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a relatively small group of Fluxus artists who worked to re-establish 
art as an integral part of life, rather than the profession it had become by 
the 1960s. They used humor, multimedia, experimentalism and other 
out-of-the-ordinary approaches in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Spirit of Fluxus" will include more than 1,000 works and documentary 
items representing more than 40 artists. The exhibit, which runs through Oct. 
16, will open with a free party including interactive tours, gallery games, 
performance art and music. Alice Hutchins, Larry Miller, Ben Vautier and 
Yoshimasa Wada will be among the artists entertaining guests with street 
theater work. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be other special presentations to coincide with the exhibit's stay 
at the museum. The first will be an evening with Fluxus artist Yoko Ono on 
Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday 11 
a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Regular admission is $4 for adults, 
$3 for seniors, $2.50 for students and free for children younger than 6. The 
museum is at 1130 State St. Call 963-4364.

Park and Recreation Department will present the Avant Gardeners at the Alameda 
Park bandstand on Sunday. Vocalist and trumpet player Nate Birkey will lead the 
band in the jazz/blues concert, beginning at 3 p.m. The park is located at 
Micheltorena and Anacapa streets.

MUSIC; HALIBUTS RIDING WAVE OF SURFER POPULARITY; THE REVIVALIST GROUP SHOULD 
FEEL AT HOME AT SANTA BARBARA'S TOES TAVERN, WHICH IS DECORATED WITH MEMENTOS 
OF THE AREA'S CELEBRATED SPORT.

 ". . . And you'll never hear surf music again . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jimi Hendrix 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, so what do you expect from a guy from Seattle -- a reliable surf 
forecast? 
</P>
<P>
 Surf music, a phenomenon originating in Southern California, has never really 
gone away, and today it's probably healthier than the water in the Santa Monica 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, surf music with its twangy guitars, thundering basses 
and wailing saxes has had its ups and downs, much like the waves along the 
coast of the Southland beach cities. This kowabunga karma probably won't ever 
play in Kansas or even Bakersfield, at least until the Big One creates 
beachfront property in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 But along the coast, there's always a surf music revival group. This time it's 
the Halibuts, who will be hanging-10 all over Toes Tavern in Santa Barbara on 
Friday night, causing finheads, gremmies and hodads alike to do that surfer 
stomp. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument is still on as to who was first, but back in 1961, instrumental 
surf music seemed to sprout simultaneously in the South Bay with the Belairs 
and down the road apiece in Orange County with Dick Dale & the Del-Tones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfaris, the Chantays, the Pyramids, the Challengers, Eddie & the Showmen 
and the Lively Ones among others all had instrumental hits in the early '60s. 
While the Beach Boys, Jan & Dean and the Fantastic Baggys sang about what it 
looked like in the Golden State -- sun, surf, girls, cars and more girls -- the 
instrumental bands described what it sounded like to be locked in the tube of a 
10-foot left. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Dale, "The King of the Surf Guitar," who just released an album a few 
months ago, bridges the gap from 1961 to the present. But the newer surf bands, 
which began appearing around 1980 and include the Malibooz, Jon & the 
Nightriders and Ventura's own Big Wednesday, are sometimes labeled surf revival 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Such, perhaps, are the Halibuts, who have been around for about 15 years, and 
definitely are not new by musical standards. The band includes Peter Curry and 
Rick Johnson on guitars, Kevin Daley on bass, Randy Haskins on drums, Joe Lyou 
on sax and Bruce Paddy on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surf music right now is probably bigger than it has been for awhile," said 
Curry during a recent phone interview. "There's probably seven or eight bands 
right now playing surf music in the old style. About five years ago, we were 
about the only ones." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a band's address didn't matter, and even having a beach and 
waves nearby was unimportant. The Astronauts out of Denver had a hit with 
"Baja" in 1964, and the Rivieras had a hit about the same time when they sang 
of that warm "California Sun." The Rivieras were from the Midwest; maybe Lake 
Erie was breaking . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we get fan mail from all over California, the East Coast and even 
Europe, but nowhere in between," said Curry. 
</P>
<P>
 Instrumental surf music is far more predictable than the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty traditional," said Johnson. "We have a killer bass and drums and 
churning guitars. It hasn't really changed a lot except maybe it's a little 
more aggressive. We all use old equipment that we started collecting a long 
time ago. Since we started back in '79 or '80, we were into the old stuff. At 
first, we didn't even know how to play but we learned, and we've become quite a 
bit better as a band. But we'll never change and we've never wanted a singer. 
No desire." 
</P>
<P>
 If surf music hasn't changed much, the beaches have, especially up here in the 
805 area code. Southers, since the '60s, are used to leaving a day early in 
order to find somewhere to park, then every wave has a million people going 
left, another going right, and now the lifeguards at some state beaches have 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I surf a lot, and I've never had any trouble," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Halibuts couldn't have chosen a more appropriate venue than Toes Tavern, 
whose owners refer to it as a "classic surf bar." There are surfboards hanging 
from the ceiling, 30-year-old surf movies running continuously and vintage 
photos, lending further proof to the old surf adage, "Dude, you should've been 
here yesterday . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "We only play about once a month because we don't want to wear it out," said 
Curry. "People that come to see us are usually in their late 20s, early 30s, 
mostly surfers. Most of us have real jobs -- we're all taxpayers. We usually do 
about three hours, usually without an opening act. We know about 75 songs, I 
think, about half of those are originals. Oh, and we don't play east of 
Sepulveda Boulevard anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how flat the surf is, there always seems to be a couple of finheads, 
members of the Optimist Club obviously, waiting for a swell. The Halibuts, too, 
are patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll do another CD, in three years or so, I dunno," said Curry. "We 
don't move very fast." Details

THEATER REVIEW; IF BUTLER DIDN'T DO IT, MYSTERY SHOW STILL HAS SUSPECTS GALORE; 
'BUT WHY BUMP OFF BARNABY?' OFFERS A MAZE OF POSSIBILITIES FOR AFICIONADOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aggravated parents shouldn't get excited over the Moorpark Melodrama's current 
"But Why Bump Off Barnaby?" No purple dinosaur gets offed in this comic murder 
mystery; you'd be thinking of Barney. In fact, the Melodrama's first 
non-musical production in eight years is great fun. 
</P>
<P>
 We're deep in Agatha Christie country here: The long-absent member of an 
aristocratic English family, Barnaby Folcey returns home at the request of 
patriarch Orion Leduc. Things aren't all as they appear to be at the family 
manse, and before long, prodigal Barnaby has become the late Barnaby. Dying, he 
scrawls a message that (as it turns out) could implicate virtually anybody in 
the house. The other problem is that, while Barnaby had a motive for killing 
most of the others, none of the others had any perceptible motive to kill 
Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Barnaby (Robert Plunkett) and Leduc (Nels Jorgensen), the 
characters -- virtually all of them suspects -- include police reporter and 
nominal hero Jeff Barnett (Scott Humphries), his addled fiancee Dora Dunstock 
(Ami Shupe), hearing-impaired Lady Barbara (Gayle Hendrix-Harris), vain and 
flirtatious movie star Cleo Barton (Deborah Webster), Leduc's fortune-hunting 
"friend" Rosalind Barstow (Buffy Jo Fitch), nanny Miss Barnsdale (Gale Grove), 
Medkins the butler (JC Bishop) and Magnolia the maid (Ginger Marin). 
</P>
<P>
 There is a real mystery among the shenanigans, one that can be solved from 
clues revealed during the play (beyond that, we shall offer no further 
information). But much of the entertainment value comes from watching what 
director Steve Robertson and his cast do with Rick Abbot's well-wrought, 
consistently amusing script -- watch -- for instance, Magnolia struggle with 
the guests' heavy luggage, a gag that's all but thrown away behind the main 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no songs in "Barnaby," but musical director Tim King supplies piano 
and synthesizer accompaniment throughout, and the cast gathers, along with 
Kevin McDonald and Amy Sullivan, for a post-Barnaby "salute to the good old 
days of vaudeville," an approximately half-hour song and dance revue 
choreographed by Erin Appling. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "But Why Bump Off Barnaby?" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursdays at 7 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Matinees 
Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. through Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Company Theater, 45 E. 
High St., Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Thursday, all seats $8; Friday, all seats $10; and Saturday 
evening, all seats $12; Saturday and Sunday matinees, $12 adults; $9.50 seniors 
and children. Group rates are available for some performances. Visa and 
MasterCard accepted.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; MOTHER MARIA'S DAILY MIRACLE; CARING FOR 6 
CHILDREN, 3 OF THEM DISABLED, IS A BIG TASK BUT ONE SHE DOES WITH A SMILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After gently bathing her two young daughters, Maria Romero lays them both on 
the bed they share, wraps their little bodies in fluffy towels and begins to 
comb out their black, shiny hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old mother of six braids the girls' hair into precise plaits, 
laughing while tickling Milagros, 5, and Guadalupe, 3. She's gotten this 
process of bathing, dressing and grooming both girls down to 30 minutes, she 
says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 She hoists up Milagros -- the "miracle" -- and straps her into a tiny 
wheelchair with a pink "Little Mermaid" backpack. Her younger daughter goes in 
an even smaller wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen, each girl must be fed by hand; then Maria brings out cups of 
milk mixed with dried baby food and carefully sets up tubes and syringes to let 
the liquid drip down their throats. 
</P>
<P>
 While his sisters are being fed, Manuel, 17, the eldest Romero child, sits in 
his wheelchair at the kitchen table silently playing solitaire on his computer. 
Maria will feed him later, laying him flat on his back, inserting a plastic 
tube into his mouth and monitoring the blended food, making sure it doesn't go 
into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tending to six children would be a tiring task under any circumstances, but 
when three of them are severely disabled, the job becomes monumental. Maria 
Romero wakes close to dawn each morning and doesn't get to bed until close to 
11 p.m., while her husband, Jose, 39, works long hours as a truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally simple tasks, such as dressing and bathing children, become demanding 
chores when those children cannot step into pants or sit up in the tub. 
Feedings require scrupulous attention when a slight error could mean choking. 
Many times, taking a short trip has meant that Maria must hoist a 200-pound 
wheelchair into a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, armed only with an elementary school education and with her abiding love 
for her children, Maria not only does these things, but does them cheerfully 
and with meticulous care. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria "is one of the most wonderful mothers I have ever met," said Dr. Irene 
Gilgoff, the children's physician. "These children all have swallowing 
problems. None has ever been ill. She feeds them with the most loving care. 
I've never met a mother quite like her. She's absolutely wonderful. She always 
has a smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel, Milagros and Guadalupe are afflicted with congenital myopathy, a rare, 
genetic form of muscular dystrophy that confines them to wheelchairs. The 
Romeros' other children, Gerardo, 13, Jose Jr., 11, and Daniel, 6, are 
completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children affected by congenital myopathies are born very weak, Gilgoff said. 
They are often unable to swallow or to eat effectively. The disease is not 
progressive, Gilgoff said; the children's disabilities will not worsen and they 
have a normal life expectancy. Nor is their intellect or development affected, 
and Manuel has proven himself a sharp student. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel, who is weaker than his sisters, is especially at risk for pneumonia. 
Still, he has never been sick because of his parents' conscientious care, the 
pediatrician said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the living room of the family's modest three-bedroom home on Elliot Avenue 
in El Monte, photographs of the six Romero children line the walls. In the 
corner stands a glass case full of trophies, testimony to the younger boys' 
sports talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, Jose Jr. and especially Gerardo help their mother by baby-sitting or 
feeding their sisters. Just playing with them is enough to give Maria a break. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard sometimes but it doesn't bother me," said Gerardo, an avid baseball 
and football player. "We have to do our best. There's nothing else we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Finances make the situation more difficult. Although the family has medical 
insurance through Jose's $11.30-an-hour job, his plan does not cover many 
expenses. Like the children's feeding tubes and syringes. The tubes cost $2 
each; the syringes $5 each, Maria said. The tubes and syringes are supposed to 
be used once and then thrown away; Maria washes the plastic instruments out 
with hot water and uses them repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Jose often have had to deny their other children the things they 
want. Gerard, Jose Jr. and Daniel have asked for expensive cereals or Reeboks, 
but they get the cheaper brands. "Sometimes they mind," she said. "They ask, 
'Why? Why?' and I tell them because it's the only thing we can afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose owns his own home and two small houses that sit on the same lot. One of 
Maria's six sisters lives in the front house and helps Maria take care of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard but she's always happy," said the sister, Antonia Abarca. "She 
never gets sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel and the girls share a room in the family's cluttered but clean house. 
The three boys share another room, Jose and Maria the third. On Manuel's side 
of the room, a Cindy Crawford poster, a Frederick's of Hollywood lingerie 
calendar and a poster of a white sports car are pasted to the walls. Numerous 
religious objects -- crucifixes, rosary beads and pictures of saints -- are 
attached to the white walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The family receives aid from the state Department of Rehabilitation and 
California Children's Services, a state-run organization that provides 
assistance in obtaining equipment. Still, it's tough. With six children to 
feed, Maria spends from $110 to $120 a week on groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go anyplace. We just stay home," Maria said. "Sometimes we go to the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 When the family does venture out to the park, other children stare at the 
procession of wheelchairs. "They say, 'Look. Look,' " Maria said. "But I just 
ask them if they want to play with my girls." The Romeros also often go to 
relatives' homes for parties. "All my family knows I'm happy with (my 
children)," Maria said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jose recently saved enough money to buy a $17,000 van. In July, the family 
received an electric wheelchair lift, worth about $4,500. The lift was donated 
to the family through the efforts of El Monte Police Officer Don Johnston, who 
became a paraplegic after being shot in the line of duty in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, a helicopter spotter for the police department, had been featured in 
an advertising campaign for Ricon Corp., a Pacoima-based manufacturer of 
wheelchair lifts, called "Everyday Heroes." The company gave him a lift because 
of his participation in the campaign, but he already had one and rather than 
accept the new one or ask for something else, he chose to donate it to a family 
in need. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romeros certainly qualified. Maria was lifting the kids and their 
wheelchairs into their old van; Manuel's electric wheelchair alone weighs about 
200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston found out about the Romero family because he is the "Adopt-a-Cop" for 
Byron E. Thompson School for the Orthopedically Handicapped, the school that 
Guadalupe and Milagros attend. The school serves students ages 3 to 15 who have 
special needs from 15 school districts, said principal Frank Greenwood.  
</P>
<P>
 Manuel attended Thompson School until he was 15. He then went to Bassett High 
School in La Puente, where he graduated with honors in June. Next week, Manuel 
will begin attending Cal State Fullerton on a full scholarship. He will study 
computer science. The family is working on getting Manuel transportation to the 
university and once at the school he will have a full-time attendant to help 
him in his classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Students at Thompson School are noted for their musical group, the Handbell 
Choir. When he was a student at the school, Manuel did not have enough muscle 
control to hold onto a bell and participate, said Lesley Wheatley assistant 
principal and a teacher at the school who has known Manuel since he was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manuel would sit and listen to us play," Wheatley said. "Then one day he came 
in with a little keyboard and started playing with one finger all of the songs 
that we had been playing." The class was stunned, Wheatley said, and from that 
point on Manuel would accompany the choir on his keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel "is very bright, very gifted in computers and has a great sense of 
humor," Wheatley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Manuel's condition prevents him from being able to talk distinctively and his 
jaw, like those of his sisters, hangs open. But he operates a computer that 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The children's condition gives them the appearance that they are sad, 
principal Greenwood said. But they're really not. In fact, Milagros and 
Guadalupe both seem to be happy children, often picking on their brothers and 
laughing with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maria jokingly asks "Who's a crybaby?" Milagros says "Danny," referring 
to her 6-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Murakami, Milagros' teacher, said the 5-year-old girl seems to enjoy 
class activities, such as music, math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milagros is very headstrong and determined," assistant principal Wheatley 
said. "That's going to get her far." 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe just started at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Jose amaze neighbors, teachers and friends with their cheerful 
attitudes and the affectionate, bubbling environment they have created in their 
home for all six of their children. People ask how she does it, Maria said. "I 
say I do it because they're my kids and I love them. I love them a lot. I give 
all my time to them and I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never feel sad," Maria said, playing with her daughters on the living room 
floor. "I don't have time to get sad." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not exactly true. At other times, Maria concedes that from time to time 
she would get angry at God, but not for very long. "At night, when everyone is 
asleep, I sometimes cry for a little while," she said. But she added that she 
wakes up the next morning and gets on with her tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose and Maria first noticed something unusual about their first son four 
months after he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared to be weak and was emitting lots of saliva," Maria said. "He was 
congested and doctors referred him to Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in 
Downey." 
</P>
<P>
 The diagnosis: congenital myopathy, a non-progressive weakness of the muscles 
that may or may not be genetic. The doctors could not tell the Romeros what 
caused the condition or whether any other children the couple wanted to have 
would be afflicted with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria worried her way through her next three pregnancies. "It was so scary," 
she said. "I couldn't sleep at night." Her three boys were all born without the 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple wanted a daughter. So when Maria became pregnant with the 
couple's fifth child and an amniocentesis revealed the baby was a girl, the 
Romeros were elated. They decided to name her "Milagros," Spanish for 
"miracle." But they soon noticed something familiar about their first daughter. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Like Manuel, Milagros was afflicted with congenital myopathy, as Guadalupe, 
the youngest of the Romero children, would be when she was born two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 It's often a hard life, family members admit. But they don't spend time or 
energy on self-pity or wishing things were different. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children are never treated like they're not capable of doing anything," 
Gilgoff, their physician, said. "They're very disabled but she's never treated 
them like anything but another child." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria has expectations for her children, Gilgoff said. She has helped Manuel 
graduate from high school and has worked to get him special devices, such as a 
computer with a voice box that allows him to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked her hopes for her children, Maria said, "That they never get sick, 
never get sick. I like them the way they are."

 Local authors Margaret Jones, biographer of country singer Patsy Cline, and 
Kathryn Phillips, author of "Tracking the Vanishing Frogs," have been on the 
campaign trail sharing the contents of their important works at bookstores and 
via radio interviews. Jones just returned to her Ojai home after a five-city 
tour, which took her to New York, Kentucky and Tennessee in behalf of "Patsy: 
The Life and Times of Patsy Cline" published by HarperCollins. Cline, who died 
in an airplane crash in 1963 at the age of 30, was a singer and performer with 
so much talent and charisma that 31 years later, her records continue to sell 
in the millions. Jones, a free-lance journalist and regular contributor to 
Publishers Weekly, spent almost four years researching and writing the 
biography. "Patsy was an icon, almost a mythological figure, and her spirit was 
near me as I wrote her incredible story," says Jones.

 In 1972 Ray Milland played an evil character in a horror movie called "Frogs." 
After consuming some good guys, the hordes of marauding frogs finally kill 
Milland. The reality is that frogs and other amphibians seem to be vanishing 
almost overnight all over the world. Ventura writer Kathryn Phillips, who 
worked for three years on her ecological mystery, "Tracking the Vanishing 
Frogs," spent months in marshes and bogs and with tough, single-minded 
scientists. Like Rachel Carson's classic "Silent Spring," Phillips' book sounds 
an alarm that the vanishing frogs may be a warning that ozone depletion and 
destruction of forests have reached dangerous levels. Published by St. Martin's 
Press, the book includes photographs and descriptions of the habits and 
appearance of these wondrous and bizarre creatures. Phillips will be 
interviewed between 12:15 and 2 p.m. Saturday on KTMS 1250 AM and will present 
a slide show at 7 p.m. Wednesday at The Earthling in Santa Barbara.

 There was a time (not long ago) when mystery / detective fiction was looked 
upon by book critics as a primitive branch of literature. But now the genre 
flourishes, its practitioners are taken seriously, and people are reading so 
much of this fiction that specialty bookstores can sustain themselves by 
focusing on the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Mysteries to Die For opened its doors at 2940 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand 
Oaks, 18 months ago. Owner Audrey Moore is hosting a party to celebrate the 
occasion and to thank her patrons and autographing authors who have been so 
supportive. The festivities will begin at 1 p.m. Saturday with Wendy Hornsby 
("Bad Intent") and Ken Kuhlken ("The Angel Gang") signing their new books. 
Other mystery writers who plan to attend are Paul Bishop, Jan Burke, Michael 
Connelly, Robert Crais, Gar Haywood, Bruce Jones, Marsha Landreth, Sharan 
Newman and Dianne Pugh.

TOPICS / LAW ENFORCEMENT; DEPUTIES TAKE A NEW TACK ON CRIMINALS WITH TEAM 
POLICING; THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PROGRAM IN CARSON INCLUDES NEIGHBORHOOD 
MEETINGS AND OFF-PATROL TIME TO CREATE AND EXECUTE ANTI-CRIME PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new program at the Carson Sheriff's Department gives deputies time to 
mastermind plans to fight crime rather than just chase criminals after crimes 
have been committed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a carefully choreographed sting recently, for example, deputies faked a 
traffic stop and arrest, leaving a sports car on the street with a 
videocassette recorder and cellular phone on the front seat. Less than an hour 
later, two men broke into the car and tried to take the electronics gear. 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy watching from inside a nearby home summoned patrol cars, and within 
minutes, the suspects were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was drawn up and executed by a group of deputies operating under the 
Team Policing program at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, deputies are assigned to teams responsible for specific 
geographic regions. Team members are given one day a week off patrol to create 
and execute plans to stop crime.  
</P>
<P>
 "Since you're working one targeted area, you know your problem areas," said 
Deputy Frank Lobato. "One day a week you can just concentrate on that area." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its first five months, deputies created 21 of these plans, which have 
resulted in 52 arrests and 49 citations, departmental figures show. Besides the 
sting with the sports car, deputies have rounded up people who drink in public, 
added patrols where neighbors have complained about drug dealing, and stalked 
taggers in their favorite graffiti spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, some members of the Sheriff's Department suspected that community 
policing had more to do with public relations than policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into it, a lot of people were very leery," said Deputy Joseph Dempsey. 
"They thought it might mean just having tea and coffee with people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sgt. Todd Rogers wants residents to know the program is a serious effort 
to reduce crime. Rogers designed the concept for his master's thesis at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a public relations gimmick at all. We have this program to effect 
meaningful change," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each area's team targets a particular crime based on calls for help or an 
increase in crime. The teams also hold neighborhood meetings each month to find 
out what concerns residents. Then the deputies meet to devise a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies say being able to interact with residents who aren't criminals has 
reduced their "siege mentality" and given them greater job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people are decent, upstanding people . . . but (on patrol) we 
are not dealing with the everyday good citizens," Dempsey said. "This is kind 
of refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Moore, who helped organize the Neighborhood Watch in Centerview, said the 
pilot program for team policing in his neighborhood helped cut down crime. "I 
am very much in favor of a community-type policing program," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson station is the first Los Angeles Sheriff's Department facility to 
try the approach. By restructuring the schedule, the department formed the new 
teams without adding deputies or paying overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Capt. Joseph P. James approved the project for all Carson deputies. 
Teams serve the North City, South City and county area. Under the new system, 
deputies work in the same part of the city for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The citywide team policing effort hasn't been as personalized as the pilot 
program, Moore said. During the pilot program he knew the deputies' patrol 
schedule and could call specific people when a stripped car was parked on his 
block or residents were blasting their music.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore isn't the only Centerview resident who became accustomed to being able 
to call a particular deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I don't work in the (Centerview) area anymore . . . when they 
have problems, they tend to call me," Dempsey said.

TOPICS / REAL ESTATE; EXPENSIVE NEW HOMES ARE ATTRACTING BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers of a posh new tract of Mediterranean-style homes have managed to 
sell a handful of units -- and at their $759,000 to $869,000 asking prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riviera Beach Colony, a gated community in the Hollywood Riviera section 
of Torrance, has sold three homes since it opened last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers of the project say it's a sign that the market for the South Bay's 
priciest homes, which dived in value during the recession, is finally coming 
out of its doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has picked up, and I think we're benefiting from that," says Rob 
Dick, the developer of the 28-home neighborhood. "For those who say, 'Where's 
the bottom?' -- I think it was six months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, built in a beachfront section of Torrance that borders the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, offers homes with views of Santa Monica Bay, in-home security 
and built-in stereo systems. Since the first four-bedroom model opened at the 
beginning of July, it has drawn about 300 curious shoppers a week, Dick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers of the first home, who didn't want their names used, bought now 
because they feared the homes would go up in price, their real estate broker 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the higher end, no question, but the land is hard to come by," he said. 
"These homes in 1990 (would have) sold for a million dollars, no question about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate brokers have praised the location of the project and the design of 
its first model, which features limestone and marble floors, a master-bedroom 
balcony, fountains and copper gutters. 
</P>
<P>
 But they aren't so sure that it means that the market for high-end homes is 
recovering. Defense firms still promise more layoffs, which could force more 
aerospace executives who live on the peninsula from their homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Sales on the peninsula have picked up: 472 homes were sold in the first seven 
months of 1994, compared to 377 last year, according to a real estate listing 
service. But most of the sales were of homes priced at less than $500,000, real 
estate brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to be confident of what is going on in the economy," said Jolaine 
Merrill, a broker at Coldwell Banker in Rolling Hills Estates. When prices are 
$600,000 and above, not as many buyers are willing to take the risk, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riviera Beach Colony is one of the few new coastal developments to have 
been built in the South Bay in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to that development is, 'Can they sustain that rate of sales in the 
next few months?' " said Michael Vernick, a broker at RE/Max Palos Verdes 
Realty. TED JOHNSON

SPORTS; HARBOR DETERMINED TO MAKE '93 A DISTANT MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There was a time last year, after a brawl had followed its Sept. 25 game 
against Pierce College, when the future of the Harbor football program appeared 
in question. 
</P>
<P>
 With penalties levied against the school by the Western State Conference for 
its role in the incident, and the adverse publicity that followed, the program 
was staggering like a wounded prizefighter on wobbly knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 11 months later, the Seahawks appear to have recaptured a firm footing. 
As fall practice gets under way, Harbor football is very much alive and 
kicking. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were any lingering effects from last season, they are difficult to 
detect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like you're reading a book," said Gene Miranda, the team's 
offensive coordinator. "Hopefully, you turn the page and you don't have to look 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as school officials are concerned, the incident is ancient history. In 
the aftermath of the brawl, Harbor was placed on one year's probation by the 
conference and forced to forfeit its game against West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also legal repercussions from the fight. Harbor wide receiver Dion 
Mills was convicted of battery and sentenced to two years probation in June for 
knocking out a Pierce assistant coach with a crutch during the postgame melee. 
As a result of the incident, Mills was also expelled by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials prefer to play down any long-term ramifications on the 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say much about it except that a few individuals can sometimes 
hurt the progress of an otherwise good organization," Athletic Director Jim 
O'Brien said. "It's very unfortunate that the coach got hurt. But if that 
hadn't happened, it probably wouldn't have gotten any publicity at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Coach Don Weems sought to place the incident in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the athletes thought it was as big a deal as a lot of other 
people did," he said. "I don't think there is any (college) in America that 
hasn't been involved in an altercation of some kind. It's just unfortunate that 
somebody got seriously hurt in this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Seahawks, the fallout that ensued appears to have 
dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Any initial concerns that there would be an exodus of players from Harbor, or 
that the school would lose potential recruits as a result of the incident, 
failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks have 13 starters and 19 lettermen returning from a squad that 
finished with a 4-5 record. The group includes eight starters from one of the 
top-rated defenses in the state community college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't lose one player because of what happened," Miranda said. "We even 
got a couple of players who came in from other programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Harbor has enjoyed one of its finest recruiting campaigns in recent 
years. Topping the list of incoming freshmen are three former standouts from 
perennial prep power Hawthorne: offensive tackle David Camacho and his brother 
Ricardo at offensive guard, and quarterback Kenji Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum was among the South Bay passing leaders last season, having thrown for 
1,667 yards and 10 touchdowns, and David Camacho is regarded as a major-college 
prospect with his 6-foot-8 and 305-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said other schools tried to use last year's incident against the 
Seahawks, and it was one of the first questions prospects usually asked when 
they were being recruited by Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once the kids came here and saw the true story, they felt a lot more 
comfortable with the situation here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weems, for one, said he is not surprised with his team's recruiting success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want to go to places where they can get (NCAA Division I) scholarships, 
and Harbor has produced as many scholarships for its players as any school in 
Southern California," he said. "I'll match our record with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harbor's not in the garden spot of the world and, for us to get kids to come 
here, we have to convince them that we have their best interests at heart. I 
don't want to see one of our kids pumping gas in the neighborhood in another 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said that after the incident occurred last year, the school had to 
work hard to ensure that any problems have been corrected and the football team 
is headed in the right direction. If anything, the ordeal has served as a good 
character-builder for the players who have returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids really want to show that they're past everything that has happened 
and they just want to go out and play good football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pressing concern for Weems this season is Harbor's difficult 
conference schedule. As fate would have it, the Seahawks have been moved into 
the conference's Southern Division this season because of realignment and will 
not play Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was strictly from luck of the draw, nothing else," Weems said. "I'd just 
as soon play them, I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, though, Harbor is happy that it will be able to start the 
1994 season from square one.

NOTEBOOK / MITCH POLIN; MIRA COSTA'S FONUA IN STABLE CONDITION AFTER SUFFERING 
BRAIN ANEURYSM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mira Costa High three-sport standout Phil Fonua, regarded as one of the 
premier prep football prospects in the nation this year, was transferred out of 
intensive care Wednesday and is in stable condition after undergoing surgery 
for a ruptured blood vessel in his brain last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 and 275-pound Fonua was preparing for his senior season when he 
collapsed Aug. 10 during a workout in the Mira Costa weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 He was initially taken to South Bay Hospital before being transferred to 
Torrance Memorial Medical Center for surgery. Fonua, 18, underwent 5 1/2 hours 
of surgery Thursday as a result of the aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
 "His physician (Dr. James Joachim) said he is very much improved," a hospital 
spokeswoman said. "He's alert and responsive." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman said Fonua has begun therapy. His condition, which was listed 
as serious, was upgraded to stable on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua had been touted as a preseason prep All-America by publications such as 
Street & Smith's and Bluechip Illustrated after an impressive junior season and 
a strong showing at a scouting combine during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, he led the Mira Costa defense with 16 quarterback sacks and also 
rushed for 403 yards and 15 touchdowns and caught 16 passes for 258 yards and 
four touchdowns at fullback and wingback. The Mustangs finished 13-1 and won 
the Southern Section Division VII championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He was honored as the Division VII player of the year and was named to The 
Times' All-South Bay first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua also was a standout center in basketball, averaging 14.7 points and 
making The Times' All-South Bay second team. He completed his junior year by 
finishing fourth in the shotput at the state track and field championships in 
June. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There will be a distinct Carson High flavor to the Santa Monica College 
football team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs will start the season with eight players from Carson on the 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are sophomore linebackers Chris Vaimili and Lomi Fa'avae, 
regarded as two of the top returning players in the Western State Conference. 
Freshmen expected to make the biggest impact are running back John Houston and 
wide receiver Nakia Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston rushed for 681 yards and nine TDs in 98 carries for the Colts last 
season and Wheeler is a big target at 6-foot-5 and 225 pounds. Other former 
Colts on the roster are freshman offensive guards Sterling Bowman and Rico 
Spencer and brothers Tali and Mantunau Salima at offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the players wind up at Santa Monica? The most obvious reason is the 
presence of former Carson standout Rowen Tupuivao, who is Santa Monica's 
defensive coordinator. He is Carson's career leader in tackles with 263 in 1972 
and 1973. 
</P>

 Harbor College is in search of a men's basketball coach after the resignation 
of Carl Strong two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong had coached the Seahawks the past three seasons, posting a record of 
49-46 and guiding the team to three consecutive berths in the Southern 
California playoffs. Harbor was 14-16 last season and finished third in the 
powerful South Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 His resignation came as a surprise to Harbor officials because Strong was a 
Harbor graduate, played basketball there and was regarded as a fixture in the 
athletic program. He had coached at Harbor since coming out of retirement three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Jim O'Brien said the school hopes to name a new coach by the 
end of next week.

WWII: 'HEARTACHE OF TERMINAL ISLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Remembering the Heartache of Terminal Island," July 28:  
</P>
<P>
 * Italian alien fishermen also had to leave Terminal Island, as well as 
Japanese nationals (alien enemies) and their dual-citizen Japanese American 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's easy enough to raise $200,000 for a propaganda museum, when every 
person of Japanese descent (alien or American-born dual-citizen Japanese), 
received $20,000 each for "human suffering."Now they must try to justify the 
unjustifiable by continuing to pervert history, falsify events and revise WWII 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only those of Japanese ancestry were given a $20,000 entitlement for "human 
suffering," because Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) and Norman Y. Mineta (D-San 
Jose) claim that Japanese were rounded up due to racism while Germans and 
Italians were rounded up for cause. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crystal Citizen Department of Justice internment camps, German, Italian and 
Japanese families resided side by side but only Japanese families received 
$20,000 each for human suffering. Some families hauled in -- tax-free -- more 
than $200,000 ($20,000 for each parent, plus $20,000 for each child, including 
those born there. More than 6,000 were born in relocation centers and 
internment camps. Each are paid under an entitlement to $20,000 and a 
government apology.) 
</P>
<P>
 Would any of the military orders come about if Japan had not bombed Pearl 
Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941? 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has just begun coming around to admitting that they were the aggressor 
in WWII. Isn't it time that Americans of WWII vintage receive an apology from 
those who have painted us with the same tar brush as Nazi Germany and fascist 
Japan? There was a Pacific Holocaust, too -- by Japan's militarists, but we 
never hear of this as if the only holocaust took place under Hitler. You can 
look up my biography and realize that where I'm coming from has nothing to do 
with "racism."

BEACHES: NUDE SUNBATHING AT COVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the article "Nude Beach Unveils Political Dispute" (July 14), nude 
sunbathing is freedom from and a welcome antidote for the stress of today's 
hectic society and should be allowed to continue in Smuggler's Cove (Sacred 
Beach) in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 No national or state laws ban naturism (nudity) and local ordinances should 
not be enacted to outlaw this activity in appropriate places.Smuggler's Cove, 
with its hazardous, steep access to the isolated beach, is over a mile distant 
from the nearest residence and is the ideal appropriate place. Risk of 
offending anyone here is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be most unfair to deny the many hundreds who enjoy nude sunbathing 
and swimming here the use of the only nude beach in Los Angeles County because 
of a minuscule minority who may have acted improperly as alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of our highways and streets are posted with speed limit signs. If excess 
speeding is observed, you don't close the streets, you arrest the speeders. If 
improper behavior is observed on any beach, you don't close the beach, you stop 
the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Designating Smuggler's Cove clothing optional and the posting of appropriate 
rules for beach users is the course to take.

POLITICS: COUNCILMAN'S PERFORMANCE IN OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's next on Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr.'s agenda? 
</P>
<P>
 When the Wilmington paint-store-owner-turned-politician was campaigning 
against professional politician Joan Milke Flores, he said he would listen to 
his constituents, make sure they were heard at City Hall and solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after 13 months in office, he has clearly become one of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has he been unsuccessful in convincing the mayor to appoint even a 
disproportionate share of harbor area residents to various city commissions 
overseeing the harbor, parks, police and fire departments or libraries, he has 
now aligned himself with the ultra-liberal factions of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he voted to oppose the "Save Our State" initiative, which is 
intended to crack down on the abuse of public services now given to illegal 
aliens. I guess it doesn't matter that most of his constituents support this 
initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Now we also learn that Svorinich voted to pay off one-time Black Panther 
radical activist Michael Zinzun to the tune of $512,000, even though a judge 
said the case "lacked merit." What a racket! No wonder the city's broke. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Svorinich has dumped his fledgling paint business (graffiti taggers 
beware) to become a full-time professional politician.

POLITICS: LOOKING AT GEISSERT'S ENDORSEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent discussion concerning former Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert's 
endorsement and activities as co-chair of Republicans for Harman is provocative 
for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the use of "popular" to describe the vindictive Geissert is probably 
more myth than accurate.Torrance politics, due to the low voter turnout in 
Geissert's elections, was controlled by City Hall insiders who kept Geissert in 
office for way too long. Her absence from Torrance politics is refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Geissert's endorsement of Rep. Jane Harman and Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen is, as they say in politics, a "quid pro quo" (something for something). 
</P>
<P>
 I knew Geissert would reciprocate when both Harman and Bowen (both Democrats) 
began interfering in the local elections with their endorsements of Geissert's 
candidates. Geissert was desperate that her candidates be elected. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I suspected that "Republican" Geissert would shortly thereafter 
reciprocate with her own endorsement of both Democrats. Again, I was right. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I agree with the comment that "Geissert's commitment to Republican 
principles is questionable." In my view, Geissert is a RINO (Republican In Name 
Only) and without credibility for any Republican to follow.

PARKLAND: HERMOSA'S DEBATE ON BILTMORE PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hermosa's City Council, except for J.R. Reviczky, has risen beyond its level 
of incompetence to outright contempt for the people of Hermosa Beach when it 
contemplates the defeat of the people's will regarding the Biltmore parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many measures placed by our councils regarding the Biltmore parcel, 
only the proposal to sell it as residential passed.Ironically, the council's 
own inaction to sell under that vote permitted time for the people's measure to 
be brought forth to secure the land as open parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure, passed by a 60 to 40 margin. Loud and clear had the people 
spoken this time. The door slammed shut on behind-the-scenes wheeling and 
dealing taking place since the 1960s. The people said they wanted parkland, and 
told their City Council to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 This council has been grudgingly implementing the people's will. The park is 
about to be completed. At night it is one of the most tranquil places along the 
beachfront, providing a buffer between bars and residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the vote, people have often inquired at council why implementation is so 
slow. Council has always espoused that the will of the people is receiving 
highest priority. Many still wonder! 
</P>
<P>
 So at this eleventh hour some on the council may seek to challenge the people 
they claim to represent with a measure regarding Biltmore Park? How cavalier 
and politically ignorant they are of the past if they choose to revisit the 
Biltmore quagmire.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; PICTURE BRIGHTENS WITH NEW MOVIE SYSTEM; THE 
PROJECTION METHOD WILL GIVE A SHARPER IMAGE. BUT IT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO 
ELIMINATE JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The future of film and video projection will get switched on at the Thousand 
Oaks Civic Arts Plaza when the city's new light valve projector goes on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike analog projectors that shine a light through a positive image such as a 
photographic slide or a movie print, a light valve projects directly from a 
digital format. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hook up your videotape or satellite feed and the projector throws an 
image 65 feet across the theater onto an 18-foot-wide screen," said Robert 
Morris, the audiovisual consultant for the soon-to-be-completed Civic Arts 
Plaza. "A standard video projector would be 1/10th as bright." 
</P>
<P>
 The technology's potential has not been lost on theater owners. Current wisdom 
has it that distributors of first-run films will deliver them over the 
high-speed wires that will compose the "information superhighway," hereafter 
referred to in this column as the "I-Way." 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage is that the projectors can run virtually unattended and the 
audience doesn't suffer the frustration of a too-dark screen or a scratchy 
print. Every showing is as crisp as the original, projectionists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside, also according to projectionists, is that many of them will be 
out of a job. But there's plenty of time for lamplighters to save for that dark 
moment. Morris said the price tag for the Thousand Oaks projector approaches 
six figures -- beyond the means of most theaters -- unless, of course, ticket 
prices increase to $15. 
</P>

<P>
 When are three words too much? Apparently when they're in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mann Buenaventura is showing "Mi Vida Loca" a film about Latina gang 
members in Los Angeles. But the theater decided the film would be more 
approachable if they translated the title into English on the marquee.

 Early sign-ups are being accepted for a seminar offered by the Ojai Film 
Society to study screenwriting with a well-known writing teacher. Katherine Ann 
Jones, an award-winning actress and writer, will lead a two-day intensive film 
and TV writing workshop at the Ojai Art Center. Early sign-up ends Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-on course, aimed at both beginning and advanced writers, will cover 
such topics as how to choose a good story for a film or TV show, screenplay 
structure, plot and character development, constructing good dialogue, possible 
sources for stories, adapting from one medium to another and how to sell your 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Clips from well-known films will be used to illustrate specific points and 
frequent round-table discussions will provide the student with feedback from 
both the teacher and the other participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, an Ojai resident, is on the faculty of the USC Cinema and Television 
School, where she teaches advanced screenwriting for graduate students. The 
course costs $125 for anyone signing up before Sept. 15 and $150 after that 
date. For more information call 646-8946. Classes will be held Oct. 8 and 9. 
</P>

PITCHER SILVA GROWS TIRED OF HIS LIFE IN THE FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ted Silva just flew in from Millington, Tenn., and, boy, is he tired. 
</P>
<P>
 From early May, when his Cal State Fullerton team qualified for the NCAA 
regional playoffs, until last week, when the U.S. national team was eliminated 
from the World Baseball Championships here, Silva has visited eight states, 
three countries, two continents and crossed the international dateline twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience hasn't quickened his fastball or improved his slider, but it 
has taught Silva how to handle the suitcase, something he says will make him a 
better pitcher next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be the key for all of us," Silva says of himself and his Team 
USA teammates. "It's just the experience of traveling, playing international 
ball. When we get back to school, those little getaway weekend trips you're 
going to have during the season are going to be nothing compared to (this)." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's odyssey began in November, when he was invited -- along with 63 other 
top college players -- to Homestead, Fla., to try out for the U.S. team. Silva 
earned the honor by going 4-2 with seven saves as a freshman relief pitcher at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 His stock improved last spring during a sophomore season in which he saved 13 
games in 33 appearances and registered a 2.29 earned-run average. But in his 
final game, after matching a career high with four shutout innings in relief, 
Silva gave up a game-winning, 12th-inning home run against Georgia Tech that 
eliminated the Titans from the College World Series in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to struggle this summer, primarily from a lack of work. In Team 
USA's 29-game warm-up for the world amateur championships, Silva pitched only 
10 innings, giving up five runs. In Nicaragua, he got in three games, the most 
memorable appearance coming against South Korea in a game the U.S. had to win 
to advance to the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva came on with one out in the eighth inning to protect a 5-3 lead, but 
gave up a two-run home run to the first batter he faced. His teammates rallied 
in the ninth inning, however, and Silva retired the Koreans in order in their 
final at-bat to pick up his second win of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. was eliminated a game later when it fell to eventual champion Cuba, 
15-2, in the sudden-death quarterfinals to conclude its long summer with a 
24-13 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just haven't been all in it this summer," said Silva, who struck out 14 
batters in 13 innings with Team USA but finished with a 5.54 ERA. "I'm not 
bearing down as much. I don't think my mind's been here all the way either." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva is looking forward to returning home. In the past four months, he's 
spent a total of 2 1/2 days there, so he has a lot of catching up to do with 
his parents. And one of the things they're sure to talk about is Silva's 
experience in Nicaragua, the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real different here," said Silva, who celebrated his 20th birthday in 
Central America. "It just makes you respect what you have more. Everybody says, 
you know, that we take that for granted. But then you come out here and it's 
just a whole different atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't met one mean person or one negative person. Everyone tries to talk 
to you, you know, communicate with you anyway they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just trying to communicate with them and get a few laughs here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 The poverty he saw apparently weighed on Silva the way his suitcase did when 
he landed here more than two weeks ago. Because of that, his luggage -- and his 
conscience -- were both a little lighter on the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 After Team USA's final game, Silva gave away baseballs, sweatbands and 
whatever else he could legally take off in public before returning to the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it makes you feel good just to give a person a ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be another lesson Silva learned about traveling: Sometimes just 
packing the memories is enough.

SPORTS; SAN GABRIEL ADVANCES TO SEMIFINALS OF RUTH SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Gabriel entered the 16-year-old Babe Ruth World Series as one of two teams 
favored to win the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 And after only two games, the team has proven it's more than worthy of such 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, San Gabriel turned in its second consecutive convincing win with a 
5-0 victory over Indianola, Iowa. Winning pitcher Steve Rodriguez gave up only 
a sixth-inning single. Once again, San Gabriel (10-1) showcased an impressive 
array of stingy pitching and explosive hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Those talents will be tested in a championship semifinal game tonight when San 
Gabriel meets Marietta, Ga., in a matchup of unbeaten teams. Although 
Marietta's 74-6 season record is unofficial, it has outscored its two 
tournament opponents, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel, which has won 10 consecutive games, has produced 18 runs and 20 
hits in two tournament games. Brian Llibre, who is five for seven, has hit two 
home runs and driven in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel's pitching has also impressed the 29,121 fans who have turned out 
for 12 games. Eric Valenzuela and Rodriguez each earned complete-game 
victories, combining to give up only one run and six hits in 14 innings. They 
struck out 16 and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 The loser drops to the consolation bracket for a 5 p.m. game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel's powerful hitting and pitching made a strong impression on the 
fans at the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Victor Becerra says San Gabriel's showing paled in comparison to the 
hoopla of pre-tournament festivities, which left his team wide-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Becerra was pleased when San Gabriel scored 10 runs with two outs in the 
second inning and hit three home runs en route to a 13-1 win over Cincinnati in 
a first-round game Sunday. Brian Llibre, Juaquin Villalobos and Valenzuela 
homered. 
</P>
<P>
 But Becerra and his players were eager to talk about the gala surrounding the 
nine-team, double-elimination tournament. Each team was escorted by tournament 
princesses during a limousine ride from the Indianapolis Airport. The coaches 
and players were treated to an elegant banquet and a parade that included Indy 
500 floats and former Cincinnati Reds outfielder George Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's wasn't enough, the players will walk away with equipment bags full 
of corporate-donated goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been something else," Becerra said. "It's unbelievable what they've 
done for us. It's tremendous, and our kids really appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of outstanding pitching performances were turned in throughout the 
first round, but perhaps none was finer than that provided by Valenzuela in the 
13-1 win over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, a stocky right-hander, went the distance and gave up only five 
hits. He struck out five of the first six hitters, finished with eight 
strikeouts and didn't walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most impressive was that his fastball reached 87 miles per hour on 
radar guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a good-hitting team, but we don't feel too bad getting shut down by a 
pitcher with his kind of stuff," Cincinnati Coach Frank Nesi said. "Our kids 
just haven't seen a pitcher of his caliber. Our pitching machine doesn't even 
have his kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel's pitching suffered a blow three weeks ago when Ray Jimenez broke 
a finger. Jimenez, who no-hit Brawley and struck out 11 in a state tournament 
game, isn't part of San Gabriel's World Series roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts, especially if we fall into the losers' bracket," Becerra said. 
"That's when your pitching can really get depleted quickly. So that's another 
reason to stay out of the losers' bracket."

EARTHWATCH: LOCAL HOTELS INTRODUCE ECO-FRIENDLY ROOMS; NONSMOKING 
ACCOMMODATIONS AT TWO SITES ARE EQUIPPED WITH FILTERED AIR AND WATER AND 
BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This summer, as far as some hotel operators are concerned, their customer's 
health and the planet's health seem to have assumed equal importance. 
Earthwatch recently looked into this issue at Simi Valley's Clarion Hotel, 
where two hotel professionals have outfitted six rooms in an environmentally 
friendly way. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a form of consumer-supported environmentalism, which, according 
to a summer flurry of articles in the hotel industry's trade press, is part of 
a worldwide trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Schwalbenberg, general manager of the Clarion in Simi, and Ray Berger, 
vice president of Green Suites International, a Century City environmental 
services company, both happen to live in Moorpark. Friends of long standing, 
the two became part of this trend by collaborating early this year to outfit 
some "Deluxe Nonsmoking Guest Rooms" at the Clarion. They discovered 
immediately that travelers will pay an extra $10 to stay in them. 
</P>
<P>
 What's involved essentially is an upgrade of the already existing, much in 
demand, nonsmoking class of rooms -- but equipped with specially filtered air 
and water, biodegradable soaps and shampoos in dispensers rather than 
throw-away packaging, and environmentally friendly paper products. Housekeeping 
staff members use only special non-polluting cleansers and carpet cleaners in 
these rooms. In other words, the rooms are chock full of things Earthwatch has 
been touting for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a haven for the allergy-prone, asthmatic or environmentally 
sensitive traveler. According to the American Academy of Allergy and 
Immunology, there are almost 50 million such sufferers in the country. But it's 
also good for the rest of us, because, when a hotel takes care of them in this 
new way, there's a reduction of water pollution and trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Our visit was unscheduled, so we could only see a room where the most recent 
tenant had just left and the place had not been serviced. Nobody had been in to 
spruce things up. Nevertheless, the air was noticeably better and the tap water 
much softer than the last place I had been in -- my home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a pleasant experience and left no doubt why a dozen companies have 
sprung up worldwide in the last few years to offer services -- or versions of 
services -- similar to those Berger supplies to hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business travelers who have just stayed in the these rooms ask their 
companies to book them in one again next time," Schwalbenberg said. "Half the 
guests take away the free copy of the EcoTraveler Magazine Ray's company 
provides for the rooms and the list of environmentally friendly products we use 
they can order for home use." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey last month in the trade journal Hotel & Motel Management said that 
more than 40% of travelers consider themselves "environmental," and say they 
want accommodations which have "green" features of some sort. Folks, it seems, 
want environmental virtue and pleasure mixed together. 
</P>
<P>
 Some trade journals report that people don't want to pay extra for these 
features, but neither of the men from Moorpark reports having encountered price 
resistance. According to Berger -- whose company also has eco-friendly room 
installations in the Piccadilly Inn chain and other sites in California and 
Nevada -- people fill up the "Deluxe Nonsmoking Rooms" as fast as the hotels 
can set them up. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something to ponder here. If Schwalbenberg makes good on his plans to 
put in all natural fabrics -- sheets, towels, maybe even the carpets and drapes 
in the Simi Valley Clarion Hotel -- the result will be an environmental 
show-window folks can actually move into. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an old science fiction novel, "Ecotopia." The traveling protagonist 
finds this kind of accommodation, and at the end of the story he sends his boss 
a message: "I've decided I'm not coming back, but thanks for sending me on this 
assignment." Details

ON THE ROAD: HIKER WHO TAKES GAMBLE GETS 2 PAIRS OF SNAKE EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was, of course, little warning. The full-throttle buzz of the 
rattlesnake, primordial and resonant, commenced as I was nearly upon the rock 
pile. 
</P>
<P>
 I backed up, stood still. A dark brown curve of his 2-inch-thick body was 
visible behind the cream-colored rocks, but otherwise he was hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the rocks were situated on a narrow stretch of the Piedra Blanca Trail, 
an area just north of Rose Valley noted for its startling, white slopes of 
exposed rock. People come to look at the rock formations because they are, 
depending upon the play of light and shadow, figurative: here a giant elephant, 
there a 30-foot-high Indian face. Lunar surfaces, animated beauty and haunting 
quiet combine to lend the place a holiness. And there is no better way to move 
through it than to be a pilgrim on the Piedra Blanca Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been on it for hours, covering perhaps 5 miles, in the searing summer 
heat, sweating myself into a happy delirium of mild exhaustion. The buzzing 
from within the rock pile, coming at sundown in the last half hour of the hike, 
seemed so loud as to be amplified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I would have to get past him. This was the only trail home. Still a mile from 
my car, I needed the remaining light to descend the trail safely. 
</P>
<P>
 But passing him posed peculiar problems: The trail at this point was a narrow 
gulch, walled in on one side by 15 feet of solid rock and on the other by 
sharply ascending hardpack made impenetrable by chaparral. The trail was 
perhaps 6 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 If I hugged the left side, I would come within 5 feet of the rattler. Yet he 
was putting me on notice at a distance of 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 I once lived in Texas and there picked up a habit that would offend the Sierra 
Club. But I was running out of time here. So I gathered small stones and 
decided to "evict" the rattler from his rock house, hoping he'd be confused and 
seek cover off the trail, allowing me passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwunk -- I hit his fat side on the second lob. He didn't move. Then he shot 
within the rocks, rattling anew. In a moment, like an apparition, he came up 
through the top of the rocks, exposing an undulant 2 feet of his body, coming 
straight at me, tongue flicking away. 
</P>
<P>
 I ran backward, frozen, mumbling holy references. I had trouble comprehending 
the event in real time. Was he coming after me?  
</P>
<P>
 I had had success years before in making snakes scram by the eviction method. 
But I'd misread this circumstance: This snake was trapped. He wasn't on open 
ground. He was, literally, up against the wall. And I, haplessly seeking 
safety, was chucking stones at him, provoking him. 
</P>
<P>
 He retreated again into the rocks, this time without showing an inch of 
himself. No, I could not bring myself to walk by the rock pile. If I were him 
at this moment of escalated hostility, I'd strike at me. 
</P>
<P>
 With daylight running out, I committed to forging an alternate route. 
Retreating on the trail would only put me back in the Sespe wilderness, and I 
am not a survivalist. So I would bushwhack: climb up the rock ridge above the 
rattler's wall and -- with luck -- creep down the lee side through dense 
chaparral and rocks, finding the trail again within 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to the top was easy. Coming down involved punching through dense 
growth, jumping over a shallow chasm, and slowly stepping across a firm dirt 
slope. That's when my vision went neon, luminous, edged in odd light: A hole 
bored into the ground by a squirrel was serving as cool refuge for a second 
rattlesnake. He lay curled within, rattle end out, 3 feet from my right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In all the hiking I have done in state and national forests and parks, I have 
always looked out for wild things. As a result, I have always taken note of 
what signs and rangers say. And when rattlesnakes are concerned, the advice is 
lean, minimal, consistent: Avoid Them. 
</P>
<P>
 I did. Yet I found only more trouble -- even though I will admit fearing the 
bushwhack for this very reason. Still, the momentum of the descent and late-day 
lighting prevented my seeing Horror in the Hole until I was upon it. While my 
rock-throwing obviously found its specific failure circumstance, the Avoid Them 
dictum also proved inadequate, hollow, without guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 In sorting these events out, I sought to find out precisely what real snake 
people would have done in my shoes. I do not intend to stop hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Wilkinson leads the Rattlesnake Roundup annually in Sweetwater, Tex. That 
is, he personally catches more than 300 pounds of live rattlers in a given 
weekend. Those snakes are sold for meat and skins, but Wilkinson keeps a few 
for live demonstrations on safety. And he's never been bitten. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have just walked by the rock pile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" I asked. "While he was provoked and buzzing and only a few feet away?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a pit viper, Mr. Reed, and the two pits located on his face sense heat," 
said Wilkinson. "By the heat he picks up from you, he's got you sized up and 
decided you're much too big to eat. So let him buzz, and, as long as you can 
stay, oh, 4 feet away, just walk on by." 
</P>
<P>
 Just walk on by. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't chase people," he added. "They're defensive, not offensive. When 
he was coming up out of the rocks, he wasn't coming at you. He was looking for 
a way out. But you were there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson then revealed a painfully simple calculus, a formula confirmed by 
Harvey Fischer, reptile curator at the Los Angeles Zoo: A rattler's strike 
range equals half his body length. If an adult is 4 feet long, the farthest he 
can strike is 2 feet. Stay out of the strike range plus a couple feet, and 
you've got only your own nerves to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I reconnected with the Piedra Blanca Trail at 50 yards, reflexively leaping 
out of strike range of the undisturbed snake in the hole and double-timing it 
to the parking lot. I looked back to the white rocks in golden light, the 
strange, sacred place called Piedra Blanca, and felt gratitude that I'd emerged 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 I also felt determined to find out how it all went wrong. With all the boyhood 
rock-chucking and popular hysteria and uninformative park sloganeering, I could 
not have known that it would be so easy, so sane, so safe to just walk on by.

 Yes, you can strap your toddler into a stroller and hit the hiking trail in 
search of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 If strollers and trails sound incongruous, they aren't -- at least to the 
people at Nursery Nature Walks. They like to acquaint children with nature as 
early as possible, even in infancy.

 The Santa Monica-based nonprofit group started leading walks in 1985 with 
volunteers who had scoped out five stroller-accessible trails in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they have about 50 trails in their repertoire of gentle walks. A few years 
ago, they began branching into Ventura County, and now about one-third of the 
outings are within the county or close to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep adding trails," said Judy Burns, the group's executive director. The 
list has grown to include places like McGrath State Beach in Oxnard, Arroyo 
Verde Park in Ventura, La Jolla Canyon and Big Sycamore Canyon along the coast 
and Rancho Sierra Vista park in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers lead about 40 walks a month in the two counties. Families call 
weeks ahead to reserve a spot in the groups, which are limited to 10 families. 
They are asked to make a $5 donation. 
</P>
<P>
 It might sound illogical to expect a toddler to get much out of a nature walk, 
but that's not Burns' feeling. The younger the better, in her view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walks are sensory-based, with lots of smelling, touching, looking," she 
said. "It stimulates curiosity. They also learn respect for the outdoors. They 
learn not to grab a leaf, but to touch it gently." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a typical outing by Nursery Nature Walks last week that drew five 
mothers and their young children to Big Sycamore Canyon, just south of Point 
Mugu. Their eight children -- from 6 months to 4 years old -- were in 
strollers, jogger-style buggies, backpacks, front packs and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Their leader was Suzanne Egeln, who brought along her own two daughters, a 
9-month-old infant and a 4-year-old, as well as her husband. Egeln had attended 
the group's workshops to learn more about plants, animals, geology, Native 
Americans -- and how to make it all fascinating to kids. 
</P>
<P>
 That's accomplished not just by taking a hike, but by mixing in songs, 
stories, snack breaks, water breaks and frequent stops to examine such stuff as 
leaves, lizards and spider webs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the volunteers have dreamed up so many things to do with kids 
involving nature that they published a book, "Trails, Tails & Tidepools in 
Pails," ($9.95) that includes more than 100 activities. They range from finding 
a pill bug and returning him to his home, to more involved fun like making soap 
the way the Native Americans did by spraying water on a ceanothus blossom and 
rubbing it. 
</P>
<P>
 So activity-oriented are these walks that it's a stretch to call them hikes. 
They are more like strolls -- a quarter of a mile to half a mile, which takes 
about two hours with all the stops. 
</P>
<P>
 As Egeln's group started out on the dirt road into the canyon, she listed the 
usual precautions for the children: Don't throw rocks and sticks, stay on the 
trail and don't put fingers into little holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk turned out to be nature bonanza. A covey a quail skittered across the 
trail, and Egeln used the opportunity to teach them the bird's chirp, which 
sounds a lot like "Chicago." A cottontail rabbit scampered into the brush, 
along with a lizard. 
</P>
<P>
 At a sycamore tree, Egeln took one of its giant leaves and brushed the 
children's faces. "Feel how soft that is," she told a 2-year-old boy. Then she 
led them in a song about how the tree's leaves, branches, roots and bark 
resemble hands, arms, legs and skin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shade of a dry stream bed crossing, the group stopped for snacks -- 
fruit, crackers, juice. Mothers fed babies. Egeln took out her ladybug puppet 
and read the story "The Very Hungry Caterpillar." As the caterpillar turned 
into a butterfly at the end of the book, as if on cue, a yellow-winged 
butterfly flickered through the group. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the children, it was their first real nature outing. "I wanted to 
come here and get an idea about what's involved if I do it on my own," said 
Karen Roberts of Camarillo, who pushed 8-month-old Joey in a stroller while 
2-year-old Sarah rode in a backpack or walked. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kathy Dezavala of Fillmore, also a mother of two, it was a break from the 
stay-at-home routine. "I needed to get out of the house," she said. "I love to 
hike. I hiked before they were born." 
</P>
<P>
 The way back was also filled with new sights, sights that a striding hiker or 
biker might have missed. There was the swarm of bees in Winnie the Pooh's tree, 
as Egeln put it, hummingbirds, and bark to examine. And along the way, the 
children's hands had been stamped with ladybugs and bear prints. Details 
</P>

SHOP TALK; STOCK UP FOR SCHOOL WITH PRACTICAL SUPPLIES; A VARIETY OF RETAILERS 
OFFER FOLDERS, BINDERS, LINED PAPER AND LUNCH BOXES IN STYLES FROM PLAIN TO 
FANCY IN A RANGE OF PRICES.

 In our last column we began buying stuff for the new school year. And we admit 
we have gotten a little frivolous. We suppose we didn't have to check out those 
Nike Air shoes. Or the leather-trimmed backpacks -- there's nothing wrong with 
all-nylon. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard to control ourselves, especially when we walked into Ventura 
County malls and found ourselves in the middle of a sale explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, in this column we will be much more practical. Last week we went 
hunting for some serious school supplies for students of all ages. Anyone who 
has parented a student, or been a student, knows where to find these supplies. 
They're at discount stores, drugstores, toy stores, even grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 We chose some of our favorite spots to see what they had to sell. We visited 
Walmart in Oxnard, Pic 'N' Save in Camarillo, Vons in Ojai, and Thrifty at the 
Buenaventura shopping center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's begin with binders and folders. It gets pretty high-tech in the binder 
and folder world. There are multi-pocketed, multipurpose, multicolored 
"organizers" of various sizes and designs. The price is more digestible, the 
simpler you're willing to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-ring binders from K&M (a division of Avery) were in great supply. The 
basic model is very simple -- no frills, no fancy covers, just a binder. They 
come in different sizes, based on ring size. We'll focus on the one-inch and 
two-inch widths. 
</P>
<P>
 At Walmart the one-inch was $2.48, the two-inch was $3.94. At Thrifty they 
were $2.49 (one-inch) and $3.99 (two-inch). At Pic 'N' Save they were $1.49 
(one-inch) and $2.49 (two-inch). At Pic 'N' Save the supplies tend to come and 
go rather quickly, but there were quite a few binders available the day we were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to binders and folders, the Mead company has a good handle on 
the market. (Actually, when it comes to basic school supplies, Mead is pretty 
active. Vons even had a Mead display.) 
</P>
<P>
 At Thrifty we found a very attractive Mead/Nike "Spiral Notefolio" for $12.99. 
It comes with a wire-bound notebook, 100 sheets of lined paper, a zippered 
pouch in the front, a pen holder in the back, and a Velcro fastener for the 
whole thing. If you're looking to be "cool" or "rad" or whatever (we're hardly 
up on the latest schoolyard lingo) this seems like a pretty nice way to go. At 
Vons we found the multi-folder, multipurpose, popular Trapper Keeper for $8.69. 
Thrifty had the same product for $9.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the wild binders, it was a pleasure to discover an old Pee-Chee, 
single pocket folder still around. You remember the Pee-Chee? It has that sort 
of Manila envelope color, decorated with sketchy drawings of athletes? They 
were selling for 69 cents at Thrifty. A color version was 79 cents. Walmart had 
a Mead one-subject folder for 20 cents. Vons and Pic 'N' Save had the same 
folder for 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on to other random essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Lined paper: There's college-ruled and wide-ruled, primarily. We went with 
wide. A pack of 250 10 1/2-by-8-inch paper from Mead was $3.19 at Thrifty. The 
Stuart Hall brand there was 200 sheets of 11-by-8 1/2 inches for $2.49. Walmart 
had packs of 200 10 1/2-by-8-inch Mead paper for 63 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch boxes/containers: Walmart had the Thermos brand Snak Kit, consisting of 
little washable containers and an insulated bottle, for $7.97. Pic 'N' Save was 
selling a small "Lunch Plus" sectioned container, the size and shape of a 
Styrofoam box from a fast-food restaurant, for 99 cents. The store also had an 
old-fashioned Thermos brand lunch box for $3.99 and an Up & Adam brand box, 
with no drink container, for $1.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Crayons: A box of 64 Crayolas was $1.88 at Walmart and $4.19 at Thrifty. Pic 
'N' Save had a set of three boxes of 8 crayons, distributed by West Coast 
Liquidators, for 59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Protractors: Pic 'N' Save was selling a six-inch Pedigree brand protractor for 
29 cents. A six-inch Helix brand protractor was 37 cents at Walmart and $1.49 
at Thrifty. Thrifty also had a Creative Works brand "Shapes and Forms" 
combination protractor, French curve, ruler, and template for $2.49. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't school seem simpler in the olden days?

FASHION; IT'LL BE BABY DOLLS FOR GALS, SARCASM FOR GUYS THIS FALL; THE FEMININE 
LOOK WILL ALSO ENCOMPASS THE RETRO NEWSBOY WHILE MALES SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON 
TRENDY T-SHIRTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Guys forward, girls back. The fall dance of fashion calls it out: male 
back-to-school styles are mod; feminine outfits, retro. 
</P>
<P>
 We fashion analysts can explain all of this in terms of social relativism and 
androgyny backlash -- but, why labor with ideological theory? Just go out and 
get the look.  
</P>
<P>
 For teen-agers and young women, you will need: the baby doll, the newsboy or 
the parochial schoolgirl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds unlikely? That's the point -- it gets you off guard. Just when you 
think pleated plaid skirts are as cold as Lurex jumpsuits, they come back for 
the knockout. (Watch out for Lurex in the spring.) 
</P>
<P>
 The plaids are short, boxy and have a keen Highland mood about them. They are 
combined with plaid tams, plaid vests, occasionally plaid tights (sorry), and 
often, solid color "baby Ts." 
</P>
<P>
 These are tiny shirts with skimpy, fluted sleeves that come in lengths too 
short to tuck in. To avoid dress code citations, keep your arms down. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirts team with short, sheer jumpers to complete the baby-doll style, or 
with what one teen-ager called "office skirts" -- long, straight '50s type 
skirts given relevance with a slit extending to the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Skirts, in general, are poised for a comeback after a couple of decades of 
being mostly invisible on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they don't figure in the most prominent look in local shops -- the 
newsboy. It's a nostalgic remake of young men's fashions of the '20s. Pin 
stripes, checks, cuffs on trousers, argyle socks -- all in black and white and 
gray, sometimes with white shirt and tie, the whole set off by a pair of black 
elastic suspenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the suspenders, forget it. You may as well wear bell-bottoms minus 
platforms, or skip the rhinestone trim on your Lurex. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble is topped with an oversized newsboy cap, a style so appealing it 
is revived every dozen years or so. In one incarnation it was called the bee 
bop, but it's now the Rasta .  
</P>
<P>
 As virile as these clothes look, none of them is approved wear for guys. Nor, 
happily, has male fashion needed to resort to similar cross dressing. Instead, 
guys are into what they've been into all along: sports and wisecracks. 
</P>
<P>
 These concerns are addressed as usual by designers' fusing smart remarks to 
active wear, and there's no shortage of choices. But one label in particular 
kept coming to our attention. Merchants from Bullock's to JC Penney, plus 
several teen-agers in the know, responded to "What's the hottest trend for 
guys?" with the mantra: "No Fear." 
</P>
<P>
 This upstart company has used the same elements for fall as other 
manufacturers: soft, washed-out colors, trims of plaid, corduroy or denim on 
cotton, and contrasting hood fabrics on sweat shirts. They have abetted what 
might be called the revenge of the horizontal stripe. But, it's the slogans 
that sell the line. They produce T-shirt credos that seem to have captured a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shut up and jump!" is a classic. It has been joined by such sentiments as, 
"Quit your snivelin' and get a life!"; "You don't need luck if you're good" and 
"If you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much space." 
</P>
<P>
 No Fear releases about a dozen new slogans each month, said its art director, 
Don Widmer, who handles its T-shirt operation. This creative frenzy is in part 
possible because everyone in the company, including receivers and truck 
drivers, thinks up remarks to put on shirts. The final messages are chosen for 
inspirational quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make a statement for everybody who's not getting out there," Widmer 
said. "You know, there's more to life than what you see on TV. Go out and 
participate is what we're saying. You've got to go out and do something. But 
don't be afraid to do it just because you've never done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 This is all well and good, but a central problem remains in the garment 
industry. Obviously, no one is developing motivational clothing for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome this, we considered offering a slogan to be added to the plaid 
mini-kilts: "Shut up and eat your oatmeal!" And, as a Jazz Age motto for the 
suspenders, "Me quit? Banana oil!" 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, these phrases seemed less relevant than those for the boys. The thing 
is, women aren't into daring each other to do things -- they're more concerned 
with expressing their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 So, designers need to concentrate on finding messages that promote emotional 
sharing, while celebrating a particular era. The suspenders might instead urge: 
"Verbalize -- it's swell!" or, "Tell it like it is, but speak easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiment could mean a smash hit for the industry; all they have do is 
learn to address our basic natures through clothing.

 Tom Marshall, general manager of Wheeler Hot Springs spa and restaurant in 
Ojai, Wednesday officially became the new owner of another Ojai establishment, 
Nora's Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, changes tend to go hand-in-hand with new ownership. Although 
Marshall said the cooking staff will remain the same, it now will be overseen 
by Wheeler chef Gael Leocolley. And there will be some corresponding changes in 
the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have bistro food with an Italian flavor. We'll certainly keep 
the pizzas. We'll expand the salads, we'll expand the pastas, we'll expand the 
entrees," Marshall said. "We'll even throw in some things that are not Italian, 
like a good (Spanish) paella. We'll have some seafood." 
</P>
<P>
 Nora's hours have been expanded to 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. (it used to be open 
until 10 p.m.) seven days a week. That's something of a gamble, Marshall 
realizes, for the usually quiet late-night streets of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go for a walk down the main street at night, it's beautiful, but it's 
sort of depressing. You can't have a cappuccino or dessert in too many places," 
Marshall said. "We'll have to see what this will do to the habits of the town. 
The habits have all been skewed toward earlier hours." Nora's is at 423 E. Ojai 
Ave. 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura County Fair has some more amateur baking contests coming up, so if 
you've been bragging about your culinary skills, now's the time to show what 
you've got. Entries will be taken from 7 to 10 a.m. Friday for various biscuits 
/ roll, bread, cake and muffin categories. Call 648-3376 for specifics.

 Wednesday marked the official opening of the Empowerment Place, a "learning 
center" in Ventura that offers personal growth and classes in a variety of 
areas, including movement therapy, dream interpretation, Shiatsu release 
therapy and food preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those upcoming food courses, taught over four Tuesdays beginning Sept. 
6, is the hands-on "Delicious Macrobiotic Cooking." Local chiropractor Douglas 
Gainor will discuss the philosophy of balance and order between humans and the 
environment and how it relates to what we eat. The course will be taught at 
City Bakery. Cost is $125. If you sign up two weeks in advance, you receive 
free enrollment in a one-day "Movement Therapy" class. Call 648-7004.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE GREEK PUTS EMPHASIS ON CLASSICS; UNLIKE MANY COASTAL 
EATERIES, THIS NEW ARRIVAL TO VENTURA HARBOR OFFERS EXCELLENT CUISINE TO GO 
WITH THE OCEAN VIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID B. GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eating at restaurants on the edges of local harbors and marinas, with their 
vistas of sparkling blue waters, white sails and happy tourists, is usually a 
delight for the eyes -- but generally a disappointment to the palate. (Tucks 
Point in Ventura is one happy exception.) 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with a sense of pleasure, excitement and a bit of bewilderment that I 
bring news of good food at Ventura Harbor. It can be found at The Greek. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasure comes, simply, from finding good food. The excitement comes from 
having it in a seaside atmosphere. The bewilderment comes from the restaurant 
itself, which, with the exception of the outside terrace, is nondescript, 
almost uninviting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a conglomeration of sound equipment (used for lively evenings of Zorba 
dancing, Greek wine and belly dancing), scattered paperwork and some sort of 
attempt at decoration. All of which can be ignored from a seat on the terrace, 
with plates of Mediterranean cuisine on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 You may eat lightly here, or heartily. Light would be a tasty, authentic 
sampler plate of hot and cold Greek appetizers ($11.95 for two, lunch). 
Tzatziki , the classical dip of yogurt and cucumber, is spiced with lots of 
dill, a good mixture for scooping with pieces of hot pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to that is a portion of taramasalta , another classic, a blend of small 
amounts of red caviar with a creamy mixture of bread, oil, garlic and other 
seasonings. It's a rich dish, but not overly salty. 
</P>
<P>
 There's melitzanosalata , also blended, a melange of baked eggplant with lots 
of garlic, oil and seasonings. The plate also holds hummus -- a smooth paste of 
garbanzos, sesame seeds, garlic, oil, lemon and spices -- and an outstanding, 
home-style tabouli. 
</P>
<P>
 The tabouli is especially finely chopped for a restaurant, with its mixture of 
fresh tomatoes, green onions and parsley, with cracked bulgur. The particular 
virtue of tabouli prepared at The Greek -- with strong flavors of olive oil, 
lemon and mint -- is that the bulgur does not overwhelm the vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 On the list of warm appetizers, you may have an argument as to whether the 
keftedes -- hot, spicy meatballs, crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, 
with plenty of dill, basil and garlic -- are better than the excellent dolmades 
-- grape leaves stuffed with meat and herbed rice. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also get a sampling of spanakopita -- phyllo triangles stuffed with 
spinach and a blend of cheeses -- and falafel, patties of ground garbanzos and 
spices. Not on the sampler plate, but worth ordering separately, are 
lahanodolmades ($3.25 lunch) -- similar to the dolmades, but wrapped in cabbage 
leaves and served in a tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid the calamari ($5.95 dinner), which are marinated, and tender, but 
completely boring in their breaded form, even with a sauce on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going on to several outstanding main dishes, don't pass by one of the 
best Greek salads ($7.50 dinner) on the California coast. It's not that the 
lettuce, tomatoes, onions, feta and Greek olives are that special. It's the 
dressing -- a vinegar and oil base with flavors and texture that meld 
beautifully, perhaps because of the addition of lemon juice and a touch of 
anchovy paste. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of entrees that you might expect would be good can easily be ignored: 
The grilled swordfish oreganato ($17.95 dinner) tends to be dry, and the Greek 
classic and comfort food, moussaka, an eggplant and meat casserole, is devoid 
of character. 
</P>
<P>
 But The Greek boasts a couple of lamb dishes, and a chicken plate that, in 
California at least, would be difficult to improve on. 
</P>
<P>
 The roasted lamb ($12.95 dinner) bakes slowly in the oven, for at least three 
hours. By the time it comes out, it's so tender it's falling apart, in 
delicious flakes, fork tender. The carrots on the side are succulent and the 
potatoes, roasted in meat juices and seasonings, are firm, just a little bit 
chewy -- very, very good. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the star of this menu is the lamb exohiko ($18.95 dinner). It's also a 
dish of very tender lamb, but this one is stuffed with feta and spinach and 
then wrapped in phyllo so the flavors roast together. 
</P>
<P>
 Roasted chicken is a pretty simple dish. But this one, chicken a la plaka 
($11.95 dinner), is specially delectable. The half chicken is rolled in a 
breading of herbs, in which garlic, rosemary, basil and possibly some Greek 
oregano, stand out. The chicken is then baked, the skin cooked to a thin, crisp 
crust, the juices of the bird fighting to get through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek is not new to Ventura County. For several years it was operated by 
Lynn and Makis Mikelatos in Oxnard, at a location, they say, that was hard for 
customers to find. They then took in a partner, Jerome Dabour -- who is largely 
responsible for the restaurant's Greek dances -- and moved into the Marina, to 
the space once occupied by Bedford's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 They brought the chef, Nikos Xidarakos, with them, and the menu is a 
combination of the input and ideas of all four, with Xidarakos leading the way.

CONVICTED MOLESTER FREED ON PAROLE; CRIME: KYLE HOCHSTRASER REPORTS TO OFFICER 
IN PALMDALE. VICTIM SAYS SHE IS 'SENTENCED TO LIFETIME OF NIGHTMARES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Kyle Hochstraser, known as Richard Streate when he entered the state prison in 
Tehachapi a year and a half ago, was released Wednesday and immediately 
reported to his parole officer in Palmdale, the same Antelope Valley city where 
he molested his goddaughter in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Desiray Bartak, the 14-year-old victim, said in Los Angeles that it 
doesn't matter what name he uses; she said she knows him as the predator who 
abused her trust to steal her innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to prison, but he's the one who got off easy, she said during a news 
conference at her lawyer's Wilshire Boulevard office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Streate has served his time, but I am sentenced to a lifetime of 
nightmares he caused me when he murdered my childhood," Desiray said. In the 
nightmares, he appears in a blond wig and red lipstick, and she is always 
running from him, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 She told reporters she wants the world to know how he crept into her bed when 
she was 10, making her "perform sexual acts that only a husband and wife would 
do." If the world knows her story, she said, maybe he won't be able to molest 
another child. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she said, the criminal justice system let her down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very angry at the justice system, that they let him out," she said. "I'm 
mad at the judge for not giving him the maximum sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hochstraser's release didn't trigger any massive outcry in the 
Antelope Valley on Wednesday, some attorneys and public officials seized the 
opportunity to call for laws toughening sentences for child molesters, and 
making them ineligible for early release. 
</P>
<P>
 "For child molesters, there should be no such thing as a mechanism for early 
release," said Palmdale Councilman Terence Judge, who works as a sheriff's 
deputy. "They should be required to serve each and every day of their sentence 
as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Desiray, called for laws preventing sex 
offenders from changing their names, as Streate/Hochstraser did. And she urged 
stiffer sentences for convicted child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obscene that often criminals will serve a longer term in prison for 
writing a bad check than they will for molesting a child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he was charged in June, 1992, Hochstraser could have faced three 
molestation counts involving Desiray and another child. He was charged with 
two, one of which was dismissed when he pleaded guilty to a single count of 
performing a lewd act on a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Desiray, her mother, Wayanne Kruger, and attorney Allred pleaded with 
Lancaster Superior Court Judge Haig Kehiayan to impose the maximum eight-year 
sentence, he sentenced the defendant in 1993 to the minimum, three-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison work and good-behavior credits further reduced his sentence by half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Desiray, in her own way, struck back. In January she won a $2-million 
verdict in an unprecedented lawsuit against her molester. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is now common for victims of sexual abuse to sue their abusers, 
Desiray's case was believed to be the first where a child victim sued and 
prevailed. So far, the case hasn't brought her a dime, but it has earned her 
national recognition as a symbol for children's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray seemed so much older than other teen-agers as she spoke at the news 
conference in Allred's office. She was poised, deliberate and gravely serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to grow up," she said. "I had to become an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray and her mother have moved to Northern California, and have obtained a 
restraining order to keep Hochstraser from coming within 35 miles of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 30-year-old Hochstraser, who has claimed he too was sexually abused as 
a child, seems more interested in resuming his life in Palmdale. He has found a 
job, moved in with a relative "in a remote location," and will be closely 
monitored, state parole officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving him the most intensive supervision that we provide," said Jerry 
Di Maggio, a regional parole administrator. "His parole officer will check with 
him more than twice a month at his residence or place of employment. He'll be 
checking to find out how he's doing and where he's living." 
</P>
<P>
 He has two weeks to register as a sex offender at the Antelope Valley 
Sheriff's Station. Neighbors with children will be notified about his record. 
And, he will not be living with his wife and his own children because the terms 
of his parole forbid contact with minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Maggio also said Hochstraser will be required to attend an outpatient 
clinic for parolees, meeting weekly with a psychiatrist. He will be barred from 
places where minors congregate. "If we catch him around a school, he will go to 
jail," Di Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, just knowing Hochstraser was free was enough to jangle Desiray's 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared," she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard for me to get to sleep last night, knowing he's getting out 
today. I felt as though I had my life back. Now, I'm back in the same 
predicament I was in two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 She was first molested during the July 4 weekend in 1990, when she was staying 
with her godfather for the weekend. A little more than a year later, in August, 
1991, it happened again. She says she bottled up her secret for a while, but 
she couldn't escape it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into a depression," she said. "I dressed in black all the time and I 
cut off all my hair, so I wouldn't be attractive. I ate until 2 a.m. I had 
horrific nightmares and thoughts of suicide. I was institutionalized and that's 
when I got help. I'd blocked it in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Filing charges wasn't easy. "When I went public, I lost half my relatives." 
She now is estranged from her father, a life-long friend of Hochstraser, and an 
aunt and uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's time, she says, for the criminal justice system and society to 
discard old-fashioned ideas and denial about child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the '50s and '60s nobody believed it was going on, but it was. This 
is the '90s. It's time for people to wake up."

CITY WORKERS RESCUE COUPLE FROM GANG ATTACK; HEROISM: SANITATION MEN INTERVENE 
IN ASSAULT ON HOMELESS PAIR. AT LEAST THREE INJURED IN CONFRONTATION WITH ARMED 
YOUTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alfredo Diego, Jesus Reynoso and several other city sanitation workers weren't 
trying to be heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles police said Wednesday the men probably saved three people's 
lives -- including Diego's. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for a ride home from work on Tuesday, Diego saw some suspected 
gang members attacking a homeless couple and decided to intervene. When more 
than 20 gang members turned on Diego, some armed with knives and ice picks, his 
friend Reynoso and other co-workers rushed to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three workers were injured, one seriously, in the ensuing fracas and 
the homeless couple suffered minor injuries. Police say they aren't sure how 
many workers stepped in, but they all risked their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "These city employees came out, and good citizens that they are, tried to 
intervene and nearly got murdered," said Detective Gil Uribe. "If (the gang 
members had) continued beating those two people, they could have killed one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, Diego and Reynoso said they wouldn't hesitate to go to 
someone's aid again. "They were going to stab Diego, so I went to help," said 
Reynoso, who was knifed in his side. "I didn't even know I was stabbed because 
I was fighting. He is my friend, and I wanted to protect him." 
</P>
<P>
 During the fight, the alleged gang members threw a barrage of bricks, rocks 
and bottles at the city workers, police said. One worker remained in serious 
condition Wednesday after his head was nearly caved in by a flying brick as he 
came to the fight scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynoso, 47, was hospitalized overnight. On Wednesday, he recuperated at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diego, 35, who was treated for minor scrapes and bruises, was back at work as 
if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all were scared," Diego said, recounting the fight. "We weren't ready for 
this. Everything happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the attackers were especially dangerous on Tuesday because 
informants have told them they were smoking cigarettes laced with cocaine and 
PCP. If police are correct in their beliefs about who the attackers were, the 
group also is suspected in a series of brutal attacks and street robberies in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're proud of that; that's their business," said Uribe, a homicide 
detective who specializes in anti-gang efforts. "All they do is rob, steal and 
sell dope." 
</P>
<P>
 Police began to piece together a full account of the incident on Wednesday 
through interviews with the city workers. One of Uribe's stops was the hospital 
where Glen Atkinson -- the worker struck in the head with a brick -- had 
regained consciousness Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson's condition stabilized, Uribe said, after doctors removed skull 
fragments that had lodged in his brain. His location was not disclosed to 
shield him from possible retribution by the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers told police that Diego's shift had ended at 3 p.m. Tuesday and he 
was waiting for his wife to pick him up outside the sanitation yard, on 
Chandler Boulevard just east of Vineland Avenue. He saw the group of teen-agers 
punching and kicking the homeless couple, yelled at them to stop, then tried to 
distract the gang members so that the bloodied couple could run away. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, witnesses said, the attackers turned their attention to Diego. It was 
then that Reynoso stepped between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing he knew, he had three or four of them jumping him, beating him 
and stabbing him," Uribe said. "Diego thinks (Reynoso) saved his life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, witnesses said many of the alleged gang members had drawn 
their weapons, while others were throwing rocks and debris. As more city 
employees moved in to help, the entire group of combatants moved into the city 
yard, where some employees sought tools that could be used as weapons. "We had 
a little fight here inside the yard," said Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, who arrived in mid-brawl to pick him up, drove away after a gang 
member broke her windshield. The gang fled when the LAPD was called, witnesses 
told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects and say they have few descriptions to work with 
because the battle and the attackers' flight occurred so quickly.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; CHILDREN GET A KICK OUT OF ANTI-GANG DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The power of world super-lightweight kick boxing champion Peter (Sugarfoot) 
Cunningham's blows resonated through the Boys & Girls Club hall, as he struck 
at pads held up by Lilly Rodriguez, the women's featherweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a two-day anti-gang event conducted by the Valley Unity Peace 
Treaty, Cunningham, Rodriguez and other kick boxers from the Jet Center Gym in 
Van Nuys appeared on Wednesday to demonstrate basic professional kick boxing 
techniques and to deliver a message of hope to neighborhood children. The 
Valley Unity group is a coalition of gangs that called a truce to all 
intra-gang disputes in the Valley. Since it began nine months and 17 days ago, 
there hasn't been a single gang-related homicide in the Valley, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to tell you that you can be somebody," announced former 
middleweight champ William (Blinky) Rodriguez, master of ceremonies to the 
program and Lilly's husband. "Follow your dream, and it's going to come true." 
</P>
<P>
 While Blinky Rodriguez demonstrated techniques to the elementary school-age 
children, the kick boxers engaged in a series of warm-up drills and mock 
matches that were met with loud shouts and applause from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is discipline," Blinky Rodriguez said. "The kids I teach have to show 
discipline inside the ring and outside. If they get in trouble at school or if 
their grades aren't up to par, they're out of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 As active members of the Valley Unity Peace Treaty, owners and members of the 
Jet Center Gym teach former Valley gang members the art of kick boxing as a way 
to release aggression and acquire discipline, respect and humility in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys in my class that were once at war with each other are now helping one 
another stretch out," Blinky Rodriguez said. "What we want to do here is make 
our program known to the community so that maybe local groups or the city can 
help us do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Blinky Rodriguez has a personal interest in seeing gang peace in the Valley. 
He explained events that led to the loss of his 16-year-old son 4 1/2 years 
ago. His son was shot to death by three gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I were not unique in that situation," he said. "The only thing 
that made us unique was the power of God that allowed us to forgive the three 
guys who killed my son. The lack of forgiving only breeds hate, and that will 
lead to destructive violence. Through that forgiveness, we broke the back of 
hatred." ANTONIO OLIVO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : MEMORIAL PARK TO SPONSOR FOOD DRIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 To commemorate the dead and to celebrate life, Mt. Sinai Memorial Park has 
asked the more than 2,000 people expected to attend a service in September to 
bring packages of food that will be distributed to the hungry and homeless of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Sunday between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, the memorial park has 
sponsored for the last 40 years Kever Avot, a musical memorial service with 
rabbis representing each denomination. Traditionally, Jewish people visit the 
grave sites of their loved ones between those holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time this year, on Sept. 11 at 10 a.m., food items will be 
collected to be given to agencies such as Sova (the Hebrew word for eat and be 
satisfied), a Jewish Community Centers program; Encino B'nai B'rith; the First 
AME church, the Salvation Army and the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council 
food pantry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really here for the living," said Memorial Park director of sales and 
marketing, Fred Ellsberg.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to carry on the traditions of the living and generational 
continuity." MAKI BECKER

 A bold daylight burglary netted more than $150,000 in cash and jewelry when 
robbers broke into the home of a self-employed businessman, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary in the 11100 block of Orion Avenue in Mission Hills took place 
Monday during the workday, said Lt. Joseph Garcia of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said investigators found signs of forced entry at the home, where 
burglars took gold bracelets and rings, some diamond-studded, Garcia said. The 
jewelry's value was estimated at $135,000, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves ransacked the home and also took about $20,000 in cash, described 
by Garcia as the weekend receipts of the man's business. CHIP JOHNSON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; CUSHION SALES TO SOFTEN SCHOOLS' BUDGET 
PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Terry of Woodland Hills believes he has discovered a way to cushion 
the blows of school budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from his experience as an advertising specialist, the 45-year-old 
father of three, who also ministers at the Valley Circle Church of Christ in 
Woodland Hills, has founded a nonprofit program called Save Our Schools as a 
vehicle to donate thousands of bleacher cushions to area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The cushions, emblazoned with each school's name and logo on one side and 
local advertisements on the other, are sold by booster clubs to generate funds 
for school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you turn around, the budget is being cut," Terry said. "The 
programs I enjoyed when I was in high school are just not there for students 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry launched Save Our Schools last year, donating 1,000 cushions to each of 
three Ventura County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Safe, who works in the athletic department at Thousand Oaks High 
School, which received 1,000 cushions from Save Our Schools, said the school 
raised about $2,000 selling the cushions to students and parents last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, she expects sales to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have experience, it will be more successful," Safe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe said the cushions arrived too late in the year for football season, and 
about 675 were left over at the end of the year. The cheerleaders sold all of 
them at graduation for $1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our Schools will donate 1,000 cushions to each of 13 schools this year, 
including Calabasas, Agoura, Chatsworth, El Camino Real, Canoga Park and Taft 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry said the project needs the cooperation of parents, community members and 
local businesses. Terry is encouraging the businesses that advertise on the 
cushions to display stickers in their windows to show their support for the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising fees pay for the cost of the cushions as well as the printing, 
Terry said. About 50 cents per cushion is reinvested in the program to cover 
handling and processing fees. SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COMIC IN PLEA DEAL AGREES TO DO AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stand-up comedian Bobcat Goldthwait has agreed to tape a public service 
announcement and pay restitution in exchange for misdemeanor charges to be 
dropped against him for unlawfully setting his chair afire on "The Tonight Show 
With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement, worked out between the New York-born entertainer and the 
Burbank city attorney's office, has not yet been finalized and is still subject 
to approval by a judge or commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very lucky he offered to do the public service announcement rather than 
simply paying a fine because the announcement serves a greater public good," 
Deputy City Atty. Robert W. Walters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait had pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanors after using lighter 
fluid and a long-handled lighter to set his chair on fire during a May 6 taping 
of the show. Leno and another guest, Lauren Hutton, quickly doused the fire 
with cups of water. The incident aired that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank fire officials worried that Leno, Hutton and the studio audience might 
have been seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-second public service announcement Goldthwait offered to appear in will 
be used to promote the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation in Canoga Park, a 
nonprofit group that provides fire education to the public and assistance to 
burn survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Ann Ruch, an 8-year-old San Fernando Valley girl, died in 1969 when she 
was seriously burned after squirting lighter fluid onto hot coals in a 
back-yard barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Fire Department has already written a script for Goldthwait to 
read during the brief taping, said Tim Anctil, one of the comedian's managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait has also agreed to reimburse NBC for the scorched chair, the 
Burbank Fire Department for its time in the investigation and pay court costs, 
Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of one of the misdemeanor charges, Goldthwait would have faced a 
maximum of one year in jail, up to a $1,000 fine, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait could not be reached for comment Wednesday. His next court date is 
scheduled for Sept. 1, when a pretrial hearing will be held. VIVIEN CHEN

 Harry Pantelas is willing to swim laps all day long if it will help the Pierce

 And the 57-year-old West Lake Village resident plans to do just that Aug. 28 
when the Friends of Pierce Pool holds a fund-raiser to upgrade the Pierce 
College facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantelas is part of a group devoted to keeping the pool open and in good 
repair during a time of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a great deal to me and a lot of people," said Pantelas, an amateur 
triathlete who has been using the pool since it opened in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends formed more than a year ago to reopen the dilapidated pool after 
Pierce College closed it in November, 1992, because of fiscal restraints, 
Pantelas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group raised about $10,000 through a fund-raiser, he said, and the pool 
was reopened in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked with the school administration," Pantelas said. "And we showed them 
that there was a lot of support outside the school to keep the pool open." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event will raise money to improve the filtering system and to 
install hot water heaters for the showers in the men's and women's locker 
rooms. Also in the works are plans to build an awning over the pool area for 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has no money to improve the facility, said Kathy Cameron, dean of 
administration for Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 The school currently pays for chemicals, heating the water and custodial care, 
Cameron said. It also pays the salary of a swimming coach and for lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends has been looking at ways to produce outside revenues to the pool, said 
Fred Shaw, the school's men's and women's swim coach. One way would be to 
charge a fee and allow unaffiliated groups use the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the pool reopened last year, he said, Taft High School and El Camino 
Real High School have been using the facility to train. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who has been active in fund-raising, helped set up a masters program in 
which 30 advanced swimmers use the pool for $45 a month each. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool has also benefited from donations from area firms. Teledyne Laars in 
Moorpark donated a furnace last year and the National Plasterers Council, which 
has an office in Orange County, donated workers to fix the leaks.  
</P>
<P>
 At the fund-raiser, swimmers will raise money from their sponsors for each lap 
they swim, said Pantelas, who last year swam 500 laps and earned $700 from his 
sponsor and employer, Litton Systems in Woodland Hills. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; FESTIVAL WILL ADD 5 EXTRA PARKING LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of Calabasas Days, a popular two-day fall festival put on annually 
by the city, are determined that this year they will not allow the event to 
become a victim of its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year fair-goers trying to enter parking lots were turned away midway 
through the second day because the event attracted so many people that it was 
impossible to find parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had about 20,000 people out there, and we had people waiting about 45 
minutes from when they got off the freeway until they got to the site," said 
Ray Upton, owner of Wipeout Productions, a Calabasas firm that is overseeing 
preparations for the Oct. 22-23 event. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year the city is adding five extra parking lots around Kanan Road and 
the Ventura Freeway, for a total of about 3,000 spaces in all, Upton said. 
Fourteen shuttle buses will carry fair-goers from the parking lots directly to 
the front ticket booth at the site, at the Paramount Ranch on Cornell Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to help ease congestion, organizers say they have added about 80,000 
square feet to provide extra space for crafts booths. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this year's festival is the same as in previous years, "Old West 
With a New Spirit," said Jeff Blum, a banker who is chairman of the Calabasas 
Days steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have de-emphasized the machismo with a gun and emphasized the friendliness 
of the West," he said. "In today's society, there is so much violence. We want 
to show people we can co-exist without violence, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival used to be held in Calabasas near the Sagebrush Cantina about 20 
years ago, but grew too big for the site and was moved to Northridge, Upton 
said. About four years ago, Blum got the idea to bring it back, and he and 
others decided to put it where it's held now, on federal parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an old Western village at the site that was once a set for the 
filming of Westerns, Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's festival will include entertainment, such as country singer 
Cliffie Stone, Chet McCracken, formerly with the Doobie Brothers, and the 
Electric Cowboy Band. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be children's music, including the Bumblebeez, the Happy Crowd 
and Laurie Richards, a performer who likes to involve her audiences in her act. 
There will be stages for amateur entertainers and other attractions, including 
a pumpkin cook-off. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the festivities, the Calabasas Halloween Parade will be held on the 
29th on Calabasas Road. 
</P>
<P>
 For questions about the festival, call (818) 225-2227. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; OSTRICH FARM TOLD TO CUT BACK BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ostrich farm in the middle of a posh Chatsworth neighborhood has been 
ordered to remove 605 of its 800 birds after neighbors complained of a stench 
"like rancid mutton fat" and other environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm's owner, David Mohile, is appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing copious testimony July 11 about flying feathers, allergy 
problems and unpleasant odors coming from Danielle Michelle Farms, city 
Assistant Zoning Administrator Daniel Green imposed several conditions on the 
compound in Monteria Estates, including limiting the number of ostriches and 
emus to 195. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to put him out of business or make him miserable or make him 
move, we're just trying to remove the nuisance," Green said of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to limiting the number of the flightless birds that could be kept 
at the farm, Green ruled that bird feces must be removed from the premises 
daily and that the farm provide evidence to city zoning administrator that it 
is complying with the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal, Mohile's attorney, Jay Bulmash of Seal Beach, disputes many of 
the findings that the birds are bothering neighbors. He also claims the hearing 
procedure was flawed because he was unable to subpoena witnesses for the July 
11 hearing, and that proper notice was not given prior to that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he claims, the farm shouldn't even be subject to city nuisance 
laws, as such regulations apply only to commercial and industrial properties, 
and the farm is neither. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a non-commercial research project," he said in an interview, and the 
complaints by neighbors have been "politically motivated and also motivated by 
the desire to increase property values." 
</P>
<P>
 The case will go before the Board of Zoning Appeals within 75 days and could 
then be appealed to the Los Angeles City Council, the mayor's office and civil 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is definitely willing to take it that far," Bulmash said. ERIC

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; GUNMAN SOUGHT IN GANG SHOOTING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank police are searching for an unknown gunman who shouted gang slogans 
and fired several shots at a 19-year-old man, inflicting minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a North Hollywood resident, was visiting a girl in Burbank 
accompanied by a male friend.He was standing behind her home in the 500 block 
of East Providencia Street at about 9 p.m. Tuesday. A car stopped in the alley 
near the men and the gunman got out and opened fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was not directly hit, bullet fragments ricocheted off the ground and 
lodged in the 19-year-old's arms and legs, Burbank Police Sgt. Scott Wilson 
said. The victim was treated at a local hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not disclose how many shots were fired or what type of handgun 
was used. They also withheld the name of the victim for his protection, saying 
they believe he and his friend are not affiliated with a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who was shot and his companion were squeaky clean, not even a traffic 
ticket," Wilson said. "(But) we do consider this gang-related, because the 
shooter did yell out gang slogans." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the victim and his friend did not know the gunman, and the motive 
for the shooting was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as a teen-ager with a shaved head. The car he was 
riding in was described as a late 1980s black compact. STEVE RYFLE

PRIVATE GROUPS TO RUN 5 CITY ARTS CENTERS; BUDGETS: IN AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP ITS 
COMMUNITY SPACES OPEN, COUNCIL TURNS MANAGEMENT OVER TO PRIVATE CONSORTIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move designed to keep city-owned community arts centers open in spite of 
budget cuts, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday approved the selection 
of several private arts groups to operate the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal approved by the council, each of the city's five community 
arts centers, including the three in the San Fernando Valley, will be operated 
by a different consortium of private arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our centers are run at 60%" of operating capacity, said Al Nodal, 
general manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department. "This is an effort 
to bring in a new group of organizations to help increase the energy and the 
programs at the centers." 
</P>
<P>
 The centers in the Valley are the Lankershim Arts Center in North Hollywood, 
the McGroarty Arts Center in Tujunga and the Encino Photo Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of the Valley's arts community welcomed the opportunity to help 
keep the centers open and expand their programs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were faced with the alternative of having them close -- which no one wants 
to see happen," said Laura Selwyn, executive director of Everywoman's Village. 
"We're all looking to make it work as best we can. We believe in the importance 
of arts in our lives, especially for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys is part of two consortiums, one will operate 
the McGroarty Arts Center and the other will run the Encino Photo Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Domine, president of the San Fernando Valley Arts Council, which will 
run the Encino Photo Center, said he was confident that the consortium idea 
would work at the photo center, but was uncertain about the impact of the plan 
on larger arts centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not convinced that volunteers can do the same quantity and quality of 
work." he said. "I'm optimistic about these new groups but I'm realistic about 
what volunteers can do without outside resources." 
</P>
<P>
 City employees said the change will actually increase the number of workers at 
the centers, which have been understaffed over the last few years because of 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just really down to bare bones," said Earl Sherburn, community arts 
director for the Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the equivalent of two full-time staff positions spread among all five 
centers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the centers will be run by arts groups representing a variety of 
disciplines. At the Lankershim Arts Center, for example, the consortium 
includes two theater groups, a dance company and a printmaking group. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of this consortium, which calls itself the Community Arts Coalition, 
acknowledge that having four groups operate out of one space will require some 
give and take and much communication between members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very concerned about that particular part of the plan," said Taylor 
Gilbert, spokeswoman for the coalition. "The space is relatively small to 
accommodate four groups, but we are very different groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members have been meeting since April to address these concerns. 
Gilbert said they are dedicated to making the plan work so that the community 
will have access to even more arts programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it will be a challenge, some artists feel the coming together of 
various disciplines in one space has proved beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We become so isolated, sometimes, as individual arts groups," Gilbert said. 
"This has been an opportunity for us to become much more aware of other arts 
groups . . . It's like making new friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Cetrone, a member of the William Reagh Los Angeles Photography Center, a 
city-owned center, is less optimistic about the idea of sharing space with 
other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that it may be a bit overcrowded is an understatement," she said, 
speaking before the council Wednesday. "Imagine Ringling Brothers in a space 
the size of this room." 
</P>
<P>
 Cetrone also expressed concern that the city-owned facilities were being 
privatized and that the community would wind up the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing we object to is the loss of control of the community's space," 
she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 David Greenberg of U.P., one of the arts organizations that will run the photo 
center, said the center will continue to serve photographers but will have the 
advantage of being able to offer the community many other forms of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great experiment," Greenberg said. "The city should have done this 
a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the council meeting, councilwoman Rita Walters expressed concern that 
the new operators of the centers may raise the fees for workshops and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens in some areas of the city, "part of the public is going to be 
locked out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year contracts between the city and the arts groups will stipulate 
that the existing fees for programs at the center be kept at the same level. 
The contract will also include a fee schedule for new programs created by the 
arts consortiums.  
</P>
<P>
 The consortiums will receive free space and utilities except telephone use, 
assistance from city staff with some programs and workshops, $20,000 annually 
and guaranteed proceeds from fund raising, Sherburn said.

COUNCIL OKS $14 MILLION FOR HOUSING IN QUAKE-HIT AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to appropriate $14 million in 
community redevelopment funds to build and rehabilitate housing in 
quake-damaged areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same action, the council voted to set aside another $14 million for 
housing in areas affected by the civil unrest of 1992 and $18 million for 
citywide housing 
</P>
<P>
 Council debate centered on how the redevelopment funds should be divided among 
areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Richard Alarcon initially proposed a 
$10-million appropriation for citywide housing and $23 million for 
quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who chairs the House and Community 
Development Committee, put forth a proposal to make more funds available for 
citywide use, regardless of whether areas were affected by the quakes and the 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not deny the areas affected by the civil disturbance their share of 
the resources, nor the areas affected by the earthquake its resources," 
Ridley-Thomas said of the plan which eventually passed.  
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot lose sight of the fact that irrespective of the earthquake, this 
city is down 15,000 (housing) units on an annual basis according to Planning 
Department and the Housing Department data." 
</P>
<P>
 Money designated for earthquake and riot damaged areas can only be used for 
that purpose, but developers who propose to develop or rehabilitate housing in 
those areas may apply for citywide funds as well as the specially designated 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan must now be approved by the mayor.

4 JUVENILES HELD IN AUTO BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four juveniles, ranging in age from 9 to 14, were arrested Wednesday as 
suspects in a string of auto burglaries carried out in a residential 
neighborhood near Burbank Airport, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested was Jose Sergura, 19, of Burbank, who police identified as the 
brother of one of the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, acting on a tip from one of the victims, picked up the youths 
Wednesday afternoon, said Lt. Joe Valento of the Burbank Police Department. 
They are suspected of breaking into at least eight cars over a monthlong 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the break-ins took place on North Ontario and Fairveiw streets about 
one mile east of the airport, Valento said. Describing the thefts as "crimes of 
opportunity," Valento said the thieves would take stereo systems and other 
items of value. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are also looking into the possibility that the youths may be 
involved in residential burglaries and perhaps even street robberies, a police 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valento said the youths appeared unfazed by their detention at a police 
station and that he considered them too young to be sent to a juvenile 
detention facility for the alleged thefts. He said they would be turned over to 
their parents and that the families would receive counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergura, however, was detained and booked on one count of suspicion of 
receiving stolen property.

COURT HALTS SUSPENSIONS OF HEALTH INSPECTORS; LABOR: THE ORDER PREVENTS COUNTY 
ACTION AGAINST PROTESTING WORKERS WHO REFUSE TO DRIVE THEIR PRIVATE CARS ON 
BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health inspectors, who have been on a work slowdown since 
last week, won a crucial court victory Wednesday that will prevent the county 
from suspending inspectors who refuse to drive their private cars on county 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien granted a temporary 
restraining order against the county in response to a plea by lawyers 
representing about 350 inspectors, about 50 of whom have been suspended from 
their posts because they rode bicycles, walked or took public transportation to 
assignments instead of using their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said the decision was a boost for their job action against the 
county, a protest begun on Wednesday of last week because they have had no pay 
raise for three years, no contract for nearly two years and no increase in 
their 25-cent per mile auto expense allowance for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll go at it with a vengeance now," said Jim Somers, a negotiator for the 
Los Angeles County Assn. of Environmental Health Specialists, the inspectors' 
union. "You know how hard it is to get a temporary order? We're dancing in the 
aisles over here." 
</P>
<P>
 In his four-page decision, Judge O'Brien also ruled that inspectors who have 
already been suspended for refusing to drive their own autos to assignments 
since the job action began must be paid for the days they were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials expressed surprise at the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Lester Tolnai, senior deputy county counsel. "I 
don't think the facts warranted the issuance of a temporary restraining order." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to regroup and see what we can do next," said Elliot Marcus, 
director of labor relations for the county chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both Tolnai and Marcus said the County Department of Health Services, 
which oversees the inspectors, will comply with the judge's decision and 
rescind the driving-related suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Somers, who said his Monterey Park Environmental Health office erupted in 
cheers at the news of the judge's decision, said he would call dozens of 
inspectors who expected to be suspended today and tell them to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of inspectors participating in the action since it began last week 
has dropped from about 320 to 200, due to a combination of the suspensions and 
the heat, Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the job action began, work by the inspectors -- who examine public 
facilities from fast-food restaurants to apartment house swimming pools for 
disease risks -- has dropped by 95%, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing before O'Brien on Wednesday, Union attorney Sylvia E. Kellison 
cited two cases related to past disputes with the county over use of employees' 
personal vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, she argued, a state appellate judge in Los Angeles ruled that county 
employees had the right to refuse to use their private vehicles if they felt 
the reimbursement rate was inadequate. And in 1982, a Los Angeles County 
Superior Court judge held that county employees could decline to use their cars 
if the contract obligating them to do so had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary restraining order will remain in effect until Aug. 31, when both 
sides will again go before O'Brien to learn whether he will replace it with a 
preliminary injunction.  
</P>
<P>
 Somers, who met with about 200 inspectors on Tuesday evening, said the 
consensus among rank-and-file inspectors is to continue the job action until 
the dispute is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no talk of expanding the effort into a strike, Somers said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER MOVES CITY ELECTION TO '97 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a calendar conflict posed by California's new presidential primary date 
in 1996, the City Council has moved its next municipal election to the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving the next city election to March 4, 1997, current council members 
whose terms were scheduled to expire in April, 1996, will serve an additional 
11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The election change was approved unanimously by the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the change was necessary because the Legislature has moved 
California's presidential primary election to the end of March, 1996, hoping to 
give the state more clout in selecting the next presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of timing problems, Los Angeles County officials said they would 
be unable to provide voting booths and other materials to Lancaster for the 
city's election, which was scheduled two weeks after the primary. County 
officials also said they did not have enough equipment to let Lancaster 
consolidate its city balloting with the November, 1996, election. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, however, the city was allowed to move its local election to 
March in odd-numbered years. Lancaster council members said a change to that 
date will be less expensive and less confusing to voters than other dates 
available to the city.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 GUILTY IN SLAYINGS OF RUNAWAYS MAY FACE 
DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Antelope Valley men convicted in the stabbing deaths of two teen-age 
runaways will either be put to death or spend the rest of their lives in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Tomas Orcasitas, 21, of Littlerock and Jose Angel Orona, 22, of 
Palmdale were found guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder and conspiracy to 
commit murder in the 1992 deaths of David Benjamin Scott of Llano and Daniel 
Joseph Kufeldt of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the convictions includes the special circumstances of committing 
murder while lying in wait and of committing multiple murders, allowing 
prosecutors to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, which deliberated for four days before reaching its verdict, will 
reconvene Aug. 25 in Los Angeles Superior Court to decide if Orcasitas and 
Orona should receive the death penalty, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron L. 
Smalstig. 
</P>
<P>
 The decomposed bodies of David, 14, and Daniel, 15, were discovered in June 
22, 1992, in a remote desert area. The teen-agers had been missing for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcasitas and Orona killed the youths to prevent them from testifying about 
the men's involvement in a burglary and because they believed David had stolen 
a ring belonging to Orona, Smalstig said.  
</P>
<P>
 The men lured the victims from a campground near Big Rock Creek in Angeles 
National Forest "to a remote area and killed them and left the bodies to rot 
out in the desert," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers were taken by van to 96th Street East and Avenue V, having been 
told another burglary was to be committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orona demanded the ring from David and stabbed him when he said he didn't have 
it, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department report. Orcasitas 
stabbed Daniel when he tried to intervene and then also stabbed David, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant, Durwood (Billy) Bland III, earlier pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder and testified against Orcasitas and Orona in the trial. 
Bland said that he was with the group that traveled from the campground to the 
desert area, but didn't participate in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth man, Brian Peak, pleaded no contest to being an accessory to the 
boys' killings for driving Orona, Orcasitas and Bland to the victims' campsite.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COLLEGE OF CANYONS RECOVERS FROM QUAKE; 
EDUCATION: OFFICIALS AT THE TWO-YEAR COMMUNITY SCHOOL CHART 25 YEARS OF 
PROGRESS ALONG WITH A FEW BUMPY PERIODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 College of the Canyons held classes at night in a nearby high school when it 
opened 25 years ago. This spring, many classes were taught in tents. 
</P>
<P>
 But college officials and faculty members note that a lot of progress has 
occurred in between. For one thing, there were only about 600 students back in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 6,000 students will start classes today at COC, a two-year community 
college in Valencia, which marked its 25th anniversary this week. The campus 
will be at nearly full operation, despite sustaining about $2.5 million damage 
during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment is down by about 200 students from a year ago, part of which may 
have been caused by the earthquake. The college's sports stadium is undergoing 
repairs which are expected to last until early September, said Assistant Supt. 
Carter Doran. But he said he isn't worried about any lasting effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're back to normal," he said. "The worst of the earthquake is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused an 11% drop in spring enrollment and left 23 of the 
college's 70 classrooms unusable, forcing officials to hold classes in tents 
and temporary buildings on campus, Doran said. "That was really a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are installing a new running track and reinforcing the college's 
stadium because its foundation was damaged in the earthquake, said Jorge Perez, 
director of facilities and planning. Other projects include repairs to 
sidewalks, parking lots, outside lights and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the worst damage occurred in a chemical storage room, said spokeswoman 
Sue Bozman. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the chemicals were like a blender in there, and they soaked into the 
ceiling and walls," she said. A modified storage cabinet that can be carried 
from the building has replaced the old storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and other employees returned to campus Wednesday to prepare for 
classes. Betty Spilker, an English teacher at the college since it opened in 
1969, said she was looking forward to seeing her rebuilt office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I'll have seen it since they furnished it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spilker was one of several longtime COC employees honored Wednesday at a 
ceremony to celebrate the school's 25th anniversary. Honorees included 10 
employees who, like Spilker, have worked at the college since its beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spilker said afterward that she is a little surprised that she has stayed so 
long. She was initially disenchanted to discover classes were being taught at 
Hart High School in Newhall because the on-campus buildings weren't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I originally said I would work here for one year and then get a job at a real 
school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spilker said she grew attached to the college, which COC President Dianne 
Van Hook called a "curious institution" that has been bold enough to hire a few 
"genuine off-the-wall sorts" and "take a risk on the inexperienced, but eager." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the college) managed to select people who were eccentric but really 
special," Spilker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup of students at COC has changed as the Santa Clarita Valley has 
evolved from rural farmland to a rapidly growing bedroom community. The 
enrollment includes more recent high school graduates, many of whom can't 
afford four-year schools for the first two years, and adults seeking career 
changes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, for example, the college attracted a lot of police officers 
who took classes there as part of their training, as well as high school 
graduates and adults going back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Many community members and students have formed strong attachments to COC. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Fay, 23, of Canyon Country said she has attended classes there since 
1989 and is starting in the college's two-year nursing program this semester. 
Eventually, she said, she hopes to get a four-year nursing degree. But for now 
the ease of taking classes at COC suits her just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm broke and the school is close," she said. "And I hate the freeway."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ADVOCATES TO GATHER FOR HOMELESS ANIMALS' DAY; 
OBSERVANCE: SATURDAY EVENT WILL CALL ATTENTION TO THE EUTHANIZING OF 12 MILLION 
TO 17 MILLION DOGS AND CATS EACH YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A somber candlelight vigil at 7 p.m. Saturday outside City Hall may evoke 
strong emotions among animal lovers here -- but less reverent responses from 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is one of 12 cities statewide in which the third annual Homeless 
Animals' Day will be observed, calling attention to the massive euthanizing of 
dogs and cats each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to finally get the (message) out (about) the killing of 
healthy dogs and cats because owners don't get their animals spayed or 
neutered," said Helen Jones, president of the International Society for Animal 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12 million to 17 million healthy cats and dogs are killed annually in 
public and private animal shelters, according to the Pennsylvania-based group. 
Animal control officials are forced to put the animals to death because so many 
unwanted births occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there becomes too much of any life, it becomes expendable," Jones said. 
"This was an issue people didn't understand, didn't know about. It has been one 
of the best-kept secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless Animals' Day observances will be held Saturday in more than 600 
cities throughout the United States, Canada and Australia, Jones said. They 
include candlelight ceremonies and, in some instances, reading the names of the 
dead animals to the sound of a drum roll and weaving a chain of the animals' 
collars. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's observance has been organized by the Santa Clarita Valley 
chapter of the Pet Assistance Foundation, a 25-member group that encourages 
spaying and neutering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year at this same time, various animal (rights) groups throughout the 
United States that have the time and energy are having these candlelight 
vigils," said Charmaine Posten, a chapter member. "It's a somber evening." 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide program is usually well-attended by animal lovers, but can be 
puzzling to those less fervent about dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a while, you get crank mail from people who say, 'Why aren't you 
doing something for people?' " Jones said. "I think we are all working 
together. We're trying to stop suffering and death." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people have attended each of Santa Clarita's two prior vigils. 
</P>
<P>
 Four canine stars are scheduled to appear in Santa Clarita, including animal 
movie actors Benji and Bingo, Missy from "Beethoven's 2nd" and Murray from the 
"Mad About You" television series. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certificates for grooming services, animal training and spaying and neutering 
will be distributed to those attending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Santa Clarita are probably better than average about having 
their pets spayed and neutered," Posten said. "We want kids growing up knowing 
that when they have a pet they need to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson also plans to participate, possibly with 
his 1-year-old sheltie, Max. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the tragedies of this society is how we treat our pets," Pederson 
said. "I think that to have this vigil is a very important thing."

SWIMMING; THOMPSON OVERCOMES TO WIN 100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenny Thompson, the bionic woman of American swimming with a plate and seven 
screws holding her left arm together, scored her second victory Wednesday in 
the National Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson won the 100-meter butterfly in 1 minute 0.34 seconds, catching 
runner-up Amy Van Dyken just before the finish with a final split of 32.04 
seconds.Van Dyken was second in 1:00.57. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really nervous coming into this meet. I didn't know what to expect," 
said Thompson, who had surgery June 3 to repair the arm she broke while riding 
a waterslide on the Stanford campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's competition, Chad Carvin, a former Laguna Hills High swimmer, and 
Seth van Neerden recorded their second victories in the competition, used this 
year to select the U.S. team that will participate in next month's World 
Championships at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Carvin, who set American records while winning the 500- and 1,650-yard 
freestyle events for Arizona in this year's NCAA meet, had a personal best of 
3:49.83 in winning the 400 freestyle. He also won the 200 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Neerden, the 26-year-old from Wilmington, Del., who swims for the Ft. 
Lauderdale Swim Team, added the 200 breaststroke title to his 100 breaststroke 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Neerden won in 2:13.27, the fastest time in the world this year. Steve 
West of Golden West Swim Club in Huntington Beach was fourth in 2:16.23.

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; ILLNESS, TU THWARTED BLESZYNSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was advised by her doctor not to go to San Jose, but severe bronchitis 
would not stop Ania Bleszynski from playing in last week's United States Tennis 
Assn. Girls' 18 national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Her illness likely played a role in her straight-set loss to rival Meilen Tu 
in what many expected to be a hotly contested showdown between great young 
players from the Valley. Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks was seeded fourth. Tu of 
Northridge was top-seeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski battled rustiness, fatigue and sluggishness -- the remnants of a 
severe cold -- but reached the semifinals. There, Bleszynski was blown out by 
Tu, 6-1, 6-2. Tu won the tournament the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to make excuses," Bleszynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 So she doesn't attribute the blowout to a physician telling her two weeks 
before the national tournament that she had symptoms of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 She couldn't play tennis for 10 days and was advised by her doctor not to make 
the trip. She made it anyway, packing antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Tu) basically blew me off the court," Bleszynski said. "She was stepping in 
and ripping winners off my first serve. I was definitely not happy (about the 
loss). But Meilen played really well. It might not have made a difference even 
if I was feeling great." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu consistently hit winners with pinpoint accuracy -- often hitting the lines 
with her ground strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu was pegged to win the match. But few who follow junior tennis figured Tu, a 
slender 16-year-old who stands 5-foot-5, would so dominate the 6-1, 17-year-old 
Bleszynski. Tu surprised Bleszynski with her power. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used to hit a lot of moon balls," Bleszynski said. "But she's gotten much 
stronger. She's always been quick and able to chase down balls. But she can 
take control, too, and wipe (opponents) off the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Tu is a rising player on the international junior circuit, winning tournaments 
in South America and England this year. But Bleszynski had been winning big in 
the United States. She won the Southern California sectional tournament in 
June, routing Violette Ahn, 6-3, 6-2, in the final. In July, Bleszynski earned 
two gold medals at the U.S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski said she expected to win the national championship at that point.  
</P>
<P>
 But the bronchitis wiped away that optimism. She had to play her way back into 
shape during the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played Meilen, I wasn't tired," Bleszynski said. "But I didn't have 
much confidence going in. I wasn't playing well. Mentally, I was just not 
pumped up enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Add rivals: Bleszynski and Tu occasionally play practice sets at the Warner 
Center Club. Tu wins most of those battles as well. Bleszynski said Tu could 
bypass college and go directly to the pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually -- because her whole day is for tennis -- something has to come 
out of that," Bleszynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Tu: A former Granada Hills High student who now studies at home, Tu had 
twice before been seeded at the national 18s tournament but never advanced past 
the quarterfinals, in part because of injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Tu downplayed her desire to win the 1994 championship until it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the title," Tu said after she defeated Lilia Osterloh, 4-6, 6-3, 
6-3, for the championship. "This is a pretty big win for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But as she advanced through six rounds to the final, beating each opponent in 
straight sets, Tu never let on about how badly she wanted to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that I'm improving," she said. "I'm just happy if 
I play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Tu said, she received some prodding from Helen Tu, her older sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Helen) said, 'I know how badly you want it, even though you don't admit it,' 
" Meilen said. "She was using some psychology on me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Battle of the bulge: It seems strange that Derek Pope, bound for Indiana on a 
full scholarship, had to upset somebody last week just to get past the first 
round of the USTA Boys' 18 national tournament in Kalamazoo, Mich. But that's 
exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded Pope of Ojai took out 12th-seeded Adam Neal of St. Louis, 6-4, 3-6, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories are rarely a problem for Pope, one of the most talented players in 
his age group in Southern California. Keeping his weight down is. 
</P>
<P>
 He stood 6 feet 2 and weighed 255 at age 16 when he joined a tennis academy in 
Florida and shed 25 pounds. But last winter the weight came back. Pope, now 18, 
was back up to 250. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it wasn't noticeable," he said. "But I weighed myself in January and 
said, 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Six hours of court time each day in the Florida heat and humidity have trimmed 
Pope down once again. He weighed 218 during the Southern California sectional 
tournament in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting tired at all," he said. "I can run down balls. I don't need 
as much time between points. Being in shape is the most important part of my 
game right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope won two more matches at the national before he was eliminated by 
sixth-seeded Justin Gimelstob of Whippany, N.J., in the round of 16.

LOCAL NOTES: THREE SPLASH PLAYERS SUSPENDED FOR BRAWL IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Continental Indoor Soccer League on Wednesday suspended three Splash 
players for a total of four games for their involvement in a bench-clearing 
brawl at the conclusion of Sunday's 6-5 loss to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Ralph Black will miss the next two home games, Aug. 28 against 
Sacramento and Sept. 1 against Dallas; Denis Hamlett and reserve goalie Ruben 
Fernandez will miss the Sacramento game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett and Sacramento goalie Mike Dowler went for the final ball of the game, 
tripped over one another and fell into the net at the back of the goal. As 
Hamlett and Dowler pushed one another, players from both benches rushed into 
the goal mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Black was suspended for his aggression and, after being struck by Kenny 
Latham, kicking him in the abdomen; Hamlett was suspended for spitting on a 
player; Fernandez was suspended for a scuffle that broke out in front of the 
bench area. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowler received a yellow card for his part in the fight; Latham was suspended 
for one game, against Carolina (2-18). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in total disagreement that a player spitting at or on another player is 
labeled violent conduct and is considered the same as hitting another player," 
Splash General Manager Tim Ryan said. "I'm not in disagreement with the 
league's decision (to suspend Black). I think Ralph's intent was to protect his 
teammates, but under league rules his suspension was probably warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspensions, because they take place in each team's next home game, might 
change the dynamics of the Western Division race, since the Splash (15-6) will 
be short-handed against third-place Sacramento (13-9), which trailed Anaheim by 
2 1/2 games after a 4-3 loss Thursday to Arizona, and Dallas (18-3), which has 
the league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to hurt us, no doubt about it," Splash Coach George Fernandez 
said. "We play Las Vegas the night before we play Sacramento, so we'll be tired 
and we'll be without two of our best defenders. No doubt we'll be behind the 
eight ball." MARTIN HENDERSON

SOFTBALL / PAIGE A. LEECH; MOONLIGHTING CHAMPIONS STAYED AWAKE JUST LONG ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While the general population of Normal, Ill., slept in the wee hours of the 
morning, two determined California 16-and-under Amateur Softball Assn. teams 
were battling under the moonlight for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Gordon's Panthers and the San Diego Lightning had been playing 
since noon. To win the title, players had to worry about more than maintaining 
top performances. They had to stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Panthers emerged from the 73-team field with the national 
title in hand, it was 3 a.m. A few more innings and players would have missed 
their early morning flights back to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Because heavy rains washed out most of Saturday's games, tournament organizers 
scheduled two days' worth of action on Sunday. And numerous extra-inning games 
further delayed play.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the schedule was so disrupted, the Panthers played four games and 
never left the field after their first game -- which was played at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long day and late-night, early morning competition, the Panthers 
showed no signs of fatigue, according to Coach Dale Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be totally honest with you, the girls play better at night," Moore said. 
"And they wanted to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Panthers live in Orange County, but three area players -- Canyon 
High's Crystl Bustos, Alemany's Jamie Moore and Buena's Bevan Trueblood -- 
played key roles in the championship game. Each scored a run in the 3-0 victory 
over the Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (37-2) breezed through the early rounds, recording eight-run, 
mercy-rule victories in all three games.  
</P>
<P>
 In the championship bracket, the Panthers were 6-0 before losing, 1-0, to the 
Lightning in a game that was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. but didn't begin until 
11:30. That forced one final early-morning championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustos, The Times' Valley player of the year, was the guiding force in the 
Panthers' tournament championship. Bustos, a shortstop entering her senior 
year, led the team with a .556 batting average, 15 hits and seven runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a catcher who also will be a senior, hit .500 with six RBIs. Trueblood 
batted .261. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Third wish: Except for Jamie Gillies' bout with food poisoning, all went about 
as planned for the 16-and-under Woodland Hills-based Stealth, according to 
Coach Wes Goodin.  
</P>
<P>
 The Stealth, making its first national appearance, finished third in the 
Illinois tournament. And Goodin couldn't be more pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ended up exactly where we thought we would," Goodin said. "Gordon's 
Panthers were by far the best team around and San Diego Lightning was about a 
notch below them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got what we were hoping for. We thought with the right draw (staying away 
from the California teams early) that we could go out and take third place," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Stealth (63-15) cruised through its first five opponents, outscoring teams 
from Washington, Oklahoma, Kansas, Florida and Illinois, 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Stealth then ran into the California teams, losing to the 
Panthers, 1-0, and the Lightning, 3-1, in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillies, a Saugus High standout and defending Southern Section Division II 
player of the year who suffered from food poisoning and sat out one day, was 
3-1 in the tournament with three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Witt, who will be a sophomore at Louisville High, led the Stealth with a 
.409 batting average. Chatsworth's Parisa Plant batted .364 and El Camino 
Real's Ramona Shelburne hit .294. Of the 16 runs scored by the Stealth, 
Reseda's Rosie Yates drove in eight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game of inches: A timely hit here or there might have been the difference 
between a first- and ninth-place finish in the 12-and-under ASA national 
championship in Greenwood, Ind., last weekend, according to Don Harris, coach 
of the Stealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between the No. 1 team and No. 9 is probably inches -- maybe a 
base hit," said Harris, whose team placed ninth in the 73-team field. 
</P>
<P>
 Stealth ace Maureen LeCocq allowed only one walk in 36 innings, but that 
batter later scored on a wild pitch to help the San Diego Power beat the 
Stealth, 1-0, in an elimination game. 
</P>
<P>
 LeCocq, who struck out 40 and allowed just five hits, did not allow a hit in 
the Stealth's first three victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maureen had an exceptional tournament," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 After beating the Chattanooga Hurricanes for a fourth consecutive victory, the 
Stealth lost its final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have gotten a key hit in any of the two games we lost, we would 
have won it," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stealth (42-11), based in Woodland Hills, has a final chance this summer 
to win a fifth tournament title. The Stealth is competing in the Junior Olympic 
Invitational in Honolulu this week.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; POLICE LOOKING FOR TWO SUSPECTS IN THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and USC security personnel are looking for two suspects in the July 28 
theft of O.J. Simpson's Heisman Trophy from Heritage Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fingerprints from two adult males," Athletic Director Mike Garrett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trophies of USC's three other Heisman winners -- Garrett, Marcus Allen and 
Charles White -- remain on display, but under increased video and electronic 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers surged into the spotlight Wednesday, during USC's first practice 
work in pads.  
</P>
<P>
 In the day's first contact drill, tailback Leonard Green, a transfer from Mt. 
San Antonio College, dashed off left tackle for five yards, despite the fact 
that defensive end Matt Keneley dumped All-American offensive tackle Tony 
Boselli on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, six feet and 180 pounds, had several other quick bursts in the morning, 
then broke two long runs in the afternoon. On one, he zipped between 
linebackers Israel Ifeanyi and Errick Herrin and ran 50 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Green was stopped by a vicious hit by cornerback Jesse 
Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen tailbacks Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons were impressive, as was 
returning starter Shawn Walters.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of poise and quick feet," Robinson said of Green. "But I liked 
all three of our new backs. We want to keep them as active as we can. . . . 
They all seem to have a sense for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Many eyes were on another prized recruit, freshman defensive tackle Darrell 
Russell. On his first play in pads, he was stopped at the line by junior John 
Michels, who then twisted a knee when Russell fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC is awash in quick, talented tailbacks, but who's going to play fullback? 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson wasn't quite ready to answer that, other than to say his tailbacks 
should consider themselves interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 The preseason depth chart lists sophomore Mark Farlin as the starting fullback 
and freshman Taso Papadakis as backup. But Farlin played in only five games 
last year, all at linebacker. He was switched to fullback in the spring.  
</P>
<P>
 Papadakis was a backup fullback last year until he suffered a dislocated wrist 
in the second game and was redshirted. He's listed as the No. 2 fullback for 
goal-line plays, but will also play inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore David Dotson lost the starting tailback job to Walters last year, 
but Robinson calls him a strong pass blocker, indicating both he and junior 
Terry Barnum might play some at fullback.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury update: Jeff Diltz, the sophomore backup tight end who injured a knee 
Saturday, underwent arthroscopic surgery Tuesday and will sit out at least the 
first two games. EARL GUSTKEY

IN FULL SWING AT 24; IN THESE DAYS OF RAP AND NEW AGE MUSIC, EVAN CHRISTOPHER 
FINDS INSPIRATION IN THE SOUNDS OF YESTERDAY WHILE LOOKING AHEAD IN HIS 
PRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a hot August night inside the Fullerton Hofbrau and, as clarinetist Evan 
Christopher takes the bandstand, it's about to get hotter. 
</P>
<P>
 As he leads his combo through Fats Waller's "Honeysuckle Rose," a few couples 
step across the slippery dance floor while servers hustle among the tables with 
steaming plates of food and steins of beer.  
</P>
<P>
 Breaking into his improvisation, Christopher -- his shoulders pinched, 
instrument pointed skyward -- bears down on the familiar tune, sliding around 
the scales before climbing into an assertive wail that he holds for several, 
steamy moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly packed house breaks into cheers and applause. Beaming, the 
clarinetist offers his instrument and a wide smile to the throng, before 
continuing with a program of music from the '20s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has brought this kind of excitement not only to his own bands but 
to popular singer-keyboardist A. J. Croce's ensemble, a group that concentrates 
on classic American pop tunes of 50 and more years ago (it was the hit of the 
Southern California Jazz Festival earlier this summer). He is also a member of 
saxophonist Tom Kubis' Dixieland project, Swing Savant, and the Misbehavin' 
Jazz Band. As KLON-FM jazz disc jockey Ken Borgers says in the notes to 
Christopher's recent self-produced CD, "He has a wonderful ability to get 
swinging so hard, you can't imagine anything hotter." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen him come up through the ranks," says arranger and bandleader Kubis, 
"and he has unbelievable talent and charisma. The electricity he brings to the 
stage is not to be missed. I hope he doesn't forget me when he really gets 
famous." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to believe these accolades listening to the somewhat redundantly 
titled CD, "Evan Christopher Plays Classic Jazz Classics." On it, the 
clarinetist brings spark and fire to selections from Waller, King Oliver, Duke 
Ellington, Cole Porter and W. C. Handy, playing in a way that makes a direct 
link to their era. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hard thing to believe is Christopher's age. He'll celebrate his 25th 
birthday later this month. How is it in this era of rap, heavy metal and New 
Age music that someone still in his 20s turns to bygone times for his musical 
inspiration? 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, "I was never really aware of pop music," he says, "I didn't listen 
to it on the radio -- it never really grabbed me." 
</P>
<P>
 But a collection of Louis Armstrong recordings from the late '20s owned by his 
father, a casual banjo picker, did make an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just jams, wonderful short songs with things I hadn't heard before. 
Johnny Dodds was the clarinetist. There was something about that era that 
attracted me, everything seemed more elegant -- the picture on the cover, 
reading the liner notes -- it all seemed very classy." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher began piano lessons at age 8 and says his this is the spacefor 
tlink and windo first interest was classical music. But when he was about 11, 
he first heard Armstrong and began to pursue others of that era, mainly to 
develop clarinet skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to things like what Artie Shaw did during the mid- to late-'30s. 
That was the first music I used to learn the clarinet. It was easy to hear the 
instrument (in that setting) and it was easy to imitate what was being done. I 
don't know what that music touched but it all became very exciting for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach native played his instrument in junior high and high school 
bands, though he says he learned more of his technique playing by ear. He spent 
his senior year at the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts, where he studied 
classical music and played in chamber groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint at USC, he returned to Long Beach for college, graduating with 
honors with a degree in music from Cal State Long Beach in 1993. During that 
time, he began to play casual dates, getting his feet wet in the performance 
world. He also spent some time at Golden West College, where he studied 
arranging with Kubis and became involved with Swing Savant. 
</P>
<P>
 He met Croce (the son of late pop songwriter-singer Jim Croce) at the San 
Diego club Croce's, where he would sit in with the house band. When Croce 
signed to do his first recording for Private Music in 1993, he called 
Christopher to play clarinet. That August, the band went out on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first job was to open for Ray Charles at Wolf Trap (Farm Park for the 
Performing Arts in Virginia) in front of 8,000 people, my first time in with a 
crowd that size. I didn't really know some of the music that well yet, so I 
taped a cheat sheet to my music stand. But by the time we went on I realized 
the sheet was just too far away to read so I had to wing it. But it all worked 
out great." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Christopher has toured Europe with Croce as well as the United 
States and Canada. He continues to be a member of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great time, but I started to get a little tired of the routine. We 
were promoting the album, so the show didn't change much from night to night. 
I'm happy to work with any configuration, but if there's no variety, things 
start to get me down." 
</P>
<P>
 That need for variety is apparent in Christopher's own work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time I put a group together, I try to focus on something different. The 
group we have now at the Hofbrau and the tunes we do are pretty standard, but 
we're trying to approach them differently. Stylistically, my groups have all 
worked within the constructs of pre-swing styles: different schools of New 
Orleans jazz, early swing music like Benny Goodman and Ellington from the late 
'20s." 
</P>
<P>
 And the clarinetist, who also sings and plays saxophone on occasion, wants to 
put some variety in his presentation as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a trend toward visual orientation now in art and music. So my next 
step is to pursue something more of a multimedia approach, to find a way of 
representing the music, not only by performing it, but by combining it with 
early dance styles and to use audio-video footage of great jazz musicians, 
great rhythm tap-dancers and the great literature of the period." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the members of his generation now being drawn to the classic American 
songs, and for the same things that first attracted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on is not so much a revival, but a broader interest in art and 
music history. People are starting to be more open toward different 
influences," he said. "We tend to forget where things come from -- the audience 
for popular music will think something is brand new even if it was done 50 
years ago. But that's OK. They'll make the connection later." 
</P>

O.C. FIRM OWNER TARGET OF FEDERAL FRAUD INDICTMENT; SECURITIES: PROMOTER OF 
NONEXISTENT VIDEOPHONE SYSTEM KEPT SOLICITING CUSTOMERS FROM JAIL IN 
$12-MILLION SCAM, PANEL ALLEGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County video telephone promoter who continued soliciting investors 
after being jailed for contempt of court was indicted Wednesday on 30 counts of 
criminal fraud and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grand jury indictment, handed down in Los Angeles, alleges that 
Michael Gartner, 32, masterminded a $12-million securities fraud scheme by 
selling hundreds of investors shares in a nonexistent videophone system that he 
claimed would link major business centers in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner, who used infomercials and a phone solicitation operation to sell 
investments, once showed a TV audience an empty cabinet covered with blinking 
lights and called it a working prototype of a "photonic switch" developed by 
his Costa Mesa-based Interlink Data Network, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gartner nor his attorney could be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a number of legitimate companies nationwide are seeking investors to 
develop various telecommunications systems, the field is also fertile for scam 
artists who take advantage of the public's fascination with high technology and 
quick profits, law enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Holguin, chief investigator for the California Department of Commerce 
unit that regulates the wireless cable industry, said she knows of at least 250 
telemarketing operations selling investments in high-tech systems, some of 
which exist only on paper. About half of those 250, she said, are in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin estimated that such companies pull in $1 million a month from 
investors lured by the promise of huge returns. "It's sad," she said. "People 
have to do their homework before they invest rather than trying to get (the 
legal system) to do something after their money is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials attempted last year to shut down Gartner's company and 
several related businesses. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for 
civil fraud, and he was ordered in June, 1993, to repay investors $12.3 million 
and to stop selling investments in the videophone business. 
</P>
<P>
 In January of this year, however, Gartner was jailed for contempt of court for 
refusing to disclose the whereabouts of the millions of dollars he had 
collected from investors. Officials so far have traced only the $2 million that 
Gartner spent on himself to maintain a lavish lifestyle, which included renting 
a $16-million hilltop mansion in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gartner was in jail, the indictment states, he teamed up with his 
sister, 26-year-old Yvette Gartner, and started peddling shares in videophone 
systems to investors in Canada. The Gartners placed ads in Canadian newspapers 
soliciting investors for a company they described as a maker and seller of 
videophones.  
</P>
<P>
 When prospects called the number, Yvette Gartner would put them through to her 
brother in a three-way call, according to the indictment. Michael Gartner would 
then speak with them on a phone made available to prisoners at the Metropolitan 
Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The two also sent out marketing material that had been produced and used 
earlier to sell investments in Interlink Data Network, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all 30 felony counts, Michael Gartner could be sentenced to 
230 years in prison and fined $7.5 million. Yvette Gartner faces up to 15 years 
in prison and a $750,000 fine on three counts of wire fraud stemming from the 
phone solicitations from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gartner's company, Interlink Data Network, was formed in 1991 and 
almost immediately began soliciting investors in what sales agents represented 
as a company with breakthrough patents in fiber-optics technology.  
</P>
<P>
 Prospects were told that Interlink had built a working prototype of its 
videophone and was in the midst of building a 21-mile fiber-optic network in 
the Wilshire district of Los Angeles. In fact, the indictment alleges, none of 
those things were true. 
</P>
<P>
 The contempt citation against Michael Gartner has been lifted, but he has been 
arrested on the criminal charges and remains in jail, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
David Schindler said Wednesday. A bail hearing is scheduled for Friday, with 
arraignment scheduled Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.

 Compaq Computer Corp.'s announcement that it will put labels on its keyboards 
warning of possible hand and wrist injuries has prompted manufacturers and 
distributors in Southern California to weigh whether they should follow 
Compaq's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a growing number of product liability lawsuits linked to the use of 
computers, some companies that make and sell keyboards said Wednesday that they 
are studying ways to call customers' attention to the potential for injury from 
repetitive stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When keyboards first came out, we weren't aware of carpal tunnel syndrome," a 
painful wrist condition, said Rebecca Cradick, a spokeswoman for Toshiba 
America Inc.'s Information Systems Division in Irvine. "Now that it's out 
there, we'd want to warn (customers) about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no nationwide tally of liability suits involving computers, 
the number is growing, said Robert Komitor, a partner at Levi, Phillips and 
Konigsberg in New York. His firm represents about 1,000 plaintiffs who allege 
keyboard-related injuries. The suits are divided among about 100 manufacturers 
nationwide, Komitor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among corporations involved in such litigation is AST Research Inc., the 
country's fifth-largest maker of personal computers. AST, based in Irvine, 
stated in a filing with the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission in April 
that it faced 11 lawsuits alleging that its products caused carpal tunnel 
syndrome or other repetitive stress injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 An AST spokesman said Wednesday that it cannot comment on the issue while 
lawsuits are pending, except to say that it is aware of Compaq's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq, the leading seller of personal computers, said Tuesday that it will 
begin putting this notice on its keyboards: "Warning! To Reduce Risk of Serious 
Injury to Hands, Wrists or Other Joints, Read Safety & Comfort Guide." 
Microsoft Corp. also said it will place notices on some of its keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compaq is a very prudent firm," said William J. Milton, an analyst who 
follows computer companies for the Brown Brothers Harriman brokerage in New 
York. "I could see where others would follow because they have nothing to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton said he doubts that warning labels will affect the sales of Compaq or 
any other computer maker, though. "We simply can't do without these machines," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Toshiba said Wednesday that the company might begin 
including with its notebook computers "usage manuals" covering topics such as 
proper posture and hand and wrist positions when using the computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, however, have no action plan yet. Advanced Logic Research 
Inc., another computer manufacturer based in Irvine, said it does not face any 
keyboard liability lawsuits and doesn't anticipate doing anything to head them 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the liability suits filed against manufacturers are "unfair," said 
Dave Kirkey, the company's vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how to keep that keyboard on your desk or how you should sit 
or at what distance from the keyboard you should sit," Kirkey said. ALR might 
put warning labels on its products or expand its user manuals "if that's what 
the attorneys tell us to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Capretz, a Newport Beach lawyer who has handled a number of product 
liability cases, said that, though warning labels and manuals are no guarantee 
against lawsuits, they might help in defending such a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're warned of a danger for a product, then the standard (defense) is, 
'You should have known,' " said Capretz, who was involved in winning a 
$26-million settlement for recipients of potentially fatal artificial heart 
valves manufactured by Shiley Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as an injured party, you might be able to say, 'I thought it was only 
keyboards with the warning label.' "COMPUTER I

SPURRED BY FED, LENDERS CUT RATES ON FIXED MORTGAGES; FINANCE: BUT COST OF 
ADJUSTABLE-RATE LOANS GOES UP, MAKING THEM LESS ATTRACTIVE TO NEW HOME BUYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Major lenders nationwide, reacting to the Federal Reserve Board's latest move 
to tighten credit, cut rates on their fixed mortgages Wednesday while raising 
rates on adjustable loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves, which make fixed-rate mortgages more attractive to new home buyers 
and to those refinancing their loans, could trigger a resurgence in the 
fixed-mortgage market, which had recently begun to lose ground to 
adjustable-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fixed rates have definitely gotten more attractive in just the past week," 
said Earl Peattie, president of Mortgage News Co. in Santa Ana. "If you're 
going to spend some time in the same home, a fixed-rate mortgage looks 
increasingly viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what happened at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank. On Wednesday, 
Wells Fargo cut the rate on its fixed-rate loan to 8.5% from 8.65%. But it 
hiked charges for a popular adjustable loan product -- the so-called one-year, 
T-bill ARM -- dramatically. The initial rate on this loan soared to 6.75% from 
6.25% the day before.  
</P>
<P>
 Such a narrowing of the "spread" between fixed and adjustable rates could -- 
if sustained -- reverse the trend that caused adjustable loans to surge in 
popularity during the first several months of 1994. Adjustable mortgages 
snapped up more than 40% of the market by the end of May, compared to 25% of 
the market in December. Fixed loans, forever the darling of home finance, still 
account for about 57% of the loans originated. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising popularity of adjustable loans was spurred when fixed loan rates 
started to rise at the beginning of the year. Adjustable loan rates rose too, 
but not as steeply. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The spread between fixed and adjustable loans hit an all-time high 
in April, with rates on ARMs 3.45 percentage points lower, on average, than 
rates on comparable fixed-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of Wednesday, that trend appeared to be put in reverse as lenders cut 
charges for fixed loans and either held the line on ARM rates or boosted them 
dramatically. At Countrywide Credit, a Pasadena-based mortgage banking firm, 
fixed mortgage rates dropped a quarter of a percentage point to 8.65% from 
8.875%, while ARM rates stayed constant. Home Savings of America and Great 
Western Bank, two of the nation's biggest thrifts, cut interest charges on 
their 30-year fixed-rate loans by 10 basis points -- or a tenth of one 
percentage point.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither thrift has yet boosted ARM rates, but such hikes are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, average fixed mortgage rates slipped Wednesday to 8.75% from 8.79% 
the week before, while adjustable loans climbed to 5.81% from 5.76% the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wouldn't rates on both types of mortgages go in the same direction at the 
same time? Because adjustable loan rates are affected by swings in short-term 
interest rates; they're frequently tied to one-year Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But fixed mortgages move in concert with the long-term bond market, which is 
swayed by inflation fears more than current interest rates. And the Fed's 
strong interest rate boost, which caused banks' prime rates to soar to 7.75% 
from 7.25%, soothed inflation fears that had been building since the economy 
began to gain steam in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silver lining in all this is that the market is very impressed with how 
aggressively the Fed raised rates," said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist 
with Wells Fargo Bank. "And that's increased the Fed's inflation-fighting 
credentials."

FELONY CHARGES ARE FILED OVER PORN CACHE AT LIVERMORE LAB; CRIME: A RECENT 
EMPLOYEE IS ACCUSED OF COMPUTER SERVICES THEFT. A FORMER CO-WORKER FACES MINOR 
COUNTS.

 The Alameda County district attorney filed felony charges against a Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory employee Wednesday, alleging that he used lab 
computers to store and distribute pornography. A second employee faces lesser 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The pornography cache, initially discovered by a Times reporter, contained 
90,000 images, according to John Bell, the assistant district attorney. The 
images allegedly were stored on lab computer tapes and loaded onto on-line 
systems by one of the two defendants. They could then be retrieved by others 
via the Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 William Allen Danforth, a technician who worked in the Computer Applications 
Sciences and Engineering division of the lab, faces two felony charges of theft 
of computer services. Livermore officials confirmed that Danforth resigned Aug. 
15; he could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the guy hadn't been using the taxpayers' computer for his personal 
interest in pornography, he wouldn't be prosecuted," Bell said, adding that the 
lab spent more than $13,000 to conduct an internal investigation. "Because of 
the nature of the work they do at the lab, they had no choice but to do a 
thorough cleansing of their computer system to see just what this guy was 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The facility at Livermore, southeast of San Francisco, is one of the nation's 
three nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Wednesday, the lab said its own investigation concluded "that 
(Danforth) had arranged for computer data storage and access that facilitated 
software copyright violations and publication of sexually explicit images by a 
select group of Internet users. Most of the images were of adults; however, 
much less than 1% involved children." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell would not say whether additional charges relating to child pornography 
might be brought. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 gigabytes of porn -- far more than originally reported -- was 
ultimately uncovered, and sources said that as many as 20 collaborators inside 
and outside the lab may have been involved in obtaining and trading the images. 
Questions about individual roles and whether money was paid for access were 
still being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Tartar, acting director of the lab, said in the statement that he had 
ordered a review of computer use, management and oversight systems to prevent 
future abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael William Lazzarini, a computer technologist who reportedly worked for 
Danforth, was charged with infractions -- offenses on the scale of a traffic 
ticket. He is accused of collaborating with Danforth to operate the porn 
database. Lazzarini, reached by phone at the lab Wednesday afternoon, said, "I 
have nothing to say about this incident at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, prepared Wednesday by the district attorney's office, were to 
have been announced Friday to allow lab officials time to make personnel 
decisions. Sources said calls from angry officials at the Department of Energy 
in Washington, which oversees the lab's operations, speeded up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab was embarrassed when the porn cache was discovered last month. The 
case highlights security problems that have arisen with the rapid growth of the 
Internet, which connects government, academic and business computers around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Danforth could face a maximum sentence of three years in state 
prison and a fine of $10,000 for each of the two felony counts.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON INDONESIA; TURNING OVER A GREEN LEAF; 
INDONESIAN FIRMS CASH IN ON ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS

 Jakarta businessman Didi Rasyidi has a hot product. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sole Indonesian licensee of solar panels from Hawthorne-based Solec 
International, Rasyidi has found an eager customer in the Indonesian 
government, which is snapping up the panels to provide a renewable source of 
power for remote villages that have yet to be reached by the state electric 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is . . . in every small town, people could buy a packaged solar 
system with cash," said Rasyidi, whose PT Altari company is heading toward $3.5 
million in annual sales. But his is not the only firm here dreaming of cashing 
in on a new environmental awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia, long considered the bad boy of the international "green" movement, 
has blossomed into a promising market for environmental goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with new satellite photos and other disturbing proof of environmental 
degradation, the government is moving with fresh vigor to rein in the 
destruction of the nation's tropical rain forests, protect its coral reefs, 
cleanse its rivers, utilize renewable energy sources and promote recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to revising environmental regulations, banning the import of toxic 
waste and clarifying rules on environmental impact studies for new investments, 
officials are anxious to tap the private sector to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is necessary to introduce sufficient economic motives to protect 
the environment," says State Minister for Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja. " 
. . . People should see a vested interest in preserving and protecting the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia's Environmental Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL) has obtained $120 
million in loan funds from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund to help 
implement a program to clean up 24 of the nation's most polluted rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-interest loans and technical expertise will be provided to companies in 
polluting industries as an incentive to add safeguards such as waste water 
treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies are proceeding without government help. PT Texmaco Jaya, one of 
Indonesia's largest textile producers, plans to build a $1-million treatment 
plant at one of its factories. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, part of a $450-million expansion, will complement an "aerated 
lagoon" already in operation at Texmaco's West Java polyester factory, which 
churns out water clean enough to irrigate rice fields downstream along the 
Citarum River. At least two other textile factories in the area have also begun 
constructing treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is concerned now," said Yani Witjaksono, president of Yayasan 
Bina Usaha Lingkungan, a foundation that provides funding and technical 
assistance to environmental entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact of pollution does not only affect the community, but it affects 
other industries as well. In east Java, for example, the waste from the wood 
industry can destroy a shrimp farm," Witjaksono said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the family of President Suharto has gotten involved in anti-pollution 
efforts. In May, PT Bimantara Citra, a conglomerate controlled by one of the 
president's sons, helped launched Indonesia's first hazardous and toxic waste 
disposal facility, a joint venture with U.S.-based Waste Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're doing quite well, said Patrick Heininger, president of PT Waste 
Management Indonesia.  
</P>
<P>
 The disposal facility has 55 customers -- at least half of them companies with 
foreign partners. Customers represent the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, 
fertilizer and pesticide industries, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The disposal plant needs some 200 customers for the plant, which will 
ultimately cost $100 million, to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 Heininger said the company will offer industry relatively inexpensive disposal 
services. But to dissuade companies from turning to an even cheaper disposal 
outlet -- the river -- local officials in the industrial zones ringing Jakarta 
have invited factory managers to industry-specific seminars on safe disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will eventually be expanded to other areas of the country where 
three more toxic waste facilities are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of Indonesia's traditionally weak and corrupt legal system, the 
government plans to supplement legal measures with the tool of public exposure 
of the "good guys and bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
 BAPEDAL plans to begin publicizing ratings of companies according to how 
responsible they are to the environment. To turn up he heat, it also plans to 
publicize information showing whether support banks and other financial 
institutions back responsible or irresponsible companies. 
</P>
<P>
 PT Freeport Indonesia, the giant copper- and gold-mining concern long targeted 
by environmentalists for allegedly irresponsible practices in the Irian Jaya 
province, promptly volunteered to be rated. "We think we're doing the right 
thing and have nothing to hide," Executive Vice President Paul Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, Freeport will undergo an environmental audit, conducted by 
an outside firm chosen with government consultation. Sarwono has proposed that 
other major companies submit to voluntary audits every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned observers here caution that Indonesia's environmental efforts may be 
limited. For the most part, the country's abundant national resources remain in 
the hands of an elite few, long cushioned from domestic and international 
criticism by political connections. And for all its professed good intentions, 
the government has relatively few resources to police this immense archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 But overseas financial institutions may prove of assistance to the government. 
As Indonesian companies go offshore for capital, their environmental records 
are coming under increasing scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, for example, PT Indah Kiat was fined for environmental 
violations at its pulp and paper plant in Sumatra. The parent firm, Sinar Mas 
Group, faced sharp questions from its American bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinar Mas replied that an intermediary was responsible for the violation. "We 
have to practice good environmental management, insisted PT Indah Kiat's public 
relations officer, Purnama Kusumaningrat.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're under pressure," he said, noting that the company has dropped chlorine 
bleaching in favor of a less harmful method.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: SOFTWARE IS MOST SIGNIFICANT LOSS IN FIRM'S 
DEMISE

 The impending bankruptcy of Thinking Machines Corp., the technically brilliant 
supercomputing company, recalls venture capital's marvelously cynical cliche: 
"The earliest Christians got the best lions." By that standard, the Cambridge, 
Mass.-based parallel-processing pioneer qualifies as a particularly tasty 
martyr. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by an MIT prodigy, weaned on defense funding and championing a 
radically new architecture for high-performance computers, Thinking Machines 
was the first company to demonstrate the viability of massively parallel 
computing. Founder Danny Hillis' essential idea was that a computer with 
thousands of processors could, like a swarm of hungry piranha, nibble a large 
problem to death far faster than a giant single processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, getting tens of thousands of piranha processors to work in parallel 
is a tremendous feat of computer architecture. But Thinking Machines did it -- 
and redefined fundamental ideas on how computers should be designed. As 
technology, it was revolutionary. As an entrepreneurial business, it was a 
flop. The bankruptcy lions got their snack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now popular in the Thinking Machines eulogies to comment on the irony of 
the technology succeeding even as the company failed. What's more, there's a 
consensus that Thinking Machines was an important company whose legacy lies in 
the parallel-processing paradigms it leaves behind. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may not be the case. As much of a breakthrough in hardware 
architecture that a massively parallel computer represents, the real legacy of 
Thinking Machines may rest in the software it created for its Connection 
Machines. A decade hence, people will look back at Thinking Machines and see 
the birth of a whole new set of approaches to advanced concepts of computer 
science such as genetic algorithms and artificial life. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hillis launched Thinking Machines saying he wanted to build a computer 
"that would be proud of me." And for nearly 10 years he has been using his 
machines as a medium to model artificial life. He's developed software that in 
turn grows other software through the process of Darwin-like natural selection. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of "piranha" processors and brilliant software, the piranhas 
can be given their own "genetic" characteristics and then set off to live with 
one another. Over time, perhaps, the traits of individual piranhas will change, 
or maybe the way piranhas act as a group will change. The computer software -- 
indeed, the computer itself -- can thus evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to conceive of traditional supercomputers, even the most 
powerful of them, acting in this way. Until you had the massively parallel 
infrastructure of a Thinking Machines computer, you simply couldn't conceive of 
supporting a large population of replicating software life forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an idea whose time is actually overdue," Hillis said recently. "It's 
scary for a lot of people, particularly in programming. . . . This whole 
technique goes against the notion that we design and build our software. It's 
like we turn the keys of the car over to nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Artificial life has become one of the hottest and most important research 
areas in all of computerdom. It's also evolving into a business as Wall Street 
companies and traders try to evolve trading strategies by breeding them on the 
computers through genetic algorithms. The fittest software survives to trade 
another day; the rest are "selected out." Other industries are using genetic 
algorithms to design product parts and grow new patterns of useful data. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the so-called A-life community today either uses Connection Machines 
as the media for genetic software engineering or the software concepts 
originally tested by Hillis. In "Out of Control," A-life commentator Kein Kelly 
describes the work of Thinking Machines' Karl Sims in his efforts to breed new 
kinds of pictures and images: 
</P>
<P>
 "The mathematical logic of breeding pictures is indistinguishable from the 
mathematical logic of breeding pigeons," Kelly wrote. "Conceptually, the two 
processes are equivalent. Although we may call it artificial evolution, there 
is nothing about it that is more or less artificial than breeding dachshunds. 
Both methods are equally artificial (of the art) and natural (true to nature)." 
</P>
<P>
 Will the legacy of Thinking Machines lie in new ways of designing computers it 
inspired -- or in the new ways of creating artificial life? If we just look at 
an architecture without evaluating the way it influences creativity and 
behavior, we risk missing the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Thomas Alva Edison, America's greatest single inventor. People 
remember Edison for the invention of the light bulb. In reality, the Wizard of 
Menlo Park's most significant breakthrough was the invention of the electric 
utility grid that lights up all those light bulbs and electrical devices. A 
light bulb without the infrastructure is just a technical novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the most obvious part of Thinking Machines is its thinking 
machines. But what we also have is the obituary of the company whose software 
will eventually create multibillion-dollar industries in artificial life.

AMERICAN CYANAMID CONSENTS TO TAKEOVER; PHARMACEUTICALS: ACQUISITION COMES 
AFTER RIVAL AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS SWEETENS DEAL TO $9.7 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ending a two-week hostile takeover struggle, American Cyanamid Co. consented 
Wednesday to be acquired by drug industry competitor American Home Products 
Corp. in a $9.7-billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger -- the second-largest ever in the U.S. drug industry -- brings 
together the makers of such products as Advil, Anacin, Robitussin and the 
Norplant contraceptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the $12.5 billion in revenue for the combined firm will come from a 
broad line of products, including consumer health goods, agricultural 
chemicals, surgical devices and food brands such as Chef Boyardee spaghetti and 
Gulden's mustard. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder will come from prescription drugs, an industry that in the past 
year has been involved in a flurry of consolidations in an effort to better 
cope with medical cost cutting and health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few weeks, American Home, based in Madison, N.J., has twice 
sweetened its buyout offer to Cyanamid shareholders, resulting in the 
$101-a-share cash offer approved by directors of both companies. The price is 
about $600 million more than American Home's initial bid of $95 a share offered 
Aug. 2 and about 60% more than Cyanamid shares were trading for in early 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the inevitability of being acquired by someone after American 
Home's first bid, Cyanamid management reportedly tried unsuccessfully to find a 
"white knight," or a friendly buyer that would offer terms more to Cyanamid's 
liking.

 Its cool response to American Home raised the ire of some shareholders, who 
filed six lawsuits against the Wayne, N.J.-based firm in state court in New 
Jersey. The suits claim that Cyanamid management did not act in the 
shareholders' best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyanamid's board, Chairman and Chief Executive Albert Costello said in a 
statement, concluded that "a combination of the two companies would maximize 
value for our stockholders and lead to the creation of a highly competitive 
participant in our markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of American Home Products rose 37.5 cents to $59.25 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Wednesday, while Cyanamid shares jumped $2.125 to $96.125 on 
the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Chairman John Stafford said the merger "will result in a 
stronger company, better situated to compete in the rapidly evolving health 
care marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation has become commonplace in a number of recent drug industry 
deals, as firms seek ways to cope with demands by managed-care companies, such 
as health maintenance organizations, and by a growing number of government and 
private employers, to cut their prices. Drug makers are also concerned about 
the prospect of federal health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar concerns were cited by Eli Lilly & Co. when it bought PCS Health 
Systems, a drug benefit management firm, from McKesson Corp. for $4 billion in 
July. And Merck & Co. was responding to the same market forces when it acquired 
Medco Containment Services, a mail-order drug firm and drug benefit manager, 
for $6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest drug industry merger was Bristol-Myer's $12.1-billion purchase of 
Squibb in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said both American Home and Cyanamid suffer from a dearth of new, 
potentially profitable drugs making their way to market. Both companies are 
also coping with competition from lower-cost generic drugs as U.S. patent 
protection on existing drugs expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the merger, by creating a company with a broad product 
line, enhances its marketplace clout with managed-care companies. Managed-care 
firms also often prefer to deal with a smaller number of suppliers rather than 
many suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 But others saw little positive in the deal. Hemant Shaw, an independent drug 
analyst in Warren, N.J., said the merger "does not give (managed-care firms) 
what they are looking for, which is innovative drugs and lower prices. . . . A 
broad portfolio isn't that critical." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Shaw said American Home could achieve significant savings by slashing 
costs. He said he expects significant job cuts as American Home moves to 
eliminate redundant jobs in administration, marketing and other areas.

 County Film Director Fired: Stephanie Hershey Liner, director of the Los 
Angeles County Film Office, was abruptly fired after she sent the city of Los 
Angeles a report on the pros and cons of merging her department with its city 
counterpart. Liner said her opinions were requested by Keith Comrie, the city's 
chief administrative officer.She had been in the position since October, 
working to persuade the film and television industries to remain in the area. 
Liner said she was suspended Monday night and told there would be an 
investigation into her actions, then told the next day she was out of a job. 
Bill Kreger, a veteran county executive with no film industry experience, was 
named interim replacement. Gary Conley, president of the Economic Development 
Corp., the private, nonprofit agency that runs the county film office, refused 
to comment on Liner's dismissal, but a city-county film office merger could 
deprive the EDC of revenue.

SOUTHLAND COMPUTER MAKERS MAY LABEL KEYBOARDS; CONSUMERS: SOME FIRMS ARE 
CONSIDERING THE MOVE TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY FROM 
REPETITIVE STRESS. 
</P>

 Compaq Computer Corp.'s announcement that it will put labels on its keyboards 
warning of possible hand and wrist injuries has prompted manufacturers and 
distributors in Southern California to weigh whether they should follow 
Compaq's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a growing number of product liability lawsuits linked to the use of 
computers, some companies that make and sell keyboards said Wednesday that they 
are studying ways to call customers' attention to the potential for injury from 
repetitive stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When keyboards first came out, we weren't aware of carpal tunnel syndrome," a 
painful wrist condition, said Rebecca Cradick, a spokeswoman for Toshiba 
America Inc.'s Information Systems Division in Irvine. "Now that it's out 
there, we'd want to warn (customers) about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no nationwide tally of liability suits involving computers, 
the number is growing, said Robert Komitor, a partner at Levi, Phillips & 
Konigsberg in New York. His firm represents about 1,000 plaintiffs who say they 
have keyboard-related injuries. The suits are divided among about 100 
manufacturers nationwide, Komitor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among corporations involved in such litigation is AST Research Inc., the 
country's fifth-largest maker of personal computers. AST, based in Irvine, 
stated in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April that it 
faced 11 lawsuits alleging that its products caused carpal tunnel syndrome or 
other repetitive stress injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 An AST spokesman said Wednesday that it cannot comment on the issue while 
lawsuits are pending except to say that it is aware of Compaq's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq, the leading seller of personal computers, said Tuesday that it will 
begin putting this notice on its keyboards: "Warning! To Reduce Risk of Serious 
Injury to Hands, Wrists or Other Joints, Read Safety & Comfort Guide." 
Microsoft Corp. also said it will place notices on some of its keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Compaq is a very prudent firm," said William J. Milton, an analyst who 
follows computer companies for the brokerage Brown Bros. Harriman in New York. 
"I could see where others would follow because they have nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton said he doubts that warning labels will affect the sales of Compaq or 
any other computer maker. "We simply can't do without these machines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Toshiba said Wednesday that the company might begin 
including with its notebook computers "usage manuals" covering topics such as 
proper posture and hand and wrist positions when using the computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, however, have no plan of action yet. Advanced Logic Research 
Inc., a computer manufacturer based in Irvine, said it does not face any 
keyboard liability lawsuits and doesn't anticipate doing anything to head them 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the liability suits filed against manufacturers are unfair, said Dave 
Kirkey, the company's vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how to keep that keyboard on your desk or how you should sit 
or at what distance from the keyboard you should sit," Kirkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Capretz, a Newport Beach lawyer who has handled a number of product 
liability cases, said that although warning labels and manuals are no guarantee 
against lawsuits, they might help in defending such a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're warned of a danger for a product, then the standard (defense) is, 
'You should have known,' " said Capretz, who was involved in winning a 
$26-million settlement for recipients of potentially fatal artificial heart 
valves manufactured by Shiley Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Gary Schwartz said that merely putting a warning label on a 
product "doesn't relieve the manufacturer of the responsibility of having a 
safe design."

 Litton Industries Adopts 'Poison Pill': The Beverly Hills-based maker of 
defense electronics and Navy ships will distribute share-purchase rights Aug. 
31 to its stockholders of record on that date.The rights plan is dubbed a 
poison pill because it is designed to ward off unwelcome takeover bids. It 
would allow its shareholders to buy additional Litton stock at a steep discount 
and thus make any unwanted takeover effort prohibitively expensive. Most big 
U.S. companies already have poison pills in place. Litton said its pill, which 
is effective once a hostile party acquires 15% of its shares, was not taken in 
response to a particular offer. "We have not been approached by anyone," a 
spokeswoman said.

 Bill Would Let Workers Sue Over Harassment: Legislation in the House proposes 
giving workers the right to sue employers over sexual harassment and other 
disputes instead of having to go to arbitration. Rep. Patricia Schroeder 
(D-Colo.), a co-sponsor, said the bill was partly prompted by "disturbing 
reports about the handling of sexual harassment by the securities industry." 
She said the bill would amend seven federal laws, including the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, to prevent employers from forcing workers to resolve discrimination 
claims through arbitration.

 Oil Imports Set Record in July: U.S. imports of crude oil and its derivatives 
toppled a 17-year-old record last month, though overall demand for petroleum 
products declined. The import level, reported by the American Petroleum 
Institute, illustrates a well-established trend in the U.S. economy: Business 
and individuals are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil.Taken 
together, imports of crude oil and petroleum products in July, at an average of 
10.059 million barrels daily, were up 9.1% from the previous July, according to 
the API, the trade group for major U.S.-based oil companies. Imports last month 
accounted for about 58% of domestic demand, another record. It was also the 
first time imports exceeded the level of 10 million barrels a day.UNITED STA

 Video Phone Promoter Charged With Fraud: The Orange County defendant, who 
continued soliciting investors after he was jailed for contempt of court, was 
charged with 30 counts of criminal fraud and money laundering. The federal 
grand jury indictment, handed down in Los Angeles, alleges that Michael 
Gartner, 32, masterminded a $12-million securities fraud by selling hundreds of 
shares in a nonexistent video phone system he said would link major business 
centers in Los Angeles and Orange counties.Gartner, who used infomercials and 
phone solicitations, allegedly once showed a TV audience an empty cabinet 
covered with blinking lights that he said was a working prototype of a 
"photonic switch" developed by his Costa Mesa-based Interlink Data Network. 
Neither Gartner nor his attorney could be reached for comment.

 U.S. Expands Genentech Probe: The federal government is widening its 
investigation into questionable marketing practices by the company to sell its 
growth drug for children, a congressional official said.The Food and Drug 
Administration has said it was probing Genentech Inc., a large South San 
Francisco-based bio-pharmaceuticals firm, and the Federal Trade Commission has 
been asked to look into the company's marketing practices. A House 
subcommittee, which is investigating Genentech as well as the practices of a 
charitable foundation linked to the firm, plans hearings later this year. A 
member of the panel's staff noted questions about kickbacks of tens of 
thousands of dollars allegedly paid to at least one doctor for prescribing 
Protropin.

 China Calls for Accurate Reporting: The Communist Party acknowledged that 
false reporting of economic statistics is widespread and, warning of dire 
consequences, called for an end to the practice.Western economists have long 
been aware of the problem, and Chinese officials have privately admitted that 
their figures often do not reflect actual conditions. In recent months, Chinese 
newspapers have begun reporting on the problem. But the front-page editorial in 
the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, was the first 
official acknowledgment of the practice. The central bank, the People's Bank of 
China, issued a landmark report last month that noted that accurate, detailed 
statistics were essential for inspiring confidence in China's economic 
policies.

INTERACTIVE NETWORK STRUGGLES TO AVOID GOING OUT OF BUSINESS; TECHNOLOGY: 
FLEDGLING VENTURE BY THE TV ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY HAS TURNED INTO A HUGE 
FINANCIAL DRAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interactive Network Inc., the interactive TV company that has ridden the high 
expectations of the information superhighway, has disclosed to federal 
regulators that it could go out of business unless it can raise money soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose-based company made the disclosure earlier this week in a filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. IN said it was negotiating to 
obtain the funds to continue but that failure to do so would force it "to 
significantly curtail or cease operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after making its filing with the SEC, the firm announced it had 
obtained a $500,000 bridge loan from two of its shareholders, cable TV giant 
Tele-Communications Inc. and NBC. Analysts, however, said that at the rate IN 
is burning cash, the money from the loan won't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third such loan IN has received from its shareholders since April. 
</P>
<P>
 IN markets a hand-held device that allows subscribers to play along in "real 
time" with sports, game and entertainment shows. Since 1991, when the firm 
began testing its interactive system in Sacramento, it has introduced the 
service in San Francisco, Chicago and South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cost of testing and implementing IN's system has been enormous. Since 
the company went public nearly four years ago, it has reported cumulative 
losses of $66.8 million. Over the same period, it has brought in revenue of 
only $2,081,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutdown of IN would be a setback for the nascent interactive TV industry, 
which to date has yet to find a success it can trumpet. It also illustrates the 
enormous risks involved for entrepreneurs seeking to crack a market that does 
not yet exist. 
</P>
<P>
 IN is headed by David Lockton, a former sports attorney who once represented 
O.J. Simpson. (Simpson appeared in infomercials for IN that were pulled after 
his arraignment on murder charges.) Lockton founded the company in 1988 and 
raised $15.4 million in a 1991 stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockton has also financed IN by making private placements with strategic 
investors, raising more than $66 million since its IPO. Last year he sold 15% 
of the company for $10 million to TCI and has also raised money by selling 
stakes to NBC, Gannett and A.C. Nielsen Co. TCI, the largest shareholder, now 
controls about 17% of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts have had a difficult time figuring out just how successful the test 
of IN's interactive system has been. The company said that as of the end of 
1993 -- the latest period for which it will disclose figures -- it had signed 
up 5,100 subscribers in its test markets so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Although IN has insisted that the "take up" rate for its interactive system 
compares favorably to, for example, VCRs in the early days, analysts have been 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a flawed strategy," contended Taurun Chandra, an analyst with 
Laidlaw Securities. "IN went after the home market from its inception. The 
problem there is they had to develop the home market for interactive 
programming, and that's an expensive proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to revive its marketing efforts, IN earlier this year brought in 
Peter Sealey as president and chief operating officer. Sealey, a former  
</P>
<P>
 marketing executive at Coca-Cola and Columbia Pictures, immediately set about 
changing the company's marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously IN was charging about $200 for its remote-control interactive unit 
and another $15 a month in subscription fees. IN is now testing a marketing 
plan where customers rent, rather than pay for, the remote-control units.

 USAir Pilots Say Agreement Likely by Year-End: At a forum to build support for 
a proposed employee-aided restructuring plan among pilots and other employees, 
union leaders said criticism from the company and other unions was posturing as 
a negotiating tactic. Pilots union leaders also said recent USAir criticisms of 
the plan did not constitute rejection. The union has proposed a restructuring 
that would swap $2.5 billion in labor cuts for 25% of USAir's common shares, 
$700 million in preferred shares and changes in the company's board to allow 
union representation.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MARKETS MIXED AS TRADERS ASSESS IMPACT OF RATE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds closed mixed Wednesday as investors searched for winners and 
losers in the wake of the Federal Reserve Board's latest interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials eased 8.09 points to 3,776.48, but 
other indexes were mostly higher. Trading was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields, meanwhile, rose slightly after tumbling 
Tuesday in a relief rally sparked by the Fed rate increase. The 30-year T-bond 
yield inched up to 7.40% from 7.36% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the municipal bond market, California got a fairly warm reception as it 
sold $700 million in general obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market supplied most of the fireworks Wednesday, though they 
were in individual stocks rather than broad indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Dow eased, another powerful rally in technology stocks lifted the 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks 7.15 points to 742.66, highest 
since early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said smaller stocks attracted buyers who figure the Fed's latest 
half-point hike in short-term interest rates will succeed in slowing the 
economy. Under that scenario, earnings growth of big companies might slow, 
forcing investors to hunt for growth among smaller "niche" firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, profit-taking hit some economy-sensitive industrial stocks 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, winners topped losers by 12 to 10 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and investors' heightened interest was evident in heavy trading 
volume of 313 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury bond market was weaker, as buyers failed to materialize to follow 
through on Tuesday's rally. Yields had slumped on the expectation that the 
Fed's increase in short rates will slow economic growth and thus reduce the 
threat of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But "it remains to be seen whether investors will now put cash to work" in 
bonds, said Kathleen Camilli, economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, demand was healthy Wednesday for California's $700 million offering of 
general obligation bonds, and the tax-free yields were lower than expected. 
Most of the bonds carried private insurance to make them more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said three-year issues in the California bond offering yielded 4.5% 
annualized, five-year issues yielded 5%, 10-year were at 5.45% and 30-year at 
6.15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Key foreign markets rallied, following U.S. shares higher. In London, the 
FTSE-100 index surged 43.0 points to 3,190.30, while Paris' CAC index rose 
22.63 points to 2,034.98 and Frankfurt's DAX index gained 19.15 points to 
2,162.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei-225 index added 38.20 points to 20,824.56 and Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng index leaped 171.35 points to 9,537.97. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican stocks also continued to advance, with the Bolsa index up 5.05 
points to 2,699.65. And in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Bovespa stock index rocketed 
4.7% on rising optimism that the markets' favorite candidate, Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, will win the presidential election in October. 
</P>
<P>
 * In U.S. trading, tech stocks leading the Nasdaq market higher included 
Intel, up 2 3/16 to 63 3/4; Adobe Systems, up 1 5/8 to 33 5/8; Dell Computer, 
up 2 7/16 to 35 1/2; Oracle Systems, up 1 1/8 to 39 7/8, and 3Com, up 2 1/4 to 
58 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But CompUSA fell 1 1/2 to 7 3/8. The computer retailer reported a 
bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the takeover rumor mill, new talk of a bid for Eli Lilly sent that stock 
up 3 to 57 1/2. Other drug stock winners included Bristol-Myers, up 7/8 to 58 
1/8; Pfizer, up 1/2 to 67 1/4, and Amgen, up 1 3/16 to 54 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other health care stocks, Medtronic leaped 6 5/8 to 96 3/4 after the 
pacemaker manufacturer reported sharply higher quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors continued to snap up other classic growth stocks, whose stable 
earnings growth may look more appealing if the economy slows. Coca-Cola, for 
example, rose 1/2 to 46 1/8. It was helped by investor Warren Buffett's 
announcement that he bought 4.9 million shares in July. His stake now is 99.8 
million shares or 7.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other growth issues gaining included Toys R Us, up 1 1/8 to 36 7/8; and 
Colgate-Palmolive, 5/8 to 55 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, some industrial issues slid. GE fell 5/8 to 47 7/8, 
International Paper lost 1 1/4 to 71 7/8, Union Carbide dropped 7/8 to 32 3/8 
and Dow Chemical fell 1 3/8 to 69 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, IDB Communications surged 3/4 to 9 7/16. The stock 
was pulled up as shares of LDDS Communications, which previously agreed to buy 
IDB in a stock swap, rocketed 2 1/4 to 24 on rumors that General Motors' EDS 
unit bid for LDDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, IDB said it expects to post a second-quarter loss stemming in part 
from a change in accounting policies. The company had been criticized for 
booking international long-distance revenue before it was received.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON INDONESIA; THE INDONESIAN ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republic of Indonesia, which once relied on oil as its chief asset, has 
worked hard to diversify its economy since oil prices began tumbling in the 
early 1980s. Those efforts have begun to pay off. The agriculture and service 
sectors have shown growth and manufacturing is growing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 ECONOMY: In the past decade, Indonesia has experienced growth in gross 
domestic product similar to the fast pace of growth in other Southeast Asia 
nations. But growth has been uneven throughout the country, which is spread out 
over almost 13,700 islands. Inflation, which declined significantly in the late 
1980s, has been creeping up again in recent years. The rupiah, the Indonesian 
currency, has fallen about 20% against the dollar in the last five years to 
2,160 rupiahs to the dollar. In 1989, the average was 1,770 rupiahs to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 INFRASTRUCTURE: Rapid economic development in the late 1980s put a strain on 
Indonesia's infrastructure. Since then, the government has been made major 
investments in infrastructure and development, spending about 35% of the 
budget. Areas targeted include, electric power, communications, transportation 
and education. 
</P>
<P>
 LABOR FORCE: With 184 million people, Indonesia is the fourth most populous 
country in the world. About half of its population is under age 20. Labor costs 
are extremely low -- the average daily wage last year was $1.50 -- but the work 
force is poorly trained. Only 22% of the the total population has completed 
elementary school and there is shortage of workers with management and 
technical skills. 
</P>
<P>
 TRADE: Oil has traditionally been Indonesia's principal export, and energy 
products -- like petroleum and natural gas -- are still among the country's 
major exports. Exports of wood, wood products and textiles are also prominent. 
The nation imports machinery, transport and electrical equipment and chemical 
and mineral products. Japan is Indonesia's principal trading partner, supplying 
nearly one quarter of all imports and absorbing 43% of all exports. The United 
States, Singapore, Germany, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea are other major 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 AGRICULTURE: With its rich, volcanic soil and hot, wet climate, Java, 
Indonesia's largest island, is one of the most fertile areas in the world and 
nealy half -- 47.6% -- of all workers are employed in agriculture. Principal 
cash crops include coffee, sugar cane, tea, coconuts and tobacco. Indonesia is 
also the world's second largest producer of palm oil and natural rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 MANUFACTURING: Manufacturing is the fastest-growing sector of the Indonesian 
economy, with an average growth of 12.5% per year between 1980 and 1990. 
Petroleum refineries are a major part of Indonesia's manufacturing base. Other 
main industries include textiles, food products, tobacco, chemicals and wood 
products. But Indonesia is still a major exporter of raw, unprocessed 
materials, so the country is vulnerable to any major slowdown in the 
industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
 SERVICES: Indonesia's service sector is large and growing, employing 30.5% of 
the labor force in 1990. Tourism -- including revenue from hotels and 
restaurants -- is one of the country's principal sources of foreign exchange. 
As Indonesia improves its infrastructure and draws more foreign investment, the 
service sector -- already growing 6.7% per year -- is expected to boom.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON INDONESIA; AFTER YEARS OF REHEARSAL, A 
GLOBAL ROLE; ECONOMY: THE WORLD'S FOURTH-MOST- POPULOUS COUNTRY HAS SOLID 
GROWTH, POLITICAL STABILITY IN ITS FAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This nation of islands is a very large country with a very low profile. Known 
in the past mainly as an exporter of oil, its only other claim to fame has been 
the unique charms of the holiday island of Bali. 
</P>
<P>
 But things are about to change. After decades of solid economic growth and 
political stability, the world's fourth-most-populous country is emerging onto 
the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year, the first Indonesian company will make an appearance on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Indosat, the state-owned international 
telecommunications and satellite operator, will sell more than $1 billion worth 
of shares to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock sale will launch Indonesia's privatization program. Plans are to 
eventually sell off such jewels in the state crown as Pertimina, the national 
oil company; the airline Garuda, and more utilities and industrial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Indonesia's top business executives and government ministers will 
promote the Indosat sale in a series of roadshows, which will raise the 
nation's profile in the world financial community. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia, a country of 189 million and one of Asia's fast-growing "tigers," 
will receive wider exposure in November when Jakarta hosts the annual meeting 
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, to be attended by President 
Clinton, more than a dozen other heads of state and thousands of businessmen, 
journalists and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, Indonesia's economy has maintained a growth rate of 
between 5% and 7% annually, pushing gross domestic product to $122 billion. It 
has grown while lessening its dependence on oil with an aggressive 
export-oriented economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though oil still provides 30% of export revenue, Indonesia's exports of 
manufactured goods such as textiles, electronics, toys and wood products have 
grown rapidly in recent years -- about 12% a year until worldwide recession 
slowed demand in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investors from countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong 
and the United States have helped fuel Indonesia's export growth. For example, 
U.S. athletic wear manufacturers Nike and Reebok have moved factories from 
higher-wage, more developed North Asian economies to Indonesia, where wages 
remain below $2 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia has attracted about $20 billion a year in foreign investment over 
the past four years, despite heavy competition for foreign capital from China, 
India and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic deregulation in Indonesia has encouraged foreign investment. With the 
help of a group of UC Berkeley-educated technocrats who have run the economy 
since President Suharto took power in the mid-1960s, deregulation has spurred 
rapid growth in financial services, among other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners may now own 100% equity in local companies, and a larger group of 
industries -- telecommunications, aviation and shipping among them -- have been 
opened to foreign participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Asian countries, Indonesia has found that even with hefty foreign 
borrowing of more than $90 billion, it will not be able to keep pace with the 
country's infrastructure needs unless the private sector is allowed to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor riots over low pay earlier this year and pressure from the United States 
on human rights have made the government conscious of the need for even faster 
growth. Washington has threatened trade sanctions -- affecting about $640 
million in exports to the United States -- unless Indonesia allows workers to 
form and freely join labor unions. The country now has only one officially 
sanctioned union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are discussing workers' rights and problems with human resources with the 
Indonesians and we understand the progress made so far," Winston Lord, 
assistant U.S. secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said on a 
visit to Jakarta this month. "Both sides know more needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 As Suharto nears the end of his almost 30 years in power, a fairer sharing of 
wealth is becoming an issue in Indonesia's more open political climate, which 
has replaced strict military rule in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 APEC visitors to Jakarta will find a city of glitzy skyscrapers, smart hotels 
and modern homes. But those who look more closely will easily spot the shacks 
of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Per-capita gross domestic product is $645 -- higher than China's but still 
only a twentieth of Singapore's. Government planners hope to achieve a 
per-capita GDP of $1,000 by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Upgrading the status of the 30 million people who still live at the lowest 
level of society remains Indonesia's greatest challenge after 25 years of 
economic development.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON INDONESIA; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE ...

<TEXT>
<P>
 Indonesia is rapidly developing its economy, partly by increasing foreign 
investment and foreign business contacts. It is the world's largest Islamic 
nation, and religion -- as well as some unique cultural traditions -- influence 
how business is conducted. DO 
</P>
<P>
 * In planning business appointments and business entertainment, be aware of 
religious requirements, such as visiting a mosque on Friday for noon prayers 
and fasting during the month of Ramadan (the ninth month of the Muslim year, 
which next begins on Feb. 2, 1995). 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of the significance of family and ethnic ties in business 
relationships. Indonesians often feel obligated to give preference to relatives 
and members of their ethnic groups.  
</P>
<P>
 * Use an intermediary to make some business contacts. Indonesians are very 
conscious of professional and social status; thus, senior executives often use 
intermediaries when dealing with people of lower status or of non-Indonesian 
origin. It is also helpful to have referrals from socially prominent 
individuals when seeking business contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employ Indonesian nationals as senior managers in your firm to avoid delays 
and difficulties in dealing with the government. The government considers the 
employment of native senior managers a priority for foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Study thoroughly government laws and regulations related to business and 
foreign investment. Regulations affecting investment and joint ventures have 
changed recently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be patient with bureaucratic procedures. A letter of support from a 
high-ranking official doesn't eliminate the need to work through the 
lower-level officials who actually get the work done.  
</P>
<P>
 * Know the different approaches to a project. In rural areas, Indonesians 
decide on the leader and members of a project team and then plan the project. 
In urban areas, they plan the project and then pull together the people with 
the needed skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sample any drink or food offered -- it is considered polite. However, do not 
reach for a beverage until the host signals you to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be formal and polite in the presence of elders and superiors. DON'T 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't use your left hand to give or receive. It is regarded as the unclean 
hand. It is also considered rude to point or summon someone with a finger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be offended if events do not start on time or if a guest arrives late. 
Indonesians are not known for their punctuality. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't cross your legs with one knee over the other while sitting in the 
presence of others. It is considered disrespectful.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect Indonesians to openly admit that they lack certain knowledge or 
that they are wrong or unable to complete a business transaction. They prefer 
to avoid disharmony and conflict and would rather preserve their own and 
others' dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't touch a person's head, even if you mean it as a gesture of friendship. 
The head is the most respected part of the body for Indonesians. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't underestimate the importance of the government's role in business 
affairs. Civil servants are highly respected (far more so than in the United 
States).  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't hire too quickly; firing someone is frowned upon. The most accepted 
way to deal with an unsatisfactory employee is to reassign him or her.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / SPOTLIGHT ON INDONESIA; IT 
MAY BE A NATION OF 13,500 ISLANDS, BUT MOST OF THE ACTION TAKES PLACE ON 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Indonesia is a vast republic of more than 13,500 islands spanning 
3,000 miles from Asia to Australia, business travelers focus on the three most 
developed and more heavily populated islands: Java, Bali and Sumatra. Doing 
Business 
</P>
<P>
 Government offices in Indonesia are typically open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday and from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Private 
offices and banks are typically open later, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday 
through Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The primary industries on Bali are tourism and handicrafts. On the densely 
populated island of Java, in contrast, there is a variety of industries. 
Jakarta, the country's capital, has car assembly plants and shipbuilding; 
Bandung, the country's third-largest city, has aircraft manufacturing. In 
addition, Batam, a tiny island near Singapore, has a burgeoning international 
tourism industry complete with luxury hotels and golf courses, as well as 
automotive manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Business (and leisure) travelers can stay in Indonesia up to 60 days with a 
passport and a return ticket. For longer stays, a visa is required, said Flamad 
Siregar, a spokesman for the Indonesian Consulate in Los Angeles. Business 
visas are available through the consulate office ((213) 383-5126).  
</P>
<P>
 Business customs are similar to those in the United States, with many 
negotiations taking place over meals or on golf courses, Siregar said. Many 
business people in Indonesia speak some English, though translators may be 
needed, he said. Hotels can usually supply one. Getting There 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least a dozen airports in Indonesia, but the three major airports 
for international arrivals are in Jakarta, on Bali and in the city of Medan in 
the northern part of Sumatra.  
</P>
<P>
 Garuda Indonesia Airlines, the national airline, flies direct from Los Angeles 
to Bali and Jakarta on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Flights to Biak, 
a remote town on one of the eastern islands, leave Friday and Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Singapore Airlines flies daily to Jakarta, Bali and Medan, connecting through 
Singapore. Japan Airlines flies daily to Jakarta and on to Bali through Tokyo. 
China Airlines flies five times a week through Taipei to Jakarta (Monday, 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday) and three times a week (Tuesday, Friday 
and Saturday) through Taipei to Bali.  
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian Airlines, which connects through Kuala Lumpur, has six flights a 
week from Los Angeles to Jakarta and Bali. (Flights leave every day but 
Wednesday and Friday, with two flights on Thursday.)  
</P>
<P>
 Domestic air travel in Indonesia is largely handled by the Indonesian airlines 
Merpati and Bouraq. Garuda, which primarily handles international routes, flies 
only a few domestic routes. Getting Around  
</P>
<P>
 Though there is a rail system on the islands of Java, Madura and Sumatra, the 
easiest way to get around in Indonesia is to rent a car, Siregar said. (An 
international driver's license is required.) For getting around cities, you can 
either drive or take taxis. If you use a taxi, however, make sure you show the 
driver on a map where you want to go, so he doesn't take you far out of the way 
to increase the fare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses, which are extremely crowded, are best avoided. Money 
</P>
<P>
 The currency unit in Indonesia is the rupiah (Rp.). Traveler's checks and 
credit cards are accepted in all major cities. If you plan to travel to 
outlying areas, however, it's best to take cash in smaller denominations (1,000 
and 5,000 Rp. notes). When exchanging money, private money changers such as 
hotels often give better rates than banks, Siregar said. But it's best to shop 
around. Lodging 
</P>
<P>
 There are a range of classes of hotels in all of Indonesia's major cities, 
Siregar said. Jakarta, for example, has eight five-star hotels, including the 
Hilton, two Hyatts, a Shangri-La, the Meridien, the Regent, Borobudur 
Intercontinental and Mandarin Oriental. Keep in mind that government taxes add 
about 20% to quoted room rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bandung, the Savoy Homann Hotel (an Art Deco classic), the Grand Preanger 
Hotel and the Panghegar are considered the finest hotels in the city. Security 
</P>
<P>
 According to the State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, a 
few areas in Indonesia have civil unrest and require special permits for 
travel. Unrest has occurred in Aceh, a province on the northern tip of Sumatra, 
and in East Timor, a province 300 miles north of Australia. Permits and 
information about civil instability are available from police in Indonesia.  
</P>
<P>
 As they are in many international destinations, pickpocketing and theft are 
problems in major tourist and urban areas. Otherwise, the crime rate in Jakarta 
is considered moderate. The loss or theft of a passport should be reported to 
the police and the U.S. Embassy. The embassy is in Jakarta at Jalan Merdeka 
Selatan 5 (telephone: 62-21-360-360). There are also U.S. Consulate general 
offices in Medan at Jalan Immam Bonjol 13 (62-61-322-200) and in Surabaya at 
Jalan Dr. Sutomo 33 (62-31-576-880).

Consular Affairs at (202) 647-9225.

CONAGRA TO LAY OFF 180 WORKERS, TRANSFER 30; EMPLOYMENT: THE ACTION AFFECTS 10% 
OF THE STAFF IN A RESTRUCTURING OF 2 DEPARTMENTS, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another blow to Southern California's economy, ConAgra Grocery Products 
Companies on Wednesday said it will eliminate 180 jobs, or 10% of its Orange 
County work force, as it restructures its corporate financial and information 
services departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty additional Fullerton-based employees with "key areas of expertise" will 
be offered jobs in Omaha, where ConAgra is building a corporate service center 
to support its existing food businesses in Fullerton and Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs and transfers are driven by "a strategic business move which helps 
us take advantage of efficiencies," Albert J. Crosson, ConAgra president and 
chief operating officer, said Wednesday. "(The restructuring) gives us the 
ability to respond more effectively to our customers and the needs of each of 
our companies." 
</P>
<P>
 ConAgra is building what Crosson described as "a world-class system to process 
customer transactions and to facilitate growth for the long-term (including) 
acquisitions." When the new facility is completed, it will take over corporate 
functions now conducted in Fullerton and Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 ConAgra Grocery Products Companies, a subsidiary of ConAgra Inc., a 
$23.5-billion diversified foods company headquartered in Omaha, now has about 
1,800 employees in Fullerton. A year ago, ConAgra jolted local civic leaders 
when it laid off 500 full- and part-time workers at a ConAgra's Hunt Food Co. 
tomato-processing plant in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The 180 layoffs announced on Wednesday will be spread out over the next nine 
to 11 months, ConAgra spokeswoman Kay M. Carpenter said. Displaced employees 
will be provided severance packages, outplacement assistance and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new operation that will employ new systems," Carpenter said. "It 
will perform the same functions as several existing departments that are now 
located both in Fullerton and Omaha." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the latest layoffs began circulating in Fullerton City Hall on 
Wednesday, but city officials said there is little they can do to prevent the 
jobs from disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 ConAgra "has told us on several occasions that they're in a worldwide 
competition and they're looking for every way to be competitive," Fullerton 
City Manager James L. Armstrong said. "It's frustrating to us in Southern 
California, because while we offer a good quality of life, it's hard to compete 
with areas like Omaha that, overall, have a lower cost of living." 
</P>
<P>
 ConAgra's decision to cluster corporate functions at one central location "is 
another example of what's going on in terms of the ability of corporations to 
telecommute," Armstrong said. "They can operate in any community that they 
choose." 
</P>
<P>
 The 500 jobs lost last year were linked to an ongoing cost-cutting program and 
increased competition worldwide.

FCC MAKES IT EASIER FOR MINORITIES TO WIN LICENSES; BROADCASTING: WOMEN-OWNED 
BUSINESSES AND MINORITY-OWNED FIRMS WILL GET A 40% DISCOUNT AT THE NEXT AUCTION 
OF FREQUENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission took steps Wednesday to give minorities 
and women a better shot at winning licenses in the government's next auction of 
the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said it will give women- and minority-owned firms a 40% discount on 
certain licenses they win in the FCC's next auction. That is up from a 25% 
discount in the series of auctions just completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also expanded its definition of small business to include firms 
with annual revenue of up to $40 million so that more entrepreneurs will be 
eligible to make installment payments on their winning bids. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress instructed the agency last year to begin auctioning broadcast 
licenses, it told the FCC to ensure that minorities, women and small businesses 
could compete against existing industry giants. In the agency's first auction 
last month, none of the 10 licenses to offer advanced paging and messaging 
services were captured by those special groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Several minority bidders at the auction for nationwide "narrow-band" licenses 
complained that the FCC had failed to live up to its congressional mandate, 
even though the agency had said it would give them 25% discounts on certain 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules are an attempt to do a better job at meeting Congress's aims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning as we go," said Donald Gips, deputy chief of the FCC's office 
of plans and policy. "We want to increase the opportunities available to 
minority- and women-owned businesses, and we believe increasing the bidding 
credit will help them attract the capital necessary to compete in this 
auction." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40% discounts will apply to 10 of the 30 licenses that will be sold in the 
FCC's next sale. That auction, for regional licenses to offer advanced paging 
and messaging services, will begin Oct. 25, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the FCC held its first two auctions of licenses to use certain 
slices of the radio spectrum. Ten nationwide licenses to offer advanced paging 
services were sold for $617 million, while 594 licenses to offer interactive TV 
services were sold for a total of $214 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the government had given the licenses away free. Last year 
Congress, directed the FCC to begin auctioning them as a way to raise money for 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in the first auction will use their licenses to set up nationwide 
networks of advanced paging and messaging services. For example, they could use 
them to offer pagers that collect voice messages, or that send written messages 
as well as receive them. 
</P>
<P>
 Six companies -- including Paging Network Inc. and McCaw Cellular 
Communications -- paid a total of $617 million for the licenses. Twenty-nine 
firms, including nine that were minority- or women-owned, signed up to bid for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "From looking at that auction, a larger bidding credit seems necessary to 
allow them to compete," Gips said. "The (low) bidding credit was one of the 
factors that resulted in no minority- or women-owned businesses winning 
licenses." 
</P>
<P>
 While no designated entity won a license in the first event, the FCC had more 
success in assisting women and minorities in the second auction, which was for 
interactive TV services. More than 60% of the licenses were won by women and 
minorities, the FCC said.

 It's the ant days of August and the triple-digit heat wave has driven the 
little creatures into Los Angeles homes, offices and restaurants by the 
zillions. Residents are fighting back with everything from bug spray to baby 
powder as well as calling pest control specialists in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the brigades continue to maneuver in sinks, shower stalls, cupboards, 
pet food dishes and, incredibly, even the freezer compartments of refrigerators 
-- where they have been found frozen to a crinkle. "It's hand-to-hand combat, 
every day," said one exasperated homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's often a losing battle. Entomologists and pest control experts say the 
offending ants are being driven inside for the same reasons as people these 
days: It's cooler and there's water. If you think you've been hot, consider 
this: Down where the ants live, the ground is 10 to 15 degrees hotter, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, ants troop inside about the same time every year and people often 
complain that the problem has never been worse, entomologists said. But in 
recent weeks, the annual ant invasion has taken on the dimensions of a plague, 
adding to the miseries caused by the record heat and challenging the sanity of 
those who seek to stamp them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's driving them crazy," said Orkin Exterminating Co. sales manager J. P. 
McConnehey, who has 100 or more frustrated people calling his office every day. 
"Most . . . say, 'I can't believe all these ants. I've never had them so bad . 
. . I have them all over the place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, they are driving us crazy," said Tim Saunders, president of Mission 
Pest Control in Laguna Hills. He estimated his company's monthly calls have 
risen from 3,000 to 5,000 largely because of ants. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders said he has developed a grudging admiration for the insects' 
industriousness and persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague in Santa Ana, Andy Allaire of Newport Exterminating, is feeling 
equally overwhelmed. He said his company usually is flooded with calls about 
fleas this time of year, but ants have taken over the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our secretaries are so tired of having people call with ants . . . it's 
become repetitious. Typically (callers) are just saying they've got ants 
everywhere and they can't take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County exterminators blame not only the weather, but the proliferation 
of new homes in areas where ants already are established, or in once-arid areas 
that now have well-irrigated gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-time residents are also among the besieged. Judy Bone, a Mission 
Viejo resident who has been in her home 18 years, just wants the invasion to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's creepy when you come down for a cup of coffee in the morning and a few 
minutes later find them crawling up your arm. When one of them is walking 
across your forehead . . . that's when it gets crazy." Bone said a pesticide 
service sprays outside her home every other month or so, but it hasn't done 
much good this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband has gone outside with the neighbors and together they've hunted 
down ant hills" and destroyed them, she said -- but to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day, they're back again" in her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The invaders are Argentine house ants, small black ants that do not sting but 
are aggressive enough to eat any termites that may stand in their way. Social 
creatures, they live in colonies of hundreds of thousands and there are 
countless colonies. Even more ominously, said Dr. Roy Snelling, a retired 
entomologist who works with the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, ants 
have terrific memories and they are natural-born teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, he said, that "even if you kill every single one of them they'll 
come back because they lay a scent trail that . . . the others are going to 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
 The best strategy, he and others said, is to find where the ants are coming in 
and block that point or spray it with pesticide from the outside. Snelling uses 
cat flea powder but other entomologists and health officials said that 
technique can be hazardous to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Others sprinkle boric acid or baby powder outside the point of entry or spray 
with Windex or Formula 409; some use caulking or even Elmer's Glue-All to seal 
it off. Many resort to firepower in a can, the powerful ant poison sprays, 
although many health experts recommend using them only outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Snelling, ants are nothing if not persistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Bell, a writer who works at her Venice home, would agree. "They're 
encircling my house and the circles keep coming closer," she said. "Sometimes 
they're climbing up the outside of the house and trying to get in the window 
and I really feel attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said she sweeps her kitchen floor 20 times a day trying to contain the 
trail of food crumbs that her 2-year-old leaves in his wake. But it's not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a losing battle," she said. Although she follows the experts' 
advice and tries to find their entry point, "the next day they've fooled me and 
they'll be in the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 The only relief, she said, is when she visits friends and discovers that they 
are just as besieged as she. It feels good to realize, she said, that "the ants 
weren't just singling me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Psenner is fighting ants on two fronts: at home and at the Silver Lake 
restaurant he co-owns, the Cobalt Cantina. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his thrice-daily attacks on ants with window cleaner, he still 
sometimes faces the ticklish situation of seating a customer just as an insect 
scurries across the white tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses a menu to block the diner's view while deftly sweeping the ant to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only been like this the last week or so," he said. "This is the worst 
I've ever seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pest control workers said that insecticides, correctly applied, are the most 
effective weapon against ants. But many people are reluctant to spray poisons 
in their home, and nontoxic remedies abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Llewellyn, the Northridge homemaker, jury-rigged an ant-sweeping device by 
stuffing a nylon stocking into the tube of her vacuum cleaner and fastening it 
with a rubber band. After vacuuming them up, she takes the ants outside and 
bombs them with bug spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Others use boric acid powder, vegetable oil, onion or garlic juice, grout and 
even hair spray to disrupt ant trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Jennings faced an infestation of his poolside refrigerator, where 
determined ants had even penetrated the freezer. Jennings and his wife drew the 
line, literally, laying down thick stripes of chalk along the rear of their 
Studio City house, around garbage cans and outside doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's had an amazing effect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the annoyance, some residents have resigned themselves to cohabiting 
with ants until the heat subsides and the insects retreat. Others have 
developed a perverse affection for the hard-working creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as bugs go, ants are my favorite," said Tom Case, a lawyer who lives 
in a Santa Monica apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't bite, they don't cause diseases, they don't buzz in your ear and 
they're not nearly as ugly as cockroaches. If I had to pick a bug to share my 
apartment with, ants are it." 
</P>
<P>
 Snelling, the retired entomologist, also recommended accommodation. As a 
Cherokee, he was taught to acknowledge the natural order, not wrestle with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Native American tradition is that we are a part of the circle of life," 
he said. "We learn to live with these things and each has its place and as long 
as we understand and respect that place we don't have much difficulty."

MEXICAN LAW, DISTANCE DISCOURAGE VOTERS; ELECTION: COUNTRY'S BAN ON ABSENTEE 
BALLOTS MAKES MANY IN O.C. APOLITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Adan Tobano took off his hat, brushed the sweat from his forehead in the 
afternoon sun, then said he had little interest in politics in Mexico, where 
presidential elections will take place Sunday, or in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "What goes on in my country doesn't really affect me any more -- unless I 
decide to go back," said the 30-year-old ice cream vendor from the state of 
Puebla. "And here, well, I don't think I can vote, and even if I could, I don't 
know enough about it, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 He can't vote in the United States because, although he is in the county 
legally, he's not a citizen. He can, however, vote in Mexico. But that would 
mean making a lengthy trip to Tijuana, Tecate or Mexicali, the closest border 
cities. And he just doesn't think it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobano is one of thousands of Mexican immigrants who find themselves in 
political limbo every time an election takes place south of San Ysidro -- be 
they from Guanajuato, Guadalajara, Queretaro or Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they have become an apolitical force. Their numbers are legion in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties but their electoral power is nil -- on both 
sides of the border. That's because to vote here they must become U.S. 
citizens, but many legal residents don't want to become U.S. citizen because 
they don't want to compromise their nationality. 
</P>
<P>
 And though they have the ability to cast ballots in Mexico, in special polling 
places set aside by the government for those "in transit," even then they are 
only allowed to vote for presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a majority of Mexican immigrants sit the elections out and glean what they 
can from the local Spanish newspapers, television or long-distance phone calls 
to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father can't stop talking about it," said Mariana Calderon, 40, a Costa 
Mesa resident who was born in the state of Durango. "But I never cared much for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria de Los Angeles, an employee at the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana, cares 
about politics. She'd like to vote, but says her hands are tied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't have the time or the transportation to get to Tijuana," she said 
from behind the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 If she could, she'd cast an absentee ballot from Santa Ana, but the fact is 
she can't, because it is forbidden by the Mexican Constitution, a fact that led 
an estimated 10,000 Mexican immigrants to hold mock elections in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties over the weekend in which the ruling party lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want the right to be able to vote outside of Mexico," said Salvador 
Vazquez, 56, who organized the elections on the north side of Los Angeles. 
"There's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't be able to vote from here. A lot 
of us have to work and just can't make it to la frontera (the border) on 
Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, very few Mexican immigrants who live and work in Orange County, 
and whose numbers are growing steadily each year, will have an electoral say in 
defining the destiny of the "Old Country." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there have been numerous attempts by Mexican immigrants in the United 
States to create an absentee-balloting law -- letters have been written, 
complaints have been filed with Mexico's federal electorate -- Vazquez has his 
own theories as to why the Mexican government has yet to embrace such a system. 
</P>
<P>
 The government "says it's too complicated a process, and it will cost a lot of 
money, but deep down it's because the Mexicans who live here generally don't 
agree with the system of government now in power. That's why they left the 
country to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the opinion of a member of the PRD, or Democratic Revolution Party, 
which contends that its candidate this year, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was robbed of 
the presidency six years ago due to widespread fraud on the part of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI has maintained power ever since it formed in 1929, another reason why 
Mexican immigrants fail to see the logic in heading south for the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why vote when you know who's going to win beforehand -- it's just one vote 
that won't matter," said Newport Beach resident Jorge Gonzales, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distance and the disadvantages, the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana 
still encourages all Mexican citizens to make a beeline for the border to cast 
their ballots if they have the chance because this election is considered 
crucial in Mexico's political future. 
</P>
<P>
 And who knows, someday Mexico might include absentee voting in the Mexican 
Constitution, said Felipe Soria, the consul for the Mexican Consulate in Santa 
Ana. After all, South Africa allowed residents living in foreign countries to 
cast absentee ballots during its presidential election in April. About 900 
South Africans in Orange County voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple fact is Mexico is making some very profound changes, but first it 
has to deal with the more immediate problems before it can even take a look at 
such a thing as absentee balloting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems such as settling the uprising in the southern state of Chiapas among 
indigenous revolutionaries, rebounding from the assassination of PRI's former 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and effectively competing in the 
North American Free Trade Agreement are just a few problems Mexico's new 
president will have to face. 
</P>
<P>
 The top contenders for the presidency include: Ernesto Zedillo of PRI; 
Cardenas of PRD; Alvaro Perez Trevino of PARM, the Authentic Mexican Revolution 
Party; Marcela Lombardo Otero of PPS, the People's Socialist Party; and Diego 
Fernandez of PAN, the National Action Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But those names are as foreign as the country is far, at least for Jaime 
Mercado, a research lab technician of La Habra who was born in the United 
States but whose parents were born in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he pays little attention to the politics, unless it's at a grass-roots 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I helped get a friend elected to the City Council in Rosemead," he said.

SENATE SOFTENING REGULATORY STING OF HEALTH BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate unanimously backed a Republican move Wednesday night to scale back 
government powers in a Clinton Administration-backed health care reform bill, 
killing a proposed $10,000-per-employee fine against companies that fail to 
offer workers a choice of plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-0 vote was just one of many unmistakable signs that the bill 
introduced by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) will be 
subjected to bipartisan efforts to delete provisions that many regard as 
excessive government bureaucracy and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as today, a group of about 20 moderate senators from both parties, 
known as the "mainstream coalition," is expected to unveil a compromise 
proposal that would further reduce the role of government in a revamped health 
care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising unanimous vote to delete the $10,000 fine came on an amendment 
offered by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), who urged members to "take away some of 
the heavy hammer" of government in Mitchell's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats said they agreed to do so in part to foster a spirit of 
bipartisanship and in part because there are other provisions in the bill that 
would achieve the deterrent effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other ways," said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). "We are certainly 
willing to try that approach in the spirit of bipartisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell added: "They said the penalty was excessive and unnecessary and we 
agreed to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unanimous vote on the Nickles amendment Wednesday night, Mitchell 
and his Senate allies are bracing for what may be a long series of GOP 
amendments intended to cripple, if not kill, the Mitchell plan, which is 
favored by President Clinton and Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Nickles disclosed that he plans to offer -- perhaps as early as today 
-- more amendments, including one to kill a requirement in Mitchell's plan for 
a standard benefits package that would be available to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Another amendment that Nickles is drafting would exempt all existing insurance 
policies from health reform legislation, a move that could render the reforms 
all but toothless. 
</P>
<P>
 The bustle in the Senate was a sharp contrast to the continuing delays in the 
House, which now may not take up health care reform until Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the House Democratic leadership put off floor debate until 
the Congressional Budget Office had fully analyzed the four bills introduced in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) told members Wednesday that 
if the Budget Office reports are still not ready after House action on the 
crime bill, the House would move into an informal session, allowing members to 
return to their districts, subject to being called back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring the bill up and pass it as soon as we can," Gephardt said, 
speaking of the health reform bill he has introduced. "I don't know (when) and 
I don't know anybody who does." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, after adopting Nickles' amendment Wednesday, began debating a 
series of amendments offered by Daschle to enhance access to care in rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the afternoon, the "mainstream coalition," which includes Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.), met in private to thrash out their consensus proposal. 
Members also met separately with Mitchell and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there are many areas in which there can be accommodation and 
agreement," Mitchell said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 As the coalition meeting broke up, members said that the group has virtually 
reached agreement on all the major issues, including how to expand coverage 
while containing costs and reducing the role of government. 
</P>
<P>
 But they declined to reveal the specifics, noting that they were to meet this 
morning with Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Budget Office, to discuss 
their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, led by Sens. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) and John B. Breaux (D-La.), is 
said to be trimming both the benefits and the scope of Mitchell's bill. 
Coverage for outpatient prescription drugs and for long-term care -- both 
proposed originally by Clinton -- are likely to be scaled back, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Mitchell defended his plan from Republican attack on the 
floor of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused his GOP colleagues of hypocrisy because of their denunciations of a 
"government-run" health care system while they take full advantage of the 
services offered by federal hospitals and doctors and willingly enroll in a 
federal health insurance program that pays 72% of their premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell denied that his program amounts to a government-run system but he 
nevertheless urged citizens to ask themselves: "If it's so bad for me, how come 
it's so good for them (members of Congress) and their families?" 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, five Republican senators, led by Mitch McConnell of 
Kentucky, denounced provisions in Mitchell's bill that they said would lead to 
"an explosion in lawsuits" by overturning tort reforms that have been enacted 
by 22 states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that Mitchell's bill would create new grounds on which employers and 
health plans could be sued, such as allegations of discrimination based on 
race, sexual orientation and age. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) said that Mitchell's bill "is worse than nothing."

COLUMN ONE; TREATMENT AGAINST THEIR WILL; MORE STATES ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO 
FORCE THE MENTALLY ILL INTO HOSPITALS. SOME DOCTORS, FAMILIES AND EVEN PATIENTS 
BACK SUCH CHANGES, NOTING THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN CIVIL RIGHTS AND 'THE 
HUMAN RIGHT TO LIVE.'

 The temperature had climbed above 90 degrees, but Tressa, a slender 
20-year-old woman sitting on a park bench outside the Staten Island Ferry 
Terminal, was wearing five layers of clothing. The holes in her jeans were 
stuffed with cardboard. Her shoes were wrapped in silver duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 She had occupied the same bench every day, all day, for the last five months. 
A psychiatrist and a nurse, members of an outreach organization called Project 
Help, were trying one last time to persuade her to enter the Bellevue Hospital 
Center psychiatric ward voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes wide with fear, Tressa refused, as she had for five months. "There's a 
time and place for everything," she told them. "Even though I'm just sitting 
here, I certainly hope I'm not drifting from reality. I have a strong belief in 
God. He has always let me know when the right moment comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, Tressa became part of a quiet but significant change in the way 
American society is dealing with the mentally ill, especially those who are 
indigent and resist treatment. Invoking special authority recently granted to 
health professionals, a Project Help psychiatrist took Tressa to Bellevue, 
despite her pleas to be left alone in the tiny triangle park where she felt 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three decades beginning in the 1950s, government policy, medical 
opinion and the law lined up together to enforce strict limits on the 
conditions under which such involuntary commitments could occur. But today, the 
situation is changing: 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the public, from relatives of mental patients and from the 
medical community, the strict prohibitions against involuntary commitment are 
being reconsidered and several states have already relaxed their standards for 
involuntary treatment. This has made it easier to commit mental patients -- 
especially the indigent -- whether they agree or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pendulum is starting to swing back," said E. Fuller Torrey, a clinical 
and research psychiatrist based in Washington who is a leading voice in support 
of involuntary treatment. "None of us are saying it should go back to where it 
was in the 1920s or '30s. But we're definitely going back in the direction 
where you will be able to get people in the hospital who need treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Most jurisdictions still permit involuntary commitment only for people with 
severe mental illnesses -- schizophrenia, manic-depression and major depression 
-- and only when they pose a danger to themselves or others -- the standard set 
in the 1950s during the movement away from involuntary commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, some states -- including, Arizona, Hawaii, Oklahoma, 
Delaware, South Carolina and Iowa -- have modified those criteria, allowing 
courts to order involuntary commitment based on other factors, including 
psychiatric history and potential emotional injury to a family. In effect, the 
new rules permit authorities to act where the need for treatment is very clear 
and individuals are unable to make a decision for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the change is being driven by neighborhood groups and citizens who 
are frightened by -- or fed up with -- the growing numbers of homeless mentally 
ill people in their communities. The balance between the rights of society and 
the rights of individuals is out of kilter, these groups contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, relatives and friends of mentally ill people who refuse treatment 
are banding together to pressure lawmakers. Consigning such people to live on 
the streets, eat out of trash cans and suffer without care or medication -- all 
in the name of protecting their civil liberties -- is perverse, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the name of civil rights they are denying people like my son the human 
right to live," said a 70-year-old engineer whose 40-year-old son has suffered 
from schizophrenia for 17 years and has lived for years on the streets of New 
York because he denies that he is sick and refuses to take medicine. "When my 
son is psychotic, he's an animal. He can't decide what is best for him," his 
father says. 
</P>
<P>
 Families tell of being unable to get treatment for their loved ones, no matter 
how clearly psychotic, until they have crossed the line into violent behavior. 
Slicing one's scalp, pulling one's hair out or hurting another person are among 
the examples cited by relatives. Desperate to get help, family members say, 
they sometimes lie to authorities, claiming that violent acts have already 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the pressure from neighbors and families is the fact that doctors 
have new tools for alleviating the problems of serious mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This comes at a time when we have a new generation of anti-psychotic drugs 
that are more effective and have fewer side effects," said Robert Levy, the 
Project Help psychiatrist who decided to treat Tressa. "It's much more humane 
to give these people treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement to abolish involuntary commitment, a common practice throughout 
most of the nation's history, began partly as a result of public horror over 
the "snake pit" conditions that existed in many mental institutions during the 
first half of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 It also reflected the difficulty in justifying mandatory commitment on medical 
grounds when the care patients received was little more than custodial and 
seldom made them better. Patients could be treated as well or more effectively 
in community-based mental health centers, reform-minded doctors argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, large-scale commitment was expensive; emptying the huge mental hospitals 
that existed in every state appealed to voters who, then as now, thirsted for 
tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil liberties groups mounted a series of successful court challenges to the 
old system. All across the country, the idea that individuals had an almost 
absolute right to refuse treatment began to replace the idea that a benevolent 
state had an obligation to treat those who were seriously mentally ill, even if 
they objected. From 1955 to 1992, the number of people in mental institutions 
plummeted from 559,000 to 90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the tide of opinion swings back, civil liberties advocates and some 
legal experts warn that changing the laws could result in denying individuals 
their constitutional rights or overburden the inadequate services available for 
helping the mentally ill. Government officials also warn that financial 
resources are not available to expand services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Broadening the commitment laws is bad in terms of policy and bad in terms of 
constitutional principles," said John Parry, chief of staff of the American Bar 
Assn.'s Commission on Mental and Physical Disability Law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gut reaction is to solve the problem of homeless mentally ill by putting 
people back in institutions, instead of providing a more humane life for these 
people," he said. "But given the resources that we have and given what 
institutions are able to do, it is not a good idea to put more people into 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Many mentally ill people who have been involuntarily treated in the past are 
also worried about changing commitment standards. "I see this as heading down a 
slippery slope of losing our rights," said Charlie Rodican, 51, of New York, 
who has been treated for mental illness through most of his adult life but has 
been stable for several years. "I think people have a right to choose whether 
they should be treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Some mentally ill people and civil libertarians are banding together to speak 
out against broadening standards for involuntary treatment. They repeat horror 
stories of patients being abused by insensitive orderlies and argue that the 
risks of treating people against their will outweigh the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Purnell, for one, does not see it that way. A 43-year-old former 
homeless crack addict who suffers from schizophrenia, Purnell was diagnosed as 
mentally ill as a child in Savannah, Ga., but for more than three decades 
denied she was sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shoes used to talk to me," Purnell said in an interview, referring to the 
first time her parents committed her when she was a child. "That's when they 
involuntarily committed me. I was mad at them for putting me into the hospital, 
because I felt like it was fine that my shoes were talking to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She refused to take medication unless she was hospitalized -- and she hated 
hospitals. She ended up living on the streets of New York -- smoking crack, 
sleeping in subway cars or train stations and eating out of garbage bins. 
Several times, the police took her to emergency rooms, but because she was not 
violent they had no legal grounds to treat her against her will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, I'm not going there with crazy people because I'm not crazy," she 
recalled. On one cold night three years ago, Purnell took refuge in a shelter. 
A social worker was unusually attentive and, for the first time in many years, 
Purnell took medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would watch me take it," Purnell said. "I had to open my mouth to show I 
had swallowed it. It was involuntary treatment, but a good kind of involuntary 
because it helped to stabilize me and it was done with kindness." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that she is stable, Purnell wishes the laws had been different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like for someone to have committed me to the hospital, because I was 
not able to care for myself," Purnell said. "Intervention would have helped a 
lot. There are a lot of people out there who have problems with reality who 
could be helped through involuntary intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in decades, she is in close contact with her family. She 
has discovered grandchildren she did not know. And she is attending college on 
a scholarship. She just started a job as a counselor at a halfway house 
associated with the program that helped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists estimate that 30% to 40% of the people living on the streets or in 
homeless shelters suffer from severe mental illness. Most get no medication or 
treatment, in large part because -- like Purnell -- they are afraid of 
hospitals or insist that they are not sick. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the increasing public determination to do something about the 
problem was a decision this summer by the New York state Legislature to expand 
the state's authority to compel mentally ill people with a history of 
hospitalization to take medication or attend counseling on an outpatient basis. 
If the patients refuse, they can be recommitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil libertarians, conceding that public views had changed so much that they 
could not defeat the proposals, opted not to fight. Instead they helped draft 
the legislative language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable that five years ago it would have passed," Torrey said. 
"The fact that they passed that law without opposition from the American Civil 
Liberties Union is a significant indication of how far things have come." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Levy, who for a long time was the New York Civil Liberties Union's 
expert on the issue, contended that the new law is not a sign of a trend but a 
reaction to a specific, highly publicized case involving a homeless, 
schizophrenic crack addict named Larry Hogue who menaced an Upper West Side 
Manhattan street for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogue had a long history of involuntary commitments. He was often picked up by 
police. Sometimes he was released in days, sometimes within months. When 
discharged, he would stop taking his medication, start smoking crack and return 
to setting fires, grabbing passing schoolchildren and hurling himself into 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 In one especially horrendous episode, he pushed a teen-ager in front of a 
truck. Fortunately, the driver swerved the vehicle in time, avoiding a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The cycle stopped when he was involuntarily committed for a longer term to a 
state hospital on the grounds that he was likely to abuse crack and become 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes exceptional cases tend to drive legislation," Levy said. "I think 
there's a great tension between the forces of liberty and the forces of 
benevolence. For the last seven or eight years there has been a lot of pressure 
to cut back on the constitutional liberties that had been recognized in the 
1970s and 1980s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of greater freedom to impose involuntary commitment see the issue 
not as a matter of civil liberties but of effective medical treatment and 
balanced social policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hogue court finding as a precedent was a very important one," conceded 
Zebulon Taintor, a professor at New York University, a practicing psychiatrist 
and the president of the U.S. branch of the World Assn. for Psychosocial 
Rehabilitation. But he added: "Involuntary treatment is often a necessary first 
step to getting people involved in treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "we think untreated mental illness gives all mental illness 
a bad name." 
</P>
<P>
 Families of mentally ill homeless have argued that they should be trusted to 
advise authorities when someone is psychotic and needs treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time the family of Victoria Jacobs Madeira sought involuntary treatment 
for her, authorities in California said that the Anaheim woman showed no signs 
of endangering herself or others, because she was finding food and shelter -- 
even though she got her food from Dumpsters and she and her then-11-year-old 
son lived in a parking lot. Like many people with mental illness, Madeira did 
not recognize her illness and refused treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in 1990, Madeira dressed her son in girl's clothes and makeup, took a 
taxi 75 miles to her parents' home and stabbed and shot her 78-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did not fit the criteria (for treatment) until she murdered my 
mother-in-law," said Carla Jacobs, who is crusading to change the commitment 
laws in California. "Waiting for danger is too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said that her sister-in-law's case illustrates the absurdity of the 
claim that the law protects individuals' constitutionally enshrined liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The laws give civil rights to the psychosis rather than human rights to the 
person," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being arrested, Madeira bounced from a mental hospital to jail, where 
she refused medication and was found incompetent to stand trial, then back to 
the hospital. She finally was committed to a state mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 California's 1967 Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which prevents involuntary 
commitment of those not deemed to be dangerous to themselves, was a pioneering 
step in the nationwide transformation of mental health laws during the period 
in which it was passed, and all attempts to change it failed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jacobs said that he believes public opinion is changing. She and other 
advocates plan to launch another attack on the law during the next session of 
the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even those who advocate more flexibility in commitment laws acknowledge 
that it is a difficult issue, that there can be a downside to involuntary 
treatment and that no single strategy is best for all cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz Ramsey, the mother of a 31-year-old mentally ill woman, lobbied strongly 
and successfully for broadening the standard in Arizona and used the new 
criterion of "persistently and acutely disabled" to get treatment for her 
daughter at what she believes was a critical moment: 
</P>
<P>
 "She had not done anything to me. She had said she wanted to kill me with a 
knife. But she did not have a knife, so that was not enough to show she was 
dangerous. But we were able to show by her previous records that she had been 
helped by being in the hospital and receiving treatment, so they hospitalized 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 But she understands clearly the perils of forcing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Broadening the standard to those who are persistently and acutely disabled is 
as far a step as we can go to take away someone's civil rights," she said. 
"Taking someone's civil rights away creates a trauma that the person will never 
get over." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter's words still echo in her memory: "You have taken away my life, 
Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 On balance, however, Ramsey said that she believes she and her daughter are 
better off now. "The way it was, she said, "you had to have someone hurt 
themselves or someone else" before you could get help.

FORGET DOG DAYS; IT'S ANT DAYS OF AUGUST; PESTS: ANNUAL INVASION HAS WORSENED 
WITH HEAT, THREATENING HUMAN SANITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When ants marched into Cari Llewellyn's kitchen like a column of Roman 
soldiers, she stayed calm. She wasn't even upset when they rampaged in her 
clothes hamper. And she could cope with them overrunning her fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she found a platoon of them sipping from a glass of water on her 
husband's night stand in their bedroom, Llewellyn lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I freaked out. I said, 'That's it! We're calling Orkin!' " the Northridge 
homemaker said. "It's disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the ant days of August and the triple-digit heat wave has driven the 
little creatures into Los Angeles homes, offices and restaurants by the 
zillions. Residents are fighting back with everything from bug spray to baby 
powder as well as calling pest control specialists in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the brigades continue to maneuver in sinks, shower stalls, cupboards, 
pet food dishes and, incredibly, even the freezer compartments of refrigerators 
-- where they have been found frozen to a crinkle. "It's hand-to-hand combat, 
every day," said one exasperated homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's often a losing battle. Entomologists and pest control experts say the 
offending ants are being driven inside for the same reasons as people these 
days: It's cooler and there's water. If you think you've been hot, consider 
this: Down where the ants live, the ground is 10 to 15 degrees hotter, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, ants troop inside about the same time every year and people often 
complain that the problem has never been worse, entomologists said. But in 
recent weeks, the annual ant invasion has taken on the dimensions of a plague, 
adding to the miseries caused by the record heat and challenging the sanity of 
those who seek to stamp them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's driving them crazy," said Orkin Exterminating Co. sales manager J. P. 
McConnehey, who has 100 or more frustrated people calling his office every day. 
"Most . . . say, 'I can't believe all these ants. I've never had them so bad . 
. . I have them all over the place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The invaders are Argentine house ants, small black ants that do not sting but 
are aggressive enough to eat any termites that may stand in their way. Social 
creatures, they live in colonies of hundreds of thousands and there are 
countless colonies. Even more ominously, said Dr. Roy Snelling, a retired 
entomologist who works with the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, ants 
have terrific memories and they are natural-born teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, he said, that "even if you kill every single one of them they'll 
come back because they lay a scent trail that . . . the others are going to 
follow." 
</P>
<P>
 The best strategy, he and others said, is to find where the ants are coming in 
and block that point or spray it with pesticide from the outside. Snelling uses 
cat flea powder but other entomologists and health officials said that 
technique can be hazardous to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Others sprinkle boric acid or baby powder outside the point of entry or spray 
with Windex or Formula 409; some use caulking or even Elmer's Glue-All to seal 
it off. Many resort to firepower in a can, the powerful ant poison sprays, 
although many health experts recommend using them only outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Snelling, ants are nothing if not persistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Bell, a writer who works at her Venice home, would agree. "They're 
encircling my house and the circles keep coming closer," she said. "Sometimes 
they're climbing up the outside of the house and trying to get in the window 
and I really feel attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said she sweeps her kitchen floor 20 times a day trying to contain the 
trail of food crumbs that her 2-year-old leaves in his wake. But it's not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a losing battle," she said. Although she follows the experts' 
advice and tries to find their entry point, "the next day they've fooled me and 
they'll be in the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 The only relief, she said, is when she visits friends and discovers that they 
are just as besieged as she. It feels good to realize, she said, that "the ants 
weren't just singling me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Psenner is fighting ants on two fronts: at home and at the Silver Lake 
restaurant he co-owns, the Cobalt Cantina. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his thrice-daily attacks on ants with window cleaner, he still 
sometimes faces the ticklish situation of seating a customer just as an insect 
scurries across the white tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses a menu to block the diner's view while deftly sweeping the ant to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only been like this the last week or so," he said. "This is the worst 
I've ever seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pest control workers said that insecticides, correctly applied, are the most 
effective weapon against ants. But many people are reluctant to spray poisons 
in their home, and nontoxic remedies abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Llewellyn, the Northridge homemaker, jury-rigged an ant-sweeping device by 
stuffing a nylon stocking into the tube of her vacuum cleaner and fastening it 
with a rubber band. After vacuuming them up, she takes the ants outside and 
bombs them with bug spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Others use boric acid powder, vegetable oil, onion or garlic juice, grout and 
even hair spray to disrupt ant trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Jennings faced an infestation of his poolside refrigerator, where 
determined ants had even penetrated the freezer. Jennings and his wife drew the 
line, literally, laying down thick stripes of chalk along the rear of their 
Studio City house, around garbage cans and outside doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's had an amazing effect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the annoyance, some residents have resigned themselves to cohabiting 
with ants until the heat subsides and the insects retreat. Others have 
developed a perverse affection for the hard-working creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as bugs go, ants are my favorite," said Tom Case, a lawyer who lives 
in a Santa Monica apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't bite, they don't cause diseases, they don't buzz in your ear and 
they're not nearly as ugly as cockroaches. If I had to pick a bug to share my 
apartment with, ants are it." 
</P>
<P>
 Snelling, the retired entomologist, also recommended accommodation. As a 
Cherokee, he was taught to acknowledge the natural order, not wrestle with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Native American tradition is that we are a part of the circle of life," 
he said. "We learn to live with these things and each has its place and as long 
as we understand and respect that place we don't have much difficulty." 
Stopping the March 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips that some homeowners have used to stall the ant invasion: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seal all food in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thoroughly clean all kitchen surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apply pesticides according to instructions, use outdoors only, especially 
where ants enter the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fix dripping faucets, especially those outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caulk openings where pipes enter the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check overhanging tree branches for ants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove fallen fruit from beneath trees near the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprinkle boric acid on outdoor windowsills and outside doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Draw lines with ordinary chalk.

ALTMAN RESIGNS OVER WHITEWATER; PROBE: DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY IS THE 
HIGHEST-RANKING VICTIM OF THE CONTROVERSY. THE DEPARTMENT'S TOP LAWYER IS ALSO 
EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, facing intense criticism from Congress 
for his role in the Whitewater affair, resigned Wednesday, becoming the Clinton 
Administration's highest-ranking victim of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton accepted Altman's resignation after Democratic leaders on 
Capitol Hill made it clear to the White House and to Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen that they believed Altman's credibility with Congress had been 
irreparably damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Bentsen recommended to Clinton that Treasury Undersecretary 
Frank Newman be nominated to succeed Altman. Newman is a former vice chairman 
of Bank of America who in his current post has been overseeing financial and 
banking policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Administration sources said Treasury general counsel Jean Hanson, 
who was also caught up in the controversy because of her testimony during 
congressional hearings, earning Altman's enmity for contradicting his 
statements, will resign soon -- perhaps as early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua L. Steiner, the third senior Treasury official 
under fire from Republicans in the controversy, will stay on at the department, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's resignation as the Treasury Department's second-highest official had 
been widely anticipated since he was forced to endure 16 hours of testimony 
during the House and Senate Whitewater hearings, grilled by angry lawmakers 
over what both Democrats and Republicans charged was his lack of candor with 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter of resignation to the President, his old college classmate from 
Georgetown University, Altman said he hoped that "my stepping down will help to 
diminish the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Wall Street investment banker, who first worked at the Treasury 
Department in the Jimmy Carter Administration, added that he regretted "any 
mistakes or errors of judgment I may have made." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman noted that his resignation would be effective after his successor is 
confirmed by the Senate. Treasury officials said it was unclear whether Altman 
plans to return to Wall Street, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who talked with Altman by telephone before the resignation was 
announced, wrote in a letter to him: "I believe you have taken the right step 
under the circumstances and I regretfully accept your resignation." Clinton 
added that Altman "had made many valuable contributions to this 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's congressional critics from both parties praised his decision to step 
down. Democrats made it clear that they believed his effectiveness in dealing 
with Congress on key legislative matters was at an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Altman's ability to serve the President had been damaged and I support 
his decision to resign," said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), the chairman 
of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which conducted the 
Whitewater hearings in the upper chamber. "The situation is unfortunate and 
regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, however, were far less sympathetic and appeared gleeful over 
helping to pressure Clinton to abandon one of his oldest friends in the 
Administration. And Altman's resignation seemed to renew their desire to stay 
on the offensive on the Whitewater matter. "Today's announcement is a welcome 
action that is long overdue," said Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), a 
Republican member of the banking panel. "While a step in the right direction, I 
believe we've only scratched the surface and much remains to be learned before 
all of the questions are answered." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the Senate 
committee and Altman's most vocal critic in Congress, said simply: "It's about 
time Altman resigned." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman is the third high-ranking Administration official to be forced out 
recently. White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned under fire in March for 
his controversial handling of Whitewater matters after the suicide of Deputy 
White House Counsel Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell, a former law partner of First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, also resigned in March after their former Little Rock, 
Ark., law firm began an ethics investigation into Hubbell's past billing 
practices. The inquiry appeared to be prompted in part by the intense scrutiny 
the firm was under as a result of its own role in the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of the 48-year-old Altman is a severe blow to Clinton. Altman 
had been widely viewed both inside and outside the Administration as one of the 
President's most effective and able advisers. He played an influential role on 
a wide range of policy fronts -- from the budget to trade to health care reform 
-- and appeared to be on track to succeed Bentsen as Treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of Altman's energy, political skills and close ties to the 
President, the Treasury Department became one of the bright success stories of 
Clinton's first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The President relied on Bentsen and Altman to take on some of his 
Administration's toughest tasks. Altman ran the White House "war room" during 
last summer's congressional battle over Clinton's economic plan and helped push 
the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993 economic summit in Tokyo, Altman acted as a key trade 
negotiator with Japanese officials and helped close a deal on a new framework 
for future trade negotiations. Both Bentsen and Altman stepped into the breach 
on health care just as the Administration's plan began to come under attack in 
Congress and around the country this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altman's political demise came as a result of yet another task he was 
asked to perform for the Administration: running the Resolution Trust Corp., 
the agency that supervises cleanup of the savings and loan failures of the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Administration's initial candidate to take over the regulatory agency 
failed to win confirmation last year, Altman was named acting RTC chairman 
while continuing to serve in the No. 2 Treasury job. 
</P>
<P>
 He was thus put in the awkward role of running an independent regulatory 
agency that was conducting a criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings 
& Loan, a failed Arkansas thrift owned by James B. McDougal. McDougal was the 
partner of then-Gov. Clinton and his wife in the Whitewater real estate 
development in northwest Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is investigating whether the Whitewater project caused losses 
at Madison Guaranty and whether federally insured deposits from the thrift were 
siphoned off through the development to benefit Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, while wearing two hats, was involved in daily meetings with White 
House officials on sensitive political matters in his role as an appointee at 
the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He came under fire in Congress -- both before and during the Whitewater 
hearings -- because of contacts between the White House and the Treasury 
Department concerning the RTC's confidential investigation into Madison 
Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. cleared Altman and other 
Treasury and White House officials of criminal wrongdoing in their discussions 
of the matter and the Office of Government Ethics also said Altman did not 
violate government ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altman's critics in Congress argued that the Treasury official repeatedly 
failed to disclose to them the full scope of the contacts, especially during an 
initial hearing in February, when the contacts were first revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 At that first hearing before the Senate banking panel, Altman acknowledged 
just one contact. But he was forced to repeatedly amend his more recent 
testimony to reveal additional contacts. And White House officials testified 
during this summer's hearings that they realized last February that Altman had 
not fully disclosed to the committee what he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hanson, who helped Altman at the RTC while continuing to work at 
the Treasury Department, also sharply contradicted Altman during the hearings. 
She came under fire for meeting last September with Nussbaum to inform him that 
the RTC was preparing to issue a criminal referral to the Justice Department 
that would name President Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign as a possible 
beneficiary of criminal acts at Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman stressed that he was not aware of that meeting. Hanson said Altman 
suggested that she meet with Nussbaum. And she made it clear that she believed 
that Altman knew more about the initial Treasury-White House contacts than he 
had said.

CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN IN HISTORIC MEXICAN ELECTION; POLITICS: THREE-DAY HIATUS 
BEFORE BALLOTING GIVES VOTERS TIME TO DECIDE BETWEEN RULING PARTY AND PROMISED 
CHANGE.

<P>
 The election campaign that could end the dominance of the world's 
longest-ruling party wrapped up Wednesday, leaving Mexicans a three-day hiatus 
to consider whether to vote Sunday for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates shook hands at street corners and exhorted followers at rallies in 
a final attempt to firm the convictions of supporters and sway the undecided 
before, by law, they had to stop campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mexicans could base their votes less on rhetoric than on performance. 
</P>
<P>
 They know what to expect from the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI). The opposition's only track record is the experience of Chihuahua, Baja 
California and Guanajuato -- three states with governors from the conservative 
National Action Party (PAN). 
</P>
<P>
 Whether voters believe that those state governments have improved conditions 
could be a decisive factor in their willingness to vote for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians consider that factor seriously enough that PAN and PRI legislative 
delegations in Baja California have taken out competing full-page 
advertisements in national weekly newsmagazines in the month leading up to the 
elections; the ads either tout or disparage the PAN administration in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Beltran del Rio, PAN candidate for the National Congress here, 
promised supporters: "Our state is today an example of democracy and authentic 
separation of powers, where the legislature is truly independent. As a federal 
deputy, I will work to make this the reality in all Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate with the most riding on the PAN's record is party 
standard-bearer Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez -- who has risen to No. 2 in most polls, edging out Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas of the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) -- is 
generally thought to have the best chance of defeating Ernesto Zedillo, the 
leading candidate, and ending 65 years of PRI rule. 
</P>
<P>
 If he succeeds, Mexicans will turn north to see what a PAN government might 
look like. While Carlos Medina, governor of the central state of Guanajuato, is 
a caretaker -- the result of a political compromise after an election fraught 
with documented fraud -- the governors of Baja California and Chihuahua swept 
into office with clear mandates for change. They pledged to bring democracy to 
their states. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chihuahua, where Francisco Barrio Terraza was elected in 1992 to the 
governorship that many Mexicans believe was stolen from him by fraud six years 
earlier, the PAN-dominated legislature is rewriting the state constitution to 
include referendums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, 80% of the initiatives for new laws came from the governor and only 
20% from the state Congress," said Luis H. Alvarez, former national chairman of 
the PAN and now a candidate for the federal Senate from Chihuahua. "Now, it is 
reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the first PAN governor in Baja California, created one of 
this nation's earliest, most powerful human rights commissions and a pioneering 
electoral reform package: The state wrested control of its electoral rolls from 
the federal government and introduced a high-tech photographic identification 
card for voters. That anti-corruption tool has become the model for the voter 
credential now used in Mexican federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the cleanest elections anywhere in Mexico today are happening 
in Baja California is a tremendous tribute to Ruffo and his government," said 
Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexico Studies at UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Castillo Peraza, national president of the PAN, contends that the three 
PAN governors have given Mexico examples of clean, efficient public 
administration. "There is a new climate of confidence in government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he may be overstating the case. Voters may not be so impressed with PAN 
state governments that they are eagerly awaiting the chance to elect candidates 
who will expand reforms nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, recent events -- including a bloody Indian revolt in the poor southern 
state of Chiapas -- attest to the fact that Mexicans are impatient for change 
and that they will demand much more accountability from the next government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even those people who will vote for the PRI want change, and it's a message 
the PRI has understood," said Jonathan Heath, president of Mexico City 
consulting firm Macro Asesoria Economica. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old order no longer satisfies the vast majority, although no one can know 
with certainty which party platform provides the solution to the current 
difficulties," said Luis Rubio, director of the Center for Development 
Research, a private think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 A national poll by Washington, D.C.-based Belden & Russonello showed no 
significant difference in Fernandez's support in PAN-governed states compared 
with the nation as a whole. A recent poll by the independent weekly Zeta showed 
Zedillo leading with 43% of the vote in Baja compared to 25% for Fernandez. 
Internal PAN polls tell a different story, Alvarez contended. But those numbers 
are not public. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts note that being an incumbent has its disadvantages and that PAN state 
administrations have shown flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAN's popularity in Baja suffers because of the inevitable hardships and 
disillusionment that come with holding office, said Tonatiuh Guillen Lopez, a 
political scientist at Tijuana's College of the Northern Border. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baja California is by no means a fortress of the PAN," Guillen said. "This 
remains an important national source of votes for the PAN, but the party is in 
a much more fragile position here than it was in 1989" when it took power. 
</P>
<P>
 City and state leaders have been handicapped by inexperience, internal 
squabbles and an attitude toward power that verges on the old authoritarianism, 
critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen cited a proposal by Tijuana's mayor for a comprehensive, locally 
funded public works initiative -- an innovative concept developed with the aid 
of enthusiastic World Bank consultants. Although Guillen praises the plan 
itself, he said it was presented to voters as a fait accompli and, therefore, 
ran into resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAN has encountered similar problems in Chihuahua, said Leonel Reyes 
Castro, a PRI federal deputy from Chihuahua. "They have been very clumsy in 
presenting their program. They have not been able to win over either the other 
parties or the citizenry." 
</P>
<P>
 In Chihuahua, Barrio's authoritarian record as mayor of Ciudad Juarez from 
1983 to 1986 had worried some observers. Guillen said the often violent, 
controversial responses by police -- acting under Barrio's orders -- to street 
protests and sit-ins by neighborhood activists, teachers and students were 
"intolerant, repressive and, finally, undemocratic." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Barrio's political persona has become more moderate since he ran 
for governor. "The Barrio who was in Juarez bears little resemblance to the 
Barrio who is now in the state government. He now is practically a liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problems Barrio has faced as governor have been financial, 
starting with a $233-million debt left by the previous, PRI-run administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The debt was supposed to be paid with highway tolls. But traffic projections 
were optimistic, and toll income has run 40% below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with an insolvent pension fund and medical plan for state workers and 
restrictions on state powers to tax, the debt has left Mexico's largest state 
with a budget that is impossible to balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Neophyte opposition leaders in both Chihuahua and Baja California also have 
been battered by a frightening onslaught of narcotics-related violence, common 
in many Mexican states. 
</P>
<P>
 Chihuahua's rugged, inaccessible mountains have long been a favored area for 
cultivating marijuana and dropping off stronger drugs for transport across the 
border to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana's geographical value in the international drug trade has made the city 
a stage for brazen murders, shootouts and high-level police scandals. The 
bloodshed reached unprecedented heights this year with the assassinations of 
PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and of the Tijuana police chief 
-- crimes blamed on the mix of drugs and political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say crime has surged to anarchic levels; the tense security around 
the Baja governor and Tijuana mayor seems to symbolize a government under 
siege. PAN officials retort that drug violence is a problem that requires 
national and international solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, once in office, PAN leaders find themselves bogged down in the same 
problems that their PRI predecessors faced, making it difficult to accomplish 
all that they promised. "The PAN's platform was change," Reyes Castro said. "I 
have not seen a great deal of change. It's been mainly personal style." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, licenses are issued more quickly since the Barrio 
administration automated the state's data processing systems. But they cost 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure of public spending has not changed much either, he said. But 
much of the state budget is from federal revenue-sharing and must be spent on 
mandated programs, such as schools. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Reyes Castro said Barrio and his administration have made 
no major gaffes, which is about the evaluation offered by other residents of 
the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have run the government well," said Ever Fauda, 22, a college student. 
"They have denounced corruption and improved the flow of traffic. But I am not 
going to vote based on a party, but on the candidate. I will probably decide on 
election day." 
</P>
<P>
 Darling reported from Chihuahua and Rotella from Tijuana. Issues at Hand 
</P>
<P>
 The key issues Mexico's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEAN AND FAIR ELECTIONS: Both the government and civil groups have made 
unprecedented efforts to promote clean elections. But with a long history of 
vote fraud, many Mexicans may not even bother to go to the polls. One recent 
opinion poll showed that 53.6% believe the elections will be irregular, unclear 
or fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 PEACE: Some have warned that massive civil protest could ensue if there is any 
appearance of fraud in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 CHIAPAS: The armed Indian peasants in southern Chiapas State say they will 
refuse to recognize a PRI victory. Currently observing a cease- fire, they have 
threatened to resume hostilities if the elections are unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 DEMAND FOR CHANGE: After 65 years of rule by the PRI, many Mexicans are 
demanding change, giving strength to the opposition and forcing promises of a 
major restructuring from the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 STABILITY: Several independent pollsters concluded that many Mexicans feel the 
best choice for political and economic stability is to stay with the PRI; a 
change right now could be disasterous, they argue. The opposition says it can 
provide stability, too. 
</P>
<P>
 ECONOMY: Short term challenges are to keep the peso stable and prevent capital 
flight. Mexicans hope their economy will pick up after the elections put 
political uncertainty to rest.

SIMPSON CASE LAWYERS FEUD OVER DNA TESTS; COURTS: SHAPIRO WANTS PROSECUTION 
HELD IN CONTEMPT. CLARK DENOUNCES DEFENSE'S 'HYPOCRITICAL RAMBLINGS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emotional exchange over the testing of blood samples in the O.J. Simpson 
murder case, defense attorneys accused prosecutors Wednesday of lying and 
hiding evidence, prompting Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark to denounce what she 
called "hypocritical ramblings" intended to influence the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter exchange came during a status conference and erupted over a dispute 
about DNA tests -- a key element in the investigation of the June 12 murders of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. O.J. Simpson has pleaded not 
guilty to those killings. His trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 19, and with 
that date growing near, both sides Wednesday accused each other of withholding 
evidence that they are obligated to turn over to their adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Tourtelot, the lawyer for a Los Angeles police detective who 
discovered a key piece of evidence in the case, said he will fight a defense 
subpoena issued Aug. 10 for his client's military records. The lawyer said he 
does not expect the records to reveal anything damaging about Detective Mark 
Fuhrman's military service, but added that he considers the request an invasion 
of Fuhrman's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito said he has prepared a tentative schedule 
for the trial that anticipates it lasting through Christmas. Without 
explanation, Ito said he is not inclined to grant a two-day recess around 
Election Day, as the acting secretary of state had requested in an effort to 
ensure a higher voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito also changed his plans to issue a decision Friday on whether prosecutors 
would be granted access to a mysterious envelope handed over to the court by 
the defense during last month's preliminary hearing. A court spokeswoman said 
that after a closed-door hearing, the judge indefinitely tabled the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen revealed that the Los Angeles Police 
Department served a search warrant on Simpson's business office, Orenthal 
Enterprises. He did not disclose what the detectives were seeking, but sources 
said the warrant was issued in connection with a grand jury probe of Al 
Cowlings, Simpson's close friend who accompanied him after Simpson failed to 
surrender to authorities June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Re, the lawyer who represents Cowlings, said he did not know what 
authorities hoped to discover with the warrant. According to sources familiar 
with the case, a number of witnesses -- including Simpson's friend Robert 
Kardashian, Kardashian's girlfriend and four doctors who were at Kardashian's 
home on the morning that Simpson and Cowlings disappeared -- have been served 
with subpoenas ordering them to appear before the Los Angeles County Grand 
Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Simpson's first appearance in court, his lawyers and prosecutors have 
engaged in often testy exchanges. But Wednesday's was the most acerbic, and it 
erupted over a dispute about blood samples that prosecutors hope to have tested 
at a California Department of Justice lab in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who had previously indicated that all DNA tests of blood samples were 
being conducted at a Maryland lab, disclosed that defense attorneys were 
notified Friday that several other samples maintained by the Los Angeles Police 
Department were sent to a Berkeley lab. Clark said the defense was not told 
earlier about the new testing because she had assumed that the samples had 
already been sent to Maryland and only recently learned they had not. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark did not explain whether police or prosecutors were to blame for the 
miscommunication. Cmdr. David J. Gascon said police officials would not comment 
on the matter because they believe evidence should only be discussed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro, who has asked for portions, or "splits," 
of all samples so the defense can conduct its own tests, said in court he found 
it difficult to believe that prosecutors had just now come upon previously 
overlooked items of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems very bizarre to me that the lead prosecutor in the case does not 
communicate with the laboratory in charge of handling essential evidence in the 
case," Shapiro said, calling Clark's account "very questionable." 
</P>
<P>
 He accused prosecutors of violating Simpson's right to due process, and asked 
Ito to hold them in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro's accusations were echoed by the normally soft-spoken Uelmen. "What 
we're really dealing with here is an attitude problem," Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot rely on the good faith and the candor of the prosecution," he said. 
"I'm sorry to say that Your Honor cannot rely on that candor or good faith, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments from the defense lawyers infuriated Clark, who lashed back, 
accusing them of "hypocritical ramblings" and "hysterical proclamations" 
intended to influence public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers have long been aware of the issues concerning the DNA testing, 
Clark said, adding that she and her colleagues have promptly turned over 
information as quickly as they have received it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason that the defense claims to be surprised today is that they 
have not read what they've been given," Clark said, her voice trembling 
slightly. "Or if they have read it, perhaps they have not understood it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacing back and forth and occasionally jabbing the lectern with her pen, Clark 
accused Simpson's lawyers of leveling accusations solely to influence public 
opinion about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense proclamations of ignorance and being deprived . . . are 
nonsense," she said. "I'm getting very tired of hearing all of these hysterical 
proclamations about how they're being denied things and about what the 
prosecution is doing. If they would look at the discovery they've been given, 
they would know that their ignorance is their own fault. I cannot make them 
read." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clark said, prosecutors have gone so far to protect the defense's 
rights that Simpson's defense team "owes me not only an apology but a debt of 
gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark did not get the apology she sought, but Ito did not find her or any 
prosecutors in contempt, as Shapiro had requested. The judge ordered another 
hearing on DNA evidence next week. He also ruled that in the meantime, 
prosecution experts may begin preliminary work on the DNA samples sent to the 
Berkeley lab, provided that one of Simpson's experts is on hand to observe that 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The vitriolic disagreement over DNA tests highlighted a hearing that touched 
on many aspects of the case and featured jockeying not only by defense 
attorneys and prosecutors but by one of the investigating detectives as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers are seeking to subpoena Fuhrman's military records as part 
of their effort to show that Fuhrman is an unreliable witness. They have 
obtained public court records of a 1983 pension case in which he made racially 
charged comments and said he was preoccupied with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 City-hired psychologists suggested that Fuhrman was lying to get a pension -- 
a challenge to the detective's credibility that Simpson's attorneys hope to 
exploit. It was Fuhrman who saw a bloodstain on Simpson's Ford Bronco after the 
murders. Fuhrman later found a bloody glove at Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 After members of the defense team suggested that they might argue that Fuhrman 
planted the glove, the detective struck back, hiring a lawyer and threatening 
to sue Shapiro and the New Yorker magazine, which published some of the defense 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 That lawyer, Tourtelot, appeared in court Wednesday and said he intends to 
fight the defense request for access to his client's military records. "I want 
to make it clear that there's nothing in those files that we are concerned 
about," he said. "This is a fishing expedition that intrudes on his right of 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not rule on that issue, saying he would take up the matter Aug. 31 
when he will also consider a defense motion for access to the records of 
several officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said the motion will include requests 
for records of Fuhrman along with those of Detectives Philip L. Vannatter, Tom 
Lange and Ronald J. Phillips, the four detectives who responded to the murder 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, Simpson's lawyers must also turn over information about witnesses 
and evidence that may be introduced at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have begun turning over material to Simpson's attorneys. About 
2,000 pages of so-called discovery material was handed over Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman complained that all the defense team has 
supplied so far to prosecutors are two tape-recorded interviews. Under 
California law, the defense is normally required to turn over information about 
its witnesses and evidence 30 days prior to trial, but Simpson's lawyers argued 
that the circumstances of this case make that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito granted the short extension. He added that he expected defense attorneys, 
with their formidable group of lawyers and private investigators, to comply 
with that deadline.

U.S. TO TRY ISSUING MORE VISAS TO CUBANS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE and MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, concerned over the continued influx of Cuban 
refugees crossing the Florida Strait in crudely built boats and rafts, is 
preparing to try to stem the flow by making it easier for Cubans to obtain 
formal immigration visas at home. 
</P>
<P>
 After a daylong meeting of an interagency task force, senior Administration 
officials decided to bolster the capability of the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana -- which functions as an unofficial embassy -- to process applications 
from would-be immigrants, key officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The streamlined procedure, expected to begin within a few days, aims to cut 
back on the number of Cuban refugees seeking to enter the United States by boat 
-- by making it easier for them to go through traditional immigration channels. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also hope it will quell complaints by Cuban President Fidel 
Castro that the United States is worsening the exodus across the strait through 
immigration laws that reward those who try to reach the United States by boat 
while impeding applicants for normal visas. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which could be announced as early as today, marks another step in 
the Administration's effort to deal with the Cuban refugee problem. It has been 
worsening in the face of growing unrest in Cuba as the economy declines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been trying to cope with the situation with as little 
direct intervention as possible, warning Cuban Americans not to sail into the 
strait to pick up stranded relatives or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, these policies have had decidedly mixed results. While Cuban 
Americans generally have complied with the Administration's request that they 
stay at home, the number of Cubans seeking refuge by sailing to the United 
States has increased markedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard reported Wednesday that it had rescued 339 Cubans in 46 
separate groups on Tuesday -- the highest one-day total since the Mariel boat 
lift of 1980. On Monday, 272 Cubans were rescued. And indications were that 
Wednesday's total would swell to about the same number. 
</P>
<P>
 While the influx still is nowhere near as large as the 125,000 who crossed the 
strait in the Mariel boat lift over a five-month period in 1980, more than 
6,000 Cuban refugees have been picked up in the Florida Strait so far this year 
-- double the number for all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing refugee flow has alarmed state and local officials in South 
Florida, who fear being overwhelmed with demands for more social services and 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 271 (refugees) coming in today, including a 91-year-old woman," 
said Arturo Cobo, director of the Transit Home for Cuban Refugees, the first 
stop for many Cubans who make it to Florida. "And there are more out there. The 
Florida Straits are full of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials were guarded late yesterday about the plan to make it 
easier for Cubans in Havana to obtain immigration visas to the United States, 
insisting that the proposal must receive final approval before it is put into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration policy-makers conceded an announcement will be made soon, 
and members of Congress from the South Florida area were briefed late 
Wednesday. Congressional strategists said the lawmakers responded favorably. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials admitted Wednesday that the plan could face some snags. While 
officials believe they can increase the number of immigration applications that 
the U.S. Interests Section can process, they cannot legally expand the 
organization's staff without Cuba's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. law permits as many as 20,000 Cubans a year to enter through normal 
immigration channels, but only a few thousand do so because it is easier for 
them to escape to the United States by boat -- an entry that guarantees them 
residency status and eventual citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of standard immigration procedures for Cubans has been hampered by 
Castro's refusal to permit Cuban nationals to apply and by the inability of the 
U.S. Interests Section in Havana to process very many applications with a 
skeleton staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But policy-makers said the Administration hopes that, after complaining about 
the issue for months, Castro will be hard pressed to refuse a U.S. request to 
expand the section's visa-processing capability. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that plan, the Administration also is expected to take steps to 
underscore its "message" to Cubans -- and Cuban Americans -- not to try to 
navigate the Florida Strait in boats. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno is expected to repeat her warning 
that the Justice Department will prosecute Cuban Americans who sail out to pick 
up refugees and will return any refugees who use violence in obtaining passage 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 And Coast Guard vessels are expected to beef up their patrols. Coast Guard 
officials said the service has cutters and small boats available for quick 
deployment to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Cuban Americans in Miami appear to be complying with the 
government's appeal for them to stay home, Cubans who are eager to flee Havana 
and Mariel are taking advantage of every chance to leave the island in boats, 
many of them unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, U.S. officials said that the current influx of Cubans is 
demographically far different from the one in 1980. While the Mariel boat lift 
brought mainly able-bodied men, the current rush includes a high proportion of 
women, children and elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
 One Cuba-watcher in Miami said a Cuban official has estimated that, along 
Cuba's north coast, about 1,300 small boats could be used to continue the 
"slow-motion Mariel." 
</P>
<P>
 Current law requires the United States to grant resident status -- and 
eventual citizenship -- to any Cuban who escapes from that country by boat or 
plane. "There are not a lot of options under the Cuban Adjustment Act," one key 
official said. 
</P>

 The situation in Miami is chaotic. After a meal and a change of clothes, 
balseros , as the immigrants are called, are bused to Miami, where most have 
relatives. Those who have no shelter are put up in small motels and channeled 
to one of two resettlement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 At one, the offices of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Miami's Little Havana, 
people packed the third-floor halls Wednesday and spilled down three flights of 
stairs into the streets. Many were sunburned, evidence of their hard crossing, 
and most looked thin and tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give clothing to those who have no family here, those who are leaving 
town, and we help the others with places to live and jobs, if possible," said 
caseworker Esperanza Diaz. "They all just want to start their new life."

GAP NARROWS IN STANDOFF OVER ANTI-CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congressional supporters and opponents of President Clinton's beleaguered 
anti-crime bill narrowed some of their differences Wednesday but remained 
divided over the spending cuts that GOP lawmakers insist must be made to win 
their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after he promised Republicans that he would agree to some of their 
demands, Clinton received good news and bad news about the uphill effort to 
save a $33.2-billion bill whose passage is seen as a critical test of his 
Administration's ability to end gridlock in an intensely partisan Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news came when three more members of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
who had opposed the anti-crime bill's expanded death penalty provisions, agreed 
to switch their votes. Their reversals inched the Democratic leadership toward 
closing the eight-vote margin by which the House rejected a vote on the bill 
last Thursday in a procedural vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news was that 11 Republicans who broke party ranks to vote for the 
bill last week were threatening to withdraw their support. They said that they 
would do so unless Clinton accepts steeper cuts than the Democrats so far have 
been willing to make in the $7.4 billion earmarked for after-school sports 
activities, drug counseling and other crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 After declaring a truce in the fiercely partisan war that has raged over the 
last week, Clinton promised House GOP leaders Tuesday night that he would trim 
some of crime prevention funding. Republicans have ridiculed the spending as 
wasteful social spending that will have little effect on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But as both sides toned down the rhetoric and got to work on the numbers 
Wednesday, it was clear that the two sides remain far apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders were shopping around a proposal to cut the crime prevention 
programs by 5% across the board, with the savings being transferred to prison 
construction and other law enforcement initiatives that Republicans favor. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other Republican leaders, 
however, said that they would insist on cuts of about 50%, while the 11 GOP 
moderates who supported the bill said that they wanted to see at least $1 
billion, or about 15%, removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bottom line is $1 billion. . . . Without that we can't support it," said 
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), the unofficial spokesman for the GOP 
moderates, who have come under intense pressure from their leadership to switch 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that they cannot afford to lose those votes, Democratic leaders were 
said to be close to offering another compromise, in which one of two 
$600-million job-training programs would be dropped, a source close to the 
negotiations said. That plan would raise the savings to "nearly $1 billion 
along with the 5% cut," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would not say which program the leaders were considering cutting, 
the source indicated that the Democrats were looking for ways to satisfy the 
Shays group. "There is a way to close the gap with Shays, but the gap between 
what we're offering and what Gingrich wants is just not bridgeable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a middle ground," added Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.). "We 
just haven't found it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as the day wore on, early predictions that the House could complete 
action on the bill this week looked doubtful as the partisan rhetoric turned 
sour again amid mutual allegations of bad faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time the White House moves to meet the Republicans halfway, "they just 
escalate their demands," complained House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), 
adding that the GOP leaders still seem intent on "killing the bill" and are not 
serious about seeking a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats are still struggling with the idea that Republicans have to be 
treated like real human beings," retorted Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), one of the 
GOP leaders. "That's been a difficult concept for them to grasp." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Democrats said that the momentum once more appeared to be moving slowly 
toward final approval, following a morning meeting among Clinton and several 
members of the Black Caucus who were among the 58 Democrats voting against the 
anti-crime bill last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, three of the Democrats -- Reps. Charles B. Rangel of New York, John 
Lewis of Georgia and Cleo Fields of Louisiana -- said they had reluctantly 
agreed to set aside their reservations about the bill's expanded death penalty 
provisions. They said that they would do so to help Clinton prevail on what has 
become one of the most important legislative votes of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders hope that a victory on the anti-crime bill will help create 
the momentum they need to pass Clinton's health care reform package this fall. 
A loss, however, would not only stall that momentum but deprive the 
Administration of any major legislative accomplishments in advance of 
November's midterm elections, most Democrats believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was . . . selling his presidency, the party and the fact that we will not 
get a better bill than this," Rangel said of the appeal that Clinton made to 
the caucus members. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of progress, both sides indicated, was that one of the anti-crime 
bill's most controversial provisions -- a ban on the manufacture and sale of 19 
assault weapons -- no longer is a point of major contention between Democrats 
and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some of us who would still like to have that taken out of the bill 
. . . but most understand that's not going to happen and so it's not a key 
factor in what's being discussed now," said one of the GOP negotiators, Rep. 
Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
 The assault weapons ban has "receded into the background, and the focus now is 
all on the money," agreed Kennelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that appeared close to being resolved as the Democrats scoured 
both sides of the aisle for votes was language to strengthen a provision 
requiring convicted sexual offenders to report their addresses to authorities. 
At the request of several New York and New Jersey Republicans, that provision 
was amended to allow police to notify neighbors that a convicted sexual 
offender was living in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by these signs of progress, a delegation of mayors said after meetings 
with both Democratic and Republican leaders that it believes the anti-crime 
bill may finally pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime bill is the boost that we've all been waiting for to make our 
cities safe," said Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them known that we represent a lot of people who are fed up with crime 
and want to see a solution," added Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle.

TOUGHER QUAKE SAFEGUARDS AT SCHOOLS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The safety of schoolchildren cannot be guaranteed in a major earthquake unless 
educators aggressively step up disaster preparedness, a task force told a state 
Senate committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools and campus personnel must be better equipped for emergencies in order 
to ensure the well-being of students, the task force concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Impaneled after the Northridge temblor, the task force of San Fernando Valley 
activists delivered its biggest punch in the final pages of an 80-page report: 
the prediction of a "tsunami of litigation" against negligent school districts 
should a quake occur during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This task force has concluded that in order to save lives throughout our 
communities, disaster preparedness at all school sites must become a major and 
immediate priority," its members declared in the report to the Senate Select 
Committee on the Northridge Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While outlining recommendations to the fact-finding committee, co-chairwoman 
Diana Dixon-Davis noted that none of the last 10 major earthquakes in 
California have struck while children were in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much longer the luck for the state of California will hold. 
Statistically speaking, we are ripe for having a major earthquake during school 
hours," Dixon-Davis said. "We need to quit this gamble while we are ahead -- 
quit not being prepared, quit not being trained." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems evident in the Los Angeles Unified School District and 
elsewhere is the spotty implementation of safety procedures, which are in place 
on some campuses and not on others. 
</P>
<P>
 Many principals simply fail to follow through in adopting disaster plans 
passed down by their superiors, the panel found. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling for creation of an oversight agency with the authority to force 
compliance, Stephanie Carter, a parent activist and task force co-chairwoman, 
said: "We need somebody to actually come back with some muscle and make the 
site administrators do it. There's nobody back there beating the grass to make 
sure these things are getting done." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, only one-third of Los Angeles Unified School District sites have 
storage bins on campus to hold vital emergency supplies such as food and water 
in the event of building collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them districtwide," said Roger Rasmussen, an LAUSD disaster 
coordinator and task force member, noting that those inconsistencies could be 
corrected with more funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of supplying the containers to every school in California would 
amount to a one-time expenditure of $40 million, he said, urging the panel to 
support placing a bond measure on an upcoming ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also called on lawmakers to pass legislation requiring that 
loose classroom objects be secured so schoolchildren would not be injured if 
powerful shock waves were to rattle the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Small details such as the need to develop a brace to hold overhead lighting 
fixtures were called for by the task force, as well as the need to train 
teachers in first aid and search-and-rescue procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members also sought legislation requiring high school students to 
take classes in basic first aid techniques. In addition, they asked lawmakers 
to require teachers to undergo disaster preparedness training in order to 
obtain their credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the recommendations of the education task force, as well as a separate 
small-business task force, were state Sens. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley) and Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 The senators said they will examine the findings in an effort to find ways to 
shore up earthquake readiness at schools and the approximately 800 state and 
local agencies charged with implementing disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting how difficult it can be to arrive at solutions at a time of fiscal 
uncertainty, Hayden said he hoped the Legislature would depart from its typical 
pattern of "negligence and inertia." 
</P>
<P>
 "What will happen is that history will repeat itself unless we step in to 
intervene with tremendous energy," Hayden said. "I just believe it's negligence 
combined with inertia. And we're in the inertia phase now. . . . It's all 
around us when we're in a budget crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The small-business task force called for the introduction of a proposal they 
dubbed the Earthquake Mitigation and Recovery Act, warning that failure to act 
"will most assuredly lead to cataclysmic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to allow enactment of a broad set of emergency powers in the 
aftermath of a big quake, the proposed law addresses a wide swath of problems 
that surfaced after the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most significant to consumers, the act would mandate minimum training, 
testing and licensing of insurance adjusters, some of whom were recruited from 
out of state to handle the heavy load of claims after the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the education task force, the business leaders called for formation of a 
state oversight agency such as a California Earthquake Commission to coordinate 
earthquake preparedness and response information. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringent new rules requiring homeowners to become familiar with their gas 
shut-off valves and high-rise tenants to review emergency plans were included 
in the task force's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the task force called for periodic and regular upgrading of 
seismic building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Senate committee is scheduled to expire at the end of 1994, 
lawmakers said they hoped it would be extended into next year, allowing its 
various task forces to continue fact-gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposals lead to legislation proposals, it will be next year before 
any new bills are introduced.

FAMALARO KEPT TAPES OF MISSING PERSON SHOWS; CRIME: TV SUBJECTS INCLUDED DENISE 
HUBER, SAY NEWLY RELEASED POLICE REPORTS DETAILING MURDER INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH and KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement reports released Wednesday reveal that John J. Famalaro kept 
videotapes of television shows spotlighting missing persons -- including Denise 
Huber, the Newport Beach woman he is accused of murdering before carting her 
nude, handcuffed body about in a freezer for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports -- totaling nearly 350 pages -- recapped much of the investigation 
spawned by the chance discovery of Huber's body and Famalaro's subsequent 
arrest in Arizona last month on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arizona police checked out the possibility that the former Orange County 
resident might be responsible for other murders, they determined that other 
women whose personal effects were found in his Prescott Country Club home were 
in fact safe and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to finding Huber's bloodstained clothing and the contents of her 
purse, police searching Famalaro's Arizona home also found identity cards, 
driver's licenses or other belongings of a dozen other women, triggering fears 
that Huber might not be the only murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they assured themselves that the other women had not come to any harm, 
police did learn of several alleged instances in which Famalaro, who grew up in 
Santa Ana and lived for a time in Lake Forest and Laguna Hills, stalked, 
terrorized or harassed women with whom he had come in contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy L. Gowan of Lake Forest, who dated Famalaro for three years and was 
engaged to marry him around the time of Huber's disappearance, told Arizona 
authorities she became frightened and screamed and cried when the 37-year-old 
house painter once began pushing her around, got a "glazed" look in his eyes 
and tried to handcuff her as she attempted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arizona police officer who attended the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Reserve Academy with Famalaro told authorities that Famalaro once boasted about 
"stalking" a girlfriend because he suspected she was cheating on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was quoted by his fellow academy cadet as saying that he hid in 
bushes and used different cars to watch her house, and that he threatened her 
and her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman contacted by Arizona police recalled taking a real estate course with 
Famalaro and said he was relentless in his attempts to "hit on" one of her 
friends. Ironically, Famalaro would often warn the two women about the need to 
protect themselves from strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two went out of their way to avoid him, and believed he concocted tales 
about himself to seem more sympathetic in the hopes the women would date him, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of the women who came in contact with Famalaro were left with 
negative impressions. Rosey Cavez Walker of Dana Point, who was listed among 
the dozens of persons providing investigative leads to police, said she was so 
pleased with the painting job that Famalaro had done at her house the weekend 
after Huber's disappearance that she recommended the "cordial" house painter to 
others in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker even handed out Famalaro's business cards to her friends, and estimated 
that he may have painted 12 houses in her neighborhood alone. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was shocked last month when Famalaro's picture appeared with news 
reports about the discovery of Huber's body in a freezer that Famalaro kept 
running inside a rental truck parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw his face on television, I said, 'My God, that's John Famalaro.' 
The same guy who was all over my house. I immediately dug out my painting 
contract. . . . He had been at my house painting the weekend after (Huber) 
disappeared," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said she remembered that at that time Famalaro appeared to be ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked so bad that day, like death warmed over. He told me the doctor had 
diagnosed him with something near pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic, Walker said, that only recently have she and other neighbors 
begun to notice paint peeling from their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozens of videotapes seized by investigators seeking evidence 
linking Famalaro to Huber's death, Yavapai County sheriff's deputies found a 
videotaped television news account about Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro also appeared to have a fascination with Suzanne Somers. Many of the 
videotapes contained specials featuring the blond actress. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also several videotaped shows about notorious killers Jeffrey 
Dahmer and Charles Manson, along with episodes of "America's Most Wanted" and 
televised games of the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday, Gov. Pete Wilson signed extradition papers 
that should promptly result in Famalaro's return to Orange County, where he 
faces capital murder charges. Famalaro has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The extradition documents were being sent to Arizona Gov. Fife Symington via 
Federal Express, but the entire process is expected to take several days and 
might not hasten a formal Aug. 29 extradition hearing in an Arizona superior 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotapes, along with boxes of documents, were seized last month during 
an exhaustive search of Famalaro's cluttered home. The place was so cluttered 
with unpacked moving boxes that even his own mother -- who lives next door -- 
disliked visiting the unkempt home, according to the police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodied tools, including a hammer and crowbar, were also seized from the home 
and are still considered possible murder weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports released Wednesday also revealed that Huber's belongings, along 
with other women's clothing and items that appeared to be bloodied, were found 
in Famalaro's home in a box marked "Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Although police have uncovered no evidence that Famalaro has caused any other 
women harm, a Santa Monica private investigator contacted Arizona police to 
draw their attention to the fact that four other women disappeared in Southern 
California in the early 1990s in circumstances strikingly similar to those 
surrounding Huber's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one were abducted from their cars, clues were scarce and all 
disappeared on either the 3rd or the 27th of the month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my view, that means (those dates) are significant to somebody," said 
investigator Jay Jones. "I just think there is too much of a coincidence here." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the case of Nancy Huter, who disappeared March 3, 1992, seems 
chillingly similar to Huber's. 
</P>
<P>
 Huter, 36, of Thousand Oaks, disappeared from the Ventura County area nine 
months to the day after Huber vanished from the Corona del Mar Freeway. At the 
time of their disappearance, both women were driving Honda cars, and there were 
no signs of a struggle at the locations where the cars were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the Famalaro investigation in Orange County said officials 
have not ruled out the possibility of additional victims, but stressed that 
there is no immediate information to point in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the police reports, even men who knew Famalaro considered him 
strange, secretive -- and shady. Several told police Famalaro hired them to do 
backbreaking work transporting paint and other materials from California to 
Arizona, without rest, and then never paid them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another worker told police Famalaro was very reluctant to allow people into 
his home, and said Famalaro would hover about whenever he used the phone or the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man told authorities he was interested in starting a business with 
Famalaro but was left only with bills totaling more than $10,000 -- 
representing charges that Famalaro incurred and never paid. Gowan, Famalaro's 
ex-fiancee, told police he ran up several thousand in bills that he left 
behind, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona authorities arrested Famalaro last month after they went to his home 
to check out a report that he had a rental truck that had not been returned and 
was reported stolen. Police were expecting to find illegal drugs when they 
broke into the locked truck, and cut away a padlock on the freezer that held 
Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder case was transferred from Arizona to Orange County after Huber's 
blood was discovered in a Laguna Hills storage facility where Famalaro briefly 
set up housekeeping before moving to Arizona. Huber died from nearly a dozen 
blows to the head, and tests are pending to determine whether she was sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Famalaro abducted Huber after her car broke down on the 
Corona del Mar (73) Freeway while she was returning home from a rock concert, 
and killed her in the storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He purchased the freezer in which Huber's body was later found just a few days 
after her disappearance, but authorities still have not ruled out the 
possibility he kept her body in a standard kitchen freezer in the meantime.

CALIFORNIA DRIVERS STILL HITTING ROAD RIGHT OUT OF STATE; EXODUS: DMV FINDS 
THAT MORE LICENSED RESIDENTS MOVED OUT THAN IN FOR THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR. OF THE 
400,000 WHO LEFT LAST YEAR, 40,000 WERE FROM O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Adding to the evidence that the Golden State has been losing its allure, the 
Department of Motor Vehicles has reported for the third consecutive year that 
more licensed drivers moved out of California than moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 A record total of 400,008 joined an exodus to other states last year, 
according to DMV statistics released this week. More than 40,000 of them left 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, that's 126,105 more drivers reporting that they have left the state 
than the number of arrivals from elsewhere in the country. In Orange County, 
13,391 more left for other states than arrived from outside California. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in population studies say the new numbers probably reflect 
California's continuing economic woes as the state's recovery from recession 
lags behind the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement of licensed drivers, these experts say, provides the most 
up-to-date measure of the relative attractiveness of the state -- an 
undecipherable mix that includes business conditions and lingering concerns 
about California's plague of earthquakes, fires, and urban riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Finance has calculated that on the average, every two 
drivers who leave the state take another person with them. That means that more 
than 600,000 people statewide and about 60,000 in Orange County have moved to 
other parts of the country in the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because of foreign immigration and a relatively high birthrate, 
California's population continues to grow faster than the rest of the country 
-- even after migration to and from other states is taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver's license data compiled by the DMV is a symptom of business 
conditions, said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study 
of the California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver's license data is a lagging indicator. It tells you where the 
economy has been," Levy said. "People take awhile -- six months, a year, or two 
-- to make plans for a long-term move." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy and other economists believe that California's economy is slowly moving 
to recovery -- an improvement that will not show up for several months in the 
driver's license statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest DMV figures continue to show a net emigration of older 
Californians, particularly those 45 and older. At the same time, there has been 
a continuing net increase in younger drivers moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Morrison, a demographer at RAND in Santa Monica, sees the influx of 
younger people as a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "These relatively young adults are moving here by choice and not chance," 
Morrison said. "They're more motivated and more educated than average." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, many older Californians are moving elsewhere. The dual 
movement, young adults moving in and older ones moving out, is like the 
circulatory system, Morrison said. "If one thing is clear here, it's that 
California's population is circulating at a somewhat higher rate," he said. The 
new blood leaves California poised for a strong, long-term recovery, Morrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those drivers who moved out of California last year, the largest number 
moved to western states: 37,947 to Nevada; 33,432 to Washington; 30,512 to 
Oregon; 29,656 to Arizona, and 28,546 to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Those moving out of Orange County mirrored the state trend, flocking mostly to 
those same western states: 3,768 to Nevada; 3,430 to Arizona; 3,341 to 
Colorado; 2,939 to Washington and 2,244 to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those moving into the state came from across the country, including 
23,379 from Texas; 17,051 from New York; 14,167 from Florida, and 13,247 from 
Illinois. But a sizable number also came to California from the states of 
Washington, 16,815; Arizona, 17,274; Oregon, 12,081, and Nevada, 11,296. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County saw 2,344 arrive from Texas; 1,655 from Arizona; 1,392 from 
Illinois; 1,385 from Washington; 1,334 from Florida and 1,262 from New York.

WILDFIRE EVACUEES RETURN TO FIND HOMES GONE

<P>
 Dazed residents chased away by a fierce 76-square-mile wildfire still raging 
in Central California returned to their charred neighborhood Wednesday where 
chimneys stood like tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we find whoever did this," a solemn Gov. Pete Wilson told homeowners 
as he examined the arson-ravaged Tassajara Creek area, 150 miles northwest of 
Los Angeles in San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildfire destroyed 37 homes and charred 48,531 acres in picturesque hills 
and century-old thickets of brush. It was 85% contained Wednesday, with full 
containment expected Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California near the Nevada border, a fire that broke out Tuesday 
near a campground south of Sierraville exploded to cover at least 8,500 acres. 
Three campgrounds and a logging camp were evacuated and residents of about 30 
homes in a Loyalton subdivision were urged to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In other California fires Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Firefighters battled a wildfire near Mt. Baldy in Angeles National Forest. 
The fire blackened 600 acres, said Dianne Cahir, a fire information officer 
with the U.S. Forest Service. The blaze was 10% contained Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Subsiding winds and moist sea air helped firefighters battle a 635-acre 
wildfire in the hills above the Mendocino coastline. The fire was 75% 
contained, with full containment expected by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Luis Obispo County, the fight focused on the fire's southeast front, 
the rugged and uninhabited upper Lopez Canyon area east of U.S. 101. The fire 
was no longer threatening structures, and all roads in the area were reopened 
by Wednesday morning, said Thomas Williams, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Forestry based in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson told homeowners Wednesday that the state was offering a $50,000 
reward for information leading to the conviction of the arsonist who started 
the blaze off California 41 near Atascadero on Sunday afternoon.

ANAHEIM STADIUM PLAYS BALL -- FOR TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may have been the biggest baseball crowd Anaheim Stadium will see the rest 
of this season. In spite of the 6-day-old strike by major league baseball 
players, about 100 people caught a glimpse of the national pastime Wednesday at 
the Big A. Of course, they were paid to show up, and the baseball they were 
watching was all fantasy.The folks in the stands were Hollywood extras earning 
about $65 each for their background roles as baseball fans in Fox Television's 
new sports sitcom "Hardball." Cast and crew used Anaheim Stadium to film 
episodes for the half-hour comedy series, which premieres Sept. 4. In the hot 
afternoon sun, extras watched as the show's fictional team, the Pioneers, threw 
some pitches and swung a few bats. According to the show's story line, the 
Pioneers not only wear uniforms similar to the California Angels', but they 
also play like them. The team is struggling, about five games below .500.

SCHOOLS NOT QUAKE-SAFE, GROUP TELLS SENATE PANEL; EMERGENCIES: TASK FORCE WARNS 
THAT CHILDREN'S SAFETY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED UNLESS PREPAREDNESS IS QUICKLY 
IMPROVED. REPORT PREDICTS LAWSUITS AGAINST NEGLIGENT DISTRICTS.

 The safety of schoolchildren cannot be guaranteed in a major earthquake unless 
educators aggressively step up disaster preparedness, a task force told a state 
Senate committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools and campus personnel must be better equipped for emergencies to ensure 
the well-being of students, the Task Force on Education concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Impaneled after the Northridge temblor, the task force of San Fernando Valley 
activists delivered its biggest punch in the final pages of an 80-page report: 
the prediction of a tidal wave of lawsuits against negligent school districts 
should a quake occur during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This task force has concluded that in order to save lives throughout our 
communities, disaster preparedness at all school sites must become a major and 
immediate priority," its members declared in a report to the Senate select 
committee on the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While outlining recommendations to the fact-finding committee, co-chair Diana 
Dixon-Davis noted that none of the last 10 major earthquakes in California have 
struck while children were in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much longer the luck for the state of California will hold. 
Statistically speaking, we are ripe for having a major earthquake during school 
hours," Dixon-Davis said. "We need to quit this gamble while we are ahead -- 
quit not being prepared, quit not being trained." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems evident in the Los Angeles Unified School District and 
elsewhere is the spotty implementation of safety procedures, which are in place 
on some campuses and not on others. 
</P>
<P>
 Many principals simply fail to follow through in adopting disaster plans 
passed down by higher-ups in the district bureaucracy, the panel found. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling for creation of an oversight agency with the authority to force 
compliance, Stephanie Carter, a parent activist and task force co-chair, said, 
"We need somebody to actually come back with some muscle and make the site 
administrators do it." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, only one-third of Los Angeles Unified School District sites have 
storage bins on campus to hold vital emergency supplies such as food and water 
in the event of building collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them districtwide," said Roger Rasmussen, a school district disaster 
coordinator and task force member, adding that such inconsistencies could be 
corrected with more funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of supplying the containers to every school would amount to a 
one-time expenditure of $40 million, he said, urging the panel to support a 
proposed bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also called on lawmakers to pass legislation requiring that 
loose classroom objects be secured so schoolchildren would not be injured when 
powerful shock waves rattle classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force addressed small details, such as the need to develop a brace to 
hold overhead lighting fixtures, and big issues, such as the need to train 
teachers in first aid and search-and-rescue procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Task force members also sought legislation requiring high school students to 
take classes in basic first aid techniques. In addition, they asked lawmakers 
to require teachers to undergo disaster preparedness training to obtain their 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the recommendations of the education task force, and a separate 
small-business task force, were state Sens. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley) and Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 The senators said they will examine the findings to discover ways to shore up 
earthquake readiness at schools and the about 800 state and local agencies that 
provide disaster relief.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WHEN A TRIAL OVERSHADOWS CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the most celebrated murder trial of the generation is held simultaneously 
with one of the most boring election campaigns, political consultants get 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 They know voters won't be caring much about state bond ratings or a 
candidate's tax returns when prosecutor Marcia Clark is tracking O.J. Simpson's 
alleged trail of blood, or a witness is testifying about an intimate encounter 
with Nicole Simpson while her ex-husband was spying through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the trial gets bogged down in a scientists' debate over 
DNA testing, peoples' minds could wander. But the consultants aren't counting 
on it. Nobody really knows what to expect. There's no precedent for this. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest parallel probably was the Cuban missile crisis in late October, 
1962, which froze the public and the election campaigns. Thirty years later, a 
month before the primary election, the Los Angeles riots mesmerized all 
Californians and campaigning went on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 But both of these events were life-and-death matters that personally affected 
voters and perhaps their politics. The Simpson case is different. Except for 
the participants, this is a sporting event with the spectators having nothing 
personally at stake. What this means, however, is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's a genius on what to do. This is terra incognita," says political 
strategist Ken Khachigian, using the Latin term for "unknown territory." He 
adds, "This is what screws up political counselors more than anything else -- 
the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some things are just logical. The public has been ignoring the candidates as 
it is. And once the trial begins Sept. 19, they're likely to have more 
difficulty yet competing for attention, even if it is the campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
 To help Treasurer Kathleen Brown, a Simpson specialist has been designated for 
her gubernatorial campaign. The aide monitors case developments to make sure 
her Los Angeles events don't compete with Simpson news. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialist also monitors the whereabouts of TV cameras. And four times so 
far Brown has showed up at TV stakeouts for Simpson in an effort to get on the 
nightly news with her campaign pitch. Gov. Pete Wilson has tried this once. 
They've been less than successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make lemonade out of the lemons presented us," says John 
Whitehurst, Brown's press secretary. "The lemon is that TV political coverage 
is restricted because the stations' resources are stretched. The lemonade is 
that the cameras are clustered together for O.J. We're bringing the campaign to 
the cameras." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dilemma is when to run TV ads. Khachigian, who is advising two 
Republicans -- Senate nominee Mike Huffington and Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren -- 
says it will be risky to run political commercials during live trial coverage. 
But few viewers will be watching the other channels, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commercials can appear tasteless after some witness has talked about finding 
the bodies," the veteran consultant says. "I can't imagine too many ads that 
might seem right." 
</P>
<P>
 Most consultants will probably increase their TV buys during newscasts to 
capitalize on the additional viewers tuning in for trial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, the Democratic nominee for his office, 
says he is worried that candidates will escalate negative campaigning in order 
to attract their own news coverage. "They may push the envelope to compete with 
sensationalism." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Shumate, the campaign manager for Miller's opponent, Assemblyman Bill 
Jones (R-Fresno), says "there's not anything at all that I plan to do 
differently because of the trial. . . . That may just show my limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings up the point: Maybe the Simpson trial will have no significant 
effect on the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most TV stations don't want to cover politics and government anyway," asserts 
Kam Kuwata, campaign manager for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. "During a 
heat wave, they go to the beach, take pictures and tell viewers, 'It's hot 
today.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The trial's real impact may be minimal. Three weeks out from the election, 
swing voters will start looking for information like sponges." 
</P>
<P>
 But if they don't and there's a low turnout, most everyone agrees, that will 
help GOP candidates because conservatives tend to vote even when others stay 
home. Also, voter inattention especially hurts little-known candidates below 
governor and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The O.J. trial does throw an ugly wrinkle into this," notes George Gorton, 
Wilson's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, more candidates might try earning the voters' attention by treating 
them like intelligent adults rather than ignorant boobs, but that's another 
story.

AUDIT SAYS DMV IGNORED WARNING; FINANCES: STATE OFFICIALS KNEW ABOUT COMPUTER 
SYSTEM'S PROBLEMS IN 1990, YET SPENT $50 MILLION ON DOOMED PROJECT. SAFEGUARDS 
WERE BYPASSED, AUDITOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Top state administrators wasted $50 million on a doomed computer project at 
the Department of Motor Vehicles by violating contracting laws, repeatedly 
ignoring signs of trouble in the system and bypassing state cost control 
safeguards, according to a state audit released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstructing the seven-year history of a project that the Pete Wilson 
Administration abandoned this year, state Auditor Kurt R. Sjoberg said 
officials were provided with ample evidence of serious trouble as early as 
1990, when only $14.8 million had been spent on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet administrators in three state agencies, he said, ignored the warnings and 
pushed ahead with a first-of-its-kind project that would merge the state's 
massive driver's license database and its motor vehicle registration 
information into a single system. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years passed and more aspects of the system failed, Sjoberg said 
officials continued to pour money into the project, often circumventing rules 
and regulations designed to curb runaway government costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DMV continued its efforts . . . despite continued failures in critical 
aspects of its development, and, as a result, spent an additional $34.6 million 
on a project that ultimately failed," the state auditor wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators were so determined to proceed at all costs, he reported, that 
at one point bureaucrats allegedly violated state criminal laws by falsifying 
$46,000 in invoices to pay project consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 A DMV spokesman said four lower-level bureaucrats have been disciplined as a 
result of the findings, but he declined to give their names, citing privacy 
laws. He would say only that in disciplining the employees, the department had 
taken into consideration that their actions had not been for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic lawmakers responded quickly to the audit's findings, calling for 
better scrutiny of computer contracts and faulting the Wilson Administration 
for not stopping the DMV project sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DMV ignored unresolved problems every step of the way and stuck the 
taxpayers with a $50-million white elephant," said Assemblywoman Debra Bowen 
(D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) demanded 
that Wilson immediately fire two of his top administrators, whose names were 
not mentioned in the audit but whose actions were documented in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the audit showed clearly that state Lottery Director A.A. (Del) 
Pierce, who headed the DMV during the early critical phases of the project, and 
Steve Kolodeny, director of the Office of Information Technology, had "major 
roles in the scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me there are two choices here for what happened," Katz said. 
"Either there were conflicts of interest or gross incompetence, either one of 
which are grounds for termination." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kolodeny, who has removed himself from the day-to-day operations of 
the Office of Information Technology, nor Pierce was available for comment. 
Kolodeny was on vacation. A spokesman for the lottery said Pierce, who is 
gravely ill with cancer, has been on medical leave for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson moved immediately to distance himself from the debacle and 
his DMV director, Frank Zolin, who made the decision to abandon the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing that he had inherited the DMV computer problems, Wilson criticized 
the Administration of his Republican predecessor, Gov. George Deukmejian, 
saying it was "outrageous that this project was implemented in such a slipshod 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 While praising Zolin for "doing the right thing" in canceling the project, the 
governor said he was nevertheless "disappointed the department was not more 
aggressive in surfacing the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff said that when Zolin took over the department, $34 
million had been spent on the computer system. He said Zolin pumped millions 
more into the project in a desperate but futile attempt to revive it and save 
the state's investment. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, he said Zolin now wishes that he had moved with greater speed to 
kill the project, though the documents available to him at the time did not 
reveal the enormity of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Zolin from the start has said the whole story needs to be put before 
the public and it is a cautionary tale for all government agencies," Nossoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they had no plans to fire anybody but the audit 
would be turned over to Business, Transportation and Housing Secretary Dean 
Dunphy to "review the findings for possible disciplinary action." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the audit, Wilson said he would issue an order prohibiting 
agencies from awarding non-competitive contracts -- a problem found in the 
audit -- except in emergency situations. He said he would also direct all 
department heads to follow contracting rules and regulations "to the letter of 
the law," threatening them with disciplinary action if they did not. 
</P>
<P>
 In the DMV report released Wednesday, the auditor traced the actions of the 
DMV back to 1987 to show how officials repeatedly altered customary procedures 
to push the project forward. The findings showed that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The department initially decided to use Tandem Corp. computers for its new 
data system even though they did not pass a key element in the tests that the 
DMV was using to analyze their capabilities. That flaw -- an inability to 
process transactions in less than a second -- was ultimately a factor in the 
decision to abandon the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department, despite promising to do so, failed to develop a working 
model for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * The department, based on other data gathered while developing the system, 
had enough documented evidence by 1990 "to indicate that the project's 
feasibility was in doubt." But instead of re-evaluating the project, the 
auditor said officials moved to fully implement it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite new reports in 1991 and 1992 showing more evidence of "serious 
problems with the project," department officials pushed on. 
</P>
<P>
 * Much of the documented evidence of problems with the project were forwarded 
to the Office of Information Technology. But OIT continued to approve funding. 
</P>
<P>
 If OIT had done its job, the auditor said, the project would have been halted 
and the state would have saved millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the audit found that the DMV awarded at least four contracts 
without competitive bidding, in violation of state contracting law, and that 
the department falsified a purchase order.

HITTING THE ROAD; RECORD NUMBER OF DRIVERS JOIN EXODUS, DMV SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding to the evidence that the Golden State has been losing its allure, the 
Department of Motor Vehicles has reported for the third consecutive year that 
more licensed drivers moved out of California than moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 A record total of 400,008 joined an exodus to other states last year, 
according to DMV statistics released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 126,105 more drivers reporting that they have left the state than the 
number of arrivals from elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in population studies say the new numbers probably reflect 
California's continuing economic woes as the state's recovery from recession 
lags behind the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement of licensed drivers, these experts say, provides the most 
up-to-date measure of the relative attractiveness of the state -- an 
undecipherable mix that includes business conditions and lingering concerns 
about California's plague of earthquakes, fires, and urban riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Finance has calculated that on the average, every two 
drivers who leave the state take another person with them. That means that more 
than 600,000 people have moved to other parts of the country in the fiscal year 
that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because of foreign immigration and a relatively high birthrate, 
California's population continues to grow faster than the rest of the country 
-- even after migration to and from other states is taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver's license data compiled by the DMV is a symptom of business 
conditions, said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study 
of the California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver's license data is a lagging indicator. It tells you where the 
economy has been," Levy said. "People take awhile -- six months, a year, or two 
-- to make plans for a long-term move." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy and other economists believe that California's economy is slowly moving 
to recovery -- an improvement that will not show up for several months in the 
driver's license statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest DMV figures continue to show a net emigration of older 
Californians, particularly those 45 and older. At the same time, there has been 
a continuing net increase in younger drivers moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Morrison, a demographer at RAND in Santa Monica, sees the influx of 
younger people as a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "These relatively young adults are moving here by choice and not chance," 
Morrison said. "They're more motivated and more educated than average." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, many older Californians are moving elsewhere. The dual 
movement, young adults moving in and older ones moving out, is like the 
circulatory system, Morrison said. "If one thing is clear here, it's that 
California's population is circulating at a somewhat higher rate," he said. The 
new blood leaves California poised for a strong, long-term recovery, Morrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those drivers who moved out of California last year, the largest number 
moved to Western states: 37,947 to Nevada; 33,432 to Washington; 30,512 to 
Oregon; 29,656 to Arizona, and 28,546 to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those moving into the state came from across the country, including 
23,379 from Texas; 17,051 from New York; 14,167 from Florida, and 13,247 from 
Illinois. But a sizable number also came to California from the states of 
Washington, 16,815; Arizona, 17,274; Oregon, 12,081, and Nevada, 11,296. The

 The Department of Motor Vehicles keeps track of licensed drivers who leave 
California as well as arrivals. Even though more drivers have been moving out 
recently, California's population continues to grow faster than the rest of the 
nation because of foreign immigration and a relatively high birthrate.

OPPOSITION SOCIALIST ALLIANCE WINS PLURALITY IN SRI LANKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A socialist alliance that wants to try negotiating an end to Sri Lanka's 
11-year-old civil war emerged as the top vote-getter in the troubled island 
nation's parliamentary election, official results showed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as happy backers of the People's Alliance celebrated their victory by 
exploding firecrackers, the ruling United National Party was furiously trying 
to cobble together a coalition to safeguard its 17-year unbroken grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
 With the voters' verdict now leaving no single party with a working 
legislative majority, whoever forms Sri Lanka's new government will find it a 
"dicey affair," predicted Gamini Wijesekara, United National Party general 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's vote, the leftist People's Alliance won 105 seats to the ruling 
party's 94, according to the tally issued by the election commissioner's 
office. (The other 26 seats were captured by minority Hindu and Muslim 
parties.) 
</P>
<P>
 The balloting, in which an estimated 75% of Sri Lanka's nearly 11 million 
voters took part, was a virtual referendum on President Dingiri Banda 
Wijetunga's liberal economic policies, on the hard line he has taken toward the 
Tamil ethnic insurgency and on alleged widespread official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 After the proclamation of the returns, Wijetunga is supposed to choose a new 
prime minister. But since neither his party nor the People's Alliance won an 
outright 113-seat majority in the 225-member legislature, it was not clear 
Wednesday night what he would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appeal to all my countrymen to remain calm," Wijetunga said in a televised 
address. "You may rest assured that I will be acting in terms of the 
constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 The election followed the most violent political campaign in the Indian Ocean 
nation's history. More than 3,000 street clashes were reported in the monthlong 
run-up to election day, and at least 20 people, most of them allied with the 
opposition, were slain. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Tamil guerrillas, who called for a voter boycott, blew up a navy 
ship in northern Sri Lanka, killing two sailors. But otherwise, the insurgents 
-- who are fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east 
-- did not try to disrupt the election. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent any unrest, Wijetunga declared a state of emergency immediately 
after the polls closed. On Wednesday, he extended a round-the-clock curfew 
until Friday, and soldiers patrolled the nearly empty streets of the capital, 
Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambling to stay in power, the United National Party on Wednesday night was 
reportedly trying to entice the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, a People's Alliance 
ally that won seven parliamentary seats for itself, into a coalition by 
offering it three Cabinet positions. Sources in the ruling party confidently 
predicted they could win over the Muslim group, as well as three Tamil parties 
that won a total of 17 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the five-party People's Alliance also started wooing the small 
minority parties to forge a majority in Parliament. Vehicles were sent to the 
north and east of the island to bring the leaders of the Tamil groups to 
Colombo for negotiations, one alliance source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition alliance -- led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which ruled the 
island from 1970 to 1977 -- campaigned for an end to what it termed widespread 
government graft and corruption. It also pledged to negotiate with the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Wijetunga took power in May, 1993, after strongman President Ranasinghe 
Premadasa was blown up by a suicide bomber believed to be a Tamil rebel. 
Although far from being as highhanded as his predecessor, Wijetunga has flatly 
refused to consider negotiations with the insurgents, saying the problem is not 
one of ethnic discontent but of terrorism.

AMERICAN ALBUM: PUSH FOR NEW ALASKA CAPITAL LEAVES JUNEAU COLD; VOTERS ARE 
BEING ASKED TO ABANDON THE ISOLATED CITY IN FAVOR OF THE SMALL TOWN OF WASILLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nestled at the foot of majestic mountains along Alaska's famed inland 
waterway, Juneau was a great place to build a fishing community and tourist 
center. But as most Alaskans will tell you, it was a lousy place to build the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, this is where the seat of government is, much to the 
consternation of many of the state's half-million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessible only by sea or air, Juneau is cut off from the major population 
centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks hundreds of miles to the north. So ever 
since Alaska became a state in 1959, there has been a move afoot to relocate 
the capital closer to Anchorage. Not too close, of course, or the people of 
Fairbanks will fight it, but that's another part of this continuing saga. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when the people of Juneau thought they had beaten down the threat 
completely, it has risen from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's an outrage that the majority of the population is not able 
to access the capital and become a part of the process," said Democratic state 
Rep. Pat Carney, author of a November ballot initiative that would move the 
capital to the small farming town of Wasilla, about a 45-minute drive from 
Anchorage. Carney is from Wasilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Juneau Mayor Jamie Parsons says the issue "just kind of festers" year in and 
year out, and the latest effort is little more than an attempt by Carney to 
steal the capital despite dire economic consequences for Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why" Carney has brought the issue up again, Parsons said. "I 
guess it's just greed." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to relocate the capital began in 1960, and voters rejected the 
issue. Two years later, it was defeated again. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, voters decided to move the capital to a town that did not even exist. 
The site was Willow, a wide spot in the highway between Anchorage and 
Fairbanks. But in 1978, a ballot initiative requiring voter approval for 
funding was passed, and a $966-million bond issue was defeated. Another funding 
initiative for $2.8 billion was defeated in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carney resurrected the issue this year, and the new initiative is couched 
in terms that might make it more palatable to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative simply says that as of Jan. 1, 1997, the Alaska state capital 
will be in Wasilla. If it passes, Wasilla will be the capital, "whether we have 
any buildings or not," Carney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings, he said, can come later, and they will be built by local 
interests and rented to the state. Since the state now rents most of the 
offices it uses, Carney says, there will be no added cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Juneau officials are outraged over that claim, noting that the projected cost 
of moving the capital more than a decade ago was in excess of $2 billion. 
Voters rejected it then, despite the fact that the state was awash with oil 
money. So it might seem reasonable to expect them to reject it now, when oil 
revenues are down and the state is facing a fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney says costs should not be an issue. Once voters realize that he isn't 
proposing building a new city, as was the case the last time, the measure will 
pass, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state is divided. Nearly all of southeastern Alaska opposes the idea 
out of fear of losing jobs in the Juneau area. And Fairbanks, second in size 
only to Anchorage, also is largely opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fairbanks and the interior of Alaska is extremely jealous of Anchorage's 
size, and they are adamant against giving Anchorage any other reason to grow," 
Carney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move could devastate Juneau, Parsons contends. Juneau has about 30,000 
residents, 20,000 of whom are dependent on the capital being here for their 
livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney, who says he doesn't buy those figures, concedes that the economic 
impact on Juneau could be substantial. But he doesn't think that justifies 
keeping the capital here. 
</P>
<P>
 Juneau, he noted, is the only capital in the country that is not accessible by 
road. You can drive by putting your car on a ferry for part of the trip, but 
even then traveling from Anchorage to Juneau requires passing through a foreign 
country, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Juneau residents are gearing up for a major battle. The last time, 
they spent nearly $1 million to fight the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "To disrupt government and move the capital when there are so many other 
needs," Parsons says, is a problem Juneau really doesn't need. He says that for 
far less than it would cost to move the capital, a highway could be built out 
of Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the battle continues.

YELTSIN VOWS AID IN PROBING NUCLEAR CONTRABAND CASES; RUSSIA: THE PRESIDENT'S 
PROMISE IN A LETTER TO GERMAN CHANCELLOR KOHL CONTRASTS WITH MOSCOW'S DENIALS 
THAT IT IS THE SOURCE OF SMUGGLED PLUTONIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has written to German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl promising Moscow's cooperation in investigating recent cases of nuclear 
contraband seized in Germany, a Bonn spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was the first direct offer of help from the Russian government, 
which has publicly denied German assertions that Russia is the source of 
nuclear materials seized in Germany over the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders are friends, and Kohl had written to Yeltsin last weekend. 
Bernd Schmidbauer, Kohl's minister overseeing intelligence services, is to fly 
to Moscow this weekend with the results of scientific examinations of the 
samples to discuss the smuggling issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Atomic Energy Commission in Luxembourg said on Wednesday that at 
least two of the plutonium samples almost certainly originated in Russia and 
that at least one of them came from a nuclear weapons facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm Gmelin, director of the European Safeguards Directorate at the 
commission, said an analysis of six grams (0.2 ounce) of plutonium found in the 
garage of a salesman in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg last May 
showed "the chances are very high that it is from weapons material." 
</P>
<P>
 Gmelin said the plutonium was mixed with a substance called gallium, "which 
normally is not used in any civilian application." 
</P>
<P>
 Adolf Jaeckle, the salesman, originally was arrested on suspicion of 
counterfeiting. German television's NDR network reported that police found the 
cards of two Russian scientists from Moscow's Kurchatov Institute in Jaeckle's 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gmelin and the Bavarian state interior minister have said 10.7 ounces of 
plutonium-239 seized in Munich also apparently came from Russia and was 
produced for use in weapons. That cache was discovered in a suitcase on a 
Lufthansa flight from Moscow, and three passengers, two Spaniards and a 
Colombian, were arrested. The sample proved to be 87.2% pure plutonium-239 -- 
which, Gmelin said, "rules out any civilian use in the European Community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gmelin warned that, even as experts narrow the origins of the plutonium 
samples, they do not necessarily know how or from which facilities they made 
their way onto the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutonium is used in Russia for making nuclear weapons. It is also a byproduct 
of atomic energy production in plants that use enriched uranium. Russia has 
specialized industrial uses for plutonium, such as smoke detectors and 
pacemakers, and does civilian as well as military research with the radioactive 
element. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the weekly newspaper Die Woche, a Russian official 
charged with cleaning up the Chernobyl nuclear power station after it exploded 
in 1986 warned that more nuclear material than suspected may already have been 
smuggled out of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can control this atomic smuggling," Vladimir Chernosenko told Die 
Woche. "This industrial sector was traditionally controlled by the KGB. . . . 
Now those structures have fallen away and there is no more control." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, the government continued to publicly deny that any plutonium is 
missing from Russian facilities and to charge that Germans have political 
motivations for exaggerating the smuggling issue. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Munich seizure -- the largest illegal plutonium cache ever discovered 
-- Yuri A. Rogzhin, spokesman for Russia's Federal Inspectorate of Nuclear and 
Radiation Security, said, "I think that this action is purely political. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passengers were detained before they approached customs. This shows that 
the German special services knew about the cargo," he said. "The fact that the 
Germans did not get in touch with us proves that they do not want to settle and 
investigate this incident." 
</P>
<P>
 But Valery F. Davydov, an independent Russian non-proliferation specialist, 
said nuclear security is the most sensitive issue in Russia and that an 
independent assessment of the problem is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "All specialists are tied to secret and semi-secret ministries and are afraid 
to say something that will not be in line with official policy," Davydov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political commentators in both countries have suggested that the German 
government is using the issue to bolster Kohl's reelection campaign and 
strengthen his bid for a German seat on the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's envoy, Schmidbauer, briefed the multi-party Parliamentary Control 
Commission on the smuggling issue behind closed doors Wednesday morning. German 
television's ZDF network reported that he told the legislators "of offers and 
buyers, the involvement of former KGB connections and at least in one case of 
official Russian authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said scientists with the U.S. 
National Weapons Laboratories have largely concluded that seized materials they 
have examined are of such high quality and grade that they could have come only 
from research facilities -- not from the former Soviet arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Melissa Healy in Washington and Andrei Ostroukh of The 
Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report.

WALESA CALLS FOR REMOVAL OF EX-SPY FROM POST IN POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Lech Walesa called Wednesday for the removal of the new head of 
Poland's civilian intelligence service, saying his history as a top 
Communist-era spy could sour relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa praised the "professionalism and many years of experience" of Marian 
Zacharski, who was appointed to the post Monday, but said his exploits as a 
Soviet Bloc spy overshadowed his credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nomination could make Poland's process of integration with the West more 
difficult," a vacationing Walesa said in a brief statement released by his 
office as debate here and abroad spread about the controversial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacharski was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States in 1981 
after being convicted in federal district court in Los Angeles of obtaining 
secret information on the U.S.-made B-1 bomber, the F-15 fighter and radar 
systems used in Patriot air-defense missiles. But he was returned to Poland in 
a dramatic East-West spy exchange four years later and welcomed as a patriot by 
Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa's call for Zacharski's removal, in a formal letter to the interior 
minister, reflected the mixed feelings throughout democratic Poland about the 
elevation of a Communist-era hero to so sensitive a post. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the president's office would not comment, leaders from across the 
Polish political spectrum said it was unlikely Zacharski was offered the job 
without Walesa's concurrence. Under an informal agreement with the government, 
Walesa oversees three ministries, among them the Interior Ministry, which 
includes the intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers Wednesday to a popular talk radio show criticized the appointment 
as a dangerous retreat from Poland's democratic accomplishments, while others 
said the government was right to pick the best possible candidate for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Several right-wing political parties and groups with ties to the United States 
sharply condemned the move and called for the resignation of those responsible 
for it, but the country's largest opposition party was considerably milder in 
its criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski, who was also vacationing, is expected 
to return to Warsaw today to respond to Walesa's request, but it was unclear 
Wednesday whether he will ask Zacharski to step down. Neither Zacharski nor his 
direct supervisor, the head of the Office for State Protection, would comment.

AS FRENCH DEPART, MORE RWANDANS HEAD FOR ZAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On this day, there are only 20,000 to 30,000 of them on the road out of 
southwestern Rwanda: children carrying babies on their backs, old women 
trembling on weak knees, mothers carrying reed mats for sleeping -- and perhaps 
dying -- on. 
</P>
<P>
 All have the same wide-open, fearful stare. 
</P>
<P>
 For 100 mountainous miles to the east and 75 miles to the north, long columns 
of refugees are traveling the two roads out of the U.N.-protected "safe zone" 
in Rwanda and toward the remote Zairian border town of Bukavu. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no haste. This is not -- at least not yet -- a repeat of the fear 
that sent 1 million Rwandans fleeing into Goma, Zaire, last month in front of 
advancing troops. But only in Rwanda, in the summer of 1994, could a river of 
20,000 to 30,000 displaced people be regarded as an ordinary event, not yet a 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The French marines and soldiers who have shielded them since late June 
relinquished command of much of the region Wednesday to U.N. troops from the 
West African nation of Ghana. But 200 French remain on the ground until their 
pullout deadline Monday, and the refugees feel no prod of panic. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 1 million other Rwandans huddled in this part of the 
country. And relief workers here save the word crisis to describe what would 
happen if even half those refugees took to the roads in the coming 100 or so 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it stays at 20,000 to 30,000, we can handle them. But add a zero and we're 
going to be in a mess," said an aid worker with the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly worrisome are the two bridges that cross the Rusizi River into 
Zaire. Single-lane and wooden, the crossings are perfect choke points for mass 
calamity if a large number of refugees should arrive simultaneously and somehow 
be stampeded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the sea of people on both sides of the border stretched for 
miles. About 200,000 to 300,000 Rwandans have gathered near here already. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are walking right up to the Zairian border, then setting up camp, ready 
to flee or prepared to stay, all depending on their best last-minute hunch for 
survival. Are the odds better in a squalid Zairian refugee camp? Or in facing 
their old enemies in the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which now 
controls all of the country except this safe zone? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid. The RPF is tying up people by the arms and burning them," said 
Isaac Bakundukize, who was resting on the long march through the mountain 
forest of this national park. "My family? Some are here, and some have parted." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with Westerners, it is almost always the young, forceful men who 
speak out most strongly in favor of fleeing the country. One cannot help but 
wonder at each stop: Which of these men is running because of guilt? Who of 
them are Hutus who joined in the massacre of perhaps 500,000 rival Tutsis 
before the Tutsi-led rebel army took over the country last month? 
</P>
<P>
 The roads out of Rwanda are full of murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are "those that are fleeing and those who have reason to flee," said 
French Marine Col. Erik de Stabenrath. On Wednesday, he relinquished command of 
the French garrison in the center of this zone to Ghanaian troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few days, the French and the United Nations, in cooperation with 
the new Tutsi-dominated government, have pleaded with Rwandans to trust the 
United Nations and not flee. 
</P>
<P>
 De Stabenrath said the campaign has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is absolutely calm, showing the confidence the people have in 
the Ghanaian army," he said at change-of-command ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many refugees in the better-organized camps held fast Wednesday as a 
result of the lobbying. But thousands of others who came from areas where the 
leadership is weak, or already on the run, told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 From the hub townships of Gikongoro and Kibuye, unbroken, moving chains of 
refugees -- sometimes as dense as 1,000 people a mile -- plodded under 
drenching rain. Only a few refugees own umbrellas or plastic garbage bags. The 
rest suffered silently under the sullen sky and in the gooey red mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-horned cattle moaned and clattered along in the columns with the refugees 
and throngs of goats and occasional dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Balanced on heads and gripped awkwardly in callused hands are the only things 
these people can carry from their past into their future: soggy bedrolls, pans, 
gasoline cans, baskets, gourds, machetes, an ancient sewing machine, a 10-pound 
sack of relief food. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them walk, and most of them on bare feet, slapping quietly over the 
winding mountain roads. 
</P>
<P>
 And every time they are asked why, they crush around with pleading faces and 
ask back: "We're afraid, we don't know -- what can you tell us?"

BOSNIA SERBS DEMAND FUEL AS PEACEKEEPERS' TOLL; BALKANS: A LETTER FROM THE 
SQUEEZED REBELS WARNS THAT TO PASS CHECKPOINTS WILL REQUIRE SUPPLYING GASOLINE. 
THE U.N. MISSION SAYS IT WON'T COMPLY.

<P>
 Hampered by a blockade imposed by their allies in the rump Yugoslavia, Bosnian 
Serb forces Wednesday turned to the U.N. Protection Force with a demand for 
fuel to run their sputtering war machine. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter delivered from Bosnian Serb headquarters in nearby Pale to the U.N. 
command center here put peacekeepers on notice that they would be barred from 
traveling through Bosnian Serb-held territory unless they supplied rebels with 
gasoline at each armed checkpoint, said U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is blackmail, and we will not comply," Annink said of the demand issued 
by the increasingly isolated, desperate regime of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel threat to block all U.N. movements through Bosnian Serb-held 
territory that surrounds most peacekeeping bases could grind the U.N. mission 
to a halt, preventing the 20,000 foreign troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 
carrying out their tasks of escorting humanitarian aid to civilian war victims 
and providing a modicum of protection to besieged U.N. "safe havens." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs loyal to Karadzic have been feeling the pinch of a fuel shortage 
since their supply line was shut down two weeks ago by their longtime patrons 
in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, who have been angered by the rebels' 
rejection of an international peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs grow enough food and get sufficient humanitarian aid to feed 
themselves. But they have been dependent on Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic for spare parts and fuel to run the tanks, armored vehicles and other 
war machinery that he and his regime inherited from the former Yugoslav 
National Army and passed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic, chief architect of the Balkan conflict, appears to have cut off his 
Bosnian proxies to pressure them into signing the peace plan, as well as to 
undermine Karadzic, who has become an unreliable surrogate, as Bosnian Serbs 
increasingly assert their independence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karadzic, backed by ardent nationalists committed to Milosevic's original 
goal of uniting all Balkan Serbs in an expanded Greater Serbia, has refused to 
give up any of the seized territory in exchange for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials concede that the rebels have been violating U.N.-proclaimed 
weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and the eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave 
of Gorazde with impunity, and even an anti-sniping accord concluded last 
weekend has been largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not deny that sniping has continued," Annink said of the hail of bullets 
that peppered a high-rise apartment building and the Holiday Inn hotel on the 
government side of the front line Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Following standard U.N. policy of emphasizing positives in a mission gone 
badly wrong, Annink noted that the number of cease-fire violations in this 
battered capital had "dropped dramatically" to 460 Tuesday from the previous 
day's 684. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch-all term of cease-fire violation now encompasses an array of actions 
ranging from hijacking heavy weapons from U.N. impoundment sites to firing 
rocket-propelled grenades with more destructive power than some of the 
artillery shells banned by a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ultimatum in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than knuckling under to pressure from Belgrade to sign the peace plan, 
the rebels have become emboldened by the U.N. mission's hesitant response to 
their belligerence -- culminating in the fuel extortion attempt, which 
effectively holds hostage the entire U.N. peacekeeping force here. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.N. officials insisted the mission had no intention of complying, they 
replied by reiterating their frequent threat: "The code word for our mission in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is freedom of movement. If they deny us this, they are 
saying, 'We don't need you, we don't want you here,' " Annink said of the 
Serbs' demand for gasoline. "If they do this, we will have to reconsider our 
mission." 
</P>
<P>
 France and Britain, which contribute the largest peacekeeping contingents in 
Bosnia, have announced that they will withdraw their forces if the United 
States follows through on plans to exempt the Muslim-led Bosnian government 
from a U.N. arms embargo imposed on all of the former Yugoslav federation in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Both European powers fear that their peacekeepers would become targets of 
retaliation by the Bosnian Serbs, who would see the lifting of the arms embargo 
currently shackling their enemies as a form of Western intervention against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton warned last week that he will push to get the embargo lifted 
after Oct. 15 if the Bosnian Serbs still have not agreed to the peace plan 
drafted by diplomats from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Karadzic leadership has already rejected the proposal three times and 
plans to put it to a popular vote on Aug. 27 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Vatican on Wednesday set Sept. 8 as the provisional date for a 
one-day visit to Sarajevo by Pope John Paul II, the Reuters news agency 
reported.

$20-MILLION PROJECT TO ASSIST BRAZIL'S NEGLECTED CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it a model for programs worldwide, the Inter-American Development Bank 
and Brazilian officials launched a $20-million project Wednesday to aid this 
nation's growing and embarrassing number of neglected, homeless children. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide program is a departure for the bank, which until a few years 
ago supported only transportation and energy projects. In recent years, the 
bank has branched into environmental programs, such as sewer construction and 
the cleanup of Rio's Guanabara Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 At a signing ceremony, bank President Enrique Iglesias said the agreements 
should signal to the international community his institution's increased 
interest in involving itself in programs affecting local social problems. 
"These projects can be a model for what Inter-American Development Bank can do 
in other countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said the bank decided earlier this year to direct most of its 
new capital to social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate agreements with six cities, the bank will provide $18 million to 
34 non-governmental organizations to provide education, housing, job training, 
day care, health care and recreation for 53,000 homeless or poor children 
during the next four years. The cities agreed to provide $2 million in funding 
or services to the organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials said they accepted proposals presented by Brazil after the 
first year's success of an $8-million program to aid homeless children in Rio 
de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the experience that we had in Rio de Janeiro, we want to do more improve 
the plight of the children," said a bank spokesman. "We want them treated in a 
more integrated way with society." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new grants may appear paltry compared with billion-dollar 
projects that the bank normally funds, Mendes said: "Obviously, the problem of 
street children is . . . very big. . . . But the idea is that the $20 million 
will create models, and while it may look small to some people, it's quite 
sufficient for those agencies to work and grow in the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of Brazil's children has long been an international embarrassment; 
six of 100 children here die before age 1. In the country's impoverished 
northeast, where much of the money from the bank's project will go, one of four 
youngsters dies before his first birthday.

 Four people were killed and at least 10 were wounded when Lesotho soldiers and 
police opened fire on protesters outside the king's palace in Maseru, officials 
said. The crowd was protesting King Letsie III's move to abolish the 
democratically elected government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, who declared 
the abolition of his Cabinet unconstitutional.

escape, a Japanese official said. The trawler's captain was wounded. On Monday, 
a fisherman was injured when a Russian gunboat fired on the two trawlers.

MATH, SCIENCE SCORES SHOW PLUS SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elementary and secondary school math and science test scores, the target of a 
decade-long improvement effort, have returned to levels that in some cases have 
not been seen in 20 years, according to a national study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar gains are not evident in test scores for reading and writing, the 
government reports.Scores for those subjects, however, had not fallen as far as 
math and science during the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The new findings, announced by Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley, 
suggest that while the trend is moving in the right direction, the pace of 
improvement is much too slow to prepare U.S. children for the future workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holding our own in the Information Age is simply not good enough," Riley told 
reporters. "We live in an unprecedented era of new knowledge, and our children 
must be prepared for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The results were derived from a report by the Education Department's National 
Assessment of Educational Progress, which has been tracking academic 
achievement since the early 1970s. The assessment looks at test scores by 
students in three age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, a startling report by the National Commission on Excellence in 
Education described a downward trend in math and science performance through 
the 1970s that gave a strong boost to education reform movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, titled "A Nation at Risk," said American students were falling 
into an academic wasteland of remedial classes and low expectations, while 
students in other industrialized nations were taking more challenging courses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Mark D. Musick, chairman of the National Assessment Governing 
Board, said: "We're beginning to see some payoffs. It takes a long time to see 
the results."

MINNESOTA, INSURER CLAIM TOBACCO FRAUD, CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minnesota and its largest private health insurance provider sued the nation's 
tobacco industry Wednesday for conspiracy, fraud and antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed in Ramsey County District Court seeks to recover the costs 
incurred by the state and by Blue Cross-Blue Shield for treatment of 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges an antitrust conspiracy and consumer fraud against tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previous lawsuits have said the tobacco companies should pay because their 
products are dangerous," state Atty. Gen. Hubert Humphrey III said. "This suit 
says they should pay because the conduct . . . is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco Corp., B. A. T. Industries P. L. C., Lorillard Tobacco Co., 
The American Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., The Council for Tobacco 
Research-U.S.A. Inc. and The Tobacco Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these arguments have been heard and rejected by juries consistently 
over the last 40 years," Reynolds said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross-Blue Shield said it is the first corporate health services buyer to 
sue the tobacco industry over smoking-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials estimate that more than $350 million is spent annually in 
Minnesota to pay the health care expenses for cigarette-caused death and 
disease. Humphrey said about 6,000 people in the state die each year from 
causes related to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said the tobacco industry conspired to suppress research and keep 
safer cigarettes off the market. He also said the tobacco industry promised the 
public it would help discover the truth about the health effects of smoking, 
then lied for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Mississippi became the first state to sue the tobacco industry for 
money spent treating illnesses caused by smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Philip Morris began a court challenge to Florida's anti-tobacco 
law, considered the nation's toughest.

GOVERNOR; BROWN BOOSTS ANTI-CRIME PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pledging to be "the best governor rank-and-file cops ever had," state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Wednesday bolstered her 33-point anti-crime plan 
with two new points that she said would lead to "tougher management and safer 
streets" than California has enjoyed under Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a largely empty gymnasium at the Los Angeles Police Academy, Brown 
said that as governor she would create a Public Safety Council modeled on the 
National Security Council that would coordinate the state's law enforcement 
agencies. She also said she would seek input from rank-and-file law enforcement 
officers when making judicial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the only formal evaluations of judicial candidates comes from 
attorneys -- the California State Bar. Their input is important," she told a 
small audience of prosecutors that appeared not to include a single police 
cadet. "But when I select judges, I also want to hear from law enforcement, 
including rank-and-file police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's comments were the latest in a series of recent speeches that have 
attempted to portray Wilson as an ineffective manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's reelection campaign immediately dismissed Brown's proposals as 
political posturing. Law enforcement officials already have significant input 
into Wilson's judicial selection process, said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for 
Wilson's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Kathleen Brown would do is add seats at the table for the trial lawyers, 
the defense lawyers and the ACLU," Schnur said. "Anyone who opposes the death 
penalty . . . is no friend of California's crime fighters."  
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said that although she personally opposes the death penalty, she 
would enforce it vigorously if elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the law enforcement groups that have endorsed Wilson, Schnur said, are 
the California Police Chiefs Assn., Los Angeles Police Chiefs Assn., Los 
Angeles Probation Officers Union and the Assn. of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, 
whose president, Shaun J. Mathers, attended Brown's speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this comes down to an issue of crime, if that's what the California voters 
decide this election on, Wilson wins hands-down," Mathers said after hearing 
Brown's remarks. "I don't believe she has any credibility on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitehurst, a spokesman for Brown's campaign, said the state treasurer 
has been endorsed by the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs, 
California Professional Firefighters Assn. and the Los Angeles Unified School 
District Police Officer's Assn., among other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Brown accepted the endorsement of the Assn. of California State 
Attorneys and Administrative Law Judges, a 2,300-member organization that 
includes prosecutors and attorneys with the Department of Justice.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; GOP CANDIDATE URGED TO RETURN 
FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Democratic Party chairman Wednesday called on Assemblyman Charles W. 
Quackenbush, the Republican candidate for insurance commissioner, to return 
nearly $500,000 in campaign contributions from the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to become the fox guarding the henhouse," said Bill Press. "I 
believe it is improper -- not illegal but unethical -- to accept money from the 
industry that you intend to regulate. It sets up a conflict from day one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Quackenbush, of Cupertino, said he will not cease taking such 
contributions or give them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to contribute money to people who share their philosophy," 
he said Wednesday. "I'm a free-enterprise, free-market Republican and I believe 
strongly in the private sector and I've traditionally received contributions 
from many interests, but that has never stopped me from doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush noted that he had taken contributions from the National Rifle 
Assn., but nonetheless in 1989 became one of only two Assembly Republicans to 
vote for an assault weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the campaign money is coming from is likely to be a central issue in the 
developing insurance commissioner's race between Quackenbush and Democratic 
Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who took a pledge two years ago not to take any contributions from 
insurance companies, agents or brokers, recently prevailed in a Sacramento 
court when the state Republican Party sued to invalidate a ballot statement he 
had prepared that read: "I'm the only major candidate who doesn't accept any 
money from insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James T. Ford, an appointee of former Democratic Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., said from what he could see the statement was 
true, and the ballot statement should stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel if you're going to effectively regulate an industry, you ought not to 
take their dough," Torres said Wednesday. "Quackenbush, apparently, will take 
money from anybody, the tobacco, the insurance industry, anybody who wants to 
give him money he'll take it from." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush and campaign aide Greg Butler charged that Torres is being 
hypocritical. Torres may not be taking money directly from the insurers, but he 
is soliciting it from defense lawyers who represent the insurers, not to 
mention trial lawyers with a different but heavy stake in the system, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, Butler said, "has taken money from the insurance industry throughout 
his career, and he's continued to take it as a candidate for insurance 
commissioner. Last month, he held a fund-raiser at the Illinois Insurance 
Exchange, hosted by an insurance defense law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also held a fund-raiser hosted by the credit insurance folks. So for him 
to say, 'I'm an angel,' it's hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
 Partial state campaign finance reports, for the first six months of the year, 
show Quackenbush with by far the most insurance money, at least $359,000 by 
July 1, including a $200,000 loan from one source, Pacific Loan Administrators, 
an affiliate of McGraw Insurance Services of Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush on Wednesday called John McGraw, the person behind the loan, "a 
friend of mine who is not on the same wavelength with me politically," in that 
he is further to the right ideologically. "He has contributed to me in the past 
and will in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Press and a spokesman for the outgoing insurance commissioner, Democrat John 
Garamendi, tried to draw a distinction between the contributions that 
Quackenbush and Torres are taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, the spokesman said, has had the policy "not to accept money from 
those he regulates, insurance companies, agents and brokers. He does not 
regulate doctors and lawyers and so he has accepted money from those parties." 
</P>
<P>
 This, Quackenbush said, is a distinction without a difference. The question 
should not be where the money comes from, but whether the candidate has the 
character to conduct himself independently of his financial backers, he said.

FAMALARO CASE CASTS PALL OVER EX-FIANCEE; RELATIONSHIP: WOMAN SAYS SHE WAS 
ABUSED BUT NEVER FEARED FOR HER LIFE. 'IT'S JUST BEEN A LOT TO DEAL WITH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who was once engaged to John J. Famalaro, the man accused of towing 
Denise Huber's frozen body around for three years, said Wednesday that her 
roller-coaster relationship with him has become a nightmare that casts a shadow 
over her new life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very hard, obviously, to think that you dated someone a long time 
and find out you didn't really know him," said Nancy L. Gowan, 30, who told 
investigators that Famalaro once pushed her around and tried to handcuff her. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight, it's a scary thought. There's a lot that goes through your 
mind. It's just been a lot to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Famalaro was sometimes abusive, Gowan said, she never feared for her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was as shocked as anyone else when this story came up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gowan, who listed her occupation in voter registration records as a Marine 
Corps corporal, said Wednesday that Famalaro's relatives and detectives from 
Arizona called her after his arrest last month. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports released Wednesday in Arizona, Gowan told 
authorities that she and Famalaro had a rocky relationship and that he often 
was secretive. She said that she last saw her former fiance in September, 1992, 
and that he ran up thousands of dollars in debt on her credit cards, according 
to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Gowan told authorities, Famalaro tried to handcuff her and she "began 
screaming and crying." 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year resident of Orange County, Gowan said Wednesday that she met 
Famalaro through a friend and dated him "on and off" for three years. At one 
time, they planned to marry. They split up "around the time Huber disappeared," 
Gowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a new mother, engaged to marry another man and living in a new house in a 
different city, Gowan said she has no desire to revisit her past relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard, especially since I've been starting my new life. It's been 
very disruptive," she said, coddling 3-month-old Jake on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I try not to deal with it, something comes back up and all the 
phone calls start again," said Gowan, whose answering machine was full of 
messages from detectives and reporters when she came home from work Wednesday. 
"I didn't want to discuss this with the detectives earlier. I don't want to 
talk with anyone about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gowan said she will testify at Famalaro's murder trial if she is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of friends, acquaintances and former customers of Famalaro have offered 
a confusing portrait of Famalaro, describing him as a workaholic fascinated by 
law enforcement who grew up in a high-pressure home with a domineering mother. 
Gowan, who may know him better than anyone, is similarly befuddled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I knew him," she mused Wednesday. "But who do you really know any 
more?"

SLAYING VICTIM AMY BIEHL'S WORK CONTINUED BY MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Biehl's mother continued the slain American student's mission in South 
Africa on Wednesday, promising to raise more money to help battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Biehl visited a women's center in Guguletu, the black township where Amy 
Biehl, who was white, was attacked by a gang of black youths shouting 
anti-white slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 Three young black men are being tried in Amy Biehl's death. After a hearing 
Monday, the trial was recessed until Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach native was killed last Aug. 25, days before she was to have 
returned to the United States after spending 10 months as a Fulbright scholar 
researching the rights of women and children here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do understand more now why Amy was totally involved," Linda Biehl said 
after talking with Mandisa Monokali, director of the center. "I think she 
really wanted to make sure that the women came through in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's family already has helped raise $4,000 that the Free South Africa 
Foundation recently donated to Monokali's center. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Biehl promised she would try to raise more money in honor of her 
daughter's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Monokali spoke of the lack of facilities for abused women and children in 
South Africa and the difficulties encountered by women seeking equality. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she started the center, called Ilitha Labantu, or the People's 
Sunbeam in Xhosa, after realizing that "the same men who stand on platforms and 
who talk about liberation are the men who abuse us." 
</P>
<P>
 President Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, has only five 
women in his 30-member Cabinet, though he has promised gender equality. Some 
progress has been made but Monokali believes it will take years to change 
attitudes.

WOMAN STABS RABID MOUNTAIN LION TO DEATH DURING ATTACK ON CAMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman stabbed a rabid mountain lion to death with a kitchen knife after the 
60-pound animal attacked a party of campers, including her husband, who lost 
his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Strehl and Troy Winslow wrestled the cat off of Strehl's wife, Kathleen, 
then held it down as Winslow's wife, Robin, killed it with a double-pronged, 
12-inch serrated kitchen knife. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us screamed, none of us panicked, to tell you the truth," Robin 
Winslow, 48, said. "But we moved swiftly." 
</P>
<P>
 Tests on the animal's brain tissue confirmed that it was rabid, Bill Clark of 
the state Fish and Game Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendocino County health officials said they were trying to reach everyone who 
came in contact with the cat and recommend that they undergo rabies 
vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow, who lost his left thumb, was listed in good condition Wednesday at a 
hospital. Kathleen Strehl, who suffered a 4-inch puncture wound in her left 
forearm, was treated and released. Chuck Strehl was shaken but unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about attacks by mountain lions in state wilderness areas has 
increased since April, when a 40-year-old woman was killed by one while 
jogging.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CABLE TV FIRM TOLD TO ISSUE REFUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach City Council has ordered the city's cable television operator 
to refund about $2.4 million in alleged overcharges since September, 1993. 
Individual refunds for more than 62,000 cable customers would be about $36, 
varying depending on the types of services. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Cablevision Industries Inc. said they will appeal the decision 
with the Federal Communications Commission, a move that could delay the refunds 
for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants hired by Long Beach told the council that, under FCC rules adopted 
in September, 1993, CVI has been overcharging for basic cable services and 
other electronic services. CVI executives, however, said their charges are 
within the prescribed limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote Tuesday was unanimous, with council members Jenny Oropeza, 
Douglas S. Drummond and Doris Topsy-Elvord absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "CVI hasn't done anything unlawful," said Bill Marticorena, Long Beach's cable 
consultant. "It's a good faith dispute over what the FCC has authorized. And 
the FCC has acknowledged the rules are vague." 
</P>
<P>
 The Signal Hill City Council also approved a similar refund Tuesday. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; PORT DIRECTOR RECEIVES 5% SALARY INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach harbor commissioners have approved a 5% pay raise for the port's 
chief administrator, making him the second-highest-paid city official. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member commission voted 4-1 last week to raise Executive Director 
Steven R. Dillenbeck's salary from $131,841 to $138,393.  
</P>
<P>
 With the increase, Dillenbeck ranks only behind City Manager James C. Hankla, 
who earns $155,721 a year. Dillenbeck, 54, has headed the port of Long Beach 
since 1991. He has been with the agency since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the pay increase, Dillenbeck makes less than some other port 
directors on the West Coast, including Los Angeles, a port spokeswoman said. 
Commissioners gave Dillenbeck a 3% pay raise in July, 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager Noelia Chapa has resigned to become finance director of Pomona, 
her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapa, 39, said her new job represents another step toward her goal of 
managing a large city.The population of La Habra Heights is 6,500; Pomona has a 
population of 138,600. 
</P>
<P>
 She began working for La Habra Heights in 1986 as an administrative assistant 
and was appointed city manager in 1991. Chapa managed 12 employees as city 
manager. She will oversee a staff of 22 in Pomona's finance department.

 Joe Perez, the assistant city manager, was named interim city manager by the 
council last week. Perez, 28, said he is a candidate for the permanent 
position, though he is unsure when the council will select Chapa's successor. 
He was hired by Chapa in 1991 as an administrative assistant and became 
assistant city manager last year. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: MONTEBELLO; 15% OF RESIDENTS GET INCREASE IN WATER BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a 5.7% rate increase, the second increase in the 
past nine months, for a company that supplies water to about 15% of the city's 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase, which is retroactive to July 1, will raise the average water 
bill about $1.96 a month for customers served by the California Water Service 
Co. The increase was approved to cover a 7% price hike for water purchased from 
the Metropolitan Water District and slight increases in maintenance fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates charged by four other water companies serving the city were not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a 17% rate hike in November for the same company.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELLFLOWER; COUNCIL OKS CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a curbside recycling program that will boost 
monthly trash collection bills by $1.15 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation trucks will collect aluminum, plastic, glass and paper products as 
well as lawn, hedge and tree trimmings, said Mike Egan, deputy city manager.The 
city will provide each home with three 65-gallon barrels -- one for trash, one 
for yard trimmings and another for recyclable materials, Egan said. Apartment 
complexes will receive dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The trash bill for all households will increase from $11.70 a month to $12.85 
when the recycling program starts Feb. 1. Trash fees increased from $11.20 to 
$11.70 a month earlier this month as part of an automatic rate adjustment in 
the city's 10-year contract with Calsan Inc., a private refuse collection 
company based in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 The city adopted the program to comply with a state law that requires cities 
to recycle 25% of collected trash by 1995, Egan said. The council voted 4-1 for 
the recycling project. Councilwoman Ruth A. Gilson cast the dissenting vote, 
saying the rate increases are too costly for residents. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: WHITTIER; CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO GET 2.9% PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whittier City Council has unanimously approved a $15-a-month pay raise, 
the council's first increase in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members decided to raise their pay by 2.9%, from $502 to $517 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since it's been five years it's been way too long," Councilman Allan P. 
Zolnekoff said. "It's better to give a small raise here and there than to 
eventually give a 50% one down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved raises this year for the city's 366 employees. 
Police received a 3.5% pay raise and other employees received a 2% increase.

GOP FRONT-RUNNERS TRADE JABS IN STATE SENATE RACE; POLITICS: TENSIONS RISE AS 
RICHARD L. MOUNTJOY, GARY G. MILLER AND PAUL HORCHER LEAD A PACK OF 29TH 
DISTRICT CANDIDATES IN THE SEPT. 13 ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With three area Republican officeholders viewed as the front-runners, tensions 
are rising and the mud is starting to fly in a special election campaign for 
the state Senate's 29th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the candidates, Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), recently 
called GOP challenger Gary G. Miller a liar. Miller, a Diamond Bar councilman, 
responded that Mountjoy should quit his crying. 
</P>
<P>
 The third prominent GOP candidate, Assemblyman Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar, is 
portraying Mountjoy as a political turncoat who helped elect Democrat Willie 
Brown of San Francisco as speaker of the Assembly more than a decade ago. And 
Horcher has declared that Miller is unfit for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, Miller and Horcher are among seven candidates vying in the Sept. 13 
election to fill the remaining two years of the term of the district's former 
senator, Whittier Republican Frank Hill, who resigned in early July after a 
federal jury found him guilty of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth Republican, Edward D. Ortell, also is running, but so far has raised 
little money. The sole Democratic candidate is Sandra K. Hester, who lost to 
Hill in 1992. Additionally, two minor party candidates, Libertarian Matthew J. 
Piazza and Walter R. Sheasby III of the Green Party, are also on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in September's election, 
the top finishers from each party will square off in a runoff Nov. 8, which 
most observers predict will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican is expected to win the seat because the district's voter 
registration is 46% Republican and 42% Democrat. But a bloodletting among the 
GOP front-runners could leave a weakened survivor and create an opportunity for 
Hester. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinarily, that's a district the Democrats would forget about," said Joe 
Cerrell, a veteran political consultant. "But if these guys all kill each 
other, (some Republicans) will vote Hester" in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that prospect, Mountjoy, Horcher and Miller have not hesitated to 
trade rhetorical punches. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaign literature, Horcher has attacked Mountjoy as a member of the 
old-boy network; he blames him for casting the deciding vote that made Brown 
the Assembly's most powerful member in 1980 in the culmination of a fight among 
Democrats for the speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy dismisses Horcher's attack, saying he voted for Brown, as did other 
Republicans, because he was preferable to his challenger, Howard Berman, who is 
now in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher sent out another mailer in which he called Miller a phony for 
presenting himself as an ethical candidate when he had to pay a $6,000 fine to 
the State Fair Political Practices Commission. Miller, who lost a bid for state 
Senate in 1990, failed to promptly report $260,000 in personal loans to his 
campaign, an FPPC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he did not promptly report the campaign loans in 1990 because he 
misunderstood campaign reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, meanwhile, has attacked Miller, accusing him of hiring a firm to 
phone constituents and tell them, under the guise of a survey, that the 
assemblyman supported a 37% pay raise for legislators. Mountjoy said he opposes 
the raise, taking effect Jan. 1, and will donate the extra money to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's just a liar," Mountjoy said of Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller denied that his campaign was responsible for such calls to 
constituents. "It seems I have Dick Mountjoy crying about everything right 
now," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is making an issue of the pay raise, however, saying the lawmakers do 
not deserve it and that he will not accept it if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, who once declined to address the issue, now says he opposes the raise 
and will donate a portion of the money he receives to the financially strapped 
Los Angeles County Library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy and Horcher have an advantage in terms of name recognition among 
voters. Mountjoy's 59th Assembly District, which he has represented since 1978, 
covers the northern half of the 29th Senate District. Horcher's 60th Assembly 
District covers the other half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller also has a solid base to run for higher office, having served on 
the Diamond Bar City Council since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, a former aide to Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park), is hoping 
that voters who decline to state a party affiliation -- about 10% of those in 
the district -- will support her. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (voters) are looking for a change," Hester said. "I offer them 
that."

QUESTIONS ON SCHOOL UNIFORMS LOOM AS SUMMER NEARS END; EDUCATION: NEW LONG 
BEACH DISTRICT POLICY WILL AFFECT ALMOST 60,000 STUDENTS. BUT MANY PARENTS ARE 
UNAWARE THAT THEY CAN REQUEST AN EXEMPTION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than four weeks before classes begin, Long Beach school officials are 
scrambling to get out the word that all elementary and middle-school students 
must wear uniforms this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's new mandatory uniform policy will affect almost 60,000 students 
from kindergarten through eighth grade, and officials have been deluged with 
calls from parents clamoring for information about what types of clothes will 
be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 14 middle schools and 56 elementary schools has chosen its own 
uniform, generally white combined with black, dark blue, gray or green. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are expected to show up for the first day of school Sept. 14 wearing 
uniforms, although officials plan to allow a one-month grace period before 
enforcing the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The district spelled out the uniform policy in two mailings to parents during 
the summer, but it still has received hundreds of inquiries, spokesman Dick Van 
Der Laan said. The district is drawing criticism for failing to inform parents 
that they have an option to seek an exemption to the uniform requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach school board approved the policy in January, becoming the first 
public school system in the nation to require students districtwide to wear 
uniforms. School board members said they hope that the uniform requirement will 
help curb gang-related violence and boost academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the board retreated to a less restrictive policy after opponents 
mounted challenges on the legal and legislative fronts. Parents filed a federal 
lawsuit contending, among other things, that mandatory uniforms are 
unconstitutional because they violate students' rights to free expression. 
Although the parents lost their legal attempt to block the new policy, they 
were more successful on the legislative front. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bill that initially would have given school districts permission to require 
uniforms later was amended to allow exemptions for families opposed to 
uniforms. The bill has been sent to Gov. Pete Wilson, who has until Tuesday to 
sign it. Supporters say they are confident that Wilson will sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Long Beach school board approved a procedure that allows 
parents to opt out of the uniform requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who do not want their children to wear uniforms must request an 
exemption in writing and must meet with school officials to explain their 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents complained that the district has made the exemption process too 
difficult. Others said they object to having to meet with officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unacceptable to us that parents should have to come in to basically 
listen to a lecture," said Eugene Kinsey, a Long Beach attorney and parent who 
filed the lawsuit against the district. "They've made it rough to opt out." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Dennis Rockway, a lawyer and a member of the school committee that 
helped develop the uniform policy, said the district has withheld information 
that could help parents understand their choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The two district flyers describing the program did not explain that parents 
could request an exemption, he said. In fact, one of the flyers described the 
dress code as mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take such pride in being the first school district in the country to 
implement the mandatory uniform policy," Rockway said. "They're trying to 
deceive people into compliance."

 Parent Randy Prak, who bought outfits for his three children at Willard 
Elementary School, said he believed that uniforms were to be mandatory. "The 
board requires students to put the uniforms on," Prak said. "It's not my 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Prak added, however, that he would have bought the uniforms even if he had 
been aware of the option to request exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials deny they are withholding information. Anyone who inquires 
about obtaining an exemption receives a brief explanation and is referred to 
the child's school, Van Der Laan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray Rivera, principal at Lincoln Elementary School, said he has not told 
parents how to avoid the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district needs to give us a little bit more direction in terms of what 
we're supposed to do or not do" with parents who don't want their children to 
participate, Rivera said. "We basically say we've got a period here of a month 
or so before it's mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
 After Oct. 14, students without exemptions will face discipline, such as 
picking up trash or serving detention, if they don't wear uniforms. It will be 
up to school principals to decide the form of punishment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials point out that uniforms have been well received in 20 Long Beach 
schools that have had voluntary programs, some of them as long as five years.  
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, 90% to 100% of the students regularly chose to wear uniforms 
to class. Some teachers offer incentives, such as Popsicles and extra recess 
time, to encourage students to participate, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate all of our children being in uniforms on Sept. 14," said 
Barbara Richardson, principal at Burnett Elementary, which has had a voluntary 
uniform code in place since March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students at 10 year-round schools began wearing uniforms this summer, although 
participation has been voluntary. No studies have been conducted, but 
principals said that students who wore uniforms voluntarily appeared more eager 
to attend classes and that their attitudes seem to be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known for years that if you want a more successful day at school, make 
it a dress-up day," said Ed Eveland, the school board member who drafted the 
uniform policy. "Kids coming in uniforms helps to show the students that 
(school) is a place of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see it mandatory for everyone," said Eveland, a former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials point out that the policy was originally enacted at parents' 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents say they favor uniforms in school. "When I put a uniform on the 
boy, he knows it's because he's going to school," said Candy Andrade, whose son 
attends Lincoln Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, most callers to the district are asking how to comply with the new 
uniform policy rather than how to avoid it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One mother called to ask if her daughter could wear athletic shoes with 
lights that go on," Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those shoes probably will be OK, but the final decision is up to the principal 
at each school, he said.

PLAN TO RESCUE NEARLY VACANT LONG BEACH MALL OUTLINED; BUSINESS: DEVELOPER 
HOPES REMODELING WILL ATTRACT WELL-KNOWN RETAILERS TO THE WATERFRONT SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Westwood-based developer has agreed to purchase the troubled Marina Pacifica 
Mall in Long Beach and plans to fill its empty spaces with well-known 
retailers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the Trident Group said they will spend about $20 million 
remodeling the waterfront center on Pacific Coast Highway near 2nd Street. The 
nearly vacant mall has a dark, maze-like lower level and many empty 
storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeled facility will include larger and fewer shops, with most 
entrances at street level, said Chris Ellis, a Trident partner. A new Ralphs 
supermarket and a Barnes & Noble bookstore will anchor the mall, along with 
longtime tenants such as the AMC Theaters complex and Trader Joe's, he said. 
Some existing tenants may move to larger facilities in the center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said he hopes to place six national retail outlets alongside about 15 
smaller shops catering to upscale residents in the Naples and Belmont Shore 
areas of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remodeling will stress simplicity," Ellis said. "The original design may 
have worked at the center's inception, but in the end it did not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis would not reveal how much his firm paid for the 290,000-square-foot 
property. Remodeling should begin early next year after nontoxic oil deposits 
beneath the mall are removed, Ellis said. The expanded facility is expected to 
open in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Co. in Newport Beach has managed the mall for Bank of America since 
1992. Connie W. Hahn, Koll's manager at the mall, said about four buyers have 
withdrawn from deals to purchase the property since Bank of America acquired it 
during a 1989 foreclosure. The mall has had several owners since it was built 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Pacifica is currently 28% occupied, Hahn said, adding that the site has 
room for about 100 shops. Although the center once thrived, "there has never 
been 100% occupancy," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several major tenants have departed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogart's, the city's main venue for alternative rock music, closed last year. 
Houlihan's, a large restaurant and bar overlooking the marina, shut down in 
1992. Buffums, the mall's only department store, closed when the rest of the 
chain went out of business in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was already deteriorating when Buffums left," said Trent Esperti, who owns 
Barwinkles nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperti said Trident will make the mall work. "They are the first to promise 
new money, construction and anchor stores," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime business owner said she is waiting for the mall to fulfill its 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been grossly mismanaged throughout the years," said Irene Pursch, 
owner of the Coffee Trader, an 18-year tenant on the mall's lower level. The 
previous managers and owners have failed to attract tourists and exploit the 
mall's location and its beautiful view, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursch said she hopes the developers will make room for her. The Coffee Trader 
is on a month-to-month lease. "I have hung on in hopes that someone would come 
in and do something with the place because it has always been a great place to 
be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is betting on the lure of the more popular existing tenants plus 
well-known national retailers to revitalize the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retailing has changed in the last 10 years," Ellis said. "We would love to 
have some smaller tenants, but you need the major anchors to support the 
mom-and-pop places." 
</P>
<P>
 Trident also developed Beverly Connection across from the Beverly Center on La 
Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach city officials said they are excited about the Marina Pacifica 
development. The city helped mediate some of the negotiations between Trident 
and Bank of America but does not have a financial stake in the development 
beyond sales tax revenue, said Susan F. Shick, the city's director of community 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for business near the mall is plentiful. The Ralphs store must vie 
with a Lucky supermarket adjacent to the property. Another Ralphs market is in 
the Bixby Village Plaza about a mile away at Pacific Coast Highway and 
Bellflower Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs feels that they can support another store in that area," said Ron 
Wood, a leasing agent with Santa Monica-based Epsteen & Associates, which is 
marketing Marina Pacifica for Trident. ". . . I know they agreed without 
hesitation."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; WORKSHOP SEEKS TO EASE TENSIONS AT JORDAN HIGH

<P>
 About 100 students at Jordan High School will take part in training sessions 
to help ease racial tensions at the North Long Beach school. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-day workshop on cultural sensitivity will begin Monday, Jordan 
Co-Principal Mel Collins said.The group will also take field trips to hospital 
emergency rooms, jails and the county coroner's office to learn about crime and 
law enforcement. Trips have been scheduled as well to the Simon Wiesenthal 
Center Museum of Tolerance on the Westside and the Long Beach Civic Light 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial tensions were high at times during the last school year. Last fall, 
police were called after a dispute between a black student and a Latino student 
escalated into several skirmishes. Twelve students were arrested for fighting. 
The district later assigned an armed police officer to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 During the year, school officials reported 13 assaults against students on the 
campus and 154 fights between students.  
</P>
<P>
 Collins said he hopes the participating students will be able to encourage 
others at the school to resolve conflicts peacefully. The group includes 
students of different races and academic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more eyes and ears I have on campus, the better off we are," Collins 
said. "There's strength in numbers." JOHN COX

<P>
 The Montebello Unified School District wants to reduce teachers' salaries by 
5.3% to help restore services that were cut three years ago when the school 
system was nearly insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay cuts were included in a $128-million district budget approved by the 
board for the new school year, but the teachers have vowed to fight the plan, 
said Kathy Kohn, president of the Montebello Teachers Assn.Teachers agreed to a 
2.1% pay cut in 1991 and received an increase of 1.4% the next year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is seeking to make money available to restore nurses, assistant 
principals and high school counselors, and hire additional teachers to reduce 
class size. The district also plans to restore bus services that had been 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, our school board said students have got to come first, 
and we have to restore some services," said personnel director Bill Erwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin said the district has already cut administrators' pay by 5.3% and has 
asked non-teaching staff to accept a 2% reduction. Teachers are the highest 
paid in the county and should also make a sacrifice, Erwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides are in contract negotiations. 
</P>

and Commerce. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; TERMINAL ISLAND RAIL LINK TO BE REPLACED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tugboats and pleasure craft that travel under the Badger Avenue Bridge as a 
shortcut to Long Beach will have to go around Terminal Island for five months 
during bridge construction, a Port of Long Beach spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The bridge, which crosses Cerritos Channel at Henry Ford Avenue, will be torn 
down or relocated this year to make way for a $30-million vertical-lift 
bridge.The new bridge is needed to cope with an expected increase in rail 
traffic to and from ship container terminals on Terminal Island, spokesman Jeff 
Leong said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badger Avenue Bridge is the only rail link to the island. The port built 
the 760-foot crossing -- a double drawbridge also known as the Henry Ford 
Bridge -- in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor Board last week approved the project for the new bridge, which is 
designed to meet seismic standards. Construction is expected to begin at the 
end of the year. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; INSTRUCTOR, UNIVERSITY SETTLE LAYOFF LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An instructor at Cal State Long Beach has agreed to drop a lawsuit accusing 
the university of racial and religious bias in canceling his Indian philosophy 
class last year and laying him off. 
</P>
<P>
 The university agreed to pay the instructor, Srinivasa Murthy, an undisclosed 
sum as part of the settlement, a university spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murthy's lawsuit contended that the university's philosophy department 
terminated his two-year contract early and denied him a permanent position 
because he is an Indian and Hindu. Murthy has taught Hinduism part-time in the 
religious studies department since the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials attribute the layoff to last year's budget crisis, during 
which many teaching contracts were terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Murthy may reapply for a teaching position in the 
philosophy department, said Jeffrey Phillips, a state deputy attorney general 
who represented the university. However, university officials will not say 
whether Murthy has reapplied to teach in either department. Murthy and his 
attorney could not be reached for comment.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VERNON; TOXIC WASTE FOES FIND A VICTORY IN DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the community group lost in a state appellate court last week, the 
Mothers of East Los Angeles has succeeded in helping prevent a local company 
from transporting toxic waste in what has been called one of the state's most 
polluted cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd Appellate Court's decision Aug. 10 upheld a Superior Court ruling that 
the city was justified in granting a conditional-use permit in 1992 to JCI 
Environmental Services Inc., 4133 Bandini Blvd., to transport hazardous waste. 
The Mothers of East L.A. sued JCI and the city that year over the issuance of 
the permit after it was discovered that the company failed to properly store 
hazardous waste on its property and that other conditions were not being met. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after pleas from the Mothers of East L.A., the City Council revoked 
the company's permit when a monitoring system detected that a waste tank was 
leaking. 
</P>
<P>
 City inspectors also cited potential soil contamination and violation of 
frontage requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave JCI every opportunity to do the right thing and they failed to," said 
Roger Wilner, an attorney helping to represent the city in the case. Said 
Aurora Castillo of the nonprofit Mothers of East L.A.: "We still claim this as 
a victory, since their permit was removed."  
</P>
<P>
 A JCI representative refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fleet of about 25 tank trucks, service trucks and other company 
vehicles, JCI transported hazardous waste for companies in Los Angeles and 
several Southeast cities. By definition, hazardous waste can explode, ignite, 
corrode metal and poison or damage organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 JCI handled wastes mainly in liquid form, contained in steel drums, said Andy 
Yamamoto, an attorney representing the Mothers of East L.A. "Hopefully, this 
will teach JCI to clean up its act," said Yamamoto. "JCI has been a repeat 
offender when it comes to environmental regulations in the state of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Carlos Porras, Southern California director of the Venice-based 
Citizens for a Better Environment, Vernon has been documented as the dirtiest 
ZIP code in the state. The city is home to steel and chemical manufacturers and 
distributors and the West Coast's largest lead battery recycler. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the California Public Interest Research Group revealed 
that the city annually emits, processes or stores 27 million pounds of toxics 
-- more than three times as much as the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With 150 residents, Vernon has the smallest residential population of any 
incorporated city in the state. Its daytime population swells to about 50,000.

RESCUING A DESIGN ICON; ARCHITECTURE: AN AUSTRIAN MUSEUM PROVIDES FUNDS TO 
RESTORE THE SCHINDLER HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World-renowned for its modernist design, the 1922 Schindler House in West 
Hollywood is about to be rescued from decay by a museum in Austria, the 
homeland of architect Rudolf Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
 A $250,000 grant from Vienna's Museumangewandtekunst (MAK), or Museum of 
Applied Arts, will be used to restore the concrete-and-redwood landmark as a 
study center for experimental architecture, officials announced late Wednesday. 
The MAK also would provide an undisclosed amount for operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Schindler House on Kings Road is an icon of modern architecture," said 
MAK Director Peter Noever. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California preservationists praised the gift, many also said it 
highlighted how difficult it is to raise funds locally to maintain 
architectural treasures here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't as much of a sense of history and preservation here in Los 
Angeles as back East," said Judith Sheine, a Schindler scholar and assistant 
professor of architecture at UCLA and Cal Poly Pomona. "In L.A., there is a 
pattern of build, burn, tear down and put in mini-malls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 14 years, the influential architect's former home at 835 N. Kings 
Road has been operated as a museum by Friends of the Schindler House -- mostly 
friends of the Schindler family. But the group and the house recently have 
fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Schindler House received $200,000 for restoration from 
West Hollywood and state coffers, and $50,000 for operations from Cal Poly 
Pomona's College of Environmental Design. 
</P>
<P>
 But public funding dried up two years ago, and the group cannot afford a grant 
writer to apply for money from private foundations. Tourist dollars bring in 
only half of the $50,000 needed annually for proper maintenance, so the 
building has been falling into disrepair, said Robert Sweeney, Schindler House 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecture aficionados prize the house for its minimalist lines, its use of 
space, particularly in commandeering the outdoors for living quarters, and its 
bare "slab-tilt" concrete walls that are still considered radical. Schindler's 
idea was that the double home -- built for himself, his wife, Pauline, and 
friends Marian and Clyde Chace -- would be tantamount to a permanent campsite 
that would exploit Southern California's mild climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with MAK, Sweeney said, means that the museum can finally live 
up to the intentions of the Friends of the Schindler House. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never envisioned the Schindler House as a house museum where you look at 
the furniture and leave. It was to be an architectural activities center. We 
tried and we simply could not do it because of a lack of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year contract between MAK and the organization will provide $250,000 
over five years for restoring the building and gardens and more funds -- to be 
determined by need -- to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has lagged behind the nation's other cities in all areas of 
philanthropic support, as a recent study showed. Scheine said that is true in 
architectural circles: A recent fund-raising study by Cal Poly Pomona showed 
that residents are not willing to give money to support modern architecture, 
and the school has had trouble finding funds to support upkeep of a Silver Lake 
house by Richard Neutra. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian-born Schindler was one of this country's most important modernist 
architects. His designs focused on human needs and were influential in the 
development of California tract housing. An apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright, 
Schindler came to Los Angeles from Chicago in 1920 to oversee construction of 
Wright's Hollyhock House. Schindler's home, his first independent work here, 
has been open to the public for weekend tours, architectural exhibitions and 
lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
 The house has no conventional living or dining rooms. Each person was assigned 
a studio marked in the plans with his or her initials, and everyone converged 
in a communal kitchen for domestic chores. The preservation group bought the 
house three years after Pauline Schindler died in 1977, 24 years after Rudolf's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 The MAK agreement leaves the deed and full curatorial control in the hands of 
the local group; MAK receives unquestioned access for museum programming. The 
new MAK Center for Art and Architecture will cater to local design aficionados 
and Austrian exchange students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of a strategy to put art, artists and architectural students 
together, which I think makes a lot of sense today," Noever said.

LYGHT LOOKS FOR A WAY TO STOP BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Rams' cornerback Todd Lyght was bored with covering his 
team's receivers in practice. He wanted something more. He wanted game 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring on the best, he was saying. Bring them all on. 
</P>
<P>
 But after getting blistered for three touchdown passes in exhibition losses to 
Green Bay and New England, Lyght is losing sleep replaying his gaffes over and 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of trouble sleeping Saturday night after giving up those two 
touchdowns to New England," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a chance to reflect on that on Sunday and get my head together. I felt 
bad because I let the team down." 
</P>
<P>
 The knock on Lyght is that he's a nice guy, that he lacks the nasty 
in-your-face, trash-talking disposition that's a trademark of Deion Sanders and 
Kansas City's Mark Collins. It's a must for a cornerback expected to 
intimidate, then shut down the best receivers week after week. 
</P>
<P>
 And after giving up three touchdown passes, don't expect Lyght to start 
tearing the locker room down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately for us, this is the preseason," he said. "None of it counts. It's 
like practice. I would rather get these touchdowns out of the way now." 
</P>
<P>
 So this is Todd Lyght, a first-round draft pick in 1991, named the Rams' 
transition player in 1994 and a rising star that the coaches are billing as a 
Pro Bowl candidate this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Todd isn't playing well right now," said Joe Vitt, assistant head coach. "And 
nobody wants to play well more than he does. He's pressing, and it's going to 
take him some time to get back in sync. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has some adjustments to make, and he'll make them. I'm 100% confident that 
Todd will come back and have a Pro Bowl year for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off knee surgery last season, Lyght has looked sterling and sharp 
during training camp workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But three weeks into the exhibition season, and with the start of the regular 
season two weeks away, do the Rams dare let him try to cover Sterling Sharpe? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to have these things (getting beat) happen in the preseason than 
during the regular season," Vitt said. "It could have been that he was never 
tested in the preseason and we go into the regular season with a false sense of 
security and then -- bam -- it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 It has happened early and often in the exhibition season. In the opener, Green 
Bay wide receiver Robert Brooks beat Lyght for a two-yard touchdown catch. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, after David Lang's fumble gave New England the ball at the Ram 
37-yard line, Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe went right at Lyght. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Timpson took Lyght over the middle and made a leaping catch in the end 
zone for the touchdown. A few minutes later, Vincent Brisby beat Lyght on an 
out pattern for a four-yard touchdown reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to pick it up," Lyght said. "I wasn't getting any balls early in 
the New England game and I got caught sleeping. We (the defense) had been 
playing well until I gave up those touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitt said Lyght needs to do a better job of reading opposing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that he's getting beat so bad that he's out of position," Vitt said. 
"He just needs to make the read and finish the play. He had a chance to strip 
the ball (against Timpson) and he lost track of where he was on the goal line." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams made a major investment in Lyght during the off-season, naming him a 
transition player to retain his contract rights after his five-year, $5.5 
million deal expires after next season. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the Rams will sign him for one season and pay him the average of 
the salaries of the top 10 players at his position. 
</P>
<P>
 They made the investment based on Lyght's strong play at the start of the 1993 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He intercepted two passes and had 44 tackles until he injured his knee in 
warm-ups against Washington. He underwent arthroscopic surgery and missed the 
final seven games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 By early March, team trainers said Lyght was 100% healthy, and the cornerback 
looked impressive in mini-camp workouts in May against a Ram receiving corps 
that will never been confused with Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an intense off-season rehabilitation program, Lyght, 6 feet and 186 
pounds, was considered to be in the best shape of his four-year career when 
training camp opened July 22. He didn't disappoint in practice, coming across 
the field on several occasions to tip passes away during seven-on-seven passing 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the difference between the Todd Lyght on the field during two-a-days 
and the Todd Lyght you see on the field on Saturday nights? 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to practice harder," he said. "I don't think I've been practicing 
every day like it was a game, so I've been picking up my practice tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the toughest thing -- being out of game tempo. I missed almost half 
the season last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the question remains whether Lyght will be back in form by the Sept. 4 
season opener against Arizona. The Rams desperately need him to cover the 
murderer's row of wide receivers they face in the first six weeks of the season 
-- Arizona's Gary Clark, Atlanta's Andre Rison (twice), San Francisco's Rice 
and Taylor and Green Bay's Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght will get a preview on Saturday night, when the Raiders' track team of 
receivers Tim Brown, James Jett, Rocket Ismail and Daryl Hobbs arrives to run 
some deep routes at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an Olympic gold-medal team they have," Lyght said. "That's good for 
us, because we get a look at all that good speed. That's maybe the best group 
of wide receivers in the league. If not the best, then a close second." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Rams' coaching staff is content with letting Lyght work 
through his slump on his own. Even if it means his losing a little sleep over 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we felt that Todd wasn't aware of how he was playing," Vitt said, "we 
would jump on him. Todd knows he's struggling, and he's working through this 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to dump gas on a fire right now."

STRIKE LOSSES NOT MERELY PEANUTS; DODGERS: WORK STOPPAGE AFFECTS VENDORS AND 
HOMELESS. O'MALLEY LOOKING FOR A LASTING SOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being the publicly private organization they are, the Dodgers, caretaker of 
the stadium in the ravine, do not want anyone to know how much money flows 
through their bank account. Or how much doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in these strike-ridden times, the Dodgers, who along with Philadelphia 
and Boston have owners whose exclusive business is baseball, say the finances 
are private, and that's their prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
 So we'll figure it out for you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' estimated revenue for the regular season was supposed to be about 
$75 million, based on comparable figures for past seasons provided by Financial 
World magazine. Should the strike last the remainder of the season, which would 
be 52 days, the Dodgers' loss in potential net income is $8.6 million plus 
another $5 million in postseason television revenue. This is based on potential 
gross revenue of $19 million minus $9 million in player salaries, $274,000 in 
travel expenses and $1.1 million in stadium personnel and operations expenses 
on the day of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the actual loss is much less. Based on a franchise that runs 365 days a 
year, and assuming an operating cost of $27 million, the Dodgers' actual loss 
is $74,000 a day or $444,000 total for six days of the strike, during which the 
Dodgers would have been playing at home. The club is saving players' salaries, 
which total $174,106 a day, but again, they are not receiving the $915,000 in 
total revenue averaged over the scheduled 82 home games, which include an 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 The $74,000 a day represents the cost of the 100 front-office employees and 
other operating costs supporting a product they can't sell. But these numbers 
notwithstanding, there are other losses that are hitting home with the 1,600 
part-time stadium and concession workers who have lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Peter O'Malley met with his front-office employees this week and told 
them their jobs are safe for now. But the 600 part-time ushers, ticket-takers, 
clean-up crew and day-of-game stadium operations staff are out of work, a 
savings to the Dodgers of about $34,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 ARA Services, which owns and manages the concessions, has about 800-1,000 
people out of work. That includes the peanut sellers, who can make up to $200 a 
game, and the concession workers, who average between $85-$120 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are those things that appear intangible, but are very real. ARA 
donates its cooked leftover food to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley, a proponent of a lasting agreement with the players union, not 
merely a stopgap solution, is well-aware of the trickle-down effect of this 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to quantify (the financial situation) after three days or a week 
because it is complicated, but foremost on my mind is a big piece of this, 
which is goodwill," O'Malley said. "We have a tremendous amount of goodwill 
that has been built for many years (from the fans) and how severely that is 
impacted is hard to quantify. That is a big concern on my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed and this is what, the (eighth) work stoppage in 22 years? 
That is way too many; it's not normal. We must find a way to work closely with 
the Players' Assn. and we have failed, and I'm not saying that it's their fault 
or our fault. I'm just saying we have not been able to identify a way to work 
civilly and we must do that -- we cannot keep putting the whole country through 
this every two or three years. It can't be done. I don't know another industry 
that has gone through this. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a long-term agreement that will be embraced enthusiastically by both 
sides, not just an agreement where we will say, 'Thank goodness it's over,' but 
something that is profound and lasting, not just something to take us out of 
the strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bob Graziano, Dodger vice president of finance, continues to crunch 
the numbers and the strike continues to eat up the potential profits of 
$454,545 a day. The Dodgers' only real saving in the strike is the player 
salaries, which amount to about $9 million the rest of the season. The total 
player payroll is now $31,681,500, excluding $3 million paid to Darryl 
Strawberry and pensions, etc., the latter of which are usually paid back after 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in payroll the Dodgers don't save as much as other clubs. Players 
salaries represent only 52.2% of their total revenue. The Cincinnati Reds pay 
an industry-high 86.8% of their revenue to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the Dodgers' revenue is from ticket sales, concessions, 
merchandising and parking, which averages about $552,000 per home game and is 
estimated to be about $13.364 million for the 26 remaining home dates.  
</P>
<P>
 That figure is based on $414,000 in ticket sales, with average attendance of 
41,444 and an average ticket price of $10. Parking revenue of $33,600 is based 
on 14,000 cars, though the lot accommodates 16,000. The Dodgers own the parking 
lot, charging $4 per car, but share the receipts with Public Parking Inc., 
which pays the employees and insurance from their share. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dodgers switched from Arthur Foods, Inc. to Marriott a few years ago, 
they received a huge up-front sum plus a cut of sales per person, which is 
estimated at $1.50 per head, giving the Dodgers revenue of about $66,000 per 
game. ARA took over as concessionaire on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The other large portion of the Dodgers' revenue comes from the 
television/radio package, which is reportedly $15.5 million annually for local 
television and another $5 million for radio. If the strike lasts the season, it 
will force cancellation of 11 scheduled telecasts and 48 radio broadcasts, an 
estimated revenue loss of $4.55 million. The Dodgers will also lose $1 million 
in merchandising revenue from sales at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Other revenue received is from a cut of road attendance, which tends to cancel 
out what the Dodgers give visiting teams from their home games, and stadium 
leases for concerts, recreational vehicle shows, conventions, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential savings for the Dodgers would be the three remaining trips, 
during which 22 games were scheduled. They would save an estimated $273,862. 
The savings come from hotels ($82,800), charter planes ($105,000), meal money 
($68,062), and buses, trucks and incidentals ($18,000).

WORLD CUP COACHING ISN'T STABLE; SOCCER: NINE OF 24 POSITIONS HAVE CHANGED 
SINCE TOURNAMENT ENDED, BUT GERMANY'S VOGTS IS STILL EMPLOYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Berti Vogts failed, but he still has a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alberto Parreira succeeded, but he quit anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer coaching, it seems, is an uncertain and unpredictable profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Success is no guarantee of continued employment, while failure does not mean 
instant dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Take World Cup '94. In the month since it ended, nine of the 24 national teams 
have changed coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some left voluntarily. Others were pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil won the World Cup, but Parreira wasted no time in resigning, citing the 
pressure of the job and the continued criticism from fans and media. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece finished last among the 24 teams; Alkis Panagoulias will stay until his 
contract expires Aug. 31 and then move on. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Italia '90 tournament, the post-World Cup housecleaning affected 
virtually every team. This time, the brooms have been more selective. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe, for instance, has been the model of stability and continuity, with 11 
of the 13 national team coaches retaining their position. 
</P>
<P>
 But South America and Africa have been just the opposite, with all seven World 
Cup participants making changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some big names have fallen by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's failure in the second round meant that Alfio Basile's days in 
charge were numbered. He knew it as soon as his team was beaten by Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Argentina's record since I took over (after the 1990 World Cup) is 
excellent," Basile said. "We've won two Copa America tournaments and we worked 
really hard and put everything into this World Cup campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, in Argentina, second place is not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Think then, how Argentine fans must have felt about finishing 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 No successor has been named, but the favorite is Daniel Passarella, a member 
of Argentina's 1978 World Cup-winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, Vogts, too, might have been expected to resign or be kicked out 
after the Germans were upset by Bulgaria in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The cries for Vogts' head raged, but the German federation, the DFB, decided 
to keep him without as much as a slap on the wrist. Vogts had threatened to 
quit if a single word was uttered against him by the DFB. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation remained silent, but that didn't stop others from voicing their 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether Vogts stays or goes is not important," said former national team 
player Felix Magath. "Whoever's in charge faces a tough job. Success comes and 
goes in cycles, and we're on the (downward) slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Berti made a mistake by relying on experience. He didn't introduce 
enough new blood. Now that (Rudi) Voeller, (Guido) Buchwald, (Andreas) Brehme 
and perhaps (Lothar) Matthaeus have played their last internationals, we're 
left with a huge gap to fill. I'm worried. Continuity has gone out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite. Vogts is still there, even though he bristles at the negative 
press he has received. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been easier just to get rid of me, but then they'd have had no 
focus for their criticism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira knows all about criticism and, having held firm in the face of an 
onslaught of negative publicity during Brazil's qualifying campaign and its 
triumphant World Cup run, he decided enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned to become coach of Valencia in the Spanish first division, where 
one of his opponents will be Atletico Madrid, coached by Colombia's World Cup 
coach, Francisco Maturana, who also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after leaving, Parreira fired some parting shots at his critics, 
including the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population (of Brazil) is an echo without its own opinion," he said. "It 
only reflects what it hears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your average fan goes to Maracana (Stadium) and watches the game but always 
listens to a transistor radio. It is important that somebody tells him what he 
is seeing. He can't analyze the game himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira also lashed out at former national team coach Tele Santana, who led 
Brazil in the 1982 and 1986 World Cup campaigns and who was one of Parreira's 
most astringent critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has ever had a team as good as his and failed to win," Parreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing Parreira will be Mario Zagalo, 63, who played left wing on Brazil's 
winning 1958 and 1962 teams, coached its winning 1970 team and was technical 
director of the 1994 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagalo, whose first task will be to build a team for the 1995 Copa America, or 
South American Championship, in Uruguay, says winning the gold medal in the 
1996 Atlanta Olympics is his real goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over for Maturana in Colombia, meanwhile, is assistant Hernan Dario 
Gomez, who was given the position even though he earlier had said he was not 
interested in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez is a relative of Colombian national team midfielder Gabriel Gomez, the 
player whose family was the target of death threats during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other coaches who have stepped down or been forced aside are 
Bolivia's Xavier Azkargorta, who cited the chaotic state of Bolivian soccer for 
his decision to resign, and Russia's Pavel Sadyrin, who might have said much 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadyrin has been replaced by Oleg Romantsev, formerly coach of Spartak Moscow, 
the country's most successful team. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia failed to make it out of the first round, but it did succeed in 
defeating Cameroon, a 1990 quarterfinalist, 6-1, with Oleg Salenko scoring a 
World Cup-record five goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Salenko is now playing for Parreira at Valencia, while Cameroon has dismissed 
its World Cup coach, Frenchman Henri Michel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michel's place, the national soccer federation has appointed Jules Nyongha, 
the first Cameroonian to hold the position in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Another African team, Morocco, also hired a local coach to take over its 
national team, with Mohammed Ammari replacing Abdellah Ajri. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria has not renewed Dutch coach Clemens Westerhof's contract and has not 
appointed a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, meanwhile, stability reigns as the national teams prepare for the 
qualifying campaigns for the 1996 European Championship in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrigo Sacchi, the Italian coach whose team was beaten by Brazil in the World 
Cup final, has perhaps the easiest of tasks. Italy has been drawn in a group 
that includes lightweights Ukraine, Croatia, Lithuania, Estonia and Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Sacchi's luck in 1994, he should be able to book Italy's ticket to 
England right now. One slip, though, and they'll be calling for his head.

JIM MURRAY: KNEE-DEEP IN LATEST FIGHT JOKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Boxing as an industry slays me. The sport of Stanley Ketchel, Sam Lanngford, 
Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis sometimes reaches new highs in buffoonery that make 
it hard to remember it's trying to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Riddick Bowe-Buster Mathis Jr. fight of last Saturday. Please. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as you know, boxing is a sport governed, more or less, by a code of 
ethics and behavior known as the Marquess of Queensbury rules. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, John Sholto Douglas, the eighth Marquess of Queensbury, 
didn't actually devise them, he merely lent his name to them. Boxing, quite 
early, got used to duplicitous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules sought to civilize and make regulatory what otherwise appeared to be 
a sanctioned mugging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marquess' rules were few (12) but fairly explicit. Rule No. 10 read: "A 
man on one knee is considered down, and, if struck, is entitled to the stakes." 
</P>
<P>
 No ambiguity there, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, you might have noticed Saturday in the Atlantic City Convention Center 
before witnesses (not many really -- the cognoscenti managed to miss this 
pugilistic mismatch), Riddick Bowe, the once and future heavyweight champion, 
broke Rule 10. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to know what the Marquess would make of this but it was too bad, 
really, because Bowe threw the best right hand he threw all night, maybe ever. 
</P>
<P>
 It caught Mathis flush on the chin and doubled him over backward and 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Mathis was kneeling at the time. No one quite knows why. Mathis 
does things on the spur of the moment and it's hard to predict from one moment 
to the next what his strategy will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe can probably be understood for his infraction if not forgiven because it 
was the only time all night when Mathis was in range and visible. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Bowe couldn't hit a moving target. So, whenever Mathis was upright, 
Bowe kept missing him. Bowe is not exactly nifty. The last time he fought for 
the title, a parachutist landed almost on top of him in the ring. And there are 
nights when the promoters are afraid pigeons will light on Bowe too, mistaking 
him for a statue of Beethoven. Bowe moves about as fast as a post office line. 
</P>
<P>
 It was very frustrating for Bowe, who was half a foot taller and 24 pounds 
heavier than Mathis. From that vantage point, he seemed to have great 
difficulty in locating Mathis all night, although Buster is not what you'd call 
svelte. He appears at first sight to be all waist line. Either that or the 
world's biggest soccer ball. He doesn't really seem to have any hitting area. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Bowe, who has trouble finding the hitting area on the heavy bag in 
the gym, couldn't believe his good luck when he saw Mathis kneeling in one 
place. He unloaded on him. Mathis was lucky his head didn't come off. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bowe has probably never read the Marquess of Queensbury rules -- among 
the myriad other subjects he has never read up on. But hitting a man when he's 
down is pretty much frowned upon in most of the civilized world. At least 
outside of Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I suppose you can understand Bowe's frustration. He couldn't hit Mathis 
when he was up. Riddick had a no-hitter going. And he didn't knock Mathis to 
one knee. Buster simply kind of went there of his own accord, like a guy 
genuflecting in church. To escape punishment, I should imagine. I mean, he 
thought he was safe -- although it's doubtful if Buster ever read Rule 10, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think the punch dazed Mathis (and it did) it was nothing compared to 
the confusion it caused the referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Mercante is 75 years old, and he had never seen an incident quite like 
this one. To his credit, Arthur didn't bother to count. He stopped the fight. 
He was heard murmuring dazedly something about "fining Bowe $10,000" but 
letting the fight stand, but the New Jersey boxing commissioner, Larry Hazzard, 
knew a felony when he saw one. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued briefly as to how best to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt as to how they should have proceeded. Bowe should have been 
disqualified. According to the Marquess' rules, Mathis was "entitled to the 
stakes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hazzard had a kind of Solomonic decision in mind. Only, he did cut the 
baby in half. "We felt we could not allow Bowe to win the fight," Hazzard 
explained later. But, apparently, they felt neither could they allow him to 
lose it. So, they ruled the bout "no contest." It never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 I told you boxing was hilarious. Now, "no contest" in boxing lore usually 
meant a fight in which one or both participants in a fight declined to give his 
best. That, in turn, usually meant the gamblers had gotten to one or both of 
the fighters. Boxing not only was funny, it was larcenous. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a case of that. As bad as they were, both pugs were trying. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what we have here is your basic non-fight. Let the record books figure it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, an additional complication. It is that Mathis might have 
gone to the floor without being struck. Now, the Marquess didn't address that, 
but the London Prize Ring Rules that predated the Marquess and to which he 
deferred, are quite clear on that. Rule No. 13 unequivocally states "It shall 
be a fair 'stand-up fight,' and if either man shall willfully throw himself 
down without receiving a blow, whether blows have previously been exchanged or 
not, shall be deemed to have lost the battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough? Wait a minute! The rule then goes on to contradict itself: "But 
this rule shall not apply to a man who, in close, slips down from the grasp of 
an opponent to avoid punishment, or from obvious accident or weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought this job was easy! 
</P>
<P>
 Only once in the history of the ring has a heavyweight won the championship 
while on the floor. Max Schmeling accomplished this dubious feat in 1930 when 
he fell to the canvas, clutching his groin in the fourth round of his title 
fight against Jack Sharkey. His manager, the resourceful Joe Jacobs, famous for 
giving the world the words to live by "We wuz robbed!" leaped in the ring and 
claimed the title. Successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmeling's legacy to the game was the tin cup over the groin. No more 
low-blow fouls deciding a match. But what is Mathis' going to be -- a catcher's 
mask? 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Buster, it's a good idea. Bowe is probably the best we have at 
the moment, at least at hitting a stationary target. He's an irresistible force 
only when encountering an immovable object. Fortunately for him, the "other" 
heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis, off his recent fights, qualifies. He 
doesn't even have to kneel to be hittable. Meantime, if you feel the urge to 
pray, make sure Bowe isn't around -- and in need of a tuneup.

VETERAN LINEBACKER; FORMER MARINE HERRIN IS NOW LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD HITS 
WITH TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day at the USC football practice field, an 18-year-old freshman 
muffed a blocking assignment and was yelled at by a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He trudged back to the huddle, head down. He was still mumbling about it at 
the next water break. 
</P>
<P>
 Errick Herrin, a 25-year-old junior linebacker, suppressed a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only in moments such as those, he says, that he feels much older than 
many of his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
 Herrin spent four years in the Marine Corps before beginning his college 
football career. He's a veteran of the Gulf War. He has been shot at and yelled 
at. He has seen men try to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't volunteer counseling services to young, emotionally untested 
players. But if asked, he'd advise them to examine the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as basic training at Parris Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing the coaching staff here can do to me on that practice field 
that would even compare to what I went through in 13 weeks at Parris Island," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This really is a game, and guys shouldn't forget that. They're not training 
you to kill people, like the Marines do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a drill instructor who was 5 feet 4 tall and 5 feet 4 wide. He could 
really get in your face. He'd scream awful things at me about my mother, my 
father, my family . . . everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had guys in basic trying to commit suicide -- by hanging themselves, 
cutting their wrists or pills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I got mad, like the other guys. But I realized early the whole thing 
was a test, to see if they could break you. So you shut up and kept your mouth 
shut, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were days I figured I'd made a mistake. There were days I figured it 
couldn't get any worse than this -- and then it did, the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot of talking to myself, when I was sure no one else was around. 
That's how I blew off steam." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gulf War, Herrin wasn't involved in combat. However, he had to "hit the 
deck" more than once, when his base would be hit by stray automatic weapons 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 For USC, Herrin is a junior college recruit who brings high expectations to 
Don Lindsey's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of anything more you'd want in an inside linebacker than what 
Errick represents to us," said Lindsey, the defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy has been to war. He's a man. He's got great maturity and you love 
that when he plays alongside very young players. From what we've seen so far, 
he's an explosive kind of linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach John Robinson: "There's a suddenness to his game that really 
catches your eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrin is 6-2 and 225 pounds and not far from becoming the 10th Trojan to 
bench press 400 pounds. He has lifted 385 pounds and has done 26 repetitions at 
225. 
</P>
<P>
 To Bob Stangel, his coach at Mt. San Jacinto Junior College, Herrin is a 
natural.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has that God-given ability to know where the ball is going to be, to go to 
the ball," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I called him my quiet assassin. He's a big-time hitter. By his second season 
for us last year, two and three guys were blocking him. He disrupts what teams 
want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big, strong man when I got him, after four years in the Marines, and 
he just got stronger with us. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 30 years of coaching, he's the best linebacker I've had. He'll be a pro." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrin, who weighed 170 when he enlisted, hopes to be a starter soon. At his 
inside linebacker slot, he's listed behind senior Donn Cunnigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cunnigan is a fifth-year senior, he started some games last year and he's 
paid his dues," Lindsey said. "He deserves to be listed as the starter now. But 
after that opening game (Sept. 3 against Washington), all bets are off." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrin joins a strong linebacker unit, led by Jeff Kopp and Brian Williams, 
who were first and second in tackles last season, with 83 and 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp played outside but is inside for his senior season. Williams is listed 
behind Gerald Caruthers at outside linebacker, but Caruthers will sit out at 
least the Washington opener because of a broken bone in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other outside slot, Errol Small is listed ahead of another prized 
junior college recruit, Israel Ifeanyi from Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from Akron, Ohio, Herrin comes from a football/wrestling 
background.  
</P>
<P>
 "I lost only two wrestling matches my senior year, both to the same guy," he 
said. "I wasn't much of a student, I was kind of a party guy in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 When he decided to join the Marines, family opposition was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "My uncle was in the Army, and my brother was in the Air Force," he said. 
"Both of them came home just to talk me out of it. The Marines were too tough, 
they told me. They said they'd talk bad to me, that the food was bad. But the 
more they talked like that, the more I wanted to join. So I did."

MASSIMINO WON'T GET SUPPLEMENT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ADDITIONAL $375,000 A YEAR 
ABOVE BASE SALARY WASN'T APPROVED BY UNLV REGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas has no plans to pay basketball Coach Rollie Massimino the 
remainder of nearly $2 million secretly promised him in a supplemental contract 
by former university officials, UNLV's interim president said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Kenny Guinn said that since the contract giving Massimino an extra 
$375,000 a year above his base salary was never approved by the Board of 
Regents, the university is not obligated to pay the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to try and collect the money, he has to ask the people he thinks 
owe it to him," Guinn said. "It is not my responsibility to try and raise 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract's existence was revealed publicly Wednesday in a story in the Las 
Vegas Sun, which said the contract was secretly set up because Massimino didn't 
want the full size of his deal made public. With the two contracts and other 
perks, Massimino would total nearly $1 million a year under his five-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money was to be paid by a private nonprofit organization in addition 
to the $511,000 Massimino makes a year from UNLV and a shoe contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn, who took over as interim president in May from former president Robert 
Maxson, said Maxson primarily raised the money to pay the extra guarantee. 
Guinn said Massimino has been paid $300,000 over the last two years in addition 
to his salary and is owed $450,000 currently under the contract and another 
$475,000 next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinn said he has been told by the university system's legal counsel that the 
university is not obligated to pay the money because it was not approved by the 
Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was to have been paid by an organization dubbed "The Varsity Club," 
set up by Maxson and former university legal counsel Brad Booke to funnel the 
extra cash to the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson, who assumed the presidency of Long Beach State in June, issued a 
statement saying the supplementary contract was handled in an "appropriate and 
ethical manner" and was payment for Massimino serving in a public relations 
capacity for the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never an intent to do anything improper; there was simply an effort 
to match his compensation at Villanova," Maxson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A secretary in the basketball office said Massimino was out of town and 
couldn't be reached for comment.

LOWLY TIMBERWOLVES FIRE LOWE; PRO BASKETBALL: COACH OUSTED AFTER 33-102 RECORD 
IN TENURE MARKED BY UNDERACHIEVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sidney Lowe's 135-game run as coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves was marked 
by pouting players, undisciplined underachievers and lopsided losses. 
</P>
<P>
 So he was fired Wednesday, along with assistants Jim Brewer and Chuck 
Davisson, as part of the sweeping changes planned by new owner Glen Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 No replacements were named. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not frustrating as an owner, it's frustrating as a fan," said Taylor, 
who on Aug. 5 agreed to buy the Timberwolves from original owners Marv 
Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner. "I think the fans' expectations are the same as 
mine. This is a building process and people expect us to get better. We haven't 
been getting better. We want to start." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there was no set timetable on naming Lowe's successor but said sooner 
is better than later. The season starts in only 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a lot of time, but we have to take enough time to make sure we 
make the right decision," Taylor said. "I realize the importance that this 
selection has for the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that General Manager Jack McCloskey, one of the few employees he has 
decided to keep from the Wolfenson-Ratner era, will compile a list of 
candidates. "Then I would get involved," said Taylor, who added that McCloskey 
made the final decision to fire Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing of Lowe, the team's third coach since joining the league as an 
expansion team in 1989, capped a wild year that included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The franchise almost moving to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A controversial public buyout of Target Center aimed at keeping the team in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Sexton's long, unsuccessful negotiations to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Star player Christian Laettner's squabbles with teammates and assistant 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An assault charge against rookie Isaiah Rider. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, lots of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, at 34 the NBA's youngest coach, had a career record of 33-102 after 
replacing Jimmy Rodgers on Jan. 11, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you're fired, you can always say, 'I wasn't given a fair shot 
because of this or that,' " Lowe told WCCO-TV. "The fact of the matter is that 
I was given a shot. I was given a chance and that's much more than I could have 
ever asked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe had been with the organization since its inception. He was the starting 
point guard during the Timberwolves' first season and was a television analyst 
the next year before joining Rodgers' staff for the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey said Lowe, who has two years left on his contract, would "be 
reassigned in the basketball department as a scout."

FORMER ANGEL AIKENS GUILTY ON CRACK COCAINE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury Wednesday found former Angel and Kansas City Royal slugger 
Willie Aikens guilty of selling crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury began deliberating the five charges against Aikens Wednesday morning 
and returned the verdict in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikens played for the Angels in 1977 and '79, with the Royals from 1980 to 
1983 and '84 and '85 with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was convicted on four 
counts of selling crack and one count of involving a gun in a drug transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense rested its case Wednesday morning without calling Aikens to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The case centered on whether the government entrapped Aikens into converting 
cocaine powder into crack cocaine. If the jury found entrapment, Aikens could 
have been acquitted of all or some of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikens' attorney, Bruce Simon, contended in closing arguments that the 
government, through an undercover agent with the Kansas City Police Department, 
persuaded Aikens to convert cocaine powder to crack because the penalty for 
selling crack is more severe than that for selling cocaine powder. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikens was accused of selling roughly 70 grams of a controlled substance. The 
conviction on selling crack could result in a 12-year prison term. The 
punishment for selling cocaine could have ranged only to 27 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun charge, stemming from a loaded, 12-gauge pump-action shotgun Aikens 
allegedly said he kept in his den for protection, would add to the punishment.

BREAKTHROUGH BOUTS TRIPPED UP BY PAIR OF CRACKED RIBS; BOXING: TONIGHT'S IRVINE 
MARRIOTT CARD LOSES TWO LOCAL FIGHTERS AFTER THEY ARE EACH INJURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Semaza and John O'Brien were only scheduled to fight undercard bouts at 
the Irvine Marriott's monthly show. But to them, tonight's fights might as well 
have been for world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Semaza, 25, has fought just once in the past two years and is trying to 
resurrect a once promising career. O'Brien, 40, is chasing a lifelong dream by 
trying to start a professional career. 
</P>
<P>
 For promoter Roy Englebrecht, Semaza and O'Brien's dreams would have meant a 
financial boon. Because both are local fighters with big followings, 
Englebrecht had already exceeded his average advance ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have paid for their fight and then some," Englebrecht said. "We've 
been gradually showing a profit the last few months. (Tonight) would have been 
our biggest show ever, and it still might be." 
</P>
<P>
 But boxing fans who paid $25, $30 or $35 for tonight's fights won't be 
watching Semaza or O'Brien. Both were hit with body shots at the wrong time and 
suffered rib injuries while sparring last week at the Westminster Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing is known for unscrupulous activities -- such as boxers pulling out of 
fights at the last minute with suspicious injuries. But Englebrecht said there 
was nothing suspicious about the injuries to Semaza and O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt worse than I did," Englebrecht said. "They wanted to fight, and it 
would have been a nice payday for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Semaza, a featherweight with a 10-0-1 record, could have made up to $1,100. 
O'Brien, a junior welterweight, stood to make about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make a lot of money in this business, and you train for something 
for a year and you're not going to make any money? . . . That's tough," said 
O'Brien, who had been working with trainer Jesse Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a former amateur fighter, actually trained for almost five years to 
become licensed by the California Athletic Commission. He runs an executive 
personal training center in Costa Mesa, where he teaches boxing as a way to 
stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before what would have been his four-round pro debut against J.P. 
Trujillo, O'Brien took a blow on his right side that fractured a rib. For a 
week, O'Brien tried to fight through the pain, but it was no use. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling myself to quit whining," O'Brien said. "I'm a boxer. I'm 
tough. But when I went to the radiologist, they told me it was a linear 
fracture. The day Jesse turned me away, I had tears in my eyes. On the way home 
in the car, I started to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Semaza said he can't bring himself to cry. It would hurt too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I cough, sneeze or hiccup, it's hell," said Semaza, who was scheduled to 
fight Frankie Avelar. "As long as my body stays straight, I'm all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Semaza, who quit boxing for a year because of financial problems, said his 
body was exposed when he got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw a left hook that missed, and my sparring partner threw a right hook 
to my left side," said Semaza, who also teaches boxing classes as a means to 
keep fit. "It felt like the rib was coming out of the front of my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, it did. Semaza said his rib popped out two more times, and 
doctors determined he had torn cartilage in his floating rib. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Semaza's comeback is derailed until November, O'Brien's debut is 
delayed until at least October, and Englebrecht is hoping ticket-holders 
understand his dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the nature of the boxing business," he said. "We have to announce a 
card to our ticket-holders 3 1/2 weeks out when the fighters are healthy. Then 
for a month, I'm afraid to answer the phone. It's unusual that two of our 
headliners got cracked ribs." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "As promoters, all we have is our credibility. And there's nothing 
we can do about injuries. If there's a silver lining to this, it happened a 
week out, not a day out." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Englebrecht took over as owner Ted Luckow's promoter in January, he has 
tried to increase the number of local fighters on each card. Fullerton's 
Semaza, who grew up in Brooklyn, moving to Orange County before beginning his 
pro career, and O'Brien fit that mold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to have at least one or two fighters from Westminster (Gym) on our 
cards," Englebrecht said. "There weren't many local kids fighting on the cards 
and we knew that had to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's main event won't feature a local fighter. Middleweight Rodney Toney 
(15-0-2) from Campo, a town 45 miles east of San Diego, will fight Basante 
Blanco (9-3) of Bell in the 10-round main event. Heavyweight Dave Yanko isn't 
local, but he has a local following because he fought at the Irvine Marriott so 
many times in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Englebrecht said boxers such as Yanko, Semaza and O'Brien are often a better 
draw than fighters like Shane Mosley, a promising lightweight from Pomona, who 
fought in the main event two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Semaza and O'Brien sell more tickets than a Shane Mosley," Englebrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one stipulation -- they have to be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reach out to disgruntled baseball fans, promoter Roy 
Englebrecht announced that any fan bringing an Angels or Dodger ticket can 
exchange it for equal value toward a ringside seat, plus receive a free box of 
popcorn. Tickets for the 7:30 p.m. six-bout show will go on sale this morning 
at 9 a.m. at the Irvine Marriott. . . . Middleweight Rodney Toney, a second 
cousin of world super middleweight champion James Toney, has knocked out his 
last six opponents and is ranked 30th by the World Boxing Council. His manager 
Joe Sayatovich, also world champion Terry Norris' manager, said he hopes 
tonight's bout will serve as a tuneup for a North American Boxing Federation 
title fight. "He looks like James Toney, and he has a chin like him," 
Sayatovich said.

 The Montreal Expos became the first club to announce layoffs during the 
strike, and the New York Yankees said more than half their staff had been sent 
on vacation. Montreal said 35 employees were put on vacation this week and they 
will be laid off when their vacations end after the strike's second week.

 Baseball fans would help settle future baseball disputes under legislation 
introduced in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill sponsored by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) would establish a 
five-member major league baseball commission consisting of three fans selected 
by the president, one player and one owner. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have the power to impose binding arbitration to settle disagreements 
between players and owners and regulate expansion, ticket prices, stadium 
financing, television revenues, marketing and merchandising.

 In another attempt to pressure baseball to end its strike, an organization of 
fans and a consumer group began a petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Fans United and the Consumer Federation of America said they expect to 
gather "thousands and thousands" of names on paper petitions and through an 
on-line computer service urging Congress to step in and end the strike.

<P>
 A construction crane accident at the Kingdome killed two people and injured 
one Wednesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two workers sandblasting the stadium ceiling fell some 250 feet when a basket 
affixed to the top of a crane broke loose, a Seattle Fire Department 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it fell, the basket struck the cab carrying crane operator Charles Cox, 25. 
Cox was being evaluated late Wednesday night at Harborview Medical Center for a 
possible head injury, Harborview spokesman Larry Zalin said. Cox was listed in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 No names or hometowns were immediately available for the dead men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingdome has been closed since July 19 for renovation after four ceiling 
tiles fell into the stands before a baseball game.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; PLAYERS TOLD TO PREPARE FOR A PROTRACTED WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Major League Baseball Players Assn. sent a memo to its members Wednesday, 
restating its belief that the work stoppage will be a long one. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 6 of the players' strike, Donald Fehr, executive director of the union, 
said he advised the players again that it could be "two weeks, two months or 
next July" before there is a bargaining agreement and they should be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't put it quite that crassly," Fehr said, "but the point is, we're 
following the owners' calendar. Dick has us where he wants us to be. He should 
be very proud. He ought to be pleased as punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr says that negotiator Richard Ravitch and the owners forced the strike 
with the hope of breaking the union and with the long-term option of declaring 
an impasse and unilaterally implementing their salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no contact between Fehr and Ravitch for the fifth consecutive day, 
and no meetings are scheduled today. However, both are expected to receive 
procedural suggestions from a team of federal mediators in separate meetings 
this afternoon and are tentatively scheduled to resume negotiations Monday. The 
union has advised the players who make up its negotiating committee to be ready 
to go to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to sit down and get this resolved, but I don't need any more of 
Dick's lectures," Fehr said. "I'd rather wait, then go through that. I'd rather 
wait, in the hope he'll eventually have something new to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch denied speculation that the bigger-market clubs have begun to show 
impatience and said it's not unusual for negotiations to be temporarily 
suspended soon after a strike begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating we can't move faster, but on the other hand I don't want to 
raise expectations by holding meetings that aren't going to be productive," 
Ravitch said. "Both Don and I welcomed mediation, and the mediators have been 
getting their ducks in a row in preparation for becoming more involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to make progress, this might be the best way right now, but I 
don't want to raise hopes in that regard, either." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way the mediators can influence the union to accept a salary cap, 
and there is no indication the owners are about to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, who spent Monday and Tuesday in Washington meeting with a House 
committee considering a bill that would remove baseball's antitrust exemption, 
said he didn't regard the negotiating interruption as customary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept talking in '85 and the strike (in August over the size of the owners' 
pension contribution) lasted only two days," Fehr said. "But we were 35 days 
into the '81 strike (over compensation for the signing of free agents) before 
there were any substantive talks and then it was decided in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said before, the atmosphere this time reminds me more and more of 
'81." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 74 games have been canceled. The strike will be the second longest 
in that context by Friday, exceeded only by the 712 games canceled during the 
50-day strike of '81. ROSS NEWHAN

COMMENTARY; REINSDORF BECOMES THE NEW WALTER O'MALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All season long, during the splendid season now stopped, the Murderers Row for 
baseball was Ken Griffey Jr. and Frank Thomas and Matt Williams, Barry Bonds 
and Jeff Bagwell and Albert Belle, and the great Tony Gwynn. These players 
lifted their sport and filled its ballparks. Now they have been replaced by a 
different kind of Murderers Row. This one shuts the sport down and turns 
ballparks empty and silent in August. It really is time for the big management 
players to be out in the open, like the ballplayers, for everyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Murderers Row for management is Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and 
Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Richard Ravitch, their mouthpiece. And 
Carl Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins is in there, and whichever empty, 
union-busting suit is now in charge of The Tribune Company, and Claude Brochu 
of the Montreal Expos, who has the best team in baseball but says he is unable 
to compete anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 And throw in Doug Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Danforth is selling the 
Pirates but thinks he can have a say in shaping baseball's future. Only in 
baseball do the guys running a going-out-of-business sale decide how the 
business should be run. Peter Gammons pointed out in the Boston Globe the other 
day that four members of baseball's executive council -- Pohlad, Danforth, 
Jackie Autry of the Angels and Tom Werner of the San Diego Padres -- are 
selling their teams, or at least entertaining offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't the governing body be better served by people who like the game?" 
Gammons wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are some of management's most powerful hawks all of a sudden, the 
toughest tough guys, even as they hide behind some kind of mob code of silence 
and let only Selig and Ravitch do their talking. Management's Murderers Row. It 
is like some old-fashioned gang of political bosses, and so perhaps it is 
fitting that it is run out of Chicago by Reinsdorf, who has convinced enough 
small-market bosses that he is their champion. Reinsdorf's agenda has nothing 
to do with what is good for baseball or what is good for the small-market 
bosses. Reinsdorf's agenda is making more money for Reinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Reinsdorf who once said he refused to pay his own baseball players 
"what the dumbest guy in the business pays his players." 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the Reinsdorf who once said: "Baseball is a business for owners, 
not players or umpires or fans." 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners can bust the union, he makes more money. If they can get a 
salary cap, he can get more money, even if it means doing some revenue-sharing. 
Reinsdorf, remember, didn't want to pay Michael Jordan. Why should he pay 
millions to some of these no-name baseball players? 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf is brilliant, tough, and has the supreme hustler's gift: He always 
lets the other guy think he came up with the idea. He is the new Walter 
O'Malley; he just doesn't want to make a big show of it. Of course, he is 
perfectly happy to stay behind the scenes and let Selig be out front. People 
like Selig, who clearly believes baseball is on the verge of some baseball 
version of October 1929, even if that is the great lie of the baseball summer. 
Reinsdorf is the real commissioner at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fehr is right about one thing: The real negotiating right now should 
involve a roomful of owners. Because if you still believe this war is between 
all the owners and all the baseball players, you are a sap. This is all about 
management's Murderers Row, which has been able to get enough votes and enough 
help from Ravitch to organize this Holy War against the players and shut down 
baseball. They knew the players would never go for a salary cap. The longer the 
cap stays on the table, the more it looks as if the owners will sacrifice this 
season, do that kind of grievous damage to their own sport as a way of breaking 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 This really is an amazing scam. Brochu, with the best record in baseball, his 
team playing in a city whose population is 3.1 million, cries the small-market 
blues. But if Brochu can't make a go of it in Montreal with this kind of team, 
why does Montreal have to be in the baseball business? What law says Seattle 
has to have a team? What law is there on the books that says baseball must come 
up with a system that takes care of Bud Selig in Milwaukee? 
</P>
<P>
 Know this: Selig doesn't get this salary cap on the table without some 
big-market muscle behind him. That is where Reinsdorf comes in.  
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf runs the owners, enough of them anyway, the way O'Malley once did. 
He is that kind of boss, even as he hides behind Selig. Reinsdorf is the one 
who took out Fay Vincent. He is the real author of this strike. The cleanup 
hitter for Murderers Row. In the process of murdering a baseball season.

SHERMAN READY TO CARRY STANDARD; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: TORGESON SUCCESSOR EXPECTS 
TO BRING NATIONAL TITLE TO CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IN FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The walls of the office still are cluttered with many of the same photographs, 
posters and plaques. 
</P>
<P>
 A hand-made sign, "There's No Crying in Softball," retains a prominent 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the Cal State Northridge softball office does it say, Under New 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Former assistant Janet Sherman has been coach of the Matadors for almost two 
weeks and seemingly little has changed. Not until two days ago did friends 
finally persuade her to remove Gary Torgeson's voice from the office telephone 
message machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was generic, it sounded good, so I figured, why bother?" Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her approach will be much the same with the Northridge softball program. In a 
nutshell: If it's not broken, don't try to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Sherman, 30, became Northridge's third softball coach. 
Torgeson, her predecessor, won 636 games in 13 seasons -- more than any other 
coach in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 And Robert Guillaume thought he had it tough replacing Michael Crawford as the 
lead in Phantom of the Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson's old swivel chair is Sherman's hot seat. But she says she wouldn't 
have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a choice. Sherman entertained an offer to start a softball program at 
the University of Wisconsin. She elected to stay closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the pressure," Sherman said. "When we got back from the (NCAA 
softball) World Series I knew I wanted to be a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
 She wants it, she's got it. Northridge, in only its fourth NCAA Division I 
campaign, last season compiled a 52-10 record, won its second consecutive 
Western Athletic Conference title and advanced to the national championship 
game, losing to top-ranked Arizona, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 All Sherman needs is something close to an encore -- only without eight senior 
starters who have exhausted their eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of expectations for my players," Sherman said, "but I don't 
expect them to do any more than what I would do." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Sherman starred at Granada Hills High, then played four seasons 
for UCLA -- the last three as the Bruins' starting catcher. She was a member of 
two national championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to have a national championship in five years," Sherman said. "Right 
now that's a dream. But that's what coaches strive for. That's why I'm here, 
because the potential is here." 
</P>
<P>
 A pessimist might say Northridge's cupboard is bare. Sherman is looking at a 
shopping cart that's full. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about the eight starters we lost, but we have eight or nine 
players returning and a great recruiting class," Sherman said. "And those 
players coming back have had a taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know how close they were to a national championship and they want to go 
back. It's my job to take them there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman was successful in her only other stint as a head coach, though under 
entirely different circumstances. When she took over the softball program at 
Immaculate Heart High in the spring of 1989 she was in a no-lose situation. 
There was no tradition to embrace. The team had won two games the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sherman's team finished second in league play, she was considered a 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge doesn't need a savior. A disciple might suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman was a member of Torgeson's staff the past four seasons -- the last 
three as his top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to compare her style with that of her former boss, Sherman replied, "I'm 
very competitive and I think I'm just as intense. We have the same thoughts 
going on inside, but we express them differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson had a demonstrative, almost combative demeanor. Sherman, as an 
assistant, was his low-key conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a yeller and a screamer," she said. "But the players do know what I 
expect of them and they know when things aren't going the way I think they 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Sherman is settling in to a new routine that includes an array of 
administrative responsibilities, plus recruiting and counseling players on 
their academic and financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 She won't take over on the field until mid-October, when the Matadors open 
fall drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Her calendar is full, and so is her desk -- with mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But as she sits at her new place amid the vestiges of her old office, Sherman 
doesn't have to look far for a reminder of what daunting challenges lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 On a message board adjacent to her desk a new slogan has been written: "Going 
to Keep it Alive in '95!!" 
</P>
<P>
 And for as long as possible thereafter.

DISARCINA CAN'T SHAKE SINKING FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina, Angel assistant player-representative, faithfully watches TV 
each night, scanning all of the channels from ESPN to CNN, searching for the 
slightest hints of optimism that the baseball strike will be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he goes to sleep more discouraged than ever, losing hope that this 
season can be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an eerie feeling," he said. "It's like a rain delay that never ends. You 
try to enjoy the time off, but it's impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like pre-spring training. You just don't know what to do. You ask 
yourself, 'Should I stay in shape?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I watch TV, and say, 'This season is over. Why even bother?' 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal feeling is that the season is over." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, even if the work stoppage were to end well before anyone's 
expectations, DiSarcina believes it's too late to save any semblance of a 
pennant stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we were to come back," he said, "the feeling I get is that it will go 
past Labor Day. By that time, it will be so late in the season that everything 
will be tainted, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about guys who haven't done anything but golf, fish and hunt. 
It's going to be like spring training all over again. You'll see pulled 
hamstrings, sore arms, everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough just getting everybody back here. This team has shot 
off in every direction. Joe Grahe's on a fishing boat some place. Russ Springer 
is somewhere in the bayou. And who knows if we'll ever find Bo (Jackson) . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only other Angel players who live elsewhere in the off-season and 
still remain in town are Rex Hudler and Joe Magrane. And Hudler plans to take 
off next week for a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, who lives in Cape Cod during the winter, might soon be next.

TWO WORKERS FALL TO DEATH IN ACCIDENT AT KINGDOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A construction crane accident at the Kingdome killed two people and injured 
one Wednesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two workers sandblasting the stadium ceiling fell some 250 feet when a basket 
affixed to the top of a crane broke loose, a Seattle Fire Department 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it fell, the basket struck the cab carrying crane operator Charles Cox, 25. 
Cox was being evaluated late Wednesday night at Harborview Medical Center for a 
possible head injury, Harborview spokesman Larry Zalin said. Cox was listed in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 No names or hometowns were immediately available for the dead men. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead men worked for Long Painting Co. of Portland, Ore., Taylor said. The 
crane was operated by Ness Crane of Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatality was believed to be the first involving a workman at the Kingdome, 
Taylor said. The accident occurred about 8 p.m. at the downtown stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingdome has been closed since July 19 for renovation after four ceiling 
tiles fell into the stands before a baseball game.  
</P>
<P>
 All 40,000 tiles have been removed. King County Executive Gary Locke said he 
hoped to have the ceiling renovation completed and the Kingdome reopened by 
Sept. 18, in time for the Seattle Seahawks' NFL opener.

ANGER ON THE AIRWAVES; FILMMAKER DOUG MCHENRY USES RADIO SPOT TO ACCUSE MPAA OF 
RACISM, SEXISM FOR CHANGES TO FILM AND POSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a highly unusual move, the director and producers of "Jason's Lyric," an 
upcoming fall release from Gramercy Pictures, took the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America to task in a radio ad when the ratings board objected to the film's 
steamy sexual content. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPAA's Classification and Ratings Administration board had threatened to 
slap the movie with an NC-17 unless the filmmakers cut some sexually explicit 
scenes -- a demand they ultimately complied with in order to get an R rating. 
The MPAA's advertising board also mandated changes in the film's promotional 
poster, which further angered the filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 60-second spot, which ran in the top 20 markets last weekend, the 
film's director-producer Doug McHenry ("New Jack City") complains: "In this 
country, you can kill 50,000 people in a film, but you can't have a tasteful, 
romantic love scene. If you have two black people making love, somehow that's 
steamier than other people. . . . I think those have been issues of sensitivity 
with respect to the MPAA." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, McHenry said he had asked Gramercy to buy the spot so he 
could deliver his message "direct to my market. . . . I wanted the active 
moviegoer to understand the hegemony, the control the MPAA -- a self-regulating 
group -- has over the movie business, and that this group is the filter to what 
they see and don't see (on the screen)." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, which opens Sept. 30 and stars Allen Payne, Bokeem Woodbine, Forest 
Whitaker and Jada Pinkett, is a story of passionate romance and fraternal 
rivalry set in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 McHenry estimates he cut 50-60 frames from the movie, including one showing 
the naked buttocks of Payne, to get the R. (Filmmakers are contractually 
obligated to distributors to deliver at least an R because of restrictive deals 
with cable networks and home video outlets.) 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmaker conceded that the cuts "did not destroy the integrity of the 
film" and that he and the MPAA "were able to reach a reasonable compromise on 
its content. I actually think they pushed the envelope for the film." 
</P>
<P>
 What he is still incensed about, however, is the MPAA's rejection of the 
movie's original poster, which depicted Pinkett's bare leg in a provocative, 
erotic pose with Payne between her legs. The leg was airbrushed out of the ad, 
then resubmitted and accepted last week by the MPAA's Advertising 
Administration board, which reviews marketing materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was infuriated that our marketing campaign to emphasize the film's 
passionate romance would get hacked to death by the MPAA," said McHenry, 
speaking from Florida where he's shooting Savoy Pictures' "The Walking Dead," a 
story about black soldiers in Vietnam. "When the MPAA controls what your 
advertising looks like, that's total dominance."  
</P>
<P>
 The filmmaker said the MPAA is guilty of "hypocrisy on three levels," alleging 
that the group is racist, sexist and enlists a double standard for sex and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 MPAA president Jack Valenti, accusing McHenry of using the press "to get free 
publicity" for his film, responded: "For somebody to say we are racist and 
sexist is almost bizarre. That's the last thing in the world we are." He 
pointed to one "interminable" sequence that the MPAA strongly objected to "of 
two people copulating in a vigorously sexual scene." As far as the poster is 
concerned, Valenti said, "It has nothing to do with black, white, any color; it 
has to do with the sensuality of the artwork. . . . we never allow nudity." 
</P>
<P>
 McHenry said he is "not one to levy the banner of racism at the wave of a 
hat," insisting, "I'm not making the charge of overt racism, but there is 
cultural or institutional racism at work here." He added: "When you have 
(ratings board members) not familiar with our culture or community, they are 
not sensitized to the validated norms and (they) apply a national standard that 
doesn't focus on us." (The ratings board is made up of eight to 11 members who 
are all parents and whose job it is to provide guidelines about a film's 
suitability for children. The identity of most members is intentionally kept 
confidential.) 
</P>
<P>
 McHenry argued that the MPAA has made allowances for many other movie posters, 
including those for the Sharon Stone erotic thriller "Basic Instinct" and "Body 
of Evidence," starring Madonna, which he said depict "direct eroticism. But 
because (the actors) are not African Americans, it was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The director's second charge against the MPAA is "clear and blatant sexual 
chauvinism -- sexism." He said there are many examples of other movie posters 
where "the female body can be depicted practically nude, but when you add the 
male body to it (as with "Jason's Lyric") it's not OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, McHenry said, both with regards to judging a movie's content and 
advertising materials, "the MPAA is much more liberal when it comes to violence 
than sex, romance and love. You can blow somebody's head off, but you can't 
have one tasteful scene of a guy's butt going up and down (when he's making 
love)." 
</P>
<P>
 He avowed that all of these issues are "heightened if there are black people 
involved. . . . If a black man has a gun, he's more threatening than Clint 
Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger. If it's two black people making love, 
somehow it's steamier." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked her reaction to McHenry's accusations about the MPAA, Bethlyn Hand, 
senior vice president of the MPAA and director of the group's Advertising 
Administration board, said, "I respectfully disagree. . . . I am the least 
racist person I know. We disapproved of the ad because it was too sensual. They 
resubmitted it and we approved it -- this is nothing new. We do this all day 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramercy president Russell Schwartz said the company expects to release 
"Jason's Lyric" in about 800 theaters and will resume its normal radio and TV 
campaign closer to the film's opening. He said in the majority of spots, the 
film is being sold as "a love story set in an urban environment. . . . I think 
it's the first time that African American love is shown like this on the 
screen."

IT'S ONLY ROCANROL BUT THEY LIKE IT; ALEX LORA, FOUNDER OF 'MEXICO'S ROLLING 
STONES,' HAS KEPT A CUTTING EDGE FOR 26 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you remind Alex Lora, founder and leader of El Tri, that his band is 
often described as the Rolling Stones of Mexico, he smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, they should be called the El Tri of England," jokes Lora, who will 
lead the group in concert at the Grand Olympic Auditorium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lora, 41, has been Mexico's greatest rocanrol symbol for 26 years, and, as 
young bands have risen since the late '80s, he has stood his ground with a 
refreshing sound inspired by the Stones as much as Mexico's own folk music. 
Like the Stones, Lora is beyond good and evil. His secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "Very simple. We've remained true to ourselves instead of wearing ponchos," he 
says, taking a jab at the Mexican rockers who have adopted an ethnic-oriented 
sound and image in reaction to years of other performers copying English and 
American acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, Caifanes and Maldita (Vecindad) are cuates (friends) of mine, but I 
just don't like what they do," Lora continues. "Please, don't give me any of 
that cumbia-rock and techno-mariachi." 
</P>
<P>
 Lora has remained unsophisticated, vulgar and raw, sticking to his simple 
blues songs with a religious fervor. But it's not just the dozens of hits that 
have made Lora a deity for a considerable portion of Mexico's underground rock 
culture, it's also his crude, straightforward attitude and his cutting social 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While his music and recordings are conventional, Lora's best songs dissect the 
complex Mexican society and government with often humorous descriptions of his 
homeland's idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
 While he offers his support to Mexicans in the United States in 
"Undocumented," he also makes fun of himself and his people ("We are the 
greatest race/the greatest race/the greatest race/in all the animal kingdom"). 
He addresses his audience as cabrones (loosely translated as bastards ), but 
then he moves them with "Nino sin amor" (Child Without Love). There are many 
who fit that description at his concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the band's sales -- both legal and through a pirate network that can have 
a tape ready a day after the show -- allowed him to survive in a country where, 
up until a few years ago, rock was so feared by authorities that it was nearly 
impossible to stage a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to our success is that I've been risking (everything) since day one," 
says Lora, sitting in a Malibu recording studio and holding an apple he's been 
eating for two hours. Wearing jeans, sandals and an El Tri flannel shirt, he 
jumps from frenetic, X-rated Spanish to slow-paced but fluent English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't changed my style and attitude in years, and people know that," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lora's career began when he founded the group Three Souls in My Mind in 1968. 
They initially sang in English, as was the style then, but for most of the 
'70s, Lora (playing bass), drummer Charlie Hauptvogel and guitarist Ernesto de 
Leon added more and more songs in Spanish and recorded 15 albums. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lora split from the trio after some disagreements with Hauptvogel, he 
began working under the banner of El Tri, the name that his old group was 
popularly called. He released "Simplemente El Tri" (Simply El Tri) in 1984. 
Since then, Lora and El Tri have recorded 10 more albums. Guitarist Oscar 
Zarate was recently added to the lineup that's been in place for a couple of 
years now: Lora (on guitar and vocals), Pedro Martinez (drums), Eduardo Chico 
(guitar), Ruben Soriano (bass) and Rafa Salgado (harmonica). 
</P>
<P>
 Singing exclusively in Spanish, Lora solidified his status despite a nearly 
total lack of TV or radio play. The bulk of his followers are hard-core, 
working suburban youngsters in Mexico City's underground scene, but even 
veteran yuppies are seen when El Tri is at its best -- in its riotous live 
shows, where the crowd manages to sing along while executing what is arguably 
the world's most dangerous slam-dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me and many others, Lora is the main inspiration," says Mario Diaz, 
guitarist and singer for Eclipse, a popular Los Angeles blues band that has 
opened for Lora in the past. "For a poor Latino and immigrant rocker, he 
touches a nerve like no one else." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are detractors as well. Some rock critics dismiss his music and 
accuse him of exploiting an image that works well, but has little to do with 
the real Lora. 
</P>
<P>
 But even for a non-fan such as Rogelio Villarreal, editor of Mexico City's 
acclaimed underground magazine La Pusmoderna, Lora is too important to be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite his conventional style, he is a mythical figure, a key idol for a 
huge legion of underground followers," Villarreal said. "It could be argued 
whether his attitude is real or not, but it's always fun to see him curse the . 
. . gringos when opening for American bands." 
</P>
<P>
 For good or bad, Lora is the most important single personality in Mexican 
rock, and Saturday's concert will be a historic moment for rock en espanol -- 
he will be playing for the first time with Argentina's blues master Pappo, a 
legend in his own right. It may very well be the seed for a much-needed link 
between Latin America's two largest rock traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Lora has succeeded because he gives a voice to the voiceless crowd 
-- leather-wearing, longhaired youths made skeptical by a world they see 
improving for everyone but themselves. They still find the greatest solace and 
freedom when El Tri plays live. 
</P>
<P>
 "My surroundings are rotten and I'm rotten," Lora says. "But when I play I 
feel free. I'll keep playing for as long as I feel that." 
</P>
<P>
 * El Tri plays Saturday at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, 1801 S. Grand Ave., 7 
p.m. $27 . (213) 749-5171.

OLIVER STONE, LIVE AND ON-LINE; CYBERSPACE: THE DIRECTOR OF THE UPCOMING 
'NATURAL BORN KILLERS' ANSWERS E-MAIL QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FILM AND THE STATE OF 
THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In cyberspace, no one can hear you screenwrite. But filmmakers armed with a 
laptop and a new endeavor to promote can speak volumes nowadays when it comes 
time to do publicity in the brave new on-line universe, where the public Q&A 
session has suddenly become an instant staple of the electronic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of massive modem networks has been visited by some rather big names 
in the last year, from Al Gore to Billy Graham to David Bowie to Joel Silver. 
But Tuesday night Oliver Stone became the highest-profile director so far to 
submit himself to one of these computer query-fests, answering written 
questions over America Online about his next controversy-bound release, 
"Natural Born Killers" (due Aug. 26), from a top-secret location said to be 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing is . . . how do we really know it was Stone? Oh, how just like the 
CIA it would be to discredit America's foremost leftist media gadfly by 
abducting him and substituting a poor typist in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, by all indications, no conspiracy was in effect: Not only did the 
Oscar-hoarding director-provocateur prove himself a more grammatically accurate 
on-the-spot computer keyboard operator than, say, Gore (as well Stone ought, 
being an Apple ad spokesman of late), but the hourlong session was full of 
classically Ollie agitprop -- albeit in slightly broken-up syntax, since the 
format only allows for one or two lines of textual input at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: First of all, it's a pleasure to "speak" with the greatest director 
of our era. Do you believe America's uncalled-for hysteria with crime, fueled 
by the media, will lead to an authoritarian response and a great swing to the 
right?  
</P>
<P>
 NBKSTONE: It already has. Nixon used fear as political theme. Promised us law 
and order and gave us chaos. Vietnam and Watergate. Bush used Willy Horton to 
stimulate fear scenario as well as Manuel Noriega. Fear of crime, very popular. 
Glamourized by media, keeps population passive. How can they think when they 
can't interact, locked behind doors watching television, fearing criminals.  
</P>
<P>
 These new forums are fascinating, at least with a literate subject like Stone 
-- allowing at times for a more sober discussion than the average radio or TV 
charm-fest might, but in a format more easily controllable for the benefit of 
the interviewee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's live "chat" took place in Wired magazine's "auditorium," with 
more than 400 America Online subscribers squeezing in to attempt to ask 
questions or just observe. Any suspicion that the host magazine's edgy 
reputation might make for an edgy Q&A were quickly put to rest, as the Wired 
reps who acted as gatekeepers for the questioning generally let through only 
the most puffball queries, usually preceded with the questioner's bald flattery 
in what amounted to a good deal of natural-born kissing butt. 
</P>
<P>
 These on-line conversations tend to be the populist equivalent of E! 
Entertainment Television -- or perhaps one of President Clinton's famous town 
meetings, with a more censorious moderator -- in which celebrities can rest 
easy that they won't be faced with any questions they'd really rather not 
answer. Why deal with that pesky press when you can eliminate the middleman and 
go right to the friendly fire of the people? 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Stone -- who rather likes to emphasize the hate half of his 
longstanding love/hate relationship with the media -- spent much of the session 
pillorying the press, much as he does in the broadly satirical "Killers," which 
is intended to spoof the way sensationalist TV coverage fans the flames of the 
national obsession with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Online Host: Do you expect the media to attack your film? Would this bother 
you?  
</P>
<P>
 NBKSTONE: Nothing would bother me after the "JFK" attack. Some media will 
superficialize my film by saying that I am glorifying violence. When I feel 
that I am imitating them and satirizing them to make a onetime point, but not 
to repeat the sensationalization on a weekly basis as television does.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: De Tocqueville said, "In order to enjoy the inestimable benefits 
that the liberty of the press ensures, it is necessary to submit to the 
inevitable evils it creates." How do you respond to this?  
</P>
<P>
 NBKSTONE: Tough question. Power of press is exceeded. Has exceeded government 
power. Can create mass hysteria. Can create war. Can demonize any individual it 
seeks to demonize. And obviously can distort the truth. One of the biggest 
problems, along with the environment, of our time.  
</P>
<P>
 Online Host: Do you think with recent events, this film is closer to truth 
than fiction?  
</P>
<P>
 NBKSTONE: Absolutely, what started as satire, became reality. I think Mickey 
and Mallory, with 52 bodies to their credit, would get a People cover. And 
disappear into the Great Yawn within two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the electronic odeon, AOL subscribers are divided into "rows"; if you 
get frustrated that none of your queries are getting through to the celebrity 
in question, at least you can vent by chatting with the seven or so other 
people in your row, in E-mail that isn't seen by the on-line host or 
interviewee. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be at least as entertaining as the more public conversation: When 
Stone discussed how screenwriter Robert Bolt helped get him his first agent, 
one person in our row asked, "Isn't 'agent' on the list of AOL nasty words?" 
Another carped that his question for Stone, "Are you wearing any pants," still 
hadn't gotten through. 
</P>
<P>
 No telling whether he wears khakis at his Mac, but Stone gave good agitation, 
humor and hype alike, the Apple of his on-line fans' eyes in this electronic 
love fest. 
</P>
<P>
 CSEmcee2: We're out of time. Do you have any closing comments, Mr. Stone?  
</P>
<P>
 NBKSTONE: August 26, Friday, the beginning of a new era in movies. I hope you 
will be there. Oliver. Thanks.

WHEN CHOREOGRAPHY AND COMPOSITION INTERSECT; CONCERT: ARTISTS FROM L.A. CHAMBER 
BALLET AND THE MUSIC-WRITERS COLLECTIVE LO-CAL COLLABORATE FOR A PERFORMANCE IN 
LITTLE TOKYO THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lo-Cal Composers, the local music-writers collective now marking its 10th 
anniversary, has changed membership and shifted priorities constantly but 
gradually over an eventful first decade. But the seriousness, wit and 
exuberance that many admired at its debut concert in September, 1984, still 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Chamber Ballet, the 13-year-old troupe founded here by Raiford 
Rogers and Victoria Koenig, continues its pursuit of artistic excellence and 
new collaborations both on the road and in a number of Southern California 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Lo-Cal and LACB come together at the Japan America Theatre in 
Little Tokyo. The featured composer at their performances is Sandra Tsing Loh, 
who joined Lo-Cal just a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsing Loh represents the quintessential 1990s composer-pianist-wordsmith in 
our city of the future: polymathic; multitalented; crossover-minded; musically 
and culturally sophisticated. Not surprisingly, her four high-achieving Lo-Cal 
colleagues -- Christopher Guardino, Murielle Hamilton, Roger Neill and Carlos 
Rodriguez -- have been described as similarly ambitious and talented. They are 
all in their early 30s.  
</P>
<P>
 With each season, Lo-Cal seems to seek new venues and avenues, fresh 
challenges, untried collaborations. "This year, we're going to try to go 
vocal," says Rodriguez, with some glibness, naming just one area of composition 
that currently fascinates the members. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, two of these composers are providing music for LACB. Scores by 
Tsing Loh and Neill form the sound-basis for new choreographies by LACB 
director Raiford Rogers and by Laurence Blake, danced by 14 members of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsing Loh says Rogers was "trolling for composers" when he attended a 
performance of music by the Lo-Cal group last fall at the L.A. County Museum of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting Tsing Loh, the choreographer asked to hear several of her 
pieces. The one he eventually chose, and which receives its dance premiere this 
week, was originally called "Night of the Grunion" -- a performance piece 
intended to be played on the beach at Malibu to encourage spawning by grunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen in rehearsal last week, the 11-minute ballet, now called "Cabin Fever" -- 
the title inspired by a painting by Susan Rothenberg, Rogers says -- turns out 
even more visceral and dramatically compressed than the score with which it 
wrestles. 
</P>
<P>
 The choreographer talks about the "coiled energy" in the sound-score (for solo 
piano and electronic orchestra), about how it resembles "a train that is not 
moving," or, to change images, about how it has "a healthy itch." What was 
Rogers' process in setting this music to dance? 
</P>
<P>
 "I listen endlessly. Then, when I come to make the dance, I sit at a table and 
I start with bar one." Later, he says, he tries out the moves with his own 
body, but not too strictly. "I don't want to set my limitations on the 
dancers." 
</P>
<P>
 He shows a visitor to the studio his workbook, filled with page after page of 
specific but practically undecipherable drawings of stick-figures, in temporal 
order, with motion indicated by arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art happens when two ideas intersect," Rogers claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Tsing Loh, after seeing the barely completed new piece, agrees. "I 
didn't know what to expect," she says, "but the ways in which he has gone 
counter to the musical motion make tremendous sense. Things seem to mesh." 
</P>
<P>
 The dance performance will open with Neill's "Delta Dervish." Played by the 
Greene String Quartet and danced by the artists of LACB, this will be the world 
premiere of both music and choreography. The other dance piece on the program 
is Blake's "Tunnel" (1992), to music of Eric Ruskin. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the agenda are world premieres of musical scores by Guardino (two 
songs, sung by mezzo-soprano Stephanie Vlahos), Hamilton ("Shed, Swoon & 
Skank") and Rodriguez ("Crazed Corollaries" for "solo, amplified, processed" 
clarinet, played by Marcus N. Eley.

<P>
 Thank you for Russ Parsons' article ("Hard-Boiled Detective Meets Shy 
Molecule": Aug. 11) on how to make a perfectly cooked hard-boiled egg. Could we 
now please have the sequel ("Hard-Boiled Detective Meets Stubborn Eggshell")? I 
am sure there are many readers like myself who have problems removing the shell 
without having to decimate it into a hundred little pieces.

 Your article on the perfect boiled egg was great. I've always used this 
method, but let the eggs sit covered for 20 minutes. Never thought about 
testing the water. Good idea. One thing is still needed, to make it "perfect," 
however. Just add a touch of vinegar (any kind) and that makes the shells come 
off much better. Some egg producers used to print this method inside the tops 
of their egg cartons. They should do it again.

 Your article on eggs left me mentally sputtering, fuming and talking to myself 
about what amazing things are allowed to appear in print. I have known for some 
50 years how to properly cook a hard-cooked egg. Don't even know where I 
learned it, but it is so superior to any of your methods (egad! sticking your 
hand in water, hoping it isn't hot). 
</P>
<P>
 Put any number of eggs in a pan with a lid. The only criteria here is that the 
eggs are in one layer. Cover with cold water, put the lid on and put it over 
the flame. Watch carefully and when the water just begins to boil, remove from 
heat. Allow to stand exactly 25 minutes. Empty water from pan and run a lot of 
cold water on the eggs. Let eggs sit in water until cool. If you are cooking 
the eggs for stuffing, you can roll them around with a wooden spoon while they 
are sitting in the hot water once or twice. That will center the yolks.

 I read your story about Cookbook Trouble (Aug. 4) and it reminded me of the 
following, which I thought you might be interested in. 
</P>
<P>
 A day or two after my first book was published my editor received a call from 
an angry reader who complained that my recipe for lemon-buttermilk cake didn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was a silly call (I had made the cake many times) but I tried it 
again and the reader was right. It didn't work. I made it over and over and 
over again. I tried everything. I never did find out what was wrong, so I asked 
my editor if we could delete the recipe in future printings. (Actually, I asked 
if we could recall the first printing. I said "General Motors recalls cars.") 
</P>
<P>
 I replaced the recipe with a caraway seed cake. 
</P>
<P>
 After that I started getting angry letters from readers who told me that the 
lemon-buttermilk cake was the reason they bought the book. Their friends were 
making it and it was wonderful. They wanted the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman wrote to say that she made a lot of money for her church by selling 
copies of that recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now 20 years later. The book is still being printed without that recipe 
-- and I still get complaints from people who want that one recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Me? I can't make it.

ESPY APOLOGIZES FOR TIMES COMMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, in an address broadcast to all department 
employees last Friday, apologized for remarks made in a recent Los Angeles 
Times interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quoted (in a Food Section story, "Mike Espy Fights Back," Aug. 11) as 
being sharply critical of the Food Safety and Inspection Service officials for 
their reaction to a deadly food poisoning outbreak in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to apologize to any FSIS employee who was offended by my recent 
comments . . . ," Espy said. "I did not intend to harm the morale within the 
FSIS, and if I have, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
 But Espy maintained that a "handful" of top employees were indifferent to the 
loss of life caused by the outbreak linked to hamburgers tainted with E. coli 
O157:H7 . 
</P>
<P>
 He said those people considered that it was "inevitable and expected" that a 
certain number of people would die each year from food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy had told The Los Angeles Times: "I got the impression that they knew 
about these deaths and they weren't excited. They considered the deaths 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The remark provoked angry letters to President Clinton from several 
professional groups.

 Piacere International Co. in Pasadena now has kosher certification of its 
fresh-brewed espresso. On July 26, Rabbi Lisbon of Kosher Supervision of 
America officially kosherized the equipment (on the off-chance that non-kosher 
ingredients may ever have passed through it) by the traditional purification 
method using fire, and from now on the letters KSA will appear on 
bottles.Available in hotels, restaurants and coffee houses; for inquiries, call

 Food writers generally don't express opinions about nightclub entertainers, 
but we're hereby making an exception. Our favorite chorine of all time, shown 
here as she appeared at a Los Angeles theater-restaurant in 1942, performing a 
Tahitian dance number in a hula skirt made out of ping pong balls, went by the 
silly but irresistible name of Jacqueline Potato. Like I Said, I'm the 
President of Canada 
</P>
<P>
 Just to make one thing perfectly clear, the President's Choice products (such 
as cookies and sodas) that you see in supermarkets are not actually connected 
to any past or present President of these United States. President's Choice is 
a Canadian-based brand, the private label of Loblaw, Canada's largest 
supermarket chain, and was established in the early 1980s. It's Hard to Be Lite 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of those nutritional label regulations, which (among other things) 
lay down specific definitions of the product designations light or lite, 
Marketing Intelligence Services Ltd. of Naples, N.Y., reports that only 3% of 
the new products introduced this year use either of those words, compared with 
7% last year. CHARLES PERRY

THAT WIDGETY FEELING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apropos your brief article (Newsbites, July 21): "Widgets" (devices that give 
canned Guinness Stout a foamy head like that of draught Guinness) were invented 
(according to authentic and unbiased English sources) at the Guinness Brewery, 
Park Royal, England, and justifiably won the highly prestigious Queen's Award 
to Industry for this superb addition to the transportability of a naturally 
brewed and magnificently tasting beer.  
</P>
<P>
 You mentioned that "widgeted" beer is not available in this country. May I 
suggest that you expand your horizons as far afield as Ventura, where 
"widgeted" Guinness is available in chilled cans at the "English-style" 
Victoria Pub and is highly recommended by those whose appreciation of such 
delightful beverages cannot be questioned.

 Re: Boiling sweetened condensed milk in the can, of years, Borden's advertised 
this about their Eagle Brand condensed milk and I did it many times as a young 
housewife.As I recall, it was horribly sweet, but I liked it because of its 
rich caramel flavor. Because of the pudding's richness, I whipped it with a 
spoon and then blended in whipped cream. I've often wondered why several holes 
punched in the top might not solve the problem.

PARTY LINE; STRIKE WHEN THE GRILL IS HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I called the MTA and told them, 'You're going to throw us a party for all the 
pain and agony you put us through,' " says Atlas Bar & Grill manager Stephen 
Noriega. "I can't believe it. They agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, the street in front of the Wilshire Boulevard 
restaurant/nightclub had been torn up and the restaurant's business curtailed 
by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Metro Rail construction. With 
the cranes and work crews finally gone, Noriega wanted to celebrate, and he 
felt Metro Rail should foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been real hell trying to get anything out of them," he says, "but now 
that they are done with the construction, they've started to warm up a little." 
</P>
<P>
 So last month, more than 500 neighbors up and down the street gathered at 
Atlas for drinks and hors d'oeuvres and to listen to former "Rifleman" co-star 
Johnny Crawford sing songs from the '20s and '30s, when the mid-Wilshire 
corridor was in its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one huge block party," says Noriega. "First (the guests) ran over to 
Metro Rail and picked up hats and T-shirts and toured the new underground 
station. Afterward, they came over here and ate like vultures." 
</P>
<P>
 Then things got rowdy. Just as MTA management bigwigs were taking the stage to 
make speeches, MTA bus strikers blocked their path and their leader, labor 
activist Eric Mann, grabbed the mike. MTA police nabbed the protesters, 
attempting to pull them aside, while TV news crews happily captured the whole 
scene on video tape. 
</P>
<P>
 While all this was going on, Noriega calmly stood by, grinning. "It was quite 
the scandal and I sort of provoked it," he says. "Eric Mann told me he would be 
making some kind of statement. So I told him, 'That's a great idea, I'll get 
you press (coverage).' Of course, I didn't let the MTA know I was back-stabbing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 At least all agreed that they liked the food. Long before the party ended, 
every last Thai duck taquito had disappeared. So had the guava-and-goat cheese 
quesadillas , the beef satay, the penne pasta with grilled chicken and ginger. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden ate two helpings of the penne. "The guy was ravenous," 
says Noriega, "and he didn't stop eating."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After testing this pasta dish, created by Atlas chef Tino Gomez, we understood 
why Councilman Holden wanted seconds. It's quick and easy and delicious. PENNE 
PASTA WITH GRILLED CHICKEN AND GINGER 1 pound penne pasta Salt 1/4 cup olive 
oil 2 teaspoons finely chopped ginger 2 teaspoons chopped garlic 4 ounces 
chicken broth 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 2 cups chopped Roma tomatoes, seeded 1 
teaspoon red pepper flakes 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, grilled and 
chopped into chunks Freshly ground pepper 4 green onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Cook penne in boiling salted water until al dente, about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in skillet. Add ginger and garlic. Saute until lightly brown. 
Add chicken broth, cilantro, tomatoes, pepper flakes, chicken and penne. Cook 
until heated through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
Garnish with chopped green onions. Makes 4 servings.

REALITY COOKING; CONFESSIONS OF A FORMER FOODIE; FROM FIVE-COURSE DINNERS AND 
AN EVER-SIMMERING STOCKPOT TO SALAD IN A BAG AND 20-MINUTE SOUPS, A FOODIE 
EMBRACES...

<P>
 Yes, I am the person who in a different life cooked 13-course dinners. (I have 
witnesses, living today.) 
</P>
<P>
 I am the person who entertained more than once a week in a wide variety of 
strange and wonderful cuisines. (Duck feet, anyone?) 
</P>
<P>
 I am the person whose 20-gallon stock pot was used so often the wallpaper in 
her apartment peeled off like a bad sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
 I am the person who catered her own wedding reception, for heaven's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I am the person who schedules a dinner for friends at 5:30 and starts 
cooking at 3:30, following an unexpected visit to my four-year-old's doctor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 I am the person who invites the editor of a sophisticated food magazine to 
dinner and gives her laundry to fold while cans of this and that are -- 
artfully, of course -- tossed together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am the person who sometimes wears two different shoes to work and doesn't 
realize it until late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking reality here, not a women's magazine version of dinner at the 
table served by a perky, smiling mother with a manicure. We're talking two 
working parents, play dates, swimming lessons, 
symphony-opera-shopping-thinking-reading-bicycle-riding days, nights and 
weekends that seem to dissolve into black holes of time. I go to bed in 
January, and when I get up, it's July. (Am I the only one this is happening 
to?) 
</P>
<P>
 Since the birth of my son and the disintegration of time as I previously knew 
it, I have learned a few things about cooking, time management and perspective. 
Life, eating and entertainment now revolve around three things: a little boy's 
play, good health and happiness. This does not allow time for elaborate dinners 
or dinner parties. Nor, strangely, do they seem necessary. Our friends have not 
abandoned us for better cooks; we are still invited back for dinner, even if 
the dessert we serve is M & Ms and ice cream sandwiches; we are not overeating 
from food boredom (overeating, perhaps, but for sport); nor are we seriously 
malnourished, despite the fact that this month my son seems to be eating only 
black beans, rice and Popsicles.  
</P>
<P>
 There are a few things we have stubbornly refused to abandon, however. Good 
food is one. Having friends over for dinner or brunch a couple of times a month 
is another. (Not only is this fun, it saves money on baby-sitters.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eating out is reserved for social occasions, rather than for evenings when 
we're too tired or too late at work to cook. On those nights we probably crack 
open a can of low-fat, low-salt soup, which we then make less healthy with the 
addition of soy sauce or cheese or something else with character and/or fat. 
For us, carryout seems too expensive and, more important, too much like work, 
since it needs to be picked up. Fast-food is something I'm just not ready for. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid desperate mid-week straits, I plan a little, use convenience products 
when they work and try to do something useful every second of the day. Julia 
Child once said to me, "Never apologize!" and that has become my mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is what I am not apologizing for: 
</P>
<P>
 Convenience products such as cake mixes that I once thought overpriced are now 
tucked very nicely into our eating life. And they do more than just save time. 
Bakery-bought cupcakes, for example, cost $3 to $5 for a dozen, as against $2 
for a box of mix, plus a can of frosting (on sale) that comes packaged with 
attractive candy sprinkles for decoration. Of no small importance, there's the 
entertainment value of watching a 4-year-old spray the walls with chocolate 
from an electric mixer. And the pride of someone who hasn't yet mastered 
shoe-tying when he frosts a finished cupcake and tops it off with colorful, 
unhealthy candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cake mixes are not just for children, though. Adults can enjoy them if they 
are properly topped, say with low-fat ice cream drizzled with caramel, 
sprinkled with chopped and partially melted Heath Bar candy. (Those watching 
their weight can substitute non-fat brownies for the cake.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the microwave oven, about which I vaguely (in that other life) 
remember saying, "Why would anyone want one?" As an example of our family's new 
reality-based style, when ours broke on a quiet Sunday morning we dressed 
quickly, hopped in the car and dashed around town looking for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Roast chicken needs to be rewarmed. Baked potatoes, which take on the 
texture of Styrofoam when microwaved, can be baked in the real oven in the 
morning before work and then successfully reheated in a couple minutes in a 
microwave at dinner time. But the microwave's chief and most valuable talents 
are reheating cooked rice (prepared in large batches in the rice cooker and 
kept in the refrigerator for several days) and steaming certain vegetables such 
as broccoli and baby carrots.  
</P>
<P>
 It can also be used for heating grilled chicken and cheese quesadillas. Black 
beans and rice. Cooked pasta and tomato sauce. Grilled fish. In short, the once 
disdained microwave now prepares most week-night dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to week-day survival, I'm convinced, is shopping only once a week. 
This forces planning, a modest amount of self-discipline and, despite the 
threatening nature of such a commitment, actually makes life easier. 
</P>
<P>
 So on weekends -- usually Saturday mornings, early -- I pull out recipes or 
recipe ideas I've collected in a file. Whether we're entertaining that weekend 
or not, I plan two dishes to cook on the weekend, plus one surprise to keep 
things interesting. This fills four or five dinner slots. The others seem to 
take care of themselves with pizza or dinner out or at a friend's house. And 
there's always the 10 gallons of something (often Prego spaghetti sauce) bought 
in a ravenously hungry moment at Costco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent weekend I made a wonderful, fall-apart roasted lemon chicken; 
tabbouleh (inspired by lemons given to me by a friend); a salad made of tomato, 
onion and stale Italian bread chunks tossed with salt, pepper and a little 
olive oil; and lastly, a too-garlicky hummus that we devoured with pita bread. 
This carried us through the better part of the week, when we added steamed 
rice, canned black beans and packaged chopped and pre-washed salad. (This is 
expensive, I know, but it seems like a good alternative to week-night salad 
spinning . . . just too much exercise on an empty stomach.) 
</P>
<P>
 On another recent Sunday we grilled, but not just for one meal and not indoors 
-- where we have a perfectly fine stove-top grill. The reason: I'm in charge of 
the indoor grill, but my husband rules -- and cleans -- the grill outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 And so he grilled, at a single standing: Italian sausage, salmon, shrimp, 
chicken and a huge pile of vegetables, including sliced potatoes (in their 
skins -- peeling is too much work) sprinkled with olive oil, fresh rosemary and 
coarse salt. 
</P>
<P>
 From that single barbecue we reaped grilled sausage for dinner that night (and 
for freezing in small servings as a future treasure); grilled swordfish, part 
of which was consumed the next night with grilled vegetables and two nights 
later in seafood-vegetable burritos; grilled shrimp, which ended up a couple 
days later in whole-wheat pasta with a spicy peanut sauce . . . Indonesian in 
spirit, if not literal translation. 
</P>
<P>
 The only cooking we do during the week occurs in the morning before work -- 
say, around 5:30, when sane people are sleeping and the day is quiet and cool. 
That actually is a good time to toss together a soup, so that it can steep in 
the refrigerator all day and taste even better by evening. A simple tomato soup 
with white beans and pasta (15 minutes) is one. Stir-fried sirloin soup is 
another. Chicken gumbo is a third. Minestrone soup with fresh and frozen 
vegetables is another. (Frozen corn and limas and canned tomatoes are just 
fine.) Nothing I make in the morning takes longer than 30 minutes, provided the 
ingredients are handy. I make sure they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Potatoes for dinner that night can be baked in the morning. Vegetables can be 
chopped for a quick evening stir-fry of hot-and-sour broccoli we eat with 
commercially made egg rolls. Corn bread from a mix can be popped into the oven 
and baked to serve that evening with canned vegetarian chili and grated cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 But if weeknight meals are survival of the hungriest, weekend entertaining is 
where the fun is. And, of utmost importance, where the good leftovers are. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where we find easy meals of grilled tandoori chicken, served with 
jicama and carrot cole slaw (3 cups grated jicama tossed with 1 cup grated 
carrot and a few tablespoons of bottled sesame dressing), apple rice, naan 
bread from a nearby Indian grocery store (substitute whole-wheat tortillas in a 
pinch), bottled chutney and plain yogurt spiked with a little cumin and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Another applauded company meal is Cuban in spirit: fried plantain chips 
(greasy, salty, delicious, sold in bags in some supermarkets and Latino 
groceries) and beer followed by Cuban picadillo (a ground beef dish with 
capers, raisins and olives), yellow rice (plain rice tinted with turmeric), 
canned black beans and salad from the bag. For dessert we share a platter of 
sliced Muenster cheese and chunks of guava paste (from a Latino market), a 
traditional Puerto Rican-style dessert served with very strong coffee in 
espresso cups. (Espresso is also too much work.) 
</P>
<P>
 An al fresco -style meal we like combines any or all of the following: 
cannellini (white kidney) beans tossed with tons of fresh, chopped oregano and 
black pepper, tomato, canned tuna and a fruity green olive oil; pasta with 
pesto (if there's any in the freezer -- garlic and olive oil if there's not), 
or maybe wild mushrooms and lemon, if I'm trying to impress; a few bowls of 
olives (including Trader Joe's great garlic-stuffed green ones); fresh 
mozzarella with tomatoes; grilled peppers (frozen from an earlier grill-out), 
marinated mushrooms or asparagus and a few kinds of bread -- maybe homemade, 
maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of our favorite entertaining meals is brunch, both because it is easy and 
because looking good on Sunday morning somehow seems rude -- thus, the food 
gets all the preparation time. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the popular brunch menus at our house: fresh orange juice (my husband's 
job) and sparkling wine, banana-buttermilk-wheat germ-pecan-honey pancakes with 
pourable raspberry yogurt and syrup, a fresh fruit platter (another job for my 
husband) and fried sausages (usually "lite"). 
</P>
<P>
 Of late I have served cornmeal pancakes made with corn-bread mix thinned to 
pouring consistency with milk and served with orange-honey butter and pureed 
berries (they're simply overripe berries sieved just before they go bad and 
tucked into the freezer for just such an occasion). 
</P>
<P>
 Another easy brunch menu: packaged tostada salad shells used as a container 
for eggs of any kind (probably fried for adults and scrambled for children) and 
a dollop each of sour cream, guacamole, tomato salsa and black beans topped 
with grated cheese. Serve this with margaritas or limeade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I've written two books on appetizers, I seldom make them any more 
except as entrees. Too time-consuming. One such former starter turned meal is 
chicken-and-cheese quesadillas with black bean and corn salsa. This takes 
minutes when made with already shredded cheese and previously grilled chicken, 
plucked from the freezer. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In theory, at least, there are still special occasions for which nothing is 
too difficult, too complicated or too silly . . . just like in the old days. 
The weird thing is, I just never seem to find the time. Maybe this is where the 
priority shift is most apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 For my son's first pre-school fund-raising event, I rose at 4:30 a.m. on a 
work day to make a fancy dessert designed to bring huge profits to the 
organization and honor my son's good name. When I arrived with the treasure I 
noticed everyone else unloading bags of packaged cookies and bakery boxes. I 
took this as a sign. Now when the need arises, I ask myself this question: Does 
it make more sense to play with him or spend hours messing up the kitchen? If 
the answer is play, I head for a bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, when I was recently asked, mid-week, to bring in a home-cooked dish for 
a school lunch two days later, I picked up the phone and dialed Pizza Hut, 
later explaining to the school that pizza is a traditional end-of-the-week 
family treat. They smiled. (Was that sympathy or disdain?) 
</P>
<P>
 I did not apologize. TANDOORI CHICKEN 4 pounds chicken breasts, skinned but

REALITY COOKING; A REALIST'S PANTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM UPTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reality cooking means breaking down and using convenience products. Here are a 
few that can make make life a little easier: 
</P>
<P>
 * Canned black beans: Either regular (about 59 a can) or nonfat (twice as much 
but less guilt-producing). Great mixed with rice and served with salsa and 
plain yogurt, rolled up in a tortilla or mixed with corn, fresh tomato and 
vinegar and oil spiked with cumin as an accompaniment to chicken and cheese 
quesadillas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh (not frozen) boned chicken breasts: These can be cooked in a variety 
of ways and then frozen for use later. This works particularly well when the 
chicken is marinated, grilled and sliced or stir-fried with, say, oil, garlic 
and a dash of soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grated cheese: I used to think these were too expensive, but now the only 
grating done at our house is of esoteric cheeses that can't be purchased that 
way.  
</P>
<P>
 * Tiny red potatoes: They microwave well and can be served whole sprinkled 
with almost any herb that happens to be growing at the moment. Or they make the 
basis of a good company lunch or light dinner: split or quartered, tossed with 
an anchovy vinaigrette, mixed with grilled tuna slices, capers, olives and 
tomatoes and served over a bed of greens. With bread, pretty darn good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pre-washed and packaged salads: The convenience is worth it . (she makes a 
big pt. in other article about never apologizing.)  
</P>
<P>
 * Packaged corn bread mix: This can be made into muffins, bread or pancakes. 
It's cheap and good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bottled salad dressing: I like Girard's Light Caesar (with a coupon since 
it's pricey) and Oriental-Chef Delicate Sesame.  
</P>
<P>
 * Garden-grown herbs: Having herbs from your own garden is like money in the 
bank. Not only are they cheaper to grow than to purchase, they free the cook to 
experiment -- and, a great luxury, to even garnish, when the mood and the truly 
unattractive dish strike. In pots, I grow flat-leaf Italian parsley, mint, 
tarragon, chives, oregano, sage and marjoram. I have one small bush of 
rosemary. Not only do they season, they can be tossed into packaged greens to 
produce an interesting salad to be served by itself or as a bottom layer for a 
plate of grilled chicken, seafood or vegetables. They are worth the effort. KIM

REALITY COOKING; TAKE-OUT: THE ULTIMATE REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BURUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an onslaught of competition from supermarket delis and swarms of 
take-out chains, independent carry-out shops -- which led the movement for 
quick, quality food that could be picked up on the way home from work -- still 
thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Southern California's best take-out comes from the following shops. 
Each in its own way has a special style that keeps customers loyal. Proprietors 
tend to be opinionated, down-to-earth andgenerous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A huge make-believe tree "grows" right out of the roof at Wesley's Place, a 
green market and carry-out food shop. Deli cases are surrounded by mountains of 
vegatables and ripe fruit. Here seasonal produce is the main ingredient in a 
constantly changing selection of dishes. The store's slogan is: "You'd cook 
like this if you had the time!" Wesley Bartera's food-from-the-garden theme may 
seem a timely marketing ploy in light of the USDA's advice to eat ample fruits 
and vegetables. But the idea actually evolved from the small 1,000-square-foot 
produce shop Bartera bought in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 She upgraded the produce quality and selection, which attracted local budding 
gourmet cooks. Eventually Bartera expanded the business by selling fresh-cut 
fruit trays, fresh salsas, guacamole and zucchini bread. But, she says, "people 
kept asking me to do a little of this and that for their parties and the whole 
thing just snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, Bartera moved into a new La Canada store more than six times 
larger than her original shop. Wesley's Produce became Wesley's Place.  
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal produce is transformed into American-style dishes with just enough 
quirky international touches to keep things interesting. Bartera's 25 or 30 
potato salad recipes, for example, include blue cheese potato salad and 
German-style potato salad. Coleslaw is also a standby and there's always one 
coleslaw with a novel twist: California red cabbage slaw, for instance, has 
strips of red and yellow pepper, zucchini and zingy lime-cumin vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Soups, especially the cold ones, are some of Wesley's more delicious 
concoctions. When peas are in season, the kitchen makes a chilled soup from 
fresh, slightly sweet peas, flavored with handfuls of fresh mint and finished 
with cream. Popular gazpachos include gazpacho verde and white gazpacho with 
garlic, cucumber and ground almonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In late summer, Wesley's bakes fruit and berry cobblers and makes big batches 
of homemade, low-sugar jam.  
</P>
<P>
 Wesley's entree menu lists three different options each week (you can fax your 
choices in at (818) 952-9324). There's always a dish called "chef's whim 
chicken breast." It might be marinated Yucatan-style and grilled or perhaps 
braised in a Dijon sauce. Other entrees might be pork loin with green 
peppercorn sauce, roasted game hen stuffed with wild rice and apricots, 
Mexican-style turkey lamb shank and vegetarian lasagna.  
</P>
<P>
 Bread is baked in-house, but Wesley also carries half a dozen varieties of 
Italian bread from Pani Pani bakery. Padus, with a rich yeasty flavor is the 
round loaf made from semolina flour,. filoni and fint (yes, fint), skate 
board-sized Italian white and whole-wheat loaves, are sliced for sandwiches. 
Demi-baguettes are made with Kalamata olives or walnuts, wheat and raisins or 
sun-dried tomatoes. While the counter people pack your order, you can relax 
with a cappuccino under the faux tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley's Place, 711- H Foothill Blvd., La Canada, (818) 790-4622. Monday to 
Friday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.

 Umberto Savone bounds around the long, thin stainless-steel kitchen of his 
Umberto Food, looking for ingredients to put on a pizza. "I call this pizza a 
la Nonna -- that's grandmother's pizza," he says, dangling a slice of grilled 
zucchini over dough on a wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid all my grandmothers would make this for us because it didn't 
cost much. They used up whatever they had around." Savone arranges pesto-laced 
roasted potato slicesand tiny chunks of sausage braised in tomato sauce, on the 
dough, then adds assorted grilled vegetables, goat cheese and low-fat 
mozzarella. "I'm still working on the crust recipe," he admits. "I called my 
mother to get her advice." Even so, the pizza is marvelous and homey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to cook like this by helping my grandmothers," Umberto SAYS. "I 
would hang around and do odd chores like bringing in wood for the stove. That 
way I would get a lot of good things to eat."  
</P>
<P>
 Cherubic-looking Savone is most well-known as a beauty-salon magnate. He is 
Umberto of Beverly Hills. His food venture, he says, is for his beauty 
customers. "Now they can take home some wonderful food after being busy all 
day."  
</P>
<P>
 Supervising his 126 beauticians and two salons, Umberto can't devote much time 
to the stove. Never mind. He leaves most of the cooking TO chef Pasquale 
Giordano and his assistant Roger Berrera. Green beans with caramelized onions, 
and whole cloves of roasted garlic may have been inspired by umberto's nona , 
but giordano uses fine French-style green beans.Although grilled baby summer 
squashes may be part of a home-cook's repertoire, Umberto's grandmother 
probably didn't use thumb-sized zucchini and yellow pattypans about the size of 
a nickel.  
</P>
<P>
 Thin scallops of skinless chicken breast, are quickly sauteed and seasoned 
with balsamic vinegar. one salad combines hearts of palm and fresh roasted baby 
artichokes with mushrooms and colorful peppers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to keep the food light," Giordano says and holds up a squid and 
vegetable salad. But there is something for everyone here: Roast chickens with 
rosemary, or chicken breasts lightly breaded and cooked milanese? style. 
Cheese-stuffed roasted eggplant slices are topped with full-bodied marinara, 
and cooked-to-order pastas include penne with grilled chicken and sun dried 
tomatoes in a light cream sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 At Umberto Food, pizzas can also be ordered anyway you like them, even the way 
Umberto's Nonna would have made them. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberto Food, 424 N. Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 274- 5653. Open Tuesday 
to Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

 Amalfi used to be an antique store on Santa Monica's Main Street until Janine 
and Rodolfo Giglioni turned it into their Italian gourmet shop about 11 months 
ago. deli cases and shelves of groceries all lead to the open kitchen where the 
two work as they talk to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the baby in the next room, the couple work stoves and counters all day. 
Janine makes fresh mozzarella. Rodolfo prepares his own lean chicken and turkey 
sausage daily. Week-ends, there's seafood sausage, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo grew up apprenticing in Italian restaurant kitchens; Janine studied at 
the restaurant-hotel school of culinary arts in Perugia. Husband and wife met 
in Italy and cooked together there for 12 years at Milan's famous Gualtiero 
Marquesi and Marina Due on Elba. This place gets better as you get to know the 
food...and the chefs. the giglioni's willcook whatever you're in the mood to 
eat.  
</P>
<P>
 If you need prompting though, there's plenty in the display cases to encourage 
you. Arancini, golden fried ovals of rice and cheese, are delicious with a side 
dish of brocoletti di rape sauteed in garlic. The garlicky bitter greens are 
also wonderful tossed with cooked pasta. Vegetarian cannelloni, are tender 
crepes filled with vegetables and ricotta. There's a different soup each day, 
too. "We only use vegetable broth; meat is too heavy for soup, " Rodolfo says 
of the white bean or lentil and vegetable soups they usually serve.  
</P>
<P>
 Amalfi's sandwiches are wonderfully exotic: Gorgonzola cheese with creamed 
walnuts and prosciutto cotto come on crusty Italian rolls or homemade focaccia. 
Prosciutto gets paired with radicchio and creamy mascarpone.Piadina Romagnola, 
served only in the wintertime, is a homemade pocket-style bread filled with 
Amalfi's freshly made mozzarella, prosciutto, grilled red peppers and spinach.  
</P>
<P>
 Amalfi also turns out the unusual Neapolitan Easter dessert called pastiera: a 
sophisticated-slightly sweet, ricotta-based cheese cake studded with chewy 
cooked wheat berries.  
</P>
<P>
 Amalfi, 2400 - D Main St., Santa Monica, (310) 392-7466. Daily 11 a.m. to 9 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Homey cooking of a very different sort comes from The Main Course, a place 
with food that seems to be straight from Fanny Farmer's cook book. Every day, 
the shop roasts turkeys that go into sandwiches or become turkey dinners served 
with mashed potatoes, steamed fresh vegetables, homemade cranberry sauce and 
gravy. The carcasses are used for soup and stock for the shop's gravy and 
sauces. Sometimes they will roast a stand of beef rib, or loins of pork or 
offer such nostalgia-inducing dishes as Irish lamb stew and corned beef and 
cabbage.  
</P>
<P>
 These savory dishes are the doing of Reggie Arjungi, now the owner. The two 
Canadian sisters who started The Main Course years ago served the same 
Mom's-home-cooking style. But Arjungi, sensitive to his customers preferences, 
has brought the food into the '90s lightning up many dishes that might 
otherwise be too rich.  
</P>
<P>
 Mashed potatoes at The Main Course have no milk or butter (or anything else). 
The more expensive Kingston Idaho potatoes he uses have enough flavor on their 
own, Arjungi believes. Gravy and most of the sauces are thoroughly tasty though 
made without butter or drippings. We don't claim this is diet food, says 
Arjungi, "we're just keeping up with the times."  
</P>
<P>
 I recently found out that The Main Course's frozen dinners have a great 
following with mothers of teenagers--presumably because they need to have 
wholesome meals on hand at a moments notice. Most are $4.95 for a single 
serving that amply serves two (unless served to male teenagers). The selection 
includes turkey chili, Hungarian chicken goulash and an especially good chicken 
tarragon. The large chunks of fork-tender, skinless braised chicken in a 
fat-free, tarragon-infused sauce tastes as flavorful as many richer versions 
would.  
</P>
<P>
 The Main Course, 10509 W. Pico Blvd. West Los Angeles, (310) 475-7564. Open 
Monday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.

 In the style of a French traiteur, a term that loosely translates to caterer 
or gourmet shop owner, Pascal Olhats, chef and owner of Orange County's 
well-loved Pascal country-French restaurant, opened Pascal Epicerie about seven 
months ago. His admirers had approached him to open other restaurants. But 
Olhats likes a business he can oversee personally most of the time. So he 
elected to open next door to his restaurant. From the shop's grand new kitchen, 
Olhats can cater larger parties and with the shop's specialites gastronomiques, 
his patrons may cater their own events with dinner or hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foods here have the solid robust flavors of Provence. This is the French 
soul food of garlic infused escargots, creamy potatoes au gratin, roasted 
chickens and tomato tarts. Deeply flavored confit of duck leg comes packed in a 
seasoned, rendered duck fat that is marvelous for sauteing onions and potatoes 
to accompany the duck meat.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the daily changing entrees you may find bouillabaisse, or cassoulet. But 
every day there will be Pascal's signature dish sea bass with a "crust" of 
thyme and crumbs resting on a tomato coulis.  
</P>
<P>
 For hors d' oeuvre, Pascal offers his black olive tepenade; an eggplant caviar 
and a marmelade of sweet caramelized onion to serve on croutons. There's a 
small but hard-to-find selection of French cheeses including several sheep's 
milk and goat varieties like brin d'amour, a goat's milk cheese ripened on a 
bed of herbs.  
</P>
<P>
 Charcuterie is also made on the premises which is extremely unusual in these 
days of commercial pate manufacturers. Pascal puts out about half a dozen items 
including his own rillettes and a duck and pistachio-nut terrine. A case holds 
picture-perfect tarts, cookies and house-made truffles.  
</P>
<P>
 Many patrons seem to be friends and long-time customers of Pascal and some 
avail themselves of the shop's wine cellar where they rent one of the lockers. 
Says Olhats, "I select my favorite wines from small vintners so they are often 
a much better value than wines from better-known wineries."  
</P>
<P>
 Pascal Epicerie and Wine, 1000 Bristol St . , (in Plaza Newport at Jamboree)

SUMMER COOKING; THE CORN CHRONICLES 
</P>

 We're growing corn. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had a summer vegetable garden every year since 1978, but I've never grown 
corn. Cooler urban heads always prevailed. People told me it took up too much 
room, that it was too temperamental, that it was meant for the hot, humid 
Midwest flatlands, not Santa Monica's sandy coastal soil. 
</P>
<P>
 So every year I planted the right stuff: tomatoes, basil, eggplant, the 
ubiquitous zucchini, a green bean or two. But I wondered about that elusive 
corn. I yearned for it. I kept remembering a story Calvin Trillin wrote about 
his boyhood in corn country. Trillin was the runner in his family, the one 
entrusted with picking the ripe corn and sprinting with it into the kitchen, 
where a pot of boiling water waited. Everything is supposed to taste better 
just-picked, and corn is supposed to taste best. Precious seconds make all the 
difference between a reverential experience and a pedestrian one. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults tend to believe in limits, though, so every year I settled for tomatoes 
right off the vine. Then this year, my five-year-old-daughter (who already has 
a prized set of junior garden tools, and clearly inherited my DNA on the corn 
issue) announced, out of nowhere, "Let's plant corn." 
</P>
<P>
 That was all it took. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We ordered "Early Sunglow" sweet corn seeds from Shepherd's Garden Seeds in 
Felton, bought white corn from our local nursery and got ready for new heights 
of gustatory ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so easy, as it turns out. Corn is a demanding crop. My other gardens did 
quite well on a mix of sporadic attention and Santa Monica's encouraging 
climate. Corn seeds were not about to yield their bounty unless we proved 
ourselves worthy of the reward. The seeds had to be planted in pairs of rows; a 
lonely stalk, it seems, is an empty stalk. If they sprouted at all, they had to 
be covered in netting or the local birds would swoop down like Hitchcock's 
gulls strafing Tippi Hedren. If the corn survived its adolescence, it would 
require food. Lots of it. Special, high-nitrogen fertilizer made from bat 
guano. (Somehow I imagine I never want to meet the scientist who figured out 
that connection.) 
</P>
<P>
 And then we had to pray for sun, lots of it, in a neighborhood where the 
euphemism "late night and early morning fog" usually means that we get sunlight 
between 3 and 3:30 every afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 We did it all. We planted and covered and fed and cursed the clouds until they 
fled. The early weeks were promising. Little sprouts grew quickly into 
something that resembled corn; two-foot-high plants that sported wide green 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one morning in mid-July, Sarah exercised her new ability to open the 
backdoor lock, went outside and let out the kind of scream that starts any 
parent's adrenalin pumping. I ran outside expecting to see the empty spot where 
she had been standing when the kidnaper grabbed her. Instead, I found her 
standing next to the tallest corn plant, pointing at a green, pebbly topknot 
that had magically appeared overnight.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" Sarah said. "Is that the corn?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, uh, sure," I said. "Or maybe not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second lesson of corn: Corn is a mysterious crop. The topknot got 
taller and then opened up into a whirligig of green, pebbly stems. Clearly this 
wasn't the corn. If each one of those stems grew into an ear of corn the weight 
would send the plant crashing to the ground.  
</P>
<P>
 We waited some more -- and then we got our first glimpse of a silky tassel, 
growing at the intersection of the trunk and one of the long leaves. Now I was 
on familiar supermarket turf. That, I announced, was the top of an ear of corn. 
 
</P>
<P>
 We were delirious. We had 16 plants. If each one yielded six ears of corn, a 
number we settled on arbitrarily (it sounded bountiful), we would get 96 ears. 
Enough for a corn feast -- for several corn feasts. But a friend who lived half 
a block from the ocean burst that bubble rather quickly. He swore that corn was 
literal. One plant, one ear. 
</P>
<P>
 One ear per stalk? The only corn I have ever seen up close was in the field 
Gordon MacRae cantered past in "Oklahoma," and for all I know the prop master 
added fake ears to make the morning look sufficiently beautiful. I was 
devastated. I confessed my dismay to Sarah's summer school teacher, who was 
about to have the kids plant corn and seemed to know about these things. She 
regarded me with a mixture of pity and amusement. "He's got bad soil," she 
said. "Sand. And he probably planted in single rows." 
</P>
<P>
 Our fantasy restored, we went back to watching, and waiting. One ear of corn 
formed, and then another, the husk wrapped in layers around it for protection 
from bugs or prying amateur farmers. The silks began to darken. By early August 
we were mesmerized, all of us. Sarah checked the color of the first tassel 
every morning. My husband, who grew up in Philadelphia apartments and considers 
a good waiter a primary food source, manned the sprinkler and trolled for 
snails. I removed aphids with a damp Q-tip, rather than spray our corn with a 
single chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even our friends inquired after our progress. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, who eats complicated foods and sophisticated wines, confessed that, 
for all the extravagant dishes he has sampled, he has always longed to taste 
fresh corn. 
</P>
<P>
 A realist asked me what I would do if the kernels didn't form properly, and 
for a moment I imagined myself the heroine of an O'Henry short story, sneaking 
out in the dead of night to paste a healthy ear of supermarket corn on the 
stalk, to spare Sarah the heartbreak of an inedible ear. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't happen. I believe in this corn. It has marked the passage of a summer 
-- and taught us something about anticipation and patience. There is no 
meddling with corn. Just waiting, devotion and a clean faith. It is a very 
romantic food. 
</P>
<P>
 I have begun to clear the route from the tallest plant to the cooktop. I have 
promised Sarah that if the first ear is out of her reach her father will lift 
her to it and then -- very fast -- put her down so she can run. I have more 
than once opened the cabinet to look at the steamer pot I'm going to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Sarah and her best friend and I were walking from the friend's house 
to ours when Sarah broke into a run. The other little girl yelled at her to 
wait, but she kept running -- and for once I forgot my job as peacemaker, 
mediator, traffic cop -- and just watched her go. She's fast. She pumps her 
arms; she's got a nice, straight, tough little stride. Let her go. I can see it 
already: She's be in the house, an ear in each fist, in nothing flat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, I will eat good corn right off the cob, uncooked. But in the 
interest of civilized living, here is the best recipe I know of for fresh corn: 
 
</P>
<P>
 STEAMED FRESH CORN 
</P>
<P>
 Pull off the husks (always buy ears with the husk still on, not the display 
corn they strip for show at the supermarket). Steam the corn for five minutes. 
Eat it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you make an impulse buy at the local farmers' market, this corn pudding, 
adapted from Joyce Goldstein's "Back to Square One," is a good, creamy, 
slightly spicy solution for the fresh ears you can't eat immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 CORN PUDDING 4 cups corn kernels, about 8 ears corn 2 tablespoons flour 
teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon 
cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 cup milk 1 cup 
half-and-half or light cream 3 eggs 6 tablespoons sweet butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Toss corn kernels with flour, salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg in bowl. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix milk and half-and-half in small saucepan and warm slightly over medium 
heat. Whisk in eggs. Add milk-egg mixture to corn. Add melted butter and mix 
well. Taste and adjust seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour corn mixture into buttered 2-quart baking dish. Place baking dish in 
larger pan. Pour hot water into larger pan about halfway up sides of baking 
dish. Bake at 350 degrees until pudding is pale gold and custard is almost 
firm, about 1 hour. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: For more Mexican flavor, add 2 large poblano peppers, charred, peeled 
and cut into small dice to corn mixture. Spread 3/4 to 1 cup shredded Monterey 
Jack cheese over top. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I suppose you could look at it this way: Anyone who grows corn saves the time 
it takes to go to the market to buy it, and so has the spare 25 minutes it 
takes to stand over the stove and stir this risotto, adapted from a recipe from 
Valentino restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 CORN AND RED PEPPER RISOTTO (Risotto Peperoni e Pannochie) 6 sweet red peppers 
2 ears corn, cooked and cut from cob Salt 1/4 cup butter 1 onion, chopped 1 
pound Arborio rice 1 cup dry white wine 2 quarts beef stock, boiling 1/4 pound 
Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated 1 tablespoon anise liqueur such as Pernod 
</P>
<P>
 Roast or bake peppers until dark brown. Peel, seed and cut tops off. Reserve 
tops and finely chop remaining peppers. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop corn into rapidly boiling, lightly salted water and cook briefly just 
until color changes. Cut kernels from cobs. Set kernels aside and discard cobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat butter over medium heat in large saute pan. Add onion and cook until 
translucent. Add rice and mix well, until rice looks glossy. Add white wine, 
bring to simmer, and add 3/4 cup broth. Cook, stirring, until broth is absorbed 
by rice. Repeat until rice is tender and creamy. Remove from heat. Stir in all 
but 1/4 cup chopped peppers, corn and half of cheese. Stir vigorously 4 to 5 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide risotto among 6 plates. Top each serving with reserved roasted pepper 
and sprinkle with some more cheese. Serve remaining cheese on side. Makes 6 
servings.

GOOD COOKING; THE BIRDS OF AUGUST

<TEXT>
<P>
 These waning days of summer pose a challenge in the kitchen. The problem is 
simple: August. What can possibly be appealing to cook after a full day of 
heat? 
</P>
<P>
 The following Asian-inspired menu saved the day recently when friends gathered 
around my table on a sultry evening. The main course was chicken marinated in 
an orange-teriyaki sauce and barbecued to a deep-bronze. On the side were fried 
rice with summer vegetables and a bold green salad in a fresh ginger dressing. 
Both were refreshingly light yet robustly flavored -- and both were made ahead 
of time during the coolest hours of the day. For dessert, fragrant peaches were 
tossed in a simple mix of vanilla, lemon juice, orange zest and sugar. CRUNCHY 
GREEN SALAD WITH FRESH GINGER DRESSING 6 cups iceberg lettuce, cut into 1 
1/2-inch cubes 3 cups watercress leaves 1 1/2 cups radish sprouts, top only 
Ginger Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Combine lettuce, watercress leaves and radish sprouts in large bowl and 
refrigerate until well chilled and crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, toss chilled salad with Ginger Dressing to coat evenly. Adjust 
seasoning. Divide between 6 chilled salad plates. Serve immediately. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, with dressing, contains about:

peeled, minced ginger root 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon paprika 
(preferably Hungarian) 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1/3 cup peanut 
oil 3/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Mix ginger, sesame oil, paprika, sugar, rice vinegar, peanut oil, salt and 
black pepper to taste in food processor fitted with metal blade or blender 
until ingredients are well-blended. Can be made day ahead and refrigerated. Let 
come to room temperature before using.

 This colorful rice dish is tasty whether it's served hot, at room temperature 
or chilled. It's essential to use chilled cooked rice for the best texture. 
FRIED RICE WITH COLORFUL VEGETABLES 2 large eggs 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 2 
tablespoons peanut oil 1 tablespoon sesame oil 3 cups chilled cooked rice 2 
large cloves garlic, minced 1 cup julienned carrots 1 cup corn cut off cob, 
about 1 large ear 1 cup thinly sliced green onions 1 cup frozen tiny peas 3 
tablespoons rice vinegar 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon light soy sauce Red pepper 
flakes 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in 
non-stick wok or 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 
eggs and cook, stirring, until just set. Remove eggs from pan and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Add remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil and sesame oil to pan over medium-high 
heat. When hot, add cooked rice and garlic. Mix well and stir-fry until very 
hot, about 4 minutes. Add carrots and corn. Mix well and stir-fry until heated 
through, about 2 more minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add reserved egg, green onions, peas, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, remaining 1 
teaspoon salt, and red pepper flakes to taste. Break apart egg into chunks with 
spatula. Toss to combine well. Stir-fry until just hot, about 2 minutes. Adjust 
seasoning. Serve hot, at room temperature or chilled. Makes 6 servings.

 Chicken always works well on the barbecue. But if you're watching your fat 
intake, skinless chicken breasts also grill successfully. To substitute chicken 
breasts, put them between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently flatten with a 
meat mallet until they are uniform in thickness, then marinate them. Cook five 
minutes or less over a hot fire, turning them once. Brush on the reserved 
marinade as indicated for the hens.  
</P>
<P>
 ASIAN ROASTED CHICKENS 1/2 cup lite teriyaki sauce 3 tablespoons peanut oil 
1/4 cup thawed frozen orange juice concentrate 4 large cloves garlic, minced 2 
(3-pound) chickens Salt Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Combine teriyaki sauce, peanut oil, orange juice concentrate and garlic in 
small bowl. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide marinade equally between two bowls, half will be for marinade, 
remainder for final brushing after chicken is cooked. Set both aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Use kitchen scissors to cut chicken in half, removing backbone. Wash and pat 
dry with paper towels. Place in large plastic storage bag. Add half of marinade 
and secure bag so that chickenis resting in marinade. Reserve remaining 
marinade for final brushing after chicken is cooked. Refrigerate chicken in 
marinade for at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. If marinating overnight, 
refrigerate remaining marinade reserved for final brushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove chicken from marinade. Place skin-side-up on foil-lined jellyroll pan. 
Brush with marinade in bag. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Roast at 450 degrees in center of oven until deeply browned and juices run 
clear when pierced with knife at joint, about 35 minutes. Remove hens from oven 
and brush generously with reserved marinade. Serve hot or very warm. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about:

 Given great peaches, this is the best way to enhance them. Th e recipe was 
inspired by a dish of fresh strawberries served much the same way at a 
wonderful Provencal restaurant, La Merenda, in Nice, France.  
</P>
<P>
 SIMPLY PEACHES 6 medium, firm but ripe peaches, sliced 1/3-inch thick 1/2 
tablespoon vanilla 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar, or to taste 1/4 cup fresh lemon 
juice 2 tablespoons grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 Toss peaches in bowl with vanilla, sugar, lemon juice and orange zest to coat 
evenly. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, divide evenly between 6 chilled shallow bowls. Serve immediately. 
Makes 6 servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: CHOW PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As inexorable as the Angels folding each autumn, as indomitable as ivy in a 
flowerbed, the march of Asian malls continues unchecked down Valley Boulevard, 
and the seating capacity for Saturday dim sum breakfast in the San Gabriel 
Valley probably approaches that for a Dodger game. By decade's end, the street 
may be one solid stretch of Chinese restaurants, bakeries and herbalists, red 
and gold Grand Opening banners flapping in the hot wind, continuing to the 
parched banks of the Rio Hondo and then beyond to the Pomona Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Chinese restaurants of Monterey Park can seem a little like 
ancient history, superseded by the newer, shinier San Gabriel places. Now the 
action is in Rosemead, just a little farther east, and there have probably been 
as many big-deal new restaurants in Rosemead in the last few months as there 
have been on the entire Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newest is 888, a terrifically elegant Chiu Chow-style Chinese 
seafood restaurant in a brand new Rosemead mall, with a dining room the size of 
two hockey rinks, chandeliers and fishtanks everywhere, and more wedding 
parties than you can shake a bouquet at. Squadrons of tuxedoed captains roam 
the floor, troops of waiters, legions of busmen. On weekends, the crowd for dim 
sum is so vast that it actually seems to recede into the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 And though nearly all of the giant Chinese restaurants seem to be Cantonese 
seafood houses -- with the exception of the big new branch of Lake Spring and 
maybe the late Great Chiu Chow Restaurant in Rowland Heights, which was 
recently replaced by another mega-Cantonese palace from the Ocean Seafood chain 
-- 888 specializes in Chiu Chow seafood, the cooking of the ethnic Chinese who 
migrated from China to Southeast Asia many generations ago. There are dozens of 
Chiu Chow noodle shops in the Southland, and a few fancier places, but 888 at 
dinnertime (lunches are fairly standard Cantonese dim sum) might be the best 
place to check out the formal cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiu Chow cooking is generally a simple cuisine: sour flavors, strongly salted 
foods, clear broths and fresh seafood unmasked by complex sauces. My first meal 
at 888, which included a sort of sharply garlicky terrine of beef shank, 
crunchy, tofu skin-wrapped dumplings of fresh crabmeat and taro ("crab balls"), 
a soft, anise-scented lamb stew, and sugar snap peas sauteed simply with oil 
and a touch of salt, seemed almost country French, like a good Monday-night 
menu at Berkeley's Chez Panisse. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the crab balls, the shrimp balls, and the minnows -- "silver fish" -- 
crisply fried whole in a coating of spicy salt, the Chiu Chow cold plate is a 
good place to start: symmetrically arranged slices of tender steamed geoduck 
clam, aspic-rimmed pork terrine, crunchy strands of jellyfish, cold halved 
shrimp in a sweet, citrus-based sauce. Fish noodles, lumpish strands of 
homemade chewy linguine with leeks and slivers of fish, are tossed in a very 
hot wok, so the dish is smoky, sweet, a little salty, with a subtle flavor of 
very fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
 One soup, served in a bubbling chafing dish, holds a whole perch gently 
poached in the heat of broth, sharp with the flavor of Chinese celery and 
herbs, made complexly tart with sour plum. A thick, peppery shredded-duck soup 
has almost the flavor of a classic hot-and-sour soup but made vivid with the 
occasional blast of muskiness from dried orange peel; duck and sour plum soup 
has a slightly high, slightly sweet poultry/fruit taste that is almost like a 
blast from a Thanksgiving dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 888 does well with its "barbecued" poultry: roast chicken with the 
shatteringly crisp skin of Peking duck, served with a sour plum/fermented tofu 
dip the pale rose color of a 19th Century Japanese print; another roast chicken 
that had been rubbed with five-spice powder; extremely good roast duck. There 
is an astonishing dish of Chiu Chow-style braised goose, a specialty of the 
restaurant: neat slices of white meat and dark arranged in a heap, garnished 
with strips of fried bean curd served with a dipping sauce somewhat like a 
fruity Chinese vinaigrette, and probably worth the $20 per half goose it costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, if you remember to ask for them, can be pretty wonderful here, 
various sweet red bean soups, richly flavored hot taro puddings and cool mango 
gelatins that are just the thing after a multi-course Chiu Chow meal. 
</P>

WINE: A VINE GROWS IN MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this keeps up, pretty soon Los Angeles will be able to thumb its nose at 
the Napa Valley, give a Bronx cheer and boast, "We make Cabernet as good as 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest entrant in the local fine-wine derby is an exceptional red wine 
made by a real estate executive at a 12-acre mountaintop vineyard. The name of 
the wine is Rosenthal. The vintage is 1991. The appellation is Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, well, Malibu is where the grapes were grown, but since Malibu is not yet a 
recognized American Viticultural Appellation, this wine bears the appellation 
"California." But its subtitle, "The Malibu Estate," clearly indicates where 
the grapes were grown. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine, made by George Rosenthal -- whose privately held Raleigh Enterprises 
Corp. owns several properties, including the Westwood Marquis and the Sunset 
Marquis -- went on sale last week at select Los Angeles wine shops and 
restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal joins Moraga Vineyards' Tom V. Jones in making premium wines in the 
Los Angeles area. The 1990 Moraga Red Table Wine is in high demand around town 
-- despite its $50 price tag. That price reflects not only the wine's quality 
but the fact that Jones' six-acre vineyard in Bel Air will never make much 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's vineyard, by contrast, may reach 16 acres when fully planted; 
although his vines produced only 180 cases of the 1991 wine, in the future 
he'll be able to make as many as 1,500 cases of Rosenthal Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal says he wants to keep the price of his Cabernet "a good value for 
people who appreciate fine wine." His '91 Cabernet is terrific -- packed with 
cassis-like fruit and nuances of herbal/chocolate and violet notes. At $20 it 
is a relative bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosenthal Malibu wine story goes back 17 years. "My wife Karen (Sharp) and 
I were in Spain in 1977, looking at Andalusian horses when I began to think 
about building a rancho in the Malibu area," Rosenthal says. He thought of 
planting grapevines there, close to sea level, but knew that coastal fog could 
be a major problem. Fog can create rot and delay maturation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I flew a small plane in those days, and I knew that the marine layer comes in 
and blankets the area but that it tops out at 1,300 feet or so," he says. "So I 
flew north to see what areas existed that were high enough to avoid that layer, 
and I saw a meadow at about the 1,400-foot level just off Latigo Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal drove around the area, ignoring "Trespassers will be Shot" signs, 
until he located the man who owned the meadow. He tried to buy it, but no deal. 
The man didn't want to sell.  
</P>
<P>
 It took two full years of pleading and cajoling, but in 1979, Rosenthal 
acquired 25 acres and began the arduous process of testing the soils to see 
whether the costly business of planting a vineyard would be practical. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal knew that the Southern California climate wasn't bad for grapes. In 
the 1830s a Los Angeles pioneer named Jean-Louis Vignes planted extensive 
vineyards near present-day downtown, east of the street that now bears his 
name, and made wine long before there were vineyards in Napa or Sonoma. 
Rosenthal also knew that wine grapes had once dotted the landscape from Long 
Beach to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he also knew that these grapes were hot-climate varieties that made 
hearty, inexpensive, rough-hewn red wines of little character. He intended to 
plant Cabernet Sauvignon, the noble grape of Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a challenge. Still, the soil tests were encouraging -- they showed 
that the meager topsoil on his property was actually tailings from the 
construction of a tunnel at Kanan-Dume Road, meaning that it contained a lot of 
rock, which is ideal for good drainage.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1986, all was ready. Rosenthal hired Jim Efird, an experienced Central 
Coast grape grower, to plant the vines. Some went in during the spring of 1987; 
the first usable crop was harvested in 1990. Eventually Rosenthal planted a 
total of 12 acres of vines, near the barns where Sharp breeds national and 
international champion Andalusian horses. Winemaker Bruno D'Alfonso, of Sanford 
Winery in Buellton, makes the wine for Rosenthal at Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
 The first release of the 1991 Rosenthal, in a tall, Italian-made bottle, 
sports a label that initially looks torn. On closer inspection one sees that 
the "tear" represents the 1,650-foot ridgeline that separates the property, 
which Rosenthal has named Rancho Escondido, from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, he's heard all the jokes about the Malibu fires: He's got a hot wine; 
it has a faint aroma of smoke; at this price no one will get burned. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Escondido is the third fine-wine venture in the western hills of Los 
Angeles. There were plenty of skeptics about the first two, Calabasas Cellars 
and Moraga. Though Calabasas is now in hibernation, Moraga definitively 
established the potential of fine wine in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Moraga's Jones, former president of Northrop Corp., and his wife, Ruth, bought 
a home on an acre in 1959 and turned the place into an oasis, with dozens of 
fruit trees, flowering plants, herbs and vegetables. Fruitless as it might have 
seemed at the time, Jones put in a test vineyard in 1978. The results were 
promising and planting of a small commercial vineyard began two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he was able to add five acres to his small estate, and -- on land 
worth literally millions of dollars per acre -- he planted grapes, mostly 
Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The wine is under the direction of 
consulting winemaker Tony Soter, who makes one of the finest Cabernets in the 
state under his own Etude label in the Napa Valley. Like Rosenthal's wine, 
Jones' wine is made at Sanford in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story at Calabasas Cellars, owned by veterinarian Al Plechner, isn't quite 
so rosy, though he also has made excellent wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Plechner, who operates California Animal Hospital on Sepulveda Boulevard in 
West Los Angeles, made six vintages of various wines from 15 acres of vines on 
his ranch in Calabasas. The ranch was part of a project set up to care for 
animals that government agencies couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas Cellars wines were very good, including an excellent Zinfandel, 
but by 1986 Plechner's energies were being stretched too thin to continue the 
project. Some vines were abandoned, and 1985 was the last formal vintage from 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year's fires wiped out all but 2 1/2 acres of vines. Plechner is 
beginning to think the wine project may never be revived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my vines," he says. "It's such a romantic endeavor, and I'd like to do 
it again." Unfortunately, he says, the animal hospital and his other ventures 
have kept him too busy, though he'd consider a joint venture with someone who 
could put time into vineyard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Napa Valley vintners can rest easy a few more years.

 DEAR SOS: Every week I pray that you have found the rice pudding recipe that 
was in The Times' old Home Magazine supplement years ago. It was the best I 
have ever found. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARION 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR MARION: Was this it? OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN RICE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup long-grain rice 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
 Whipping cream, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse rice thoroughly in bowl, then drain. Combine rice and 2 cups milk. Let 
stand in refrigerator overnight. Next day, turn rice into 1 1/2-quart 
casserole. Add remaining 2 cups milk, sugar, butter, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. 
Bake at 325 degrees 1 hour, stirring occasionally to break up brown "skin" that 
forms on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, place raisins in bowl of hot water. Let stand until softened. Drain 
raisins, stir into rice mixture and bake 15 to 20 minutes longer, stirring 
occasionally. Pudding is done when rice is soft and fluffy. Liquid that has not 
been absorbed will be soaked up by rice on standing. Let pudding stand at least 
10 minutes. Stir before serving. Serve with whipping cream. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Pudding reheats well. Stir in some additional milk to moisten when 
reheating. 
</P>

 DEAR SOS: With the popularity of flavored vinegars and the pretty bottles they 
come in, do you have any recipes for making them from scratch? The store-bought 
ones are quite costly. They make great gifts for upcoming holidays too.  
</P>
<P>
 -- BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR BARBARA: Yes, we do have a recipe. And just in time for adding the 
wonderful herbs of summer. HERB VINEGAR 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint white wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups fresh snipped tarragon, basil, dill, chervil, thyme and/or other 
favorite herbs 
</P>
<P>
 Place herbs in wide-mouthed sterilized jar and crush lightly with wooden 
spoon. Bring vinegar to boil and pour over herbs. Cool at room temperature. 
Cover tightly and let stand in cool place (not refrigerator) from 3 days to 2 
weeks. Strain and refrigerate for use when needed. Makes about 1 pint. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Sprigs of herbs can be added to jar when strained vinegar is transferred 
to permanent jar.

BACKYARD PIZZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CARROLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pizza came from Naples, they say, where peasant women would top chunks of 
baking bread with whatever was in the kitchen. Now pizza is the favorite food 
of millions of Americans, young and old. But in the dog days of August, pizza 
is the last thing I want to cook in my hot kitchen. I'd rather be outside on 
the tree-shaded deck, catching the breeze and grilling dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Marry the two and you get grilled pizzas, a new innovation for summer dining. 
</P>
<P>
 You can shortcut the process and use frozen pizza dough; thaw it and bring to 
room temperature to rise before topping and grilling. But true pizza lovers 
will enjoy the easy homemade crust recipe that follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza can be as low-fat as an undressed salad; it's all in the topping. Very 
little fat goes into the crust if it's homemade -- maybe a smidgen of olive oil 
to keep the dough silky. On top you can pile anything -- from fresh vegetables 
to fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you choose cheeses (although plenty of grilled pizzas are topped without 
them), look for the stronger varieties of reduced-calorie ones. Asiago, Swiss, 
Parmesan, Romano, provolone, Cheddar and Monterey Jack lend the pizza more 
flavor for the ounce than mild-tasting mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomato sauce for grilled pizza can be store-bought or homemade. Try a simple, 
light sauce whipped together in the food processor -- just puree ripe tomatoes, 
fresh basil and salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 As your dough rises and becomes ready to shape, start preheating your grill. 
According to the chefs at Al Forno restaurant in Providence, R.I., a charcoal 
grill with hardwood charcoal produces the best pizza with a wonderful smoky 
crust. When white ash appears on the coals, the grill is ready for the first 
pizza. Gas grills are less messy but impart less flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sliding the pizza onto the grill is not hard. Place dough on the oiled back of 
a metal cookie sheet. Using your fingertips, slip one edge of the circle of 
pizza dough off the baking sheet and gently drape it onto the grill. Continue 
working the dough off the baking sheet until the entire circle is on the grill. 
If the coals are ready, it only takes a minute or two for the pizza to puff 
slightly and get grill marks. Then it's ready to top. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've found it's easiest to flip the pizza (grilled side up) back onto the 
baking sheet to top, since placing the ingredients on top may take longer than 
I want the pizza to remain on the grill. After topping, slide the pizza back 
onto the grill to allow cheese to melt, sauce to heat through and grill marks 
to appear on the reverse side. This takes about five minutes -- faster if you 
cover the grill. Watch for charring. 
</P>
<P>
 On most grills, you can cook only one pizza at a time, but they cook so 
quickly I didn't find this a real problem. Sliding the raw dough onto the grill 
often produces some interesting shapes in the finished pizza, especially if the 
dough sticks to the baking sheet and has to be tugged off. But this all 
combines to make a very appealing, homemade pizza that friends and family will 
all love. 
</P>
<P>
 The following pizza dough may be made in quantity and frozen after the first 
rising; roll it into circles, place on baking sheets and freeze. When frozen, 
slip into self-sealing bags. To use, let the dough come to room temperature and 
continue with the recipe below. BASIC PIZZA DOUGH AND TOPPINGS 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup lukewarm water (98 to 102 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon active dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups whole wheat or unbleached white flour, plus up to 1 cup additional for 
kneading 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Pesto Topping or Roasted Red Potato Topping 
</P>
<P>
 Place honey, water and yeast in prewarmed bowl and mix well. Cover top of bowl 
with clean dish towel and let stand in warm place 5 minutes or until mixture 
foams. Stir in 1 cup flour and mix well. Let rise in warm place 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in another 1 cup flour, oil and salt. Knead 5 to 7 minutes into pliable 
but elastic dough, adding additional flour as needed. Place dough in clean, 
greased bowl and cover with dish towel. Let rise in warm place until doubled in 
bulk, about 1 hour. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 12-inch circle on 
floured board. Oil back of metal baking sheet and transfer 1 circle onto it. 
</P>
<P>
 Preheat grill until coals are covered with white ash. Slide 1 circle of dough 
onto grill. Cook 1 minute or until dough puffs slightly and stiffens. Flip back 
onto baking sheet (side with grill marks should be up). Add topping of your 
choice. Return pizza to grill. Cover and grill 5 minutes longer, or until 
topping is hot and pizza has grill marks on underside. Repeat process with 
second circle of dough. Makes 2 pizzas, or about 10 servings. Pesto Topping 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, very finely minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely chopped walnuts or pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup toasted rye bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup shredded Asiago or other low-fat cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped spinach leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons dried basil 
</P>
<P>
 Thinly sliced tomatoes, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Combine garlic, nuts, bread crumbs, cheese, spinach, parsley and basil in food 
processor fitted with steel blade and pulse until finely minced. Spread mixture 
on pizza dough. Top with thinly sliced tomatoes. Grill as instructed above. 
Makes enough topping for 2 pizzas. Roasted Red Potato 
</P>
<P>
 Topping 
</P>
<P>
 8 small red potatoes, peeled and scrubbed 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil, warmed 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup apple juice or defatted stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sliced mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup shredded Asiago or low-fat cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Thinly slice potatoes. Brush with oil and place slices on baking sheet. Bake 
at 450 degrees 20 minutes while pizza dough is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat apple juice in separate pan. Add mushrooms and saute until tender and 
lightly browned. Drain. 
</P>
<P>
 To assemble pizzas, top with roasted potatoes, then add mushrooms and sprinkle 
with cheese. Grill as instructed above. Makes enough topping for 2 pizzas.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; ORGANIZERS OF SHELTER SEEKING NEW SPONSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN COX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of a stalled homeless shelter at the former naval housing facility 
in west Long Beach are scrambling for funding after the initial sponsor 
withdrew from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Mission last month withdrew its pledge to provide most of the 
funding and some personnel for the shelter because of federal guidelines that 
prohibit mandatory religious instruction at the site, a mission spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach-based Christian Outreach Appeal initially proposed the homeless 
project, and secured the funding agreement with the mission. About 200 
apartment units at the former Cabrillo and Savannah naval housing projects 
would be converted to temporary residences for homeless families and 
individuals. Christian Outreach Appeal had hoped to open the units in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Salvation Army is seeking a $2-million grant from the Housing and 
Urban Development Department and has offered to operate the facilities if the 
grant is approved, said Daryl Ogden, director of a Salvation Army shelter in 
Bell. The organization does not require religious services at its facilities, 
Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the HUD money is approved, the Salvation Army still could open the facility 
by the January deadline, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-acre housing project was approved by the Navy last month. JOHN COX

COVER STORY; A FAMILY TRADITION; SECOND- AND THIRD-GENERATION SCHNEIDERS ARE 
CARRYING ON THE PRACTICE OF FIGHTING FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighting is a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
 They're everywhere, these firefighting families, families chock-full of 
fathers or sons or brothers or uncles or cousins or nephews all dedicated to 
fighting fires -- "putting the wet stuff on the red stuff," as firefighters 
say. Perhaps more than in any other profession, the desire to become a 
firefighter seems to be passed on genetically, like a hot spot in the family 
DNA code. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't any statistics on it, no known scholarly studies. But stop by 
almost any fire station in the Southeast/Long Beach area, Los Angeles County, 
or the whole country for that matter, and chances are you'll see the phenomenon 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's tons of those kinds of families" among about 50,000 paid and 
volunteer firefighters in California, says Wally Hurst of the California State 
Firefighters Assn. "The joke is that it's probably some sort of genetic 
defect." (So far, at least, it's a predominantly male gene: Less than 1% of 
firefighters statewide are women.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, Deputy Chief Rick DuRee is the son and grandson of Long Beach 
firefighters -- and he may soon see his own son become a fourth-generation 
firefighter. In Compton, Fire Chief Milford Fonza, who started his career as 
the first black firefighter in Iowa, is the father of a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne Battalion Chief Bruce Bradford is the son-in-law of a former 
firefighter. His son, Craig, is a Hawthorne firefighter, and Craig's wife, 
Cathy, is a Long Beach firefighter. In the Los Angeles City Fire Department, 
there are the Olsen brothers -- Raymond, Robert and Richard -- all of them 
current or retired battalion chiefs, all of them the sons of former Battalion 
Chief Walter E. Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the many firefighting families, in perhaps none does that hot spot in 
the DNA burn more brightly than in the Schneider firefighting family. Ted, 
Larry D., Paul P., Howard N., Larry P., Scott, Howard R., Phil, Paul R. -- they 
are or were all firefighters, spanning three generations, accumulating between 
them almost 2 1/2 centuries of firefighting experience. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not even counting the four firefighting cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd be hard-pressed to name a major fire in the Los Angeles area within 
memory that hasn't had a Schneider or two, or three, fighting it: the Hollywood 
Park Race Track fire in Inglewood in 1949, the 1961 Bel-Air fire that destroyed 
500 homes, the 1965 Watts riots fires, the 1992 riot fires, the Los Angeles 
firestorms of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 It all started with grandpa Ted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Schneider started working for the Los Angeles City Fire Department in 
1912, a time when firetrucks were still pulled by horses. He was only 17, a 
year short of the minimum age, but he wangled a job as an "extra man," 
available when needed. He was paid by the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Ted later began working for the Fire Department full time. In 1923 he moved to 
the county fire department and began organizing fire districts in what are now 
Watts, Gardena and Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he and his wife, Adelaide, had five sons. Three of them -- Howard 
N., Larry D. and Paul P. -- became Torrance and Los Angeles city and county 
firefighters. (Another son, Bob, was killed in 1940 when a bulldozer rolled 
over on him while he was working for the Forest Service clearing a firebreak in 
the Malibu area.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Schneider retired in 1955 after more than four decades of firefighting. 
When he died in 1977, three of his grandsons also had become firefighters. 
Eventually, five of Ted's grandsons would become firefighters -- Larry P. with 
the Los Angeles City Fire Department, Phil and Paul R. with the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department at stations in Lakewood, Huntington Park and 
Willowbrook, among others, and Howard R. and Scott with the Torrance Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Schneider boys, becoming firefighters seemed like the natural thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all grew up hearing fire bells," says recently retired Torrance Fire Capt. 
Howard N. Schneider, 62, who spent 40 years with the department. He means that 
literally: To receive fire calls when the fire company was out of the station, 
Ted Schneider installed an extension of the firehouse phone in the family home 
near the corner of 97th Street and Normandie Avenue. Adelaide served as the 
temporary dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father lived (at) the fire department," Howard N. Schneider says. "Our 
whole lives revolved around it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 6 years old when I discovered I wanted to become a firefighter," says 
Larry D. Schneider, 66, a Los Angeles City Fire Department battalion chief. "My 
mother and I were watching Dad fight a fire, and when my mother wasn't looking, 
I snuck away and climbed up one of the ladders and got on the roof. One of the 
firemen saw me and grabbed me and carried me down, and of course my mother was 
horrified. But I knew then that that's what I was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was probably the biggest influence on my life," says Paul P. 
Schneider, 71, a retired County Fire Department assistant chief. "I used to 
hang out at the fire station all the time and get to see the firemen. They were 
a great bunch of guys. It was only natural for a kid to want to be like them." 
</P>
<P>
 For the succeeding generation of Schneiders, the dose of firefighter 
indoctrination increased exponentially: They got it not only from their fathers 
and grandfather but from their uncles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow up in a firefighter family like ours, you hear all the war 
stories," says Larry's son, Phil, 31, an 11-year veteran of the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department. "The fires, the rescues -- the job is what everybody 
talks about. It's exciting to a kid. It makes you want to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent more Christmases and birthdays at the fire station when I was a kid 
than I did at home," says Paul R. Schneider, 27, a Los Angeles County 
firefighter assigned to Station 164 in Huntington Park. He also has worked at 
Station 41 in Willowbrook. "The fire station was home in a lot of ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Children of firefighters cite several reasons why they wanted to become 
firefighters themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it's steady work -- there will always be fires, and thus 
firefighters. It's also pretty good money. According to the State Firefighters 
Assn., firefighters in the Los Angeles area make $45,000 to $50,000 a year, 
base salary; fire captains average about $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major reason the children of firefighters want to become firefighters 
is admiration. They admired Dad and his firefighter colleagues, and they 
admired the way Dad and his friends were admired by others. On any elementary 
school playground in America, to have a dad who was a firefighter was 
considered far cooler than to have a dad who was a lawyer or a banker or even 
the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are some drawbacks to the firefighter's life -- for example, the 
near certainty that sometime in your career you're going to get hurt. In 1992, 
the last year for which figures are available, 1,641 firefighters were injured 
in California -- about one out of every 30 on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Every one of the Schneiders has been injured while fighting fires. Howard N. 
Schneider, for example, was forced to retire this year because of heart and 
lung damage he suffered when he tore off his protective face mask to warn his 
fellow firefighters about toxic materials in a 1985 industrial fire in 
Torrance. Phil Schneider suffered first- and second-degree face burns battling 
brush fires. Larry D. Schneider was severely burned when a roof collapsed and 
he fell into the fire. And so on throughout the Schneider family, a litany of 
burns and bruises and scrapes and breaks and seared lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risk, or maybe at least partly because it is a dangerous and 
daring occupation, the children of firefighters seem driven to do whatever is 
necessary to follow their fathers into the station house.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Schneider, for example, wanted to be a firefighter so badly that he 
"divorced" his firefighter father. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not quite like it sounds. Howard N. Schneider adopted Scott when he was 2 
years old, and like every other Schneider kid, Scott grew up wanting to be a 
firefighter like his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all I ever wanted to do," Scott says.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1975 Scott got a job as a firefighter at Hughes Aircraft Co., but his 
ambition was to become a city firefighter. A few years later, there was an 
opening at the Torrance Fire Department. Scott was qualified for the job, but 
there was one problem: Torrance had a nepotism ordinance specifying that 
immediate family members of city workers couldn't hold jobs in the same 
department. And Scott's dad, Howard, was a Torrance Fire Department captain. 
</P>
<P>
 So Scott called a friend of his and started legal proceedings to have the 
buddy and his wife adopt him. When the adoption went through, it legally 
severed Scott's earlier adoption by Howard; Scott was, legally speaking, no 
longer Howard's son, and thus could join the Torrance department. The Torrance 
nepotism ordinance later was thrown out, and Scott was readopted by Howard.  
</P>
<P>
 Being the son or daughter of a firefighter still can be a disadvantage in 
getting a firefighter's job, at least in the same department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, for example, there was an outcry in Long Beach when seven of the 21 
applicants chosen to attend the city's firefighting academy turned out to be 
the sons of Long Beach firefighters. The 21 had been selected from more than 
600 applicants who were considered qualified, who in turn had been chosen from 
5,000 total applicants -- an indication of the tough competition for 
firefighting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of firefighters' sons in the group was not unusual. Ken 
Brondell, a Los Angeles City Fire Department firefighter and a director of the 
State Firefighters Assn., remembered that when he attended firefighting academy 
25 years ago, one-third of his classmates were sons of firefighters. That was 
about average, Brondell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters say it's only natural for their offspring to do well in fire 
department selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably an advantage for them because they tend to be more tenacious 
in seeking the jobs," Brondell says. "They start sooner, and they focus 
themselves on getting the education they need to make them more acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a number of Long Beach observers cried foul, saying that the 
sons of firefighters obviously had been given special consideration. As a 
result, five of the firefighters' sons were bumped, at least temporarily, from 
the academy list. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them was Michael DuRee, 26, the son of Long Beach Deputy Chief Rick 
DuRee. Michael would have been -- and eventually may still be -- the fourth 
generation to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing," says Rick DuRee, adding that he understands the public 
perception that firefighters' sons had an advantage. They do have an advantage, 
but not an unfair one. "You do have an edge because you know what to do to 
prepare yourself."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to find fewer sons and daughters on the same 
department," DuRee says. "But the tradition will continue." 
</P>
<P>
 The concern about nepotism, or the appearance of nepotism, is being felt in 
other fire departments as well. In the Lynwood Fire Department, for example, 
engineer Swen Swenson, a 24-year veteran, says his son Swen Jr., 24, wants to 
become a Lynwood firefighter and has been working for the department as a 
volunteer. But such a hire might appear to be favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be proud for my son to be a firefighter, and he'd be a good one," Swenson 
Sr. says. "But there's a concern there."  
</P>
<P>
 Swenson Jr. is looking for jobs in other fire departments, his father says. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters predict the firefighting family tradition will also include more 
minority families in the future. After decades of inequities in hiring, fire 
departments have opened -- or been forced to open -- their ranks to minorities. 
(The Los Angeles City Fire Department, for example, which was less than 6% 
minority 20 years ago, now is 37% minority.) And it appears that the trend of 
firefighters' children becoming firefighters extends to minority firefighting 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already we're seeing black and Hispanic firefighters whose sons and daughters 
are on the job now," says Brondell of the firefighters association. "I think 
that will only increase in coming years." 
</P>
<P>
 But some see concerns about nepotism working against minority members. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son wanted nothing else in life but to be a firefighter," says Compton 
Fire Chief Fonza, an African American whose son became a firefighter in his 
home state of Iowa. Fonza said his son had tried to join the Pasadena Fire 
Department when Fonza was a battalion chief there, but had been turned away 
because of concerns about nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nepotism is a double-edged sword," says Fonza. "Twenty-five years ago we 
(minority members) had to fight nepotism in fire departments to get the doors 
open to us. Now, when the offspring of minorities are starting to come of age 
to be firefighters, they start enforcing the nepotism rules." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the Schneider family? Is there a fourth generation of 
firefighters waiting in the wings? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to have my kids continue the tradition," Torrance 
firefighter/paramedic Scott Schneider says of his 10-year-old son, Nicholas, 
and 6-year-old daughter, Natalie. 
</P>
<P>
 And will they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says Schneider, "their favorite TV show is 'Rescue 911."'

SPORTS; ONE SWELL TIME; WATER SKI RACE TO CATALINA PROVIDES PLENTY OF THRILLS 
-- AND SPILLS -- FOR COMPETITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's a $220 entry fee, no prize money and the winner doesn't even get to 
keep the perpetual trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't deterred competitors throughout the world from from flocking 
to the annual Catalina Ski Race, a 62-mile round-trip water ski race from Long 
Beach Harbor to Catalina Island and back. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46th running of the event Sunday drew a record 140 teams from the United 
States, Australia, England, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium and 
Italy. The number of competitors, which range in age from 8 to 69, at this 
year's race forced organizers to start the race in two groups for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 About 110 teams started at the firing of a flare gun in a 1 1/2-mile stretch 
between Island White and Island Grisham in Long Beach Harbor, fighting for 
position to exit the channel at the narrow Queen's Gate breakwater less than a 
mile away. A second stampede start followed 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Choppy waters prevented Mason Thompson's 1987 record of 54 minutes 56 seconds 
from being challenged, but Sunday's race marked the first time foreign 
competitors won the men's and women's races in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Kirkland, a 27-year-old carpenter from London who had finished second 
in three previous Catalina races, held on for a 22-second victory over Kurt 
Schoen of Huntington Beach in 59:20. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Leanne Braun, 21, the 1993 world champion, racing for the first 
time in open waters, won the women's division in 1:10.03. Defending men's 
champion Lee Squier, 40, of Long Beach was the top local finisher, placing 
fourth in 1:03.55. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the skiing fraternity around the world knows the big races to go 
to and Catalina is one of them," said Braun, a law student from Perth. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is also one of the toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 The top skiers, using only a single, specially designed ski, can exceed 80 
miles per hour. Braun aggravated tendinitis in her right knee during the race 
but was not the only one limping to the awards ceremony. Swells, which reached 
15 to 20 feet Sunday, caused skiers to lose sight of their boats some 200 feet 
ahead. Gauging distance in open water is another unique challenge of the 
Catalina race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Sydney, we race on lakes and rivers, but the closest thing we get to this 
is a bay," Braun said. "On the way back, I didn't know where anyone was, I 
didn't know whether I was winning or losing or what was going on. All I wanted 
to see was the big white (Spruce Goose) dome." 
</P>
<P>
 Skiers are aided by a support team, which includes a driver, navigator and 
observer, but plotting a direct course to Catalina and back is not an easy task 
either. It was sunny and visibility was good Sunday, but that didn't keep boats 
from veering several miles off course. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a real heavy cloud bank and a thick marine layer, I've been way 
back and seen the leaders get lost," said Kirk Book, 30, of Carlsbad. "They're 
so busy heading side by side, the guy who is leading heads off to San Pedro and 
everybody follows him. All of a sudden, you're by yourself heading to the right 
opening." 
</P>
<P>
 Book has led the Catalina race at some point since he first competed in the 
event at age 14. But the 1993 world champion and four-time U.S. champion has 
yet to cross the finish line first. 
</P>
<P>
 He was challenging for the lead at the turnaround boat about a quarter mile 
off Avalon, but finished third in 1:02:30 after taking a spill with about 19 
miles to go. Book, who has been first to the island three times and finished 
second three times in 10 previous Catalina races, was leading last year when he 
took a spill and was knocked unconscious about halfway back to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest ocean race in the U.S. and I've won everything but this 
race," said Book, who competed with a brace to protect a hyper-extended knee 
suffered two weeks ago when he was thrown about 150 feet out of a boat 
traveling at 100 miles per hour. "The top skiers don't refer to the things they 
won, they refer to the things they haven't won and this is the one I haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing is a goal for others. One-hundred-one of the 140 teams completed the 
race in the allotted three hours. Mark Kachigan, a 38-year-old real estate 
broker from Long Beach, dropped out five miles after the turnaround because of 
the "worst leg cramps" of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Kachigan, a marathon runner who has been a recreational water skier for 18 
years, decided to try the race after watching the event every year for nearly a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could run for 3 1/2 hours and run 26 miles, I didn't think it would be a 
problem being on a ski for 1 1/2 to two hours," Kachigan said. "You can see the 
island about a third of the way on the way out, but it seemed like an eternity 
before you're there. I guess I thought I was a legend in my own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Any illusions of grandeur were quickly extinguished after Kachigan fell three 
times on the way to Catalina, the last of which he attributes to simply 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to make it to the island," Kachigan said. "My thighs were on 
fire. I was in tears when I knew wasn't going to finish and swore I would never 
do the Catalina race again. But the next day, I'll be mad about not finishing. 
And the day after that, I'll be thinking of ways to do better in next year's 
race."

BUSINESS: PLAN FOR R&D AUTOMOBILE PARK AND TEST TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edmund Newton's story about Christopher R. Pook (Times, Aug. 11) was an 
interesting account of a clever entrepreneur. However, the description of Mr. 
Pook's proposed research and development park and test track was incomplete.For 
example, only four major events per year were mentioned when, in fact, there 
will be 40 additional so-called "noise-restricted" events. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Pook's slick slide presentation, which I have seen, promised jobs, 
beautification of a blighted area and economic revitalization. He conveniently 
omits or glosses over any discussion of the potential for deafening noise, 
traffic snarls and environmental degradation, simply saying these threats will 
be "managed." He is similarly vague about the project's financing, neatly 
sidestepping questions about who will be left holding the bag if the project is 
a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Pook is correct when he states that the area proposed for the racetrack 
needs an economic overhaul. However, Long Beach and Signal Hill residents must 
seriously consider whether a noisy racetrack in their neighborhood is the sole 
alternative for boosting the area's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the article, Mr. Pook may not be telling the whole story about 
his marketing degree from the University of London. He is clearly not telling 
the whole story about his proposed "research and development park," which is 
really a euphemism for a raucous hangout for fans of a fringe sport. He is 
adroitly marketing the high-priced public fulfillment of his personal dream. As 
the citizens of Long Beach and Signal Hill will foot the bill, caveat emptor.

 Menswear is turning up everywhere . . . that is, when it comes to cuffing pant 
legs. The coolest examples are unwashed, raw denim jeans with a one- to 
two-inch fold, says Scott Omelianuk, fashion writer for GQ magazine. "It's a 
London street influence. Just buy jeans a couple of inches longer than usual." 
Business suits, of course, should always be cuffed. "The added weight allows 
trousers to hang better," he reminds. "It just gives them a better appearance. 
It looks more finished." The exception: tuxedo pants, which must always hang 
sans cuff. Locker Chic

 Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get those sneakers? Athletic-inspired fashions 
of late are mutating with the Teddy Boy influence for fall. The results include 
such funky items as the Trainer shoe ($84), which combines sneaker styling with 
lug creeper soles. The U.K. shoe is available at Rack N Ruin in Lake Forest. 
Creepers have been making a feverish comeback lately, says owner Steve Wagoner, 
"mostly among those in their mid- to late-20s who are nostalgic for the early 
'80s when they used to ruckus around in them." Customers come from as far as 
San Diego and Santa Barbara to land a pair from Wagoner's store, which is one 
of the few sources for the original kind. As for the new version like the 
sneaker, Wagoner expects it to find fans among the younger set. Not Crossing 
the Line

 How do you draw the line? That's what Mark Smith is asking teens about 
preventing HIV and AIDS infection. He's getting the message across with a 
symbol and educational campaign he created with Jim Brightwolf to empower 
teens, through their Art For Life's Sake organization. Smith founded Laguna 
Beach-based AFLS in 1992 after finding out his brother was HIV positive. The 
dot represents risk identification; the slash means risk reduction, and the 
circle is personal commitment. Smith hopes it will become as identifiable as 
the red loop. But instead of a sign of mourning, this is about education and 
prevention. The campaign has already found an audience among students in Orange 
County and San Diego public schools and through the American Red Cross Youth 
Volunteers. "They're drawing the symbol all over their folders," Smith says. 
Among the adults getting into spreading the word is jewelry artist Ollie Cox, 
who designed a sterling silver pin ($95, above) and bolo ($110) and a gold 
bracelet ($250) with the symbol. About 15% of the profits go back into the 
program. The jewelry is available at Elements in Irvine and the Garrett White 
Gallery in Laguna Beach and Los Angeles. Smith says the "ambiguity of the 
symbol opens up the opportunity for conversation and, hopefully, education 
without preaching. We still have to focus very much on prevention because 
there's no cure in sight." ROSE APODACA JONES

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: MADE IN AMERICA

 When Hiro, who trained under Richard Avedon, was asked by Mirabella magazine 
to come up with the face of American beauty in the '90s, the legendary fashion 
photographer considered his options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gone into the cornfields of Iowa," he said by phone from his New 
York studio. "Or I could have drawn on the type of beauties from the past, like 
Ava Gardner or Merle Oberon." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he chose to create a woman of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The clue to this futuristic female's family tree floats to the left of her 
cover portrait. A tiny computer chip is a tip-off that Miss September is more 
(or less) than meets the eye. A computer-generated composite of several women, 
to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people first see her, they say she's very beautiful," Hiro said. "After 
I tell them she does not exist, they say, 'I thought there was something weird 
about her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Others have called her vacant, inhuman, detached, said Pat Beh Werblin, 
Mirabella's director of communications. (Reminding us of some flesh and blood 
cover girls.) 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, she's not as ethnic as she ought to be, given our increasingly ethnic 
population. The 35 women Hiro initially interviewed represented a cross-section 
of ethnicities. He says he wanted to get away from the "peaches and cream, 
blond-haired, blue-eyed Nordic beauty." Yet the features of his creation remain 
steadfastly Anglo-European. Ultimately, Hiro photographed five women in similar 
poses and scanned the photos into an image generator. Then he went to work, 
blending eyes, noses, skin tones, cheekbones into his own conception of 
American beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "In America, beauty has a history of being manufactured," said the 
Chinese-born photographer. George Hurrell made beautiful women ravishing. 
Calvin Klein turned a skinny adolescent into an object of desire. "The camera 
sees more than we can ever see. But a photograph doesn't always tell the 
truth."

 Skin Deep: The new Miss Teen USA, 17-year-old Shauna Gambill of Acton, Calif., 
won the swimsuit portion of Tuesday night's pageant in Biloxi, Miss. But like 
most contest winners who spend countless hours perfecting their physical 
selves, Shauna subscribes to the it's-what's-inside-that-counts philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to reach the parents out there for more positive parenting 
so they can raise their children with good morals and values so we won't have 
the problems that we have today," Shauna told the Associated Press. We would 
have expected someone like that to, well, perhaps become a teacher or even a 
social worker. But they don't get to wear those fabulous rhinestone crowns, do 
they?

 Maternity Suit: The Pregnancy Survival Kit is the brainchild of two stylish 
New York women who wanted to stay that way. Faced with a paucity of hip 
maternity clothes, Cherie Serota and her partner, Jody Kozlow Gardner, devised 
a four-piece wardrobe-in-a-box that would fit and flatter an expanding torso -- 
for $150. Packaged like a queen-size portion of Chinese takeout, the Pregnancy 
Survival Kit includes a baby-doll dress with a flattering princess neckline; a 
simple, long-sleeved tunic; leggings with a four-inch-wide, non-elastic 
waistband, and a short, slim skirt. All in black, cotton-Lycra, in sizes S, M, 
L, the pieces will be sold in selected maternity stores beginning Sept. 1. (For 
information, call (800)-4-9-MONTHS.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our own Pregnancy Survival Kit wasn't so fashion-conscious, consisting 
entirely of Milk Duds and Big Sticks.

 We Interrupt This Program . . .: "The Bold and the Beautiful" will live up to 
its name next month, when the CBS soap stages a fashion show billed as "The 
Grand Diva Collection" as part of its ongoing story line about the rivalry 
between two fictional L.A. fashion houses. This is fashion on a grand scale -- 
plus-size garments on plus-size beauties. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the attention focused on the waif model, we thought it would be 
appropriate to focus on the beauty in the plus side of fashion," said Bradley 
Bell, the show's head writer and supervising producer. L.A. designer Daphne 
Jogolulos will provide the clothes, while Big Beautiful Woman magazine is 
supplying technical assistance. The episode will air Sept. 12 -- "barring 
pre-emptions for the O.J. Simpson trial."

 Them's Shoppin' Words: "Walk into any thrift store and you can find tons of 
kilts," remarked a friend who pshaws the notion of paying more than $3 for such 
a skirt. All we can say is -- she's dreaming! Prowling our usual thrift-store 
haunts this week, the closest we came to the trendy look was a lime-green 
blanket-plaid skirt with a triangular hem and sad-looking yellow fringe 
($2.99); a red-white-and-black plaid, knife-pleated polyester treasure that 
hung to mid-calf ($4.99); a fake-fur mini with horizontal, Easter Egg-colored 
stripes, which, in very bad lighting, might have passed for an Anna Sui 
($5.99). We didn't want a stupid kilt, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, a black patent leather envelope purse caught our eye ($2.99). At the 
counter, an expertly groomed clerk handed us a cup containing a die. "Roll it," 
she said. In an added thrill to what was already a thrilling experience, the 
number four came up. "You get 40% off." Can't beat that, kilt or no kilt.

BEHIND THE SCENES: UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE; NOW THAT WONDERBRA IS IN TOWN, WOMEN 
HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR THEIR TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 But for $26, it's the way to a curvier you if you've hooked into all the hype 
regarding the Wonderbra, as troops of women have during its West Coast debut 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of you have worn a pushup bra before?" yelled out the event host 
before the unveiling of the Wonderbra rack at Robinsons-May in South Coast 
Plaza last Thursday. Store employees wore T-shirts that asked "Who cares if 
it's a bad hair day." As if having cleavage was supposed to make up for the 
frizzies. 
</P>
<P>
 There were young customers, old ones, already buxom ones and others striving 
to be. In all, about 30 women lined up before noon next to the rack, which 
stood shrouded in yellow and black satin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten, nine, eight . . .. Within a few seconds, the unveiling took place. 
Immediately, two women snapped at each other. "That's not fair," barked the 
first woman in line to another who had walked up moments before. Having waited 
more than 30 minutes in line, she believed she was entitled to the first take. 
</P>
<P>
 There were men. Husbands, boyfriends, salesmen all stood around looking a 
little stunned at the desperate frenzy. One man photographed his wife near the 
magical product. When she pointed to the panties, he asked, "Do they push up 
your buns?" No, but for $10 they'll complete the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I hadn't come and my wife told me what happened today, I wouldn't have 
comprehended it," said Greg Vetrone of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 More women arrived, and the queue to the dressing room stretched past the 
register, past the other pushup bra racks (those lonely racks) almost to the 
Wonderbra rack itself. Someone screamed from within the dressing area. Those in 
line smiled knowingly, anxious to get in there and experience it for 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 In 25 minutes, only one black bra was left. The satins blew out before the 
lace. Smaller sizes in white became more difficult to find. Red was fast 
becoming an option to the more practical black or white. 
</P>
<P>
 Vetrone waited patiently for his wife. "It's something my wife is excited 
about getting. It's supposed to be a present for me; it's our fifth anniversary 
today. I guess you could notice a difference," he says, as we look at the model 
walking the stage in a cocktail dress, first without, then with the Wonderbra 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Denise Vetrone, walked up. "It's great, honey." 
</P>
<P>
 He turned and quietly said: "Personally, I don't really care about it. But as 
long as she's happy." ROSE APODACA JONES

HE SAID / SHE SAID: IF YOUR FRIENDS COULD SEE YOU NOW, WHAT ADVICE WOULD THEY 
OFFER?

<P>
 I t's axiomatic that no one is truly happy with his or her looks, a fact that 
has spawned several billion-dollar industries and one rather cruel word: 
make-over.  
</P>
<P>
 We see the ads everywhere and the premise is always sure-fire on the daytime 
talk shows. Take a fairly plain looking person and, with the cooperation of 
makeup artists, hair stylists and clothing consultants, transform him or her 
into a dazzling vision of sophistication and beauty.  
</P>
<P>
 But will it work in the real world? We wanted to find out. So we stuck our 
necks way, way, way out and asked a few of our colleagues for their suggestions 
on how we might change our appearances.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, let me go on record immediately by saying I told you so. I said that 
almost nobody I knew around here would play it straight. To wit: example number 
one, a computer message in answer to the question of how I should be made over: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I'm much too compassionate a person to accept that assignment. 
Seriously, though, I think you'd be gorgeous with a lip ring and a long-shiny 
gray ponytail. Add some love beads and sandals and some old-fashioned Bermuda 
shorts and tell people you're a writer." 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I asked an old friend how I might change my look and he sent this 
computer message: "Do you really think for one second that I would think you're 
healthy enough to accept any critiquing? Is there anything in your record to 
suggest that you are? Convince me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, I convinced him and got this: "You look your best when you are a little 
bit less than completely made up and dressed up. I'm just talking shading, I 
guess. Not sackcloth but somewhere south of top-of-the-line merchandise. Maybe 
the same with hair/makeup but we're talking minor adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is great advice. I'm trying too hard. He's telling me I don't 
have to. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: This compassionately incomplete advice from a pair of co-workers who put 
their heads together on my behalf: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dye your hair and let it grow long so you can flip it back, get smaller, 
rounder, bronzier glasses with clip-on shades, always wear a loose 
(non-constructed) blazer and pleated trousers or fitted jeans. Oh . . . and get 
a tan." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: your thinning gray hair makes you look ancient, your current 
glasses make you look like an owl and you need a big, blousy jacket to hide 
that paunch. And, by the by, you look like you live in Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilty, guilty, guilty, except for the tan part. I have a choice: go for a tan 
or live a long and cancer-free life. Hey, I want to be wearing those baggy 
tweeds when I'm in my 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I cornered one co-worker and her immediate response was, "You look 
great!" Then I begged her to tell me the truth. She took a long second look (my 
medium-length hair was acting a little bubblish and I was wearing a very 
tailored off-white pant suit): "I would put you in jeans -- torn jeans, a white 
T-shirt and big belt every Friday. And I would send you to my hairdresser for a 
waif cut. I'd change your nails from painted to clear." 
</P>
<P>
 HE: "Actually," said a friend whom I've decided to remember in my will, "you 
look pretty good the way you are. And I actually think your butt's getting 
smaller." 
</P>
<P>
 I pressed for the truth. The message came back: 
</P>
<P>
 "Your glasses have to go. You have distinctly British features masked by the 
frames and the glass reflection. When you drop the glasses, your features, 
which have a lot of character, are clearly seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the glasses, you strike me as a grocery store manager. Without them, you 
remind me of a distinguished British admiral set for sail." 
</P>
<P>
 And a big yo ho ho to you, too. Wherever you are. Can't tell without my 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: One co-worker suggested that I "get a little looser" in my clothes, wear 
jackets that are more soft-shouldered. She also told me to experiment with my 
lipstick, "try a brown/bronze shade" (instead of my predictable bright reds and 
pinks). OK. I'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, dear Patrick, do I dare tell you how I'd make you over? I'd dress you up 
more often. With your distinguished silver beard and immaculate grooming you 
look like a million bucks when you're dressed to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd put you in navy or gray slacks, a white Oxford shirt and V-neck sweater a 
couple of times a week. And occasionally, I'd ask you to show up in that 
fabulous pin-stripe suit of yours. And to give your co-workers a real treat, 
I'd tell you to wear black tie to our annual Christmas buffet. Nobody looks 
sexier in black tie than you do. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: If you're angling for a dinner on me, consider the reservations made. I'll 
send the tux to the cleaners right away. 
</P>
<P>
 And now to you, partner. I agree with that looser clothing idea. Your 
day-to-day look is usually so smartly and closely tailored I think you could 
only benefit from a more casual approach occasionally. Big, comfortable 
sweaters and flowing fabrics. Wear the angular stuff with the knife-like 
creases when you really mean business, but when it's just us kids in the 
office, how about something you can sprawl in? You'd still look great, honest. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Funny how I told you to dress up and you told me to dress down. Let's 
just switch wardrobes.

HONORING THE COWBOY-HUMORIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funny, with a common sense repartee that made the masses chuckle and the 
politically influential blush, Will Rogers endeared himself to all in the 1920s 
and '30s. Enhancing the memory of the cowboy humorist-philosopher, trick roper 
and actor, is his 186-acre ranch site, intact and immaculate above the state 
beach that bears his name in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and Saturday, a celebration will be held to honor the 50th 
anniversary of the year Betty Rogers, Will's widow, turned the property over to 
the state. Many of the things that best define Rogers will be a part of the 
event, including trick roping, storytelling, horse shows and polo (which Will 
and his two sons, Will Jr. and Jimmy, had in common). 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be demonstrations of weaving and wood carving, Native American 
dancing, cowboy poets, branding and roping. On Friday a historic re-enactment 
and Will Rogers Symposium will take place noon-4:30 p.m. The other events are 
Saturday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Will Rogers State Historic Park is located off Sunset 
Boulevard. Admission is free; Friday parking free; Saturday parking $5; $4 for 
seniors. (310) 454-8212. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

FIRST PERSON: THANK YOU, SIGNORE MODUGNO

 He who drives the car controls the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the single most important rule of the road as three fellow college 
sophomores and I made our way from Los Angeles to the Pacific Northwest in the 
summer of 1958 on a six-week camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 We switched drivers every hour, moving all the passengers around as well, 
since we had taken out the bottom cushion of the back seat of my 1954 Chevrolet 
two-door sedan to make room for the sleeping bags, tent and other gear that 
wouldn't fit into the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a sleeping bag atop a tent atop a cooler isn't exactly luxury 
travel. So we had this rotation, the way volleyball players move during a game. 
You moved from right rear to left rear to right front to driver. One move per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortwin Wersel, who was from Germany and had moved to the United States in 
junior high school, liked to listen to jazz. Senny Takahashi was a classical 
music fan. Ted Furr and I preferred rock, and my particular interest was in 
trying to find Buddy Holly's newest single, "Maybe Baby," on as many stations 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In those pre-FM days, radio playlists were limited. And these stations were 
playing actual records, remember. No tape, no discs, no lasers. Superhighway? 
It was the information footpath. 
</P>
<P>
 And 1958 was the summer of Domenico Modugno and his huge hit (30 million 
copies), "Volare." It was "Volare" in San Francisco, "Volare" in Portland, 
"Volare" as we pitched the tent in snow on the Fourth of July at Crater Lake 
and looked for a flat site on the side of Mt. Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those moments that meant little as it passed -- yet, 36 years 
later, is clearer to me than where I put my car keys Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention this because Domenico Modugno died the other day in Italy. His death 
at 66 of an apparent heart attack was worth seven sentences in this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Our trip wasn't one of those "rites of passage" experiences that become motion 
pictures. Other than a transmission-related breakdown east of Vancouver and a 
muffler that decided to stay on a rock in a park near Portland, there were few 
crises -- not counting my bout with some tainted canned pears. 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't searching for ourselves or celebrating the last days of our youth 
before marriages and jobs would take us into reality and the 1960s. We were 
just four college kids who had gone to Marshall High School in Los Angeles and 
thought it might be fun to go on a camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 After all these years, I still remember certain moments. Hearing on the radio 
the news that Congress had approved statehood for Alaska. The embarrassment of 
being denied entry into a Portland theater because we were wearing gym shorts. 
Putting on a sock in a campground restroom at Mt. Tamalpais near San Francisco, 
only to discover the world's largest and most malevolent looking beetle had 
gotten there before me. Feeding animal crackers to a raccoon, the first one I 
had ever seen. Swimming in the icy Merced River at Yosemite. You can do that at 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, "Volare." Modugno's song was actually named "Nel Blu Dipinto 
di Blu" in Italy, but it was the often-repeated word volare that everyone knew. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the time of Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly, Fats Domino and Chuck Berry. 
A guitar instrumental called "Raunchy." The garage-band sound of "At the Hop." 
An awful pop novelty called "Flying Purple People Eater." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a long time ago. Ortwin Wersel died from exposure to some kind of 
chemical while working on his doctorate in chemistry in the East in 1967. The 
last I knew, about the time of our 20-year high school reunion, Senny Takahashi 
was a reporter with a television station in Spokane. Ted Furr is a metallurgist 
with Bethlehem Steel -- or at least he was about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I can picture a whole generation of people who might have seen Modugno's 
obituary and said to themselves, "Domenico who?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ciao, signore. Thanks for taking me back to 1958 for a little while.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; SUPERSONIC SEARCH FOR MEANING STALLS AIRPORT ANALOGY; 
THE AIRPORT:TERMINAL NIGHTS AND RUNWAY DAYS AT JOHN F. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL BY

 In the airport, journalist James Kaplan has landed upon a neat metaphor for 
postwar America. Just as great railway stations like Paris' Gare de Lyon and 
Berlin's Alexanderplatz mirrored the ebullience of late 19th-Century Europe, so 
America's airports expressed its optimism in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 JFK International (then Idlewild Airport) welcomed travelers with a 
rainbow-colored Fountain of Liberty and entertained them with 
silver-and-tablecloth restaurants before spiriting them off on graceful, 
silver-skinned planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the signal year of 1973. In America, Watergate began doing to 
patriotism what the Weathermen had just done to idealism. At the airports, 
meanwhile, an Arab oil embargo tripled jet-fuel prices, forcing the airlines to 
cut back on most amenities. After the further blow struck by '80s deregulation, 
what had been a sweet and mysterious portal began to look like little more than 
another weary bus depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the signs of malaise at JFK (and by implication, America), Kaplan 
watches Ernesto the custodian glumly pick up napkins and plastic spoons at 
JFK's dismal Food Court ("Tuna Sandwiches: $6.95"). He listens to the bored 
Queens announcer warn incessantly about limo and baggage hustlers. And he 
wonders: "Where is the sunlight, grandeur, beauty, mystery, philanthropy, 
welcome and awe?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like director Godfrey Reggio, whose 1983 film "Koyaanisqatsi" depicted 
Manhattanites numbed, dazed and spiritually impoverished by the workaday 
routine, Kaplan believes that there was a time when life was lived with more 
emotional immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Early commercial air travel, he writes, where you "arrived at your destination 
weak, woozy, deaf and exhausted from hour upon 300-mile-per-hour hour in the 
air," may not have been as comfy as today's "hermetically sealed, 
sociologically alienating" flights, but it was more affecting: "You knew you 
were flying then!" 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas Reggio saw the frenetic pace of his Manhattan commuters as the 
tell-tale sign of "koyaanisqatsi" (Hopi for "life out of balance"), Kaplan sees 
speed as a kind of salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, Kaplan's Holy Grail in these pages is to bum a ride on 
the Concorde. Anticipating the event, he projects a vision of speed that seems 
right out of the '50s, when Detroit was supercharging engines and Einstein was 
popularizing his theory that you could cheat time by zipping through space. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan eventually gets "to ride the rocket," but since its speed of 1,350 
miles per hour falls somewhat short of the minimum set by Einstein (186,000 
miles per second ), it's little surprise that he finds the trip "a profound 
anticlimax." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan's obsession with speed ends up disappointing us as well, for it leads 
him to set a frenetic narrative pace that deprives us of potentially engaging 
vignettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinting down JFK's labyrinthine corridors, Kaplan refuses to linger even 
when he lands upon infectiously exciting characters, such as the air traffic 
controller who compares "pushing tin" (moving planes) to "playing the World 
Series every night." Kaplan clearly seems too invested in his generation's hip 
nihilism to spin the kind of yarn his subjects sometimes require: the glitzy, 
sexy, narrative that Arthur Hailey pioneered with such books as "Airport" and 
"The Moneychangers."  
</P>
<P>
 He's also too arch to play the game of investigative reporter when that seems 
well-advised. When an airline captain suggests, for example, that pilot fatigue 
could be a serious problem on the new 747-400, which often carries 500 
passengers on 14-hour trips with only two flight crew members, Kaplan never 
pursues the point. 
</P>
<P>
 What Kaplan, like many writers of his generation, does find hip is searching 
for the metaphysics of modern life. As he looks out of his airplane window at 
the beckoning lights of JFK's runway, for instance, he quotes John Cardinal 
Newman: "Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom; / lead thou me on!"  
</P>
<P>
 Such references ultimately seem more pretentious than profound, however, for 
they are sprinkled perfunctorily through these pages rather than woven into a 
story's web. One suspects that Kaplan knows this, for when his narrative flags, 
he tries to jazz it up with the lurid details of -- what else? -- airplane 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 It works -- our attention is restored. But not by reaching the new and 
transcendent literary heights that Kaplan aims for when this book first takes 
off.

FASHION FLARES; BACK-TO-SCHOOL SHOPPING COMES WITH WARNING SIGNALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As back-to-school sales get underway, many schools are warning parents and 
students that some of the clothes they're buying now won't make the grade when 
the school bell rings in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason these fashions will fail: They've been banned by schools because 
they've been identified as gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the gang presence out of the classrooms, Orange County school 
districts have adopted dress codes that forbid attire like baggy, 
below-the-knees shorts, combat boots and bandannas. 
</P>
<P>
 But these same styles worn by kids to advertise their gang affiliation often 
cross over into the mainstream. They become all the rage with kids of every 
description and wind up on the pages of back-to-school ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Even clothing that appears harmless, such as baseball caps and collegiate 
sweat shirts, is prohibited at some schools. Capistrano Unified School District 
in San Juan Capistrano recently sent parents a notice prohibiting gang-related 
apparel in classrooms, including "khakis worn with wool-type shirts," overalls, 
hats and loose, baggy "skater" clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress codes can confuse retailers, students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Haydon, owner of the Toddling Turtle in Laguna Niguel and mother of a 
14-year-old boy, frequently fields questions from parents about what's 
acceptable in schools. She's known parents who have spent $80 for a pair of 
combat boots that are trendy enough to be worn by Hollywood celebrities, only 
to find their kids can't wear them to class. She even visits schools to find 
out exactly what styles are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in the business you have to be aware," she said. "The trouble is, 
sometimes it's hard to know" what's acceptable. She recently ordered some 
knee-level shorts from a popular beachwear line, then decided to pull them from 
her inventory because she was afraid schools wouldn't allow them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't in good conscience sell them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers say schools are overreacting and banning fashions that are not 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy McAtee, owner of Good Times Surf & Sport in Dana Point, said "overactive 
imaginations" caused school officials to ban baggy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a style," she said. "I'm sure there are problems with gangs, but 
most of the kids (who wore baggy clothes) were normal, everyday kids. They 
weren't gang members. Remember when we wore big bell-bottoms? It's normal not 
to like children's clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 McAtee wondered why some seemingly innocent fashions have been banned: 
</P>
<P>
 "In junior high some kids can't wear baseball caps. That's kind of sad. The 
kids like to wear them so much. I can see taking the hats off during class, but 
why ban them altogether?"  
</P>
<P>
 The answer from school officials is that caps and other apparel can mistakenly 
mark a child as belonging to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about not looking like you're a gang member. A youngster who thinks he 
or she is in fashion walking down the street in the wrong clothes and in the 
wrong place can get in serious trouble," said Diane Thomas, spokeswoman for the 
Santa Ana Unified School District.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the mode of dress is detrimental to a child's safety, we need to do 
something about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago the district tightened up its dress code. Some of the forbidden 
clothes are obvious gang looks, such as bandannas or T-shirts that advertise 
drugs or gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents might be surprised by some of the other banned clothing: athletic 
jackets ("some of the gangs use professional team symbols" to advertise their 
membership, Thomas said); T-shirts and sweat shirts with athletic club or 
collegiate logos, and any other emblems, initials or insignias not related to 
the school or school-related activities. Even belt buckles can be suspect if 
they have initials, another mark of a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 "They use a lot of different ways to show their affiliation," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcing dress codes is a headache for schools because many gang looks have 
been glamorized by the fashion industry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed many big retailers are advertising clothing we would not allow in 
our schools," Thomas said. "We had a principal last year who clipped out 
back-to-school ads and said, 'What am I going to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas contacted a couple of retailers to ask how schools could stop the 
promotion of gang looks. She's found no solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as it's being purchased, stores will buy it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if stores were to comply with school dress codes, they can't stop 
students from wearing acceptable clothes in an unacceptable way. Something as 
basic as a pair of overalls can be a problem "if they wear them big with one 
strap hanging down," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more how a kid wears the item," said Dave Moreland, clothing buyer for 
Beach Access in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "One kid could wear a flannel 
shirt and wear it super baggy with a white T-shirt underneath and be construed 
as a gang member." 
</P>
<P>
 Styles for this school year are "pretty basic" and less oversized, he said, so 
students will be more in line with school dress codes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, almost as soon as schools issue new dress codes, gang members find 
other ways to show their colors. After the Santa Ana school district issued its 
list of prohibited clothes, gang members started identifying themselves by 
wearing colored shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In frustration, many Orange County schools have instituted optional uniforms, 
Thomas said. Most of the 30 elementary schools in the Santa Ana district have 
switched to voluntary uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we're protecting children by having them in uniforms. That way 
they're easily noted as belonging to that school," Thomas said. "A fashion 
statement isn't worth endangering a student's life."

RELATIONSHIPS: WHEN COUPLES GET POOR RECEPTION FROM EACH OTHER, IT'S TIME FOR A 
TV BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John and Rita sought professional counseling when they realized something 
serious was coming between them: their television set. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, both in their 20s, watched so much TV they had stopped 
communicating with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't talking; they weren't intimate. They were avoiding each other. 
They had other problems and escaped into TV," says Deborah Hendlin, a clinical 
psychologist in Irvine who counseled the couple, whose names have been changed. 
</P>
<P>
 She proposed a simple experiment: Unplug the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day without television was really awkward," Hendlin says. "They 
didn't know what to say to each other. The house seemed eerily quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet slowly the communication barrier that had built up over years of sitcoms 
and sports came down. The couple began playing games together and taking walks. 
They started talking and dealing directly with their problems. These days they 
still watch TV, but now they're much more selective and careful to limit the 
viewing to a couple of shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Television can cause all kinds of static between a couple. They can fight over 
what to watch, how much to watch and when to watch. Such squabbles are fairly 
common and usually harmless, say psychologists, but sometimes TV troubles can 
signal deeper problems within the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as though TV viewing habits are a barometer for the 
relationship," Hendlin says. "The way people fight about TV viewing is 
indicative of the way they fight about other things. It's one more arena of 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Often TV troubles focus on the remote control. Before there were remotes, 
"Nobody wanted to get up and change the channel. That was the fight in the 
early days," says Joe Saltzman, a USC professor of journalism specializing in 
broadcasting. "Now they argue over the remote." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically one person, usually the male, will want to "channel surf" while the 
other, usually the female, wants to stay put on one station, Saltzman says. 
Such a difference in the sexes may not amount to much if one person doesn't 
care about what's on the tube, "but it can evolve into a real power struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 The remote control is a "power weapon," much like the couple's checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a person likes holding the remote because they can change the 
channel at will, frustrating the other person," Saltzman says. Serious 
arguments over the remote can indicate that a couple needs to examine the 
relationship and its balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a more serious problem is the insidious way TV can come between a 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV seems to rob couples of a lot of their together time," says Lesley 
Donovan, a marriage, family and child counselor in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just sitting down and having a conversation gets pushed back later and 
later," she says. "I hear wives say they get all of their communicating done 
during commercials and half-time. It gets absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Communicating can be uncomfortable, Donovan says, and watching TV is a way to 
avoid that. One can turn on the TV to tune out a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV becomes "an unconscious way to dial up and dial down the intimacy 
level. You can make it impossible for someone to communicate with you," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan has advised couples to get away from the TV and go to a place like a 
restaurant, park or beach where they're "really going to just talk . . . . It's 
a conscious effort to turn off the distraction." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, couples can find that one or both parties have become 
TV-dependent. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that after two or three hours of watching TV, viewers go 
"into a kind of trance" that can become addictive, Saltzman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care what's on. They're getting a buzz," he says. "The minute they 
come home the TV is on. It's a sign something's wrong with the relationship 
beyond TV. Probably the person is bored with the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 His suggestion for curing a TV addict is to slowly wean him or her from the 
set -- although some addicts have quit TV cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a TV addict," Saltzman says. "I used to watch 20 hours a day. When 
you shut off an addict's TV, there's a lot of anger. Being in the room with a 
TV and not putting it on is very painful,"  
</P>
<P>
 When first talking about cutting back on TV, "It's best for a couple to leave 
home and go to a neutral territory," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple that attempted to work through their problems by escaping the house 
were foiled when the wife noticed her TV-addicted husband was distracted: 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd found a TV in the corner of the bar," Saltzman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Addicts need to gradually cut out the number of shows they watch until they 
turn off the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to replace it with something; one would hope it would be the 
relationship," Saltzman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendlin counsels one thirtysomething couple who have been married 10 years and 
now find the TV is a major source of disagreement. He has a demanding job as a 
lawyer and when he comes home at night "he just wants to flop in front of the 
TV," Hendlin says. Because her job is less strenuous, she comes home wanting to 
do something active like work out together. 
</P>
<P>
 "She feels neglected and ignored. She's come to resent the TV. She sees it as 
the enemy," Hendlin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendlin has been helping the couple work out a compromise: He's agreed to 
watch only one or two half-hour shows but without any interruption from her. 
She's trying not to degrade him or "make him feel like a lazy slob" -- which 
makes him withdraw even further, Hendlin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's giving him a little more down time, and he's more willing to 
compromise. They're actually doing a lot better," Hendlin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people turn to the TV out of dissatisfaction with a mate or for the 
stimulation that's missing in their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The TV becomes a love object," says Henry Cloud, a clinical psychologist in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When couples don't develop a healthy attachment to each other, they'll often 
substitute something else, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, their most important relationship is with the TV. Instead of loving 
an imperfect spouse, they will focus on an idealized TV character," Cloud says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (they) can't work through some of their disappointments and non-ideal 
parts that every relationship has, some turn to the idealized world of TV, 
where all the women are 'Baywatch'-perfect or all the men are successful, 
dashing Remington Steeles," Cloud says. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples who are fighting over the TV need to examine their connection, he 
says. They need to look at the power and control dynamics of the relationship 
and "how they're dealing with metabolizing the loss of ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that a relationship isn't perfect can be the first step to making 
it better, to "making something good out of the real person they have," Cloud 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 TV isn't all bad for relationships, psychologists say. If watched in 
moderation, it can even have benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's a person's only time to escape the pressures they're responsibly 
dealing with during the day," Cloud says. "There doesn't have to be a redeeming 
motive to every 30 minutes we spend." 
</P>
<P>
 TV can even draw two people closer, Saltzman says, if they watch a program 
together and talk about it afterward. In some ways it can enhance reality: 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching TV in bed as a couple is very erotic and comforting," he says. "It's 
a nice way to be."

TRUE TO HIS SKILL; LEATHER IS THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE FOR FASHION DESIGNER ABEL 
VILLARREAL. IN HIS STUDIO IN SILVER LAKE, HE TRANSFORMS COWHIDE INTO WORKS OF 
ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leather can be stubborn. A heavy-tooling cowhide, it lies stiff and dull. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a pretty leather," fashion designer Abel Villarreal says. "It is 
not delicate." 
</P>
<P>
 But it suits Villarreal's purpose. He kneads with strong fingers and stitches 
with wide, flat lacing. Sometimes he reaches for a mallet and pliers, sometimes 
the point of an awl, to create an envisioned line or curve. 
</P>
<P>
 The leather can feel as hard as granite. This is fashion as sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 And the faceted costumes that emerge from Villarreal's elemental studio in 
Silver Lake are the stuff of medieval legend and dark humor. A Tahitian leather 
bridal gown. A perverse ringmaster's suit. A spiked corset bursting with 
leather fronds. 
</P>
<P>
 Such creations have earned the 34-year-old designer cult notoriety. His devout 
clientele -- he refers to them as "performers and crazy people" -- include 
French designer Thierry Mugler, underwear jockey Marky Mark and actress Debi 
Mazar. 
</P>
<P>
 "His clothes," Mazar says, "are extremely sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 The leather takes shape. The stiff, black sculpture comes to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It begins to mold to you as it develops a patina, a shine from the oils in 
the leather," Villarreal says. "There's something about it being a hide or a 
skin, something that was once living. I know that sounds weird, but there's 
something innately real about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was thousands of years ago that primitive man first draped animal pelts 
over his body. Perhaps an artisan can feel the connection, a tactile sense of 
history. Working in the living room of a mid-1920s house, a studio he has 
dubbed "the Bullpen," Villarreal toils over a broad table. He wears a leather 
apron and camouflage pants, his arms bare, revealing the classic tattoo of an 
eagle on his muscled left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the hands-on part," he says, "the craftsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 There is more at stake, though. More than pattern-making, cutting and 
stitching. There is sex. Long after the so-called civilization of humans -- in 
the 19th Century, in fact -- leather acquired an explicit association with the 
warm and dangerous aura of eroticism.  
</P>
<P>
 "Leather seems infused with a karma, a charisma," says Valerie Steele, who 
teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Her latest book, 
"Fetish: Fashion, Sex and Power," will be published next year. "Part of it is 
sensory. There is the smell and the sound as well as the feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Fetish fashion -- black with studs, big straps and buckles -- eventually 
stepped into the light of day on divergent scenes: the worlds of motorcycle 
gangs, punk rock and the gay culture. The style had became prominent on Paris 
runways by the 1970s. People would never look at leather the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can diffuse that by making it pastel or suede instead of hard leather," 
Steele says. "But all leathers have this array of erotic associations." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal has played on these associations to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For Marky Mark, he created a relatively tame "Mack truck" vest. Drag artist 
Lypsinka appeared on the cover of the Advocate in a more outre jacket and 
bell-bottoms. Mazar commissioned a bondage romper to wear to Madonna's "Sex" 
book party. The actress, Villarreal says, "didn't have any trouble saying, 
'Push the (breasts) up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even the fleshiest of his designs are imbued with a sense of whimsy and 
the fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pieces I do are fun," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer inspection of his studio reveals a wood-and-glass case filled with a 
collection of vintage G.I. Joes. Bright paintings of cows hang near the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very summer camp," Villarreal says, continuing with an unexpected description 
of his work. "Very hobby-like." 
</P>
<P>
 His assistant, a thin young woman named Michi, breezes into the room and says, 
"Remember those lanyards you made for key rings? It's that craft thing. When 
you were a kid and they made you do crafts, it was fun. We're using all that 
stuff we learned a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal's own line -- which he started designing in 1984, soon after 
leaving the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising -- folded in 1987. 
Two years ago, while working for the Italian knitwear designer Marina 
Spadafora, he began fashioning leather pieces for himself and his boyfriend, 
Tim Palen, an art director at Columbia TriStar Home Video. It was Palen who 
urged Villarreal to devote himself entirely to cowhide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always working for other people, executing their ideas," Palen says. 
"This gives him the opportunity to exercise his wild imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends began ordering pieces. One of them was Susanne Bartsch, the Manhattan 
club persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like plain-Jane dressing. I like statement dressing," Bartsch says. 
"He gives you a presence." 
</P>
<P>
 A "horsewoman" costume Villarreal made for her quickly drew attention. Mugler 
-- the designer who gave the world breast-mounted rear-view mirrors -- was 
predictably smitten. He ordered several pieces, including a vest for his 
private collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way -- one by one, by word of mouth -- Villarreal attracted clients 
while keeping an unlisted phone number. Last year, he devoted himself full-time 
to leather. He now commands from $300 for a simple vest to $30,000 for 
outlandish pieces. Bartsch has him overhauling the traditional bunny suit for 
her September benefit, "The Hoppening," at the Playboy Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To think of Villarreal's version of leather in terms of softness and warmth is 
to misinterpret his aim. Although some of his pieces are crafted of lambskin 
and similarly light hides, most are not so cozy: The fronded dress he made for 
a Mugler fashion show weighed 90 pounds and was fraught with piano wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very painful," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thierry kept thinking there was some way we could make it comfortable, but 
it's like armor," Villarreal says. "With the hard leather, it's really for the 
look. You appear in it, make a statement, then take it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The designer has focused on leather work for the feel of it, the sharp and 
earthy scent. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, with breezes holding the August heat at bay, he 
stitched a boot covering for the upcoming "Mortal Kombat," a film based on the 
blood-drenched video game. A broad needle must be pushed through each stamped 
hole, thick lacing tugged after it. The leather squeaks, complaining as it 
draws into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you have to force it," Villarreal says. "It doesn't always do what 
you want it to do. It's malleable, but it's also stubborn."

FAMILY MATTERS IN THIS HOUSE; POLITICS: ALL AGREE, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED 
EMPHASIS ON FAMILY ISSUES SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON TOOK OFFICE. BUT WHAT HAS 
BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IS OPEN TO DEBATE.

<P>
 In the middle of a meeting with the President last spring, domestic policy 
adviser William A. Galston quietly folded his papers, took a deep breath and 
walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Galston had something more important to do, he explained in a note to the 
White House chief of staff. His son was playing a Little League game -- and if 
the choice was between running the country and watching 10-year-old Ezra hit a 
triple, there was no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 To the charge of putting his family before his profession, Galston quipped, "I 
plead guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, in its small way, symbolizes an increased emphasis on family 
issues that many say occurred in Washington with the arrival of the Clinton 
Administration. This new visibility has continued, say those on the front 
lines, despite major foreign crises and domestic scandals such as Whitewater 
and Paula Jones. And even in the frenzy to reform health care and welfare, they 
say, family issues have remained central. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's efforts have nonetheless drawn mixed reviews, often 
split along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has definitely put his priorities where his mouth was," said Cathy 
Collette, director of the women's rights department at the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But after keeping close tabs on family-centered legislation on Capitol Hill, 
Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) has concluded that "President Clinton's rhetoric 
outstrips his commitment." The programs Clinton has introduced have failed to 
provide direct benefits to most families, Johnson contended, explaining: "The 
bottom-line truth is that the best thing we can do for families is to increase 
the child tax deduction for families." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussion of a new emphasis on the family almost invariably begins with the 
Family and Medical Leave Act. Nine years in the making, the bill granting 
employees unpaid time off to care for babies or ailing relatives was signed 
into law weeks after Clinton took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The steam had been building up for years," said David Blankenhorn, president 
of the Institute for American Values, a nonpartisan research organization in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Clinton with fulfilling a campaign promise to enact the 
legislation, but he cautioned: "The final bill was so watered down and had so 
many exemptions that maybe it was a bit of a symbolic advance rather than 
substantive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Family and child advocates also point to the debate over health-care reform as 
proof of a focus on family. "Universal coverage for all Americans is a 
tremendous family policy boon," said Sammie Moshenberg, director of Washington 
operations for the National Council of Jewish Women. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Moshenberg added, "The jury's still out on this one. When the heat is 
turned on in Congress, we have to wait to see if the President will pull out 
all the stops on universal care for families the way he did for NAFTA." 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare reform package that the White House has put before Congress also 
troubles some family specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're worried about it," said Eve Brooks, head of the National Assn. of Child 
Advocates in Washington. She described current efforts to revamp this social 
aid package as "basically an anti-child approach to welfare reform that focuses 
on the parents, with the theory being that the bitter pill will somehow help 
the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the glare of publicity, a number of other Clinton initiatives on 
behalf of the family have been proposed or enacted: 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Youth Service bill, enacted Sept. 22, 1993. Wendy Lazarus 
describes this legislation allowing college students to trade public service 
work for tuition as "sending the message to families that service is part of 
what everyday life should include." 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of the Head Start program to include services for children from 
birth to age 3. Dozens of schoolchildren were present on May 19, 1994, when 
Clinton signed this measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Family Preservation and Support Act, passed by Congress in August, 1993. 
Domestic policy adviser Galston called this "a program that was declared dead 
1,000 times, and resurrected 1,001." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Earned Income Tax Credit, signed into law on Aug. 10, 1993. It provides 
tax credits for working families with incomes of less than $23,050 and at least 
one child living with them. More than 15 million families qualify for the 
credit, which averages between $1,000 and $1,500 annually, and which is 
available both to single and married parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Goals 2000, a comprehensive education reform package that provides $700 
million in federal funds in 1995 for states and school districts that meet new 
guidelines. It was signed into law on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 * The federally funded Vaccines for Children program, set to begin Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pending domestic violence legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 * A recently signed executive order declaring the federal government's 
intention to be a "family friendly" workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Clinton Administration's first 18 months have been "very bad for 
the family generally," said Gary Bauer, who served on the White House Domestic 
Policy Council under President Ronald Reagan. He took particular issue with 
this Administration's push to "zero-fund the only federally funded program that 
helps parents and teachers teach abstinence." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other experts in family policy say that while the family, vintage 1994, 
may not be basking in the legislative spotlight, it certainly is more prominent 
than it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all seriousness, you have to ask, 'compared to what?' " said Amitai 
Etzioni, author of "The Spirit of Community" (Simon & Schuster, 1994) and 
founder of the Communitarian Network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to where we were before, we've made important steps forward. 
Compared to where we were before, the government's heart is definitely in the 
right place," said Etzioni, who is also on the faculty at George Washington 
University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Wendy Lazarus, founder and director of a nonprofit policy 
research group called the Children's Partnership, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration represents a clear departure," Lazarus said. "For the 
first time in 15 years, I would say we have a leadership who is at least 
putting on the table issues affecting families and children." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnold Fege, director of governmental relations for the national office of 
the PTA, called family policy under the Clinton Administration "about as 
unrecognizable as our foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 David Liederman, head of the Child Welfare League of America, said that while 
many good things have happened in the name of the family since Clinton took 
office, "I'd feel an awful lot better if all of this good stuff was part of an 
overall plan. To tackle the problems of children and the family, you need a 
national vision -- and that's what's missing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recent remarks by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala -- which 
seemed to echo former Vice President Dan Quayle's infamous "Murphy Brown" 
speech -- have drawn fire from factions who accused her of trivializing the 
growing problem of children born to unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 From her office in Washington, Shalala said the comments were widely 
misunderstood. Rather than issuing a "Murphy Brown" speech of her own, she 
said, she was responding to a congressman's query. 
</P>
<P>
 On the broader question of how this Administration was responding to the 
increase in births to unmarried women -- particularly teen-agers -- Shalala 
said federal programs to reduce teen pregnancies had not proved effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the President can do, all we can do is to galvanize communities and 
community organizations," Shalala said. She emphasized that nevertheless, "we 
are indeed putting resources into real family planning" efforts, including a 
pregnancy reduction program included in the new welfare package. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala insisted that the ongoing flap over Whitewater or sexual harassment 
charges against President Clinton by Paula Jones had done nothing to distract 
the Administration from its work on family programs. DHHS employees were far 
too busy to spend their time watching the Whitewater hearings on television, 
Shalala said -- and as for herself, while grabbing a quick solo lunch at her 
desk, she had turned on cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Galston said work on the domestic policy council had been 
equally unaffected by presidential embarrassments or charges of misconduct. "We 
have just conducted our business to the best of our ability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Blankenhorn of the Institute for American Values, for one, thinks that for 
all the good intentions, many potential services for families had been 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about opportunities through changes in the tax code, regulations and 
changes that would allow parents to spend a longer period of time at home after 
a child is born?" Blankenhorn wondered. "Why not double the child exemption in 
the first year of a child's life? Why not have a kind of GI bill for parents?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fege, at the PTA, said that in the early days of the Clinton Administration, 
"we had recommended that there be an Office of Family and Children in the White 
House. We're still proposing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps President Clinton, who frequently ventures into schoolrooms to talk to 
children, could hold regular town meetings on subjects of interest to families, 
Fege said. 
</P>
<P>
 But merely "by using the White House as a bully pulpit" on family issues, the 
President has helped advance these matters, Etzioni, of the Communitarian 
Network, pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Family matters are at least out on the table, agreed Cathy Collette of the 
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- and that 
already represents an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as we would like revolution," Collette said, "I think we have to 
settle for evolution."

 Just as Disney will pull "The Lion King" from theaters at the height of its 
popularity, Greg Arnette has yanked his company's best-selling sunglasses from 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was prompted by fears that the 1950s-style wrap-around, chrome-plated 
plastic shades -- called Ravens -- were becoming overexposed.The Beastie Boys 
wore them on the covers of Details and Vibe, Lenny Kravitz wore them on "MTV 
Unplugged," and Madonna wore them to a Laker game. Next thing you know, a 
face-lifted Mick Jagger might wear them to the Voodoo Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discontinued the chromes because we didn't want them to be played out," 
marketing director Chris Burke says. "We don't want to be an Oakley or a 
Ray-Ban. You lose a little bit of your coolness and your hipness if you get 
that big." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnette created the glasses 2 1/2 years ago as an alternative to high-tech 
black ski and snowboarding goggles. When top snowboarders Steve Graham, Brian 
Thien and Mike Ranquet donned Ravens, it seems everyone else did too. Since 
then, Arnette's San Clemente-based company, called Arnet (he dropped the "te" 
because it fouled up the company logo), has sold more than 4,000 pairs of the 
sleek $75 frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnette hasn't left his snowboarding Raven customers in an ultraviolet-ray 
lurch. A new variation in gold will be available at surf shops (such as the 
Pacific Sunwear chain, North Hollywood's Val Surf & Sport and Surfside Sports 
in Newport Beach) later this summer.

 Custom-shirt maker Anto Sepetjian probably dresses more of Hollywood's leading 
men than Giorgio Armani at an Oscar telecast. His 3,500-square-foot Beverly 
Hills shop, called simply Anto, turns out about 125 custom shirts a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison Ford wears half a dozen fine Swiss cotton shirts by Anto in "Clear 
and Present Danger." Nick Nolte courts Julia Roberts in a pinpoint Oxford in "I 
Love Trouble." And Arnold Schwarzenegger goes through about 120 Sea Island 
cotton shirts while dodging bullets and airplanes in "True Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold has a 17 3/8-inch collar, a 50-inch chest and sloped shoulders, so he 
has to have a custom-made shirt," says Anto, who uses only his first name. "If 
he wears a straight-shouldered dress shirt off the rack, it will cut on him and 
he'll be very uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference, you ask, between a store-bought and a custom-made 
shirt? Basically, everything. Before the first stitch, 15 measurements are 
taken, eight for the collar alone. The customer selects fabric, collar, cuff 
and pocket design, after which a shirt is sewn from muslin to confirm the fit. 
First-time customers must order at least six Anto shirts, which cost $165 to 
$185. 
</P>
<P>
 A less expensive way to go is Nordstrom's unadvertised, by-appointment-only 
custom-shirt service. These shirts, made by New York shirt designer Ike Behar, 
start at about $95. The Custom Shops chain specializes in "semi-custom-made" 
shirts; a customer chooses the fabric, but pockets, cuffs and collars are 
standardized. Cotton shirts range from $47 to $99.50. CUSTOM VERSUS 
STORE-BOUGHT 
</P>
<P>
 PRICE Custom: Anywhere from $95 to about $185. Store-Bought: Average price 
about $30. * 
</P>
<P>
 FABRIC Custom: Better quality, usually 120-thread cotton, tighter weave. 
Pre-washed to prevent shrinkage. Store-Bought: The average dress shirt is made 
of CVC ("chief value cotton"). That's a nice way of saying a cotton-poly blend. 
Usually 65% cotton, 35% polyester. If 100% cotton -- such as an Arrow shirt -- 
the thread count is usually 80 threads per inch. * 
</P>
<P>
 BUTTONS Custom: Mother-of-pearl -- stronger and more aesthetically pleasing. 
Hand-sewn. Store-Bought: Plastic -- can break during dry cleaning. Attached by 
machine. * 
</P>
<P>
 STITCHING Custom: Single-needle stitches, often done by hand. Store-Bought: 
Double- or triple-needle stitches done on machines. * 
</P>
<P>
 COLLARS Custom: Lined with fabric and sewn; the collars get softer over time. 
Store-Bought: Fused -- another word for glued. Initially stiff, fused collars 
often crinkle, crack and fray after repeated dry cleanings. * 
</P>
<P>
 CUFFS Custom: Dozens of variations -- from tab closures to interesting angles. 
Store-Bought: Two varieties -- French or button. * 
</P>
<P>
 MONOGRAMS Custom: Hand-stitched. Store-Bought: Machine-stitched, usually for 
nominal fee by department store. * 
</P>
<P>
 LAUNDERING Custom: Anto's in-store laundry service. Pick up, wash, press and 
delivery, $4.50 per shirt. And hold the starch, Anto says -- it ruins the 
fabric. Store-Bought: In-home laundry service. New "wrinkle-free" dress shirts 
can be worn straight from the dryer. Great for cotton shirts, but 
"wrinkle-free" cotton-poly shirts are the same as, excuse the expression, perma 
press.

 The motley crew of Gen Xers in the new Calvin Klein ad looks as if they 
stepped right off Melrose Avenue. Shirtless, skinny boys in weathered jeans and 
cropped leather pants chat aimlessly with girls clad in tanks, bra tops and 
stringy hair about. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Why, cK one, of course.Beginning this month, Klein's new gender-neutral 
fragrance is the subject of a multimillion-dollar ad campaign photographed by 
Steven Meisel. Representatives from Klein's camp say the citrus-smelling 
fragrance is manly, yes. But they're betting that women will like it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Those steamy spots for Klein's Obsession and Escape seem clearly aimed at the 
"me" generation, but the ad for cK one is definitely going for the Pepsi crowd. 
Even the minimalistic frosted glass flask with its twist-off cap resembles a 
2-liter soft-drink bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Look hard and you might be able to pick Kate Moss and Donovan Leitch out of 
this homogenous crowd. Apparently, that's the point. The image is supposed to 
reflect "a certain plainness and naturalness" that characterizes today's youth, 
Klein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have been wearing men's fragrances for years, says Annette Green of the 
New York-based Fragrance Foundation, a trade association. "It seems to be a 
trend. Men and women are trying to downplay their differences . . . so 
genderless fragrances make a lot of sense now." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't refer to cK one as unisex or androgynous. The words make Klein 
wince. It's a "shared scent," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. Customers cruising through Bullock's this week were handed free 
samples of the his-and-her scent, which goes on sale in early October. "Avon?" 
guessed one young man, sniffing his wrist. "No," the fragrance girl said. "It's 
cK one." Uh-oh.

<P>
 The verdict's in on at least one aspect of the upcoming O.J. Simpson trial. 
Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro's wardrobe has been ruled, well, 
indefensible by picky fashion watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 While many courtroom warriors spell integrity with snow-white shirts, rep ties 
and American-shouldered navy suits, Shapiro's look is strictly Hollywood 
peacock. Count on the perennially tan, handsome attorney to appear in 
mind-numbing print ties and a succession of unvented, European-style 
double-breasted suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "His clothes look good on TV," says Beverly Hills retailer Sami Dinar, "but 
they have nothing to do with fashion. Those bold ties are just no longer 
happening." The price, however, may have been right: Dinar says he sold Shapiro 
nearly $2,000 worth of sale merchandise in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney is known for keeping an eye on the bottom line. "He's primarily a 
sale customer," says Scott Hill, who recently opened a signature shop on 
Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles. And although Hill says Shapiro occasionally 
"hits it" with a particular outfit, "he has the most eclectic mishmash of 
suits, shirts and ties I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, the clothing buyer at Ron Ross for 16 years, recalls helping Shapiro 
shop at the Studio City store. "He's a great guy. But he always bought the 
worst suit left on the rack after it had been marked down 75%." 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion insiders say that these days, Shapiro does most of his shopping at 
Bernini on Rodeo Drive. "I really don't think he's that bad of a dresser," 
Bernini Vice President Stevan Hill says. "He just picks the fringe things."  
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of a few recent shopping expeditions, Shapiro bought at least 
three Italian-made suits, 18 Lorenzini cotton dress shirts and several Brioni 
silk ties, Hill says. "He still likes those loud, bright ties . . . as if the 
trial were not enough."

CLOSET RX; IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A package is waiting for you. You know what it is, but you're not looking 
forward to opening it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another birthday gift from your dear mother or sweet Aunt Lil, who saw a 
blouse, dress or hat she thought you'd look perfect in. But the truth is, while 
they might look great in an over-blouse printed with flowers in a shade of pink 
not known to nature, your tastes are probably different. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before you send the thank-you note and toss the apparel in the thrift 
shop bag, you might want to experiment to see if it could work into your closet 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fairly common to want to give away pieces of clothing that don't fit 
your needs," says Sandy Miller of Twice the Style in Costa Mesa. "But if you 
give it some thought, some of those pieces can be salvaged. You might realize 
that Mom isn't as out-of-touch with what you wear as you thought." 
</P>
<P>
 If there's an old pleated skirt gathering dust on a hanger, now is probably 
the time to give it a good examination. "You can shorten it above the knee and 
use a large safety pin to accessorize it and you'll have the skirt that is 
expected to be hot this fall," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Coordinate this "kilt" look with opaque tights and black shoes to match the 
pages of the fall fashion books. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're good at selecting colors and styles for yourself, try using some of 
your creativity to turn a dull outfit into a hot one," says clothing designer 
Sara D'allesandro of Yorba Linda. "Sometimes it just takes a new necklace and 
belt to keep from tossing out what you thought of as your mother's dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Another classic you may have winced at when you pulled it out of the box is 
the cardigan sweater. The short cardigan, which hits the waistline, is on the 
verge of a revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beaded cardigan is making a comeback for the fall and winter, and many 
designers are introducing their own versions of it," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 You can apply a beaded applique or a beaded neckline to that gift cardigan to 
help create a '40s look; add a pearl necklace and earrings or even '90s-style 
gold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer cardigans are expected to start around $300, making your updated 
version a bargain, especially if it was a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at fashion magazines quite a bit, you realize that everything 
comes back in style," says Evelyn Martiens of Serendipity in San Juan 
Capistrano. "Blouses, slacks, dresses that a few years ago you would have 
thrown away are coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Martiens also recommends hanging on to those clothes your mother sends for 
more than their fashion. "Anytime someone's given you a gift out of love, it 
shouldn't be tossed away. Find a good use for it."

ELLEN TRACY BLENDS STRENGTH, ROMANCE

 There arose an understated intensity to Ellen Tracy's fall '94 collection as 
it unfolded last Thursday at Bullock's, South Coast Plaza. It reflected a 
strength without screaming, timeless styling without being conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Linda Allard, who appeared after the benefit for the Susan G. Komen 
Breast Cancer Foundation, said her inspiration came from Napoleon and 
Josephine, Bogie and Bacall, "Wuthering Heights" and "Anna Karenina." 
</P>
<P>
 Though romance dominated her design direction, it did not parlay into the 
fragile and mushy softness of obviously romantic clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she chose fabrics with substance -- crepes, wool, twills, jersey -- 
and interpreted them into silhouettes that hinted to her influences. There were 
military accents, from the officer jackets and Lycra jodhpur pants to details 
of red piping and gold buttons. Suit jackets buttoned high up. Knee-high boots 
and thigh-high socks reached just short of flirty fingertip length skirts. 
Trench coats and other long jackets belonged on a foggy city street. 
</P>
<P>
 While Allard emphasized brown for day and left black for night, she stressed 
color throughout the line. "Color is very important now," she said between 
meeting customers in the Ellen Tracy department at Bullock's. "We've had 
neutrals for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes are worn monochromatically and paired with leg wear and shoes of 
another color -- usually a matte Java. Among the colors featured: topaz, plum, 
russet, bittersweet and oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
 If colors like those don't arouse your taste buds, Allard's cookbook 
"Absolutely Delicious" (Random House, $24) could. Released in the spring, the 
collection of her favorite recipes is illustrated with her watercolor drawings.

FASHION; DIVINE INSPIRATION; MORE FOR A COOL LOOK THAN FOR RELIGION, THE VIRGIN 
MARY ICON IS A BEST-SELLING ICON 
</P>

 The faithfully fashionable are at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Trendy devotees wore crosses last year on advice not from the Pope, but from 
Donna Karan. Modern evening dressing meant somber, monastic designs from Calvin 
Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the truly hip have gone a step further. Their inspiration is neither Karan 
nor Klein, but the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Her image is turning up in nightclubs, coffeehouses and wherever else 
scenesters congregate. And in no other incarnation is she more popular than as 
Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art is negotiating with the 
Mexican government to bring the collection of artifacts from Our Lady of 
Guadalupe basilica in Mexico City to Santa Ana. This, spokesman Brian Langston 
says, is because of continuing pop interest in the blessed mother -- including 
hot sales of T-shirts and car stick-shift knobs from the museum store. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Virgen de Guadalupe is a very high-profile image in Southern California 
because of the large Latino population," says Billy Shire, owner of La Luz de 
Jesus gallery and Soap Plant on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, which stocks a 
host of Catholic- and Day of the Dead-related items for home and body. The 
attraction, he says, is "imagery that's so intense." He adds that the appeal 
for many young customers is pure kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Na Na's Paul Kaufman attributes the fascination with things Catholic to an 
abundance of "great stuff available, like a 3-D picture of Mary that turns into 
Jesus or votive candles. There are so many rich visuals." Na Na has carried 
earrings, chokers, brooches, bolo ties, candles and pillows since the original 
store opened in Santa Monica in 1976. "It's about having a healthy irreverence 
for things that people take seriously," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That take hits home for Hi-Fi owner Sean Barger, who credits a "really heavy, 
strict Catholic upbringing" for his design inspiration. "Our Lady" appears on 
wallets, watches, undershirts and on buttons sewn on pants and knit shirts by 
the Costa Mesa-based streetwear label. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always amazed me how my family's lives were so consumed by their religion 
and how certain symbols made them react," says Barger, who has included other 
Catholic images in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred heart items have done well for Hi-Fi, as well as for the more 
mainstream designs of Mossimo, who has stamped his own version on Zippo 
lighters. As a tattoo, the sacred heart shows up in more renditions -- space 
age and literal interpretations, with veiny valves and all -- than the Virgin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although genuinely religious customers account for some of the brisk sales, 
the general consensus is that the trend has less to do with faith and more to 
do with fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always locking on to symbols, like crosses or tribal pattern 
tattoos," says Steve Wagoner of Rack N Ruin/Dead Cow in Lake Forest, which 
distributes belt buckles and chain wallets featuring "Our Lady" to 
alternative-wear boutiques and to skate and surf shops. "They want to be bold, 
but I don't think it's to shock like it used to be. I don't think you can shock 
anyone with anything anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Are consumers of Catholic-themed merchandise searching for some deeper meaning 
in their lives? 
</P>
<P>
 No, Wagoner says. "They're just looking for something cool."

 Community center -- An article in Thursday's Westside section contained 
incorrect information on the Ocean Park Community Center in Santa Monica. A 
renovation project now under way will allow the center to house 55 homeless 
people, up from the current 35, and expand its counseling programs and support 
groups for battered women. The center has raised $2.7 million for the work 
through government grants and private donations and is trying to raise an 
additional $1.3 million needed to complete the project.

THEATER REVIEWS; BURBAGE ENSEMBLE ILLUMINATES 'RACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With "Race" the Burbage Theater Ensemble has found an ingenious and 
illuminating way tolook at the vexing, endlessly complicated subject of 
American race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago playwright Jamie Pachino has adapted the interviews of Studs Terkel's 
recent book "Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American 
Obsession" into a kaleidoscopic series of scenes reflecting the fear, hope and 
confusion of everyday people in the melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough Polish American cop recounts how he was ostracized by peers for 
bucking a racist policy. A man worries that Latinos on television are only 
shown "in street gangs, immigration raids or drug busts." And African Americans 
notice the not-so-subtle ways they are shunned in restaurants and on subways. 
</P>
<P>
 The material, at least as arranged by Pachino, has an unmistakably 
left-leaning spin, with a tendency to break whites down into camps of the 
enlightened and the ignorant. But the show's poignant insight and occasionally 
mordant humor more than compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-directors Ivan Spiegel and Jimm Giannini choreograph the brief scenes with 
admirable theatrical flair, and the nine-member ensemble, while occasionally 
stumbling during the review performance, nevertheless found the poetry in these 
real-life monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Race," Burbage Theatre, 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles. Thursdays 8 
p.m., Fridays and Saturdays 7:30 p.m. Ends Sept. 10. $15. (310) 478-0897. 
Running time: 1 hour , 30 minutes. SCOTT COLLINS

THEATER REVIEWS; ANGELS' 'NEON TETRA' TAKES AIM AT ICONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Philip Brandes 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handily living up to its satirical premise about a housewife's transformation 
into a lip-syncing phenom, Sebastian Stuart's "Neon Tetra" at Angels Theater 
takes short, biting jabs at all sorts of trendy jugulars -- and usually 
connects with hilarious accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reed engagingly carries the title role through the stock stages of 
stardom -- from shy ingenue to blossoming artist to uptight prima donna to 
pathetic has-been 20 years in the future, and Kevin Williamson plays her nerdy 
true love with impeccable whining conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, we can't help reveling in Stuart's delightfully catty potshots 
at cultural icons (like the inspired rock video of the "I Dream of Jeannie" 
theme with lyrics by existential chanteuse Suzanne Vega) in a society that 
elevates pretense to an art form. Despite Alexa Hunter's crisp direction, 
however, a few scenes overstay their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Is "Neon Tetra" worth seeing? As one of Stuart's 21st-Century teeny-boppers 
would say in future-slang for self-evidence, "Well, duh -- is Kevin Costner 
President?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Neon Tetra," Angels Theater, 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake. Fridays, 
Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays,7 p.m. Ends Aug. 27. $10. (213) 466-1767. Running 
time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. Philip Brandes
