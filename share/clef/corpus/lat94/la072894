SCOTT HARRIS: THIS FESTIVAL COULD BE TIME FOR LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HARRIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete is one of my best friends. Donald is one of his best friends. Chuck is 
one of Donald's best friends. This is a story about Donald and Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
 They met at work. They hung out together all the time. They played a lot of 
softball, basketball and poker. More than a few times, they went to Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete and Donald were roommates. One evening, Pete came home and found Donald 
sitting in the living room. The place was dark and silent. Donald was 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the matter?" Pete asked. Donald said nothing. Pete kept pestering him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck is gay," Donald finally said. (Knowing Donald, it may have been a more 
colorful term.) 
</P>
<P>
 There hadn't been a single clue. Donald's shock was understandable. And, as 
Pete quickly realized, now that Chuck was coming out of the closet, Donald had 
to be thinking that people would be wondering about him too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Pete finally said, "I guess you're going to find out how good a friend 
you really are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I offer this tale because there's a chance that some people who live in the 
Antelope Valley may learn something surprising about a friend, a neighbor or an 
acquaintance. This is especially true if they dare drop by the Antelope Valley 
Fairgrounds, the site of the community's first Gay and Lesbian Pride Festival, 
which begins Friday at 5 p.m. and continues Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, many Angelenos yawn at the news of a gay pride event. But the 
Antelope Valley? Even some gays seem surprised. After all, the distance between 
West Hollywood and the neighboring burgs of Palmdale and Lancaster is much 
farther than the map indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the fact that there is exactly one gay bar in the Antelope 
Valley. Rather, it is the reputation the region has developed for homophobia. 
This western outpost of the Bible belt is home of the church that produces "The 
Gay Agenda," an anti-homosexual video that has received wide national 
circulation and has been denounced by gay activists. Many other churches also 
preach that homosexuality is an abomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers thus are expecting to be greeted with some sort of 
protest.  
</P>
<P>
 The size and tone of the demonstration is anybody's guess. If a protest 
occurs, festival organizers are hopeful that their response will be a model of 
civility. Don't look for members of Queer Nation marching down California 14 
chanting, "We're here/ We're queer/ Get used to it." Instead, they suggest, 
gays are more likely to simply join hands in a silent show of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Penland of the Antelope Valley Gay and Lesbian Alliance suggests that the 
festival has two purposes. One is to demonstrate that gays and lesbians are 
indeed everywhere, not just in magnets like West Hollywood and Laguna Beach. 
But perhaps more important, he suggests, the point is to encourage gays in the 
area to take pride in their true selves -- to get involved in their fledgling 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley, Penland suggests, is really more tolerant than its 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never experienced any kind of discrimination," says Penland, who lived in 
the region for six years before recently moving to Nevada. "I find it's more 
based on how you feel about yourself. If you project yourself as ashamed or 
embarrassed, they'll respond to that. If you have something to be ashamed 
about, they'll go ahead and treat you badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, sometimes people get terrorized for no good reason. One Lancaster 
man was recently beaten in what law enforcement authorities describe as a 
"gay-bashing." This happened not in the Antelope Valley, but in West Hollywood, 
which shows that hate is everywhere too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Fletcher, a Mormon father of 11 who says his own effort to organize a 
protest against the festival has fizzled, believes that instead of hatred and 
violence, homosexuals should be approached with Christian understanding -- to 
show them the error of their ways. 
</P>
<P>
 John, meet Hank. He also believes in Christian understanding. And Hank wants 
everyone to know that he is not only gay, but a church-going Christian and a 
patriot. Hank says he "gets chills" every time he hears "The Star-Spangled 
Banner." He wears the uniform of the United States Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank, who is stationed at Edwards Air Force Base, also wants you to know that 
Hank isn't his real name. The Pentagon's "don't ask, don't tell" policy 
requires a certain discretion. But it hasn't stopped colleagues from asking 
him, and Hank says he's encountered nothing but respect for telling the truth. 
And the policy hasn't prevented Hank from serving as the festival chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 One last note: I don't see Donald and Chuck much anymore, but the last time I 
talked to Pete, he said they're still friends.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE FAA; THE FEDERAL AGENCY BLEW IT; OVERHAUL IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is time for Congress and the Clinton Administration to shape up the Federal 
Aviation Administration. If that means cleaning house at the top, or even 
putting others in charge of airline safety, so be it. Today's hearing before 
the House subcommittee on technology, environment and aviation would be a good 
place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 A 46-page report issued Tuesday by two top officials of the FAA and the 
Department of Transportation included the startling and frightening finding 
that the agency lacks the ability to spot and avert potential threats to 
safety. The implications for public confidence in the nation's commercial 
aviation system are enormous. It confirms what critics have charged for years, 
that the agency is too slow to move on issues affecting the well-being of 
pilots, crews and more than 500 million airline passengers each year. Such 
laxity is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was prompted by extensive publicity -- which began with The Times' 
reportage on a crash in Santa Ana that killed five people -- given to the FAA's 
mishandling of the problem of wake turbulence caused by the Boeing 757 
passenger jet. Astonishingly, the agency ignored warnings that smaller aircraft 
flying behind the 757 could be affected by what amounted to "horizontal 
tornadoes" coming from each wingtip of the 757. Only after the Santa Ana crash, 
preceded by one in Montana that killed eight, did the FAA institute new 
policies this year that required smaller planes to stay an extra mile -- four 
miles instead of three -- behind 757s on final airport approach. It is 
unconscionable that the agency failed to alert pilots to the problem far 
earlier; it might have saved lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tension between the agency's missions: ensuring safety and 
promoting the airline industry. Spacing planes farther apart means fewer 
landings at desirable times, more delays and more unhappy passengers. Still, 
the extra-mile requirement was less than the National Transportation Safety 
Board's call for a distance of six miles. And the FAA's concern about the 
effect distancing requirements might have on Boeing's economic health further 
suggested conflicting allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 An improved air-traffic control system might allow smoother traffic flow, but 
the FAA has mismanaged the automation of the current system so badly that the 
project is billions of dollars over budget and delayed by years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the airline industry has a good safety record. But now it is 
apparent that not only did the FAA mishandle the 757 problem, it also cannot 
mount coordinated responses to safety problems. At a minimum, the FAA must get 
rid of those who failed to warn pilots of the dangers of the wake turbulence. 
And the nation's airways need a better safety monitor -- either a reformed FAA 
or another agency.

RIGHTS WATCH; PAYING FOR THE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among many other things, state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown is obviously a 
highly intelligent and imaginative legislator. But his proposal to prohibit 
witnesses in criminal trials from selling their stories before or during a 
trial would push California onto very tricky ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown -- like fellow legislator Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who 
favors a similar approach -- is utterly appalled by the practice of witnesses 
pedaling their testimony to the sort of "news organizations" that have no moral 
or ethical reservations at all about checkbook journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ordinary citizens were disgusted to hear that witnesses in the O. J. 
Simpson case were selling their stories to frenzied media outlets. The problem 
is not only that the practice is questionable, but that it may possibly 
complicate Simpson's criminal trial. "A witness who tells the truth, but admits 
being paid for the story, may lose credibility in the eyes of the jury," Brown 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Brown's proposal lands right on the knife's edge of the perennial 
dilemma: rights in conflict. The American system requires a fair trial, but it 
also requires the greatest possible freedom of speech and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibiting witnesses from taking money for their stories is not the same as 
banning them from talking to the press, as Brown is careful to point out. But 
when all is said and done, his proposal could mean less freedom for both the 
individual and the press. In the final analysis, Brown's cure, which is 
constitutionally dubious anyway, could prove worse than the disease.

DO IT RIGHT, BE INCLUSIVE; ASSEMBLY WISELY CALLS FOR ADDING 'ASIAN PACIFIC' 
DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1993 the California Department of Finance issued a population projections 
report that for the first time used demographic demarcations of race and 
ethnicity. The categories were white, black, Hispanic and other. Noticeably 
missing was a breakout of Asian and Pacific Islanders, who account for about 
10% of state population and make up the fastest growing minority group in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The oversight is so apparent that a legislative remedy is warranted. The state 
lumped Asian and Pacific Islanders into the "other" category, even though it 
used U.S. census data on more than a dozen categories of Asian and Pacific 
Island ancestry. The Finance Department acknowledges that the group overall 
accounts for 85% of the "other" category. But the agency said it lacked the 
necessary comparable U.S. census data over a 20-year period to project 
population growth for Asian and Pacific Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Some demographers disagree, noting that California is home to the largest 
number of Asian and Pacific Islanders. With such a population base, they 
believe that credible population projections for the group are doable with a 
change in methodology. The census began counting this influx in 1870, when 
settlers from across the Pacific were primarily from China. By the turn of the 
century, they were joined by the Japanese, Filipinos and Koreans. The numbers 
were limited until 1965, when immigration reform ended the national-origin 
quota system. 
</P>
<P>
 To more accurately count the Asian and Pacific Islander population in the 
state, the Assembly has wisely passed a bill with bipartisan support to require 
the Department of Finance to break out those groups as a distinct category 
whenever it issues reports containing breakdowns or analyses based on race or 
ethnicity. The Senate Appropriations Committee takes up AB 3335 on Aug. 8 when 
the Legislature reconvenes. The bill is needed so that Asian and Pacific 
Islanders are not excluded in future reports by the Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing information on a group that will have increasing impact and voice in 
public policy is itself good policy.

THE ATTACKS ON ISRAELIS AND JEWS; BUT FROM THE RAVAGES OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, NO ONE IS IMMUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No credible claim of responsibility has yet been made in the wake of recent 
terrorist attacks on Israelis and Jews in Argentina, Panama and Britain. But 
the inference to be drawn from these atrocities is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly by no coincidence, the attacks came as the leaders of Jordan and 
Israel met in Washington to proclaim an end to their long state of war. But 
peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors has its sworn enemies, and it's no 
secret that plotting against peace goes on in Tehran as well as in the capitals 
of a number of radical Arab regimes. Terrorism is the method of these plotters, 
and the entire world is their arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The two car-bomb attacks in London this week, one directed against the Israeli 
Embassy, a second against a building housing Israeli and Jewish organizations, 
have prompted Britain's police -- long on the alert because of bombings by the 
radical Irish Republican Army -- to greatly tighten security around Israeli and 
Jewish facilities vulnerable to terrorists' attacks. In the United States, 
including Los Angeles, a similar intensification of protective measures has 
taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel has diplomatic, trade and transport missions in more than 100 
countries, not all of them with the kind of security resources that Britain or 
this country can commit in response to the new threat. Bombs are easily made 
and transported. In greater or lesser degree such overseas Israeli facilities 
have always been exposed to terrorist attack. The campaign that now appears to 
have been launched raises the level of risk. Moreover, as the attacks in Buenos 
Aires, Panama and London again showed, it is not only Israelis but Jews as a 
group who are being targeted, once more giving lie to the claim that the fight 
being waged by Muslim extremists is only against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorist groups are difficult to penetrate. But intelligence agencies of a 
number of countries have learned much in recent years about what organizations 
and individuals to watch, and international cooperation has improved. 
Obviously, room for further improvement exists. As the murdered and maimed 
citizens of Argentina, Panama and Britain attest, terrorism is truly an 
international menace.

CSUN QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your report on earthquake recovery (July 17) correctly stresses the amount 
of work yet to do. However, because repair work at Cal State Northridge has 
continued around the clock this summer, conditions on campus will be much 
better this fall than last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of several major permanent classroom buildings have been repaired and 
will house classes. The core of the Oviatt Library building will reopen, 
allowing access to its vast book collection and study spaces. Most classes and 
all labs will take place on campus rather than off. Student housing has been 
strengthened and will reopen. And important new buildings will open for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although major repair work will continue on campus as throughout Los Angeles, 
the work that has been done so far will greatly improve classroom and study 
conditions at Northridge this fall.

DOLE ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your account of a tribute dinner at the Nixon Library (July 24), I read 
that the organizers decided to "toss the salad" (course) to accommodate main 
speaker Sen. Bob Dole's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hurrying back to Washington after meeting with Republican leaders in 
Los Angeles to talk over campaign strategy ("GOP Presses for Delay in Health 
Reform Action," July 24). 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to adopt a position of delaying health-care reform until after the 
election, Dole said, "We don't have to do any of it this year . . . Congress 
meets every year." Dick Cheney, a relatively new player to the health-care 
game, agreed. Cheney is a declared 1996 presidential wanna-be and Dole most 
likely is. 
</P>
<P>
 Well that's just great! The political ambitions of a few will now take 
precedence over health care for millions of people. Can we expect the 
Republicans to toss out health care like they did the salad? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dr. Harry Goldin's article, "Gatekeepers May Be Hazardous to Your Health" 
(Commentary, July 11), was both enlightening and disturbing. Who would 
willingly participate in a health-care plan where the doctors care more about 
their profit than their patients' health? Thinking I had all the facts after 
carefully researching the literature, I recently joined such a plan. It came as 
quite a shock when my primary-care physician told me, after excruciatingly 
painful back spasms that required the paramedics to get me up off the floor, 
that I "had used up my allotment," and I was repeatedly denied requests to see 
a specialist. Consequently, the problem has gone undiagnosed. Besides being 
"unethical" and "dangerous," capitated plans may, in the long run, cost the 
system more, as well as extend the patient's pain and suffering.

GOLDWATER ON GAY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All too often, I'll read an opinion in your Column Right feature, shake my 
head, and wonder to myself why I'm still registered as a Republican. Thank you 
for brightening my day with former Sen. Barry Goldwater's excellent piece on 
employment protections for gays and lesbians ("Equality, in the Service of 
Productivity," Column Right, July 14). 
</P>
<P>
 It is very encouraging to see a political figure of Sen. Goldwater's stature 
stand up to the hateful, mean-spirited and fundamentally foolish rhetoric of 
the radical right. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the mainstream leadership of the Republican Party can find the courage 
and the character to stand up to the dime-store demagogues and fundamentalist 
fanatics, the Ollie Norths and Jerry Falwells, the Republican Party will become 
the kind of irrelevant political freak show it has defeated in five of the last 
seven presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, Sen. Goldwater, for reminding Republicans of our traditions, our 
principles and our priorities. 
</P>

 Goldwater's article appeared on the wrong side of the page. Thomas Jefferson, 
a true conservative, said, "He who governs least governs best." The litmus test 
for governmental intrusion is and continues to be economic disparity proven 
through statistical and anecdotal data compiled through disparity studies. If 
it could be proven that the mean income of homosexuals falls consistently and 
substantially below that of the average American, then a case should be made 
for "equalizing" legislation as in the case of blacks, minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Relevant data from private sources such as advertisers and political 
fund-raisers indicates the opposite, that in fact homosexual households contain 
a far higher percentage of "disposable" income. Continued erosion of this 
litmus test does a disservice to blacks and minorities who cannot conceal their 
identity as homosexuals can. As a civil rights activist since 1965, you can 
label this "letter from the left."

 Am I hallucinating? On the same day's Commentary page, two dire warnings and 
chastisements of the runaway-rogue right (Goldwater and Alexander Cockburn, 
"Where's the Left's Reply to Limbaugh?" Column Left). 
</P>
<P>
 After months of nothing but vicious right-wing false accusations, are we 
finally seeing signs, hints in the political debate to semblances of 
moderation, balance and truth? Or is truth to be allowed only biannually, in 
token columns from liberal and traditional conservative alike?

 I found Andrew Reding's analysis of the single-transferable-vote system quite 
interesting but I was disturbed by the philosophy behind it ("Making Every Vote 
Really Count," Commentary, July 17). While on the one hand Reding asserts that 
"There is no presumption that members of a given ethnic group will always want 
to vote on the basis of their ethnicity," he concludes that the objective is 
"(to achieve) a Congress and state legislatures that look like America. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I for one would prefer legislators who think like America. What they look like 
seems to me to be irrelevant.

 Rwanda evokes visceral reaction from Africans living here in the United 
States. "I don't want to think about it; it's a disgrace to Africa and it's too 
close to home," says Anita Shirima, a graduate student from Tanzania. "Rwanda 
is one more proof that the military is out of control in Africa," declares 
Reminglus Kintu, president of Uganda Democratic Coalition. "The complicity of 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni should not be overlooked in the Rwandan 
crisis," he adds. "Where is the Organization of African Unity? What are African 
governments doing to resolve the Rwandan crisis?" asks Jide Osikomalya, the 
Nigerian publisher of Africa Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the OAU and African governments did something. At the OAU's 30th summit 
in Tunis on June 15, Secretary-general Salim Ahmad Salim declared: "Africa must 
assume its responsibility." Indeed, it produced a cease-fire agreement between 
Rwandan warring factions that bore no signatures. It also appointed -- of all 
people! -- President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as the mediator. Zaire itself is 
on the brink of total collapse, wracked by civil strife and carnage. Virtually 
all formal institutions in Zaire have crumbled. Unpaid Zairean soldiers have 
been rampaging and pillaging villages. The business communities in Kivu and 
Lower Zaire decided to pay the salaries of soldiers there to prevent further 
looting. Zairean soldiers have even been robbing the Rwandan refugees encamped 
at Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrations of Africans over the hopeless incompetence of the OAU and 
African governments on Rwanda seldom receive play in the Western media, which 
prefers quoting politicians' trite alibis for African inaction and gratuitous 
blaming of the United Nations and the U.S. government for acting too slowly. 
But most Africans are tired of these crises, the incessant blame and "parachute 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year since 1985, Western journalists have hopped from one African 
debacle to another, parading grisly pictures of emaciated bodies of famine 
victims on television to appeal for humanitarian assistance: Ethiopia (1985), 
Angola (1986), Mozambique (1987), Sudan (1991), Liberia (1992), Somalia (1993), 
Rwanda (1994). Many Africans are enraged by television images that deprecate 
their pride and dignity. Africa, it seems, is synonymous with famine, death and 
destruction. The horrific pictures also convey the mischievous notion that 
Africans are incapable of feeding themselves or solving their own problems. 
With a bowl in an outstretched hand, they are always begging foreigners for 
food. The responsibility for feeding Africans rests with African governments, 
not foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet every year there is a fete of massive relief for Africa. Back in 1985, it 
was Band Aid for Ethiopia and U.S.A. for Africa at a cost of over $1.6 billion. 
In 1992, it was "Operation Rescue" for Somalia, costing more than $2.6 billion. 
The Rwandan mission has passed the $250-million mark. And more African 
countries are standing in line, ready to blow up. The United Nations 
Development Program has targeted 10 on the brink of social disintegration: 
Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Egypt, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sudan, Zaire 
and, of course, Rwanda. It would make more sense to spend a little money now to 
help prevent these crises, rather than waiting for them to explode, sending 
refugees streaming in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees and famine victims must be helped; it is humanitarian and noble to do 
so. But African humanitarian relief should be coupled with a search for 
permanent solutions, or at least acknowledge the efforts that Africans 
themselves are making to find such solutions. Racism, colonial borders and 
legacies, American imperialism, the Cold War and ancient tribal rivalries are 
irrelevant in the analyses of these crises. Take Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, 
Rwanda, Somalia and Sudan: All have been devastated by the adamant refusal of 
military coconut-heads to step down or share political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa has too many dictators -- more per capita than any other region in the 
world. Only 13 of the 54 African countries are democratic. The least the 
international community could do to help Africa find permanent solutions to its 
crises is to aid only democratic countries and deny aid to any African country 
that spends more than 5% of its government budget on the military. (African 
governments spend more than $12 billion a year on the importation of arms and 
the maintenance of the military -- an amount equal to what Africa receives in 
aid from all sources.) 
</P>
<P>
 On Rwanda, it is tempting for the international community, anguishing over the 
bloodletting and embarrassed by its apparent helplessness to halt the 
slaughter, to embrace and recognize the government formed by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front. This government, boasts RPF leader Paul Kagame, is 
"broad-based," with two moderate Hutus, Faustin Twagiramugu and Pasteur 
Bizimungu, as prime minister and president. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the RPF earned distinction by its remarkable display of discipline in 
battle and committed fewer atrocities, an RPF government is not viable. First 
of all, recognizing a group that shoots its way to power undermines the ideals 
of democracy that most seek to establish elsewhere in Africa. Furthermore, 
Africa's protracted experience with civil wars shows that a vanquished faction 
simply does not evaporate. It flees into exile, regroups and returns with a 
vengeance to wreak mayhem. Says Labislas Habyatinana, a defeated Hutu soldier 
who fled to Munigi, Zaire: "I've killed at least 80 Tutsis with grenades. . . . 
I'm still young, I can fight again soon, then again and again until we win back 
Rwanda." This is exactly what the Tutsi rebels did, fleeing into exile after 
being routed in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite assurances by the RPF that it will not seek revenge against the Hutus, 
it is unlikely that the 3 million Hutu refugees in Tanzania and Zaire will 
return anytime soon to Rwanda. Africa is a place where promises by governments 
have as much value as a 5-million Zaire note -- less than a cent. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than leave it to suffer the fate of Somalia -- abandoned to the whims 
of armed vultures -- Rwanda should be recolonized from within Africa. An 
interim, two-year transitional multinational government should be established, 
with representatives drawn not only from the remaining Hutu and Tutsi 
populations but also from groups organized along class, economic and religious 
lines to weaken the ethnic factor in government. The Rwandan military should be 
disbanded. And neighboring countries -- Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and 
Zaire -- should have seats in the interim government, with the right to veto 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighboring countries, after all, have received huge numbers of Rwandan 
refugees, putting a severe strain on their meager social services. As such, 
they ought to have a say in the internal affairs of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a more cogent reason for the involvement of neighboring 
countries: Their own domestic situations mirror those of Rwanda. Burundi, 
Kenya, Uganda and Zaire are themselves sitting on the keg of ethnic explosion. 
An involvement in Rwanda may have a deterrent or therapeutic effect by 
impressing upon its neighbors the ravages of unremitting civil strife. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to send a strong message to African governments: If they do not 
handle their internal affairs well, they will be recolonized or invaded by 
their neighbors. Perhaps the United Nations could take the lead instead of the 
OAU and establish an African-administered trusteeship over Rwanda and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, this proposal is not fail-proof. But as a Tanzanian proverb 
advises: "We start as fools and become wise through experience." Making excuses 
for the OAU and African governments hardly gives them the incentive to make a 
start.

COLUMN RIGHT/ RON K. UNZ: BROWN BETRAYS HER IGNORANCE OF ECONOMICS; HER 
ILL-CONCEIVED PLAN TO BOOST BUSINESS IS GROUNDED IN POLITICS AND GEARED TO 
'CORRECTNESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON K. UNZ, Ron K. Unz, a Silicon Valley computer software entrepreneur, was 
a Republican candidate for governor in the June primary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes a single phrase can summarize an entire political philosophy. Early 
in her campaign for governor, Kathleen Brown announced her support for 
re-imposing California's asset-forfeiture laws, which involve confiscating the 
property of individuals who have not been convicted of any crime. Her position 
paper defended such laws as a "badly needed source of revenue . . . for state 
and local law enforcement agencies." In plain English, government needs the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it? Since the early 1960s, our state budget has grown from under $3 
billion to more than $55 billion, an increase of nearly 150% even after 
accounting for inflation and population growth. Few Californians today would 
believe that this huge spending increase has made our state a better place to 
live. Instead, much of the increased cost of government has gone to pay for the 
sort of half-baked spending programs that Brown now proposes as tools for 
revitalizing our economy and society. Consider a few choice examples. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown proposes an employer tax credit equal to 25% of the salary of each new 
job created in California that pays between $17,600 and $60,000 (presumably 
jobs paying more than $60,000 might create Republican voters and therefore 
should be discouraged). Brown seems not to realize that this provides an 
enormous incentive for an employer to eliminate existing jobs and replace them 
with "new" jobs having different titles, perhaps with the same employees doing 
the same work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, Brown would "allocate" these tax credits according to a whole 
range of subjective evaluation standards, such as whether a company is part of 
an "emerging" industry (as decided by bureaucrats), whether it joins a business 
cluster (whatever that means) and how many minority workers it agrees to hire. 
Thus, even firms that actually created new jobs would get the tax credits only 
if they filled out endless new paperwork -- or paid off the right politicians 
and bureaucrats. The only jobs that Brown's proposal would create are for 
government bureaucrats, private sector paper-pushers and the lobbyists who act 
as their go-betweens.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown also proposes creating a fund to provide venture capital to start-up 
companies. The fund would be administered by a volunteer board of private 
venture capitalists and would provide funding to companies that had failed to 
attract funding from private venture capitalists. This authorizes political 
appointees to risk public money on companies for which they, as private 
investors, had already refused to risk their own private money. Such language 
almost guarantees massive losses to taxpayers. Brown seems unconcerned about 
the business logic of her economic proposals, but she is very concerned about 
their "political correctness." The firms that are to receive government largess 
are not just those that government bureaucrats in their infinite wisdom divine 
will create the jobs of the future, but should be minority- or women-owned as 
well. Presumably, the ideal Brown entrepreneur is a politically connected and 
physically challenged minority woman in a government-selected industry. The 
question of whether such individuals will actually create new wealth for 
California appears entirely secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these obvious business flaws would be apparent to someone like 
Kathleen Brown. As a member of the Los Angeles school board, she learned to 
bend to the prevailing political wind and presided over the decay of one of 
America's finest public school systems. As a "rainmaker" at a prestigious law 
firm, she learned that names and personal connections mattered more than the 
quality of legal briefs. And as state treasurer, she has learned that product 
differentiation among the major Wall Street public-finance bond houses is 
almost nonexistent, with highly lucrative contracts being based primarily on 
political connections, campaign contributions and minority set-asides. How can 
Brown even understand the concept of meritocracy if she has never had any 
contact with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's California would retain enormously high tax rates on the successful 
many in order to subsidize the well-connected few. We would regularly read 
stories about the latest government-sponsored success, but never learn of the 
10 companies silently driven into collapse to pay for that one public-relations 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has followed the international news over the past decade knows that 
state-managed economies are always far better at publicity than at 
productivity. But, as a prominent Brown supporter explained to me in a private 
conversation a few months ago, "Kathleen Brown is an economic illiterate."

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: LABOR 'REFORM' WILL EVISCERATE WORKER RIGHTS; 
RHETORIC IS EERILY SIMILAR AT AN ILLINOIS FIRM THAT LOCKED OUT AND REPLACED 
UNION WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if Congress had made a dent a couple of weeks ago in the proposition that 
it's illegal to win a strike in this country, the prospect for workers would 
not have markedly improved. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure that Senate Republicans filibustered to death in mid-July would 
have barred employers from permanently replacing workers on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the AFL-CIO would have fairly claimed a great victory if Congress 
had barred permanent replacements. It was Item No. 1 on labor's agenda this 
year and would have somewhat compensated for the 1993 defeat on NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 But the win would have been more a symbolic than a practical weapon in the 
hands of workers. Temporary replacements would still have been permitted, along 
with the rest of the formidable arsenal available to employers. It remains 
almost impossible in this country to exercise the democratic right to withhold 
your labor without losing your job. 
</P>
<P>
 In the present era of ferocious encroachment by employers on workers' rights, 
the strike is no longer a focus. The ability of an employer to relocate, the 
quiescence of most labor chieftains, are features not lost on workers whose 
battles often have little to do with simple efforts to win higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the current struggle at A.E. Staley Co. in Decatur, Ill., which has been 
going on for more than two years, with 760 workers locked out a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Staley is a corn-processing factory owned by the international giant Tate & 
Lyle. The dispute isn't over wages, but control. The management, whose company 
was posting decent profits at the time, decided to rewrite long-standing 
portions of the contract, junking rights won over years of negotiation by Local 
837 of the Amalgamated Industrial Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the June, 1993, lockout, the workers had been without a 
contract for a year, negotiations having broken down over the company's 
determination to destroy union protections on seniority, job classifications 
and grievance procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also had imposed 12-hour shifts without overtime, three days on 
and three days off, with 30-day rotations between night and day shifts. This 
ended the eight-hour day and also caused domestic and social problems for 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks as though Staley wanted to force a show-down. The union mounted an 
in-plant resistance campaign in the form of a work-to-rule, sticking rigidly to 
specific job descriptions, and Staley responded with the lockout. Management 
also claimed equipment sabotage, but no convincing evidence has ever been 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the workers are locked outside the factory gates, watching scabs drive 
in to do their jobs. The law killed by Republicans and southern Democrats two 
weeks ago wouldn't have helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 Staley began its onslaught by proclaiming in the late 1980s that it was 
embarking on a "cooperative effort" to result in the "elimination of we-they 
perceptions" and to "improve the competitive position of the Decatur plant." 
</P>
<P>
 By no accident, this is precisely the lingo of the Clinton Administration as 
it moves toward its so-called New Deal for labor. The "reforms" now being 
pondered by the Labor and Commerce departments will similarly spout the lingo 
of worker-management cooperation while eviscerating what legal guarantees -- 
going all the way back to the 1936 Wagner Act -- organized workers have. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of cooperation sung by the Clintonites took the practical form, on 
June 25, of a Decatur SWAT team summoned by Staley management spraying the 
locked-out workers with pepper gas. Some witnesses said the burning gas was 
pointed specifically at union activists, many of whom were already on the 
ground, and that three children got sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians aren't going to help. At the time of the June 25 attack, such 
supposed friends of labor as Democratic Sens. Paul Simon and Carol 
Moseley-Braun of Illinois and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota all kept their mouths 
shut.  
</P>
<P>
 The Staley workers, meanwhile, have been traveling around the country, 
explaining their struggle to other workers -- trying to ignite the popular, 
grass-roots protest that in truth is the only weapon American workers have at 
their disposal at this stage of the game.

THIS ONE IS NOT A SURPRISE; BASKETBALL: ITALY DEFEATS UNITED STATES, 81-72, 
PROVING YET AGAIN THE WORLD IS CATCHING UP TO AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy's first victory over the United States in international basketball since 
1978 did not provoke a wild celebration at midcourt. None of the Italians even 
rocked the baby, as their point guard -- the cool Claudio Coldebella -- did 
when victory was assured in an earlier game against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they expected to defeat the United States on Wednesday at the Sport and 
Concert Complex in the semifinals of the Goodwill Games. Although the ease with 
which they accomplished that, 81-72, might have been a surprise, their bright, 
young coach, Ettore Messina, convinced them beforehand that a close loss would 
still be a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to believe you can win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So they did, scoring the first seven points of the second half to turn a 
one-point halftime deficit into a six-point lead that the United States never 
overcame. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was another reason for the Italians' reserve after advancing to 
today's final against Puerto Rico: "We know it's not the Dream Team we beat," 
Coldebella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coldebella knows it as well as anyone in Italy. In the athletic apparel store 
he owns in Bologna, where he plays professionally for the team that has won two 
consecutive Italian League championships, Dream Team merchandise is his best 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
 Coldebella said the Italians also know that the United States left many of its 
best collegians from last season at home. Glenn Robinson of Purdue and Jason 
Kidd of California turned pro; Corliss Williamson of Arkansas and Randolph 
Childress of Wake Forest were injured, and Ed O'Bannon of UCLA and Marcus Camby 
of Massachusetts had to hit the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Coldebella and his teammates should not diminish their accomplishment. 
The players representing the United States might not be considered as even a 
collegiate Dream Team, but neither are they 12 guys from Backwater A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 Five went to last season's Final Four, including Duke's Cherokee Parks and 
Arizona's Damon Stoudamire. And if history is an accurate precursor, virtually 
all of them will some day have a shot at the NBA. Of 25 players on U.S. teams 
in the 1986 and '90 Goodwill Games, 22 became NBA first-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came over here feeling we had enough talent to win," U.S. Coach George 
Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the United States will play for third place against Russia, which 
lost to Puerto Rico, 69-65, in the other semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the tournament, a Raveling assistant scouted the Americans' three 
first-round opponents, including the Russians, who beat them, 77-75, Sunday. 
But Raveling said he did not know much more about the Italians than what he saw 
here during their first-round games, all victories. There was not much more to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, second in the European Championships as recently as 1991, hit bottom 
last year when it failed to qualify for the final tournament to determine 
Europe's representatives in next month's World Championships at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation responded by firing the coach and hiring Messina from Bologna. 
His first act was to cut several stars, whom he called prima donnas, and 
replace them with players who have less talent but fit better into his 
disciplined system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of international experience, and that is as well-coached a team 
as I have coached against in some 20 odd years," Raveling said. "There is no 
question that tonight they were the superior basketball team. To suggest 
anything else would be foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not a new phenomenon. In recent years, the United States has won only 
one major international title. That was in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, 
where it used the Dream Team. It no doubt will win again in Toronto with Dream 
Team II. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is apparent that the lion king of basketball can no longer just roll 
the ball onto the floor, send any combination of college players after it and 
expect them to come home with gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said that USA Basketball, which governs teams that represent the 
country internationally, is perpetually seeking incentives to coax the best 
college players to participate. But even if they want to play, he said, 
increased academic pressures often prevent them from having their summers free. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had our best college kids here, that would have been enough," Raveling 
said. "But our system doesn't lend to that." 
</P>
<P>
 The other factor is that most of the opposing teams are composed of more 
mature and internationally experienced professionals. That would not have made 
much difference a decade ago, but it does now because foreign teams have 
improved significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans need to understand that these other countries are efficient at 
basketball," Raveling said. "We don't see a lot of international basketball 
other than the Olympics, so we don't get a chance to appreciate Italian 
basketball, Brazilian basketball, Croatian basketball. There are a lot of 
countries that play good basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States can even learn from them. After seeing teams play here, 
Raveling said he is intrigued by the international trend of placing 
good-shooting centers outside so that more space is created underneath the 
basket for free-flowing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that's an even more efficient way to play the game than we do," he 
said. "Maybe we've retarded the progress of our big men by confining them to a 
small area. I hope we're not so egotistical that we can't look at this 
objectively and see if it's something that is adaptable to our basketball."

CANDIOTTI'S FLUTTER FADES, GIANTS SAIL; DODGERS: HE SHUTS OUT SAN FRANCISCO 
THROUGH SEVEN, BUT FALTERS IN EIGHTH AND FALLS, 4-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers returned to Los Angeles on Wednesday night a first-place team, but 
the way they played against the San Francisco Giants did nothing to ease the 
pain of a dismal trip. They lost, 4-1, again coming close, but not having a 
closer to trust proved costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Candiotti, who pitched in all four cities on this trip, held the Giants to 
no runs and four hits through seven innings, but he suddenly seemed to lose 
control of his knuckleball in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dodgers leading, 1-0, Candiotti gave up the tying run, loaded the 
bases and walked Dave Martinez to bring in the winning run.  
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda might have pulled him for a reliever at the first sign of 
trouble, but his bullpen has done little to earn his trust. Candiotti, who at 
that point had pitched 27 innings in the team's last 13 games, was not 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirt Manwaring followed the walk with a drive into the gap in left-center 
field that bounced off the back wall for a ground-rule double, scoring two more 
runs to put the Giants ahead, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Daal relieved Candiotti and ended the inning by getting left-handed Todd 
Benzinger to pop up. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Beck retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth, moving the Giants to a 
half game behind the Dodgers in the National League West and winning the 
series, 2-1. The teams meet again for a three-game series at Dodger Stadium the 
final weekend of the season, if the schedule is not altered because of a player 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were 3-10 on the trip, after leaving two weeks ago with a 
five-game lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to forget this trip," Tim Wallach said. "It was not good, that says it 
all. We didn't do anything well." 
</P>
<P>
 Against starter Bill Swift, the Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on 
a series of close calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi was safe on an infield single to shortstop Royce Clayton, though 
the replay showed the call made by first base umpire Brian Gorman was 
questionable. He went to third when Bill Swift's made a bad throw on a pick-off 
attempt, and was safe when Matt Williams dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, the Giants loaded the bases for Darryl Strawberry with a single 
and two walks, to Barry Bonds and Matt Williams, to whom Candiotti threw four 
consecutive balls. To Strawberry, Candiotti went 2-2 to before striking him out 
on a called third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching with a few runs, or no runs, is something Candiotti got used to last 
season, when the Dodgers averaged only 2.53 runs per game for him, the lowest 
run support in the league for a starting pitcher.

ANGEL PITCHING HAS ANOTHER COLLAPSE, 11-3; BASEBALL: OAKLAND STRIKES QUICKLY BY 
BATTERING LEFTWICH DURING A SIX-RUN FIRST INNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least the Angels were spared the indignity of listening to fans in Anaheim 
Stadium cheer for the opposition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After Phil Leftwich gave up six runs in Oakland's 36-minute first inning, 
Angel and Athletic fans alike were reduced to such a state of apathy that the 
loudest spectators were hundreds of day campers in the upper deck, challenging 
their counterparts across the stadium: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got spirit. Yes we do. We've got spirit. How 'bout you?"  
</P>
<P>
 You need an oil-drilling rig to reach Angel spirits these days. 
</P>
<P>
 How low can they go? Wednesday's humiliating 11-3 loss to Oakland was the 
Angels' sixth consecutive defeat and left them a season-low 18 games below 
.500. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the Angels locked reporters out of the clubhouse for 57 minutes as 
they discussed their woes and talked about "where we want to be as a team and 
how to get this ship righted," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite protests of "We're still in a pennant race," the Angels are apparently 
sinking, even in the weak American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a lack of effort," said Lachemann, who called the postgame meeting. 
"We're getting smoked today and (Gary) DiSarcina is still diving for balls in 
the hole in the eighth inning and Chili (Davis) is still running out ground 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were a lack of effort, it would be easy for me to scream, but it's just 
a matter of channeling that effort into more efficiency, into better focus." 
</P>
<P>
 The A's were clearly focused on Leftwich, rapping six singles, including five 
in a row, in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels drew 24,113 fans for the afternoon game, but long before the A's 
were finished, the stands were deserted. "It's possible that a team can say, 
'Here we go again,' when something like that (six-run first inning) happens," 
Angel outfielder Jim Edmonds said. "I've seen it happen in the minors. I don't 
think a team meeting can change everything overnight, but I think some good 
things were said." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are seeking a veteran closer, but maybe they're looking for help in 
the wrong place. What about some quality starts? Chuck Finley gave up six runs 
in the first two innings Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Lachemann was comparing Leftwich to Catfish Hunter while all those 
around him tried to keep a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the stuff that will knock you down, but it can be like facing 
Catfish, when you'd go a very comfortable 0 for 4," Lachemann said. "I don't 
mean he's headed for the Hall of Fame, but he's capable of that kind of 
consistency." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter won an Oakland-record 131 games, had an earned-run average of 3.01 and 
24 shutouts. Leftwich is 9-15 with the Angels and has averaged only four 
innings in his last three outings. And his one-third of an inning Wednesday was 
the shortest by an Angel starter since Hilly Hathaway failed to get an out in 
Toronto last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was mostly a case of being too fine, of worrying about whether 
they'll move a runner over with an out, of trying to keep them at zero (runs) 
and then they end up with six," Lachemann said. "But we scored two in the 
first, and it could have been four and we would have been right back in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Edmonds had run-scoring singles in the Angel first and were on third 
and second base, respectively, with only one out. But Greg Myers struck out and 
J.T. Snow grounded to third. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the third inning, Oakland led, 10-2, with the help of Geronimo 
Berroa's 437-foot, three-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his obvious pitching problems, Lachemann claims to be looking forward 
to the four-game series against the division-leading Texas Rangers that begins 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really get to the point when I'm challenged like this where I relish 
getting after it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they do, too."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; JOHNSON ERUPTS AFTER ANOTHER SEATTLE DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle pitcher Randy Johnson struck out 11 and gave up only three runs, but 
his performance still was not good enough as the Mariners lost to the Tigers, 
3-1, Wednesday at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really tired of this," said Johnson (11-6), who walked five but dropped 
to 0-5 in his career at Tiger Stadium. "I've been doing this for six years with 
this team, and I was really hoping it would be better this year. But if 
anything it is worse. Even if I won every time, this team would still be right 
where it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Fryman, a career .348 hitter against Johnson, hit a two-run home run in 
the first inning and that proved to be enough for the Tigers. Manager Sparky 
Anderson, moved into a tie with Joe McCarthy for fourth place on the career 
managerial victory list with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Fryman, who is batting .382 against Seattle this season with three homers and 
17 runs batted in, has hit four career homers against Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fun to hit off him, because he makes you concentrate so much," Fryman 
said. "You know that anything less than your best, and you'll never touch him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners avoided becoming the first team to be shut out by the Tigers this 
season in the ninth. Ken Griffey Jr. doubled to lead off the inning, stole 
third and scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 1, Texas 0 -- Pat Mahomes pitched six solid innings and the Twins' 
bullpen bailed him out of a jam in the seventh inning, making a first-inning 
RBI groundout by Kirby Puckett hold up at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the third time this season the Rangers have been blanked, 
surprising considering the Twins began the game with the worst earned-run 
average in the majors at 5.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett's one-out grounder scored Chuck Knoblauch, who opened the game with a 
double. Knoblauch also doubled in the fifth, upping his major league-leading 
total to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahomes (8-4) wasn't dominant with only two strikeouts, but in 6 2/3 innings 
he only allowed three hits and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Chicago 1 -- Brian McRae scored the go-ahead run when third 
baseman Robin Ventura bobbled Wally Joyner's grounder in the eighth inning for 
the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere held the Royals to three hits over seven innings before he was 
replaced by Kirk McCaskill (1-3) after giving up a leadoff double to Chico 
Lind. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Meacham (2-3) pitched to one batter in the eighth for the win, and Jeff 
Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Toronto 0 -- Dave Nilsson hit his second three-run home run in as 
many games and drove in four runs to lead the Brewers at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wegman (8-3) allowed four hits in seven-plus innings for the Brewers, who 
have won five of their last six road games. Mike Ignasiak completed the 
five-hit shutout with two innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Hentgen (12-7) gave up five runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, Boston 3 -- The game between the Red Sox and Yankees was suspended 
because of rain in the bottom of the eighth inning. The game will pick up at 
the point it was stopped before today's game between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston scored twice in the top of the eighth to tie, 3-3. Mike Stanley, who 
hit two homers, had singled with one out in the Yankee eighth and Bernie 
Williams was batting when play was halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley has hit seven home runs in his last 10 games and has scored a run in 
14 consecutive games, nearing the modern major league record of 18 set by Red 
Rolfe of the Yankees in 1939.

LIFELESS ANGELS PUTTING UP A BRAVE FRONT; BASEBALL: AFTER THEIR SIXTH LOSS IN A 
ROW, PLAYERS HOLD TEAM MEETING AND TALK ABOUT TRYING TO SALVAGE THE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This was the home stand that was. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were outscored, 53-19, in losing six consecutive games to the New 
York Yankees and Oakland Athletics. This after sweeping three from the Boston 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 They were close in only one of those six, but blew that one to the Yankees, 
6-4, after a four-run, ninth-inning meltdown by the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 They spent more than a week with 24 healthy players on the roster, one brick 
shy of the usual 25-man load. 
</P>
<P>
 Game, set and match. Despite continued protests, the Angels appear to be 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a 57-minute team meeting after Wednesday's 11-3 loss to the A's, 
apparently in a last-ditch effort to salvage what remains of their evaporating 
playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Postgame talk centered on rallying for a seven-game trip to Texas and Seattle, 
er, Tacoma, Wash., that begins tonight at The Ballpark in Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost four or five in a row, but (today) we've got to go out and act 
like we've won four or five in a row," shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "We've 
got to go out and show the other team we've got our act together." 
</P>
<P>
 Can you say Academy Award for best acting? 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, that's the best the Angels can produce: A facade, a brave 
front. Again on Wednesday, there seemed to be no life in their game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been miserable around here for the last four or five days," DiSarcina 
said after the Angels fell to a season-low 18 games below .500. "It just seems 
we've got to all pull in the same direction. And that's winning. We just can't 
go up there with no game plan. It's something we're all guilty of, just going 
through the motions." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the American League West that's not good enough to challenge for first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been distractions," DiSarcina said. "People expect to lose. I 
don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Into this grim scene of woe and loss, stepped a bright young prospect named 
Garret Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels called up Anderson from triple-A Vancouver to replace Tim Salmon, 
on the disabled list with a sore right hamstring, and started him in left field 
Wednesday. Anderson promptly lined out to right on the first major league pitch 
he saw, moving a runner from second to third. Later, he singled twice and made 
a couple nice running catches in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was what took the Angels so long to bring him up? 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who plays right, had been hurting since July 17, but the Angels waited 
until 10:45 p.m. Tuesday night to place him on the DL. Jim Edmonds, who plays 
left, covered ably for Salmon, but that left Bo Jackson as the everyday left 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painful sight, watching Jackson hobble around on that artificial hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Anderson got the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't control what the front office does," said Anderson, who batted .346 
with 10 home runs and 82 runs batted in in 95 games at Vancouver. "You have to 
put up some good numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about all that transpired on his first day in the big leagues, Anderson 
smiled and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to worry about the score too much, just trying to help the 
team any way I can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Wednesday's bright spot. The grim reality is that the Angels again 
failed to seize the day. Or more to the point in the past home stand, they 
failed to seize more than four victories in 13 games.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MERCKER ENDS BRAVES' SLIDE AGAINST EXPOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kent Mercker did something Wednesday that John Smoltz and Greg Maddux couldn't 
do earlier in the week -- stop the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker, Atlanta's fifth starter, pitched seven strong innings and Jeff 
Blauser hit a two-run home run as the Braves defeated Montreal, 4-1, at Atlanta 
to avoid a three-game sweep and move within 2 1/2 games of the Expos in the 
East Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's victory, only its fourth in 11 games, ended the Expos' eight-game 
winning streak, their longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to be the stopper when you're in a skid," Mercker said. "It was good 
to get the win. To be 4 1/2 games out, it wouldn't have been over, but it would 
have been much tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Cincinnati 1 -- Jeff Bagwell hit his 34th home run and singled home 
the go-ahead run in the 12th inning to lead the Astros at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell's single off Scott Service (0-2) -- his major league-leading 103rd run 
batted in -- started a six-run rally that moved the Astros into a first-place 
tie with the Reds in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bagwell did what he's done all year," said Astro Manager Terry Collins. "I 
think right now he's the best player in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros got 8 1/3 strong innings from Doug Drabek and Bagwell's fourth 
homer in four games, but had to go extra innings because of two errors by 
Andujar Cedeno. The shortstop muffed routine grounders with two outs in the 
third to let in an unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, St. Louis 4 -- Bobby Bonilla hit two two-run home runs, including 
the tiebreaking shot in a four-run eighth inning, as the Mets completed a 
three-game sweep at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, who also had a two-run homer in the fourth inning, had his 16th 
career two-homer game and his second this season. Tim Bogar added a two-run 
homer in the eighth and Ryan Thompson had a solo shot in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Jason Jacome (4-1) won his fourth straight start, working seven innings 
and allowing four runs on seven hits. He struck out five and walked four. John 
Franco pitched the ninth for his 25th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 9, Chicago 4 -- Rick White won for the first time as a major league 
starter, limiting the Cubs to two hits over six innings at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Foley had four runs batted in and three of the Pirates' 16 hits, giving 
him 11 hits in his last 18 at-bats, and Don Slaught was three for four with two 
RBIs. White (3-5) allowed an unearned run, struck out five and walked none in 
his third start. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 3, Florida 1 -- Bobby Munoz pitched a two-hitter for his first 
career complete game to help the Phillies complete a three-game sweep of the 
Marlins at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz (7-3) did not allow a walk and didn't give up a hit after Benito 
Santiago's homer with one out in the second inning. The other hit by Florida 
was Chuck Carr's single in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Rapp (6-6) took the loss, allowing eight hits and three earned runs in 
eight innings.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 9, Colorado 2 -- Eddie Williams had a three-run homer and four runs 
batted in for the Padres at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 With a chance to move into a tie with the Dodgers in the West Division, the 
Rockies dropped to third place -- a game behind the Dodgers and a half-game 
behind San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 Joey Hamilton (7-5) gave up one run and three hits in six innings and had 
seven strikeouts. Dante Bichette hit solo home runs in the first and eighth, 
giving him 25 for the season.

GOODWILL GAMES ROUNDUP; CUBA PACKS PUNCH, U.S. LACKS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cuban boxers showed their dominance during Wednesday's semifinals at the 
Goodwill Games on a night when the U.S. team fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Americans lost all three of their semifinal bouts, the Cubans went 
five for five, including a stunning five-second knockout by light-middleweight 
Juan Lemus and a devastating victory by heavyweight Felix Savon. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a day of joy and glee, we went down to nothing," said U.S. Coach Tom 
Coulter, one day after the Americans had gone 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointment began when light-flyweight Albert Guardado of Topeka, Kan., 
was outpointed by Joon-Wook Choi of South Korea, 8-5. Then, Eric Morel of 
Madison, Wis., also a light-flyweight, was routed by Manuel Mantilla of Cuba, 
19-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Then lightweight and team captain Larry Nicholson of Tyler, Tex., was defeated 
by Heiko Hinz of Germany, 16-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson crumpled over during the second round when the German appeared to 
land a low blow, but the officials failed to see it that way and Hinz was not 
penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beat me with some illegal shots," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the failures, Coulter was not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have six fighters going," he said. "And we will get at least one 
fighter into the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Middleweights Shane Swartz and Stephen Beets will meet in one semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 While American boxers were faltering, the usually powerful Cubans showed their 
skills are not diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Their two most impressive boxers were Lemus and Savon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemus needed only one punch -- a straight right to the face -- to knock out 
Dirk Dzemski of Germany. Savon took only 1:21 to stop Peer Muller, also of 
Germany, knocking him down with an overhand right. WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team was eliminated from medal contention, losing to Russia, 9-4. In 
other games, Spain and Italy played to a 1-1 tie and Spain defeated Hungary's B 
team, 15-7. TEAM HANDBALL 
</P>
<P>
 France scored seven of the last nine goals to upset Russia, 22-20, for the 
gold medal. Spain defeated South Korea for the bronze. TAEKWONDO 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Thorpe of Edmond, Okla., was the only winner for the United States, 
taking the gold medal in the women's 121-pound class with a 2-1 decision over 
Kim Mi-sun of South Korea. Clayton Barber of Colorado Springs lost to South 
Korea's Lee Jun-hee in the men's 141-pound final. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kelly, Goodwill Games president, said that Games mile champion Noureddine 
Morceli was one of several athletes paid extra money for exceptional 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Linford Christie, sidelined by an injured left hamstring, should be 
ready for the European Championships, which begin Aug. 7 at Helsinki.

LOCAL NOTES: FULLERTON'S NOE, PARK QUALIFY FOR MATCH PLAY AT USGA JUNIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Noe and Jin Park, both of Fullerton, qualified Wednesday for match play 
in the USGA Junior Amateur Championships at Echo Lake Country Club in 
Westfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey McGraw of Fullerton shot par 72, then won a five-hole playoff for

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: SUZUKA RACE LAWSON'S LAST ON MOTORCYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Lawson, one of the greatest motorcycle road racers, will make his final 
competitive appearance on a two-wheeler Sunday in the Suzuka eight-hour 
endurance test in Japan -- but it will not be the last race for the 36-year-old 
rider from Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson switched from motorcycles to cars two years ago and is driving for the 
Tasman Motor Sports team in the Indy Lights series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having so much fun driving my Indy Lights car, I'm anxious to get to 
where I'm in an Indy car running the 500," he said from his hotel in Suzuka 
City. "I've accomplished all I could in motorcycle racing, but I'm only 
beginning in cars." 
</P>
<P>
 So why is he in Japan to race a Yamaha on the twisting 3.5-mile course where 
Formula One cars race? 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, it's because Yamaha offered me enough money for a two-race 
deal, here and Daytona, to help finance my Indy Lights car this year," Lawson 
said. "I really hadn't planned on racing after the Suzuka race last year until 
Yamaha came around with some big money." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson has won 500cc Grand Prix world championships in 1984, '86, '88 and '89; 
U.S. Superbike championships in 1981 and '82, 31 world championship Grand Prix 
races, two Daytona 200s, in 1986 and '93, and the 1990 Suzuka eight-hour race 
</P>
<P>
 The Suzuka eight-hour is considered the No. 1 motorcycle race in the world, 
with more than 250,000 spectators expected to line the course. During the 
event, each bike has two riders, who alternate riding an hour at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather talk about my first Indy Lights win (two weeks ago) in Cleveland," 
said Lawson, who also has three second-place finishes in seven races and is 
second to teammate Steve Robertson in the season standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Horne and the Tasman team are great, and their cars are absolutely 
fantastic. I'm in the one Bryan Herta drove last year when he won the 
championship, and I couldn't ask for any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson is in only his second season of four-wheel racing. As soon as the 
Suzuka race is over, he will return to Tasman headquarters in Hilliard, Ohio, 
and begin preparations for the next Indy Lights race, Aug. 14 at Mid-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he finished third in the Daytona 200 last March, Lawson has been on a 
racing bike only once, for a day of testing last month in Suzuka. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get out on the track this week and don't expect any problems," he said. 
"The bike was really fast when I rode it before and it won't take long to get 
in my motorcycle mode. Fortunately, even though we're on the same Formula One 
course where the cars race, the attitudes of the two machines are so different 
that there is no problem in adapting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do so much with body English on a bike when you have a problem, but 
with a car you just have to sit there. The braking is so much deeper with a car 
and the corner speeds are much higher, but the feeling is entirely different 
coming out of a corner. A GP bike accelerates so fast, it makes the Indy Lights 
feel like it's just creeping along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a lot of fun Sunday. I'll have a lot of emotions thinking 
about it being my last race, but I won't really think about what it means until 
it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 What puzzles Lawson most is the difference in finances. To ride a motorcycle, 
he is being paid $250,000 for two races. To drive a car, he has to pay that 
much for half a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no different from most of the other guys who want to race cars," he said. 
"You've got to bring money to get a ride. The trick is to catch someone's 
attention who has money." 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- The fourth round of the Frontier Toyota sportsman championship 
series will be held Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, with drivers from other 
tracks battling the Saugus regulars in a 75-lap main event. Mark Wilson, from 
Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield, is leading; Saugus veteran Ron Daniels is 
second. A destruction derby will cap the evening. . . . Mesa Marin will have a 
double attraction Saturday night when the NASCAR SuperTruck series makes its 
debut with a 20-lap exhibition race along with a Featherlite Southwest Tour 
main event. P. J. Jones will drive a Ford truck for Scoop Vessels' team. . . . 
The Coors Light Silver Bullet series will resume Friday night at Ventura 
Raceway. . . . Racing is also scheduled Saturday night at Cajon Speedway in El 
Cajon, Blythe Speedway, Kern County Raceway in Willow Springs, Temecula 
Motorsports Park and the new Sunrise Valley Raceway in Adelanto. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEEDWAY BIKES -- After two weeks off, the Orange County Fairgrounds track in 
Costa Mesa will open its summer season Friday night with handicap and scratch 
racing. . . . Lake Perris Speedway will reopen Saturday night with an unusual 
two-lap match race pitting former U.S. speedway champion Mike Faria, on his 
speedway bike, against U.S. Supercross champion Jeremy McGrath, on his Honda 
motocross bike. . . . Speedway USA in Victorville will be dark until Aug. 13 
because of the San Bernardino County fair. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- The Sprint Car Racing Assn. will be at Ventura Raceway Saturday 
night, sharing the program with California dwarf cars. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- When Kevin Schwantz won the British Grand Prix last Sunday, it 
snapped the winning streak of Australia's Mick Doohan, who won his sixth 
straight world championship road race at LeMans, France. It was the longest 
consecutive streak since 1971 when Italy's Giacomo Agostini won eight in a row. 
But it is a long way from a Grand Prix record. Agostini won 20 straight, 10 in 
1968 followed by 10 in '69. The U.S. Grand Prix will be held on Sept. 11 at 
Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 OFF-ROAD -- Rumors that the Mickey Thompson stadium series has been canceled 
are not true, series director Danny Thompson said. What led to the rumor was a 
three-month lapse in the schedule, caused by the cancellation of a race in 
Detroit. Remaining are events scheduled on Oct. 1 at Las Vegas and on Oct. 8 at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAG RACING -- Former baseball star Jack Clark failed to qualify his top fuel 
dragster in his National Hot Rod Assn. debut last week at Denver, but he will 
try again this weekend in the Autolite Nationals at Sears Point Raceway in 
Sonoma, near his hometown of Danville. 
</P>
<P>
 AWARDS -- Max Muhleman, who founded Muhleman Marketing 22 years ago in Los 
Angeles, has been named to Advertising Age's Marketing 100, a list of the top 
marketing executives in the United States. Muhleman, who directed Charlotte's 
successful bidding for NFL and NBA franchises, has handled marketing projects 
for many race teams and events.

DIGEST: SAUGUS TO SCRAP SPORTSMAN RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saugus Speedway announced plans Wednesday to eliminate the Sportsman Division 
during the 1995 racing season because of increasing costs and dwindling 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Late Model Division will be created and will take over as the 
elite division at Saugus. The Late Model Division will be formed from the 
current Pro Stock Division but will feature late-model bodies on a stock 
chassis, according to Ray Wilkings, track general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sportsman Division is suffering from cost escalation and the car count is 
graphic evidence of this," Wilkings said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new division, the bodies of the cars, all from 1990 or later, will be 
similar to those on the NASCAR Southwest and Northwest tours. Engines will 
remain stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pure Stock Division also will be established for entry-level drivers. The 
division will consist of American-made passenger cars with little modification 
except for safety-related equipment. The Grand American Modified, Street Stock 
and Mini-Stock divisions will return for 1995, Wilkings said. Golf

<P>
 Darren Angel of Northridge and Brandon DiTullio of Thousand Oaks survived the 
36-hole cut Wednesday at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship in Westfield, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel and DiTullio made the cut of 153 at the 6,704-yard Echo Lake Country 
Club. The 156-player field was trimmed to the low 64, who advanced to match 
play, which begins with two rounds today. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, a senior at Granada Hills High, shot a six-over-par 78 to finish the 
stroke-play portion of the event in a five-way tie for 17th place at 147. 
Angel, playing in his second U.S. Junior Amateur, missed the cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
 DiTullio, a senior at Westlake High, shot 78 and finished in a five-way tie 
for 32nd at 150. 
</P>
<P>
 "My iron play wasn't very good," DiTullio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Henderson of Raleigh, N.C., was the medalist at 70-69 -- 139. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, Angel faces Richard Topping of Laurel, Md. Topping shot 
78-73 -- 151. DiTullio faces Josh Levin of San Francisco, who shot 72-74 -- 146 
to finish in a tie for 13th.

WHITTINGHAM HAS NUMEROUS SUCCESS STORIES; DEL MAR: TRAINER'S $1.7-MILLION COLT 
IS IMPRESSIVE IN GRASS DEBUT. STEVENS AND RASH WIN BOTH HALVES OF OCEANSIDE 
STAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Rodney Rash and jockey Gary Stevens may have swept the Oceanside 
Stakes with Powis Castle and Saltgrass as Del Mar opened its 55th season 
Wednesday, but the 3-year-old to beat on grass at the seaside course will be 
Numerous, who made a convincing turf debut while stragglers in the record-crowd 
of 34,697 were still looking for parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third race of the humid, 75-degree afternoon, Numerous stalked Foreign 
Merger early and then held off Golden Slewpy through the stretch, despite a 
repeated tendency of trying to pull himself up once he takes the lead. That's a 
bad habit that another good horse of trainer Charlie Whittingham's had. His 
name was Ferdinand and he won the Kentucky Derby in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, a $1.7-million yearling purchase by Howard Keck, whose former wife 
raced Ferdinand, won the Derby Trial, but Whittingham had another colt, Strodes 
Creek, ready to run in the Derby and saved Numerous for the Preakness. Besides 
drawing the outside post in a 10-horse field at Pimlico, Numerous carried Pat 
Valenzuela in the direction of the grandstand as they left the gate and 
finished a well-beaten fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham was going to run Numerous in a $100,000 race in New York the same 
day as the Belmont Stakes, but that plan failed when the Mr. Prospector colt 
suffered a stone bruise. Back at Hollywood Park, Whittingham began training 
Numerous on the grass, because of sensitive feet and because his dam, Number, 
knew how to run on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a tough grass horse," Whittingham said of Numerous. "If you 
put horses on the grass, they last longer. This is a nice horse, very athletic 
looking. The Del Mar Derby (a $300,000 grass race on Sept. 5) is very much a 
possibility, but he's also nominated for the Pacific Classic (a $1-million dirt 
race on Aug. 13), and we'll consider that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous won by 1 3/4 lengths over Golden Slewpy, who hadn't raced since last 
summer. When Numerous started pulling himself up, Chris McCarron went to a 
left-handed whip to get him going again. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham would have entered Numerous in the Oceanside, but because of the 
colt's victory at Churchill Downs, he couldn't satisfy the conditions of the 
stake. Numerous ran his mile race in 1:35 4/5, much faster than either Powis 
Castle or Saltgrass in their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle won for the first time in 7 1/2 months with a powerful stretch 
run that left him three-quarters of a length ahead of City Nights at the wire. 
Like Numerous, Powis Castle was making his first start on grass for Rash, a 
former Whittingham assistant, and the opening half of the Oceanside was his 
first outing since he was eighth in the Kentucky Derby and ninth in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Switching Powis Castle to grass) is the Charlie coming out in me," Rash 
said. "Whenever Charlie got a good horse, he couldn't wait to run all of them 
on grass." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, who has won at least a share of the divided Oceanside four out of the 
last five years, was aboard Powis Castle for the first time. The son of Rare 
Brick had been winless in four starts since Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown 
Records, bought him the day after he won a minor stake at Turfway Park in 
December. The race that caught Rash's attention this winter at Santa Anita was 
Powis Castle's strong second in the San Rafael Stakes behind Tabasco Cat, who 
went on to win the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally got a jockey who rode him right," said Roger Campbell, who manages 
Gordy's stable. "You've got to sit off the pace with this horse, and wait and 
wait, and then he'll give you that one big explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 After Powis Castle's victory, a nervous Rash kept looking at the tote board, 
expecting the stewards' "Inquiry" sign to be flashed 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse is still green and dumb," Rash said after the result was declared 
official. "I guess they're not doing any inquiries today. I thought that 
Numerous might have come in a little in his race too. I guess that what they 
figured was all right for Charlie was all right for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The day wasn't devoid of disqualifications, however, and the horse moved down 
a notch by the stewards was Ocean Crest, after he had finished third while 
interfering with Rapan in the stretch of the other division of the Oceanside. 
Rapan, who finished fourth before being moved up to third, was trying to rally 
between Saltgrass and Ocean Crest when Ocean Crest and Garrett Gomez came out 
from the fence, costing Rapan and Alex Solis the chance to get through. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltgrass, a son of Woodman and Papochino, was bred and is raced by Bob 
Hibbert, the Houston oilman who won the Oceanside with Sky Gipsy II in 1960, 
and raced Roving Boy, the country's champion 2-year-old colt, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Powis Castle, Saltgrass was accustomed to grass before Wednesday, but 
had finished second in all five of his turf starts. He lost three races by the 
combined margins of one length and a nose earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle and Saltgrass were both favored, paying respective win prices of 
$6 and $5.40. Saltgrass beat the filly Twice the Vice by one length. Stevens 
wound up with three winners for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of waiting for the $300,000 Ramona Handicap on Aug. 6, Rodney Rash has 
entered the European champion User Friendly in a 1 1/16-mile grass race on 
Friday. "This is her first start in the U.S.," Rash said, "and I wanted an 
easier spot rather than running against horses like Flawlessly and Hollywood 
Wildcat right away.". . . Friday's race drew four other entrants -- Viviana, 
Miss Turkana, Empress Club and Lyphard's Delta. . . . Chris Antley, whose 
five-day suspension from Hollywood Park was supposed to start at Del Mar 
Thursday, has obtained a court stay and will continue riding. . . . Chris 
McCarron suffered a bruised and sprained right ankle when his mount in the 
sixth race, Fly'n Ogygian, flipped in the gate. McCarron's X-rays were 
negative, but it wasn't known whether he will ride today. Fly'n Ogygian was 
scratched. . . . The 10-horse field of 2-year-old colts, many of them making 
their first start, was being loaded for the five-furlong race when it was 
discovered that the gate was positioned a sixteenth-of-a-mile too far up the 
backstretch. Those horses had to be unloaded and the field stood on the track 
for several more minutes while the tractor moved the gate into the correct 
spot. Fly'n Ogygian flipped after the second loading attempt. . . . The largest 
attendance in Del Mar history broke the record of 29,856 that was set on 
opening day in 1987.

MOVIE REVIEW; A MAGICAL 'MASK' SENDS IN THE CLOWN; THE FILM'S STAR, JIM CARREY, 
IS ADEPT AT PHYSICAL HUMOR AND HAS A LIKABLE SCREEN PRESENCE. AND INDUSTRIAL 
LIGHT & MAGIC'S SPECIAL-EFFECTS TRICKS ARE SOMETHING TO SEE.

<P>
 This is the summer Hollywood has decided Cartoons-R-Us. First "The 
Flintstones" had actors re-create cartoon roles, then "The Lion King" offered 
pure animation, and now comes "The Mask," in which a flesh-and-blood performer 
is turned into an elastic, living cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the early buzz about "The Mask" involved the wizardly 
computer-generated special effects that allow kick-sand-in-my-face bank clerk 
Stanley Ipkiss to turn into an off-kilter superhero whose India rubber body 
contorts like Spiderman and absorbs punishment like something out of Looney 
Tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, masterminded by the imps at Industrial Light & Magic, who ought to just 
wrap the visual effects Oscar and take it home, the tricks in "The Mask" are 
something to see. When the Mask's body recovers from being flattened like a 
tortilla and his eyes literally pop out at the sight of a beautiful woman, 
audience eyes are likely to roll as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite all this technology it is heartening to report that "The Mask's" 
sine qua non, the factor it would be hard-pressed to live without, is the actor 
who plays both the cartoon and alter ego Ipkiss, Jim Carrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known as the lucky man whose salary made a Roadrunner leap to millions 
per picture after the unexpected success of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," 
Carrey is revealed here as a comic actor of charm and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is he adept at physical humor, the kind of knockabout stuff that 
recalls the classic silent clowns, but Carrey also has a bright and likable 
screen presence, a lost puppy quality that is surprisingly endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he plays the Mask, wearing a supple and non-confining latex facial 
apparatus designed by Greg Cannom, Carrey displays a manic side as well, doing 
riffs from old movies and dishy impersonations of everyone from Elvis to Clint 
Eastwood to Sally Field accepting her Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all these amusing elements, it may not matter very much that "The Mask" 
runs out of energy faster than its star does. Though director Charles Russell 
knows how to keep things loose and playful, the movie doesn't aspire to be more 
than a gaudy showcase for Carrey's ability and ILM's magic, and anyone looking 
for something else is open to disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 In line with this, Mike Werb's screenplay, based on a story by Michael Fallon 
and Mark Verdeiden and before that on a comic-book character, is less a sturdy 
narrative than an extended premise on which all these assorted antics can be 
hung like ornaments on a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-Mask Ipkiss lives and works in Edge City and wonders why nice guys 
finish last. A shy pushover and dupe whose primary emotional attachment is to 
his clever terrier Milo (one of the more entertaining of recent dog 
performances), Ipkiss just about stops breathing when sultry Tina Carlyle 
(Cameron Diaz) stops by his desk at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A headliner at the chic Coco Bongo Club, Tina is also the girlfriend of 
mobster Dorian Tyrel (Peter Greene), but Ipkiss can't get her out of his mind. 
And though the movie presents Tina as little more than the scantily clad 
physical embodiment of Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica, model Diaz, in her first 
screen role, has enough presence to help us see past the tinsel. 
</P>
<P>
 At a particularly morose point in his life, Ipkiss comes across a nondescript 
green wooden mask, which, he later learns, is probably of Scandinavian origin 
and carved to represent Loki, the Norse god of mischief, permanently banned 
from Valhalla for his pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, when Ipkiss puts the mask on, havoc breaks loose. 
Normally timid, he becomes an amoral live wire out of one of the Tex Avery 
cartoons he admires, a party animal with a face the color of key lime pie 
capable of robbing banks and whirling off like a pastel tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 That robbery aside, the Mask isn't really a bad guy, and his most memorable 
moments are song-and-dance riffs so antic that in interviews Carrey has taken 
to calling his character "Fred Astaire on acid." Whether passionately twirling 
with Tina in a canary-yellow ensemble, playing the maniac French boulevardier 
in beret and loud pants or turning a SWAT team into a conga line with his Cuban 
Pete impersonation, Carrey is a treat on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one wants to look this kind of gift horse in the mouth, it is hard to 
watch "The Mask" without wishing its pluses were attached to a story even a 
trifle more inventive or involving. But in the glory days of Cartoons-R-Us, 
that is an awful lot to ask. 
</P>

 Arts Partnership: The Los Angeles City Council's arts panel has recommended 
approval of a partnership in which local cultural groups would help run five 
municipal arts centers -- including the Los Angeles Photography Center and 
North Hollywood's Lankershim Arts Center -- which have had their budgets 
slashed in recent years. Pending full council approval, each center will be run 
by a consortium of two or more arts groups. At Lankershim, the newly formed 
Community Arts Coalition -- comprising the Road Theatre Company, Martin 
Dancers, Los Angeles Printmaking Society and Synthaxis Theatre Company -- plans 
to organize classes, performances, workshops, exhibitions and festivals, while 
Urban Pride Inc. plans similar fare, but also in Spanish and Korean, at the 
Photo Center. Also covered in the plan is management of the Encino Photography 
Center (which will become the Encino Media and Animation Center), Arroyo Seco 
Art in the Park and Tujunga's McGroarty Arts Center.

 Senate Approves NEA Cut: The Senate has approved a 5% cut in the 1995 National 
Endowment for the Arts budget, higher than the House's recommended 2% cut, 
which means a House-Senate conference committee must now hammer out a 
compromise budget. The Senate version, which would drop the NEA's budget to 
$161.6 million, targets the cuts to three specific programs -- visual arts, 
theater and presenting programs -- effectively slashing those programs' budgets 
by 40%.

Wednesday, leading with the word that it roared past the $200-million mark at 
the nation's box office Tuesday in 33 days, becoming the second-fastest movie 
(behind "Jurassic Park") to reach that distinction. Meanwhile, on the nation's 
pop chart, the film's soundtrack remained in the No. 1 spot, selling 294,984 
units. Another soundtrack, from Paramount's "Forrest Gump," moved into 
Billboard's No. 3 spot with sales of 132,474. Rap also fared particularly well 
on the Billboard chart this week, taking three of the top 10 spots. MC Eiht's

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SPANKING': AN OFFBEAT, DARING DIRECTORIAL DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Spanking the Monkey," the first feature by writer-director David O. Russell, 
is an odd choice for a debut film -- even by the odd standards of American 
independent cinema. It's a whimsical black comedy about incest, and it never 
lets up. The matter-of-factness of Russell's approach is harrowing and also -- 
this is the odd, daring part -- funny. He keeps his camera on an even keel as 
he dispassionately records the wayward passions of his people. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Aibelli (Jeremy Davies) is an MIT freshman who is called home from a 
summer internship with the Surgeon General to care for his bedridden mother 
(Alberta Watson) while his errant traveling salesman father (Benjamin 
Hendrickson) conveniently hits the road. Ray is miserable about the change in 
his summer plans; he doesn't want to be back in the suburbs, which he's been 
trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 He's trying to escape his parents, too. His father, who gives the boy 
boot-camplike instructions about taking care of the dog, his mother and the 
car, has no feeling for Ray's ambitions to become a doctor. His mother, Susan, 
her leg in a cast, lolls about her bedroom like a blitzed empress. As if for 
sport -- to relieve the boredom -- she moves closer and closer to Ray's 
privacies. She asks him to scrub her back, to prop her up while she takes a 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray seems alternately blank-faced and razor-sharp. He's the kind of very 
bright science maven who doesn't comprehend his own emotional circuitry. 
Russell makes us recognize the boy's conflicts even as Ray doesn't; we watch as 
he moves imperceptibly, inevitably toward his mother's clutches. 
</P>
<P>
 What Ray and his mother do, along with its repercussions, is presented as 
all-of-a-piece with the Aibelli's larger human comedy. It's the logical 
extension of the sultry love-hate horror at the heart of the family's 
functional dysfunctionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray is sexually unawakened prior to his woozy, boozy encounter with his 
mother. He masturbates in the bathroom -- spanking the monkey is slang for 
masturbation -- while the family dog scratches at the door. He has a tingly 
tussle with a local high school girl (Carla Gallo) that leads to something a 
bit more ferocious than either of them bargained for. But his mother -- she's 
such a casual monster -- wades right into the boy's Oedipal entanglements. She 
gives him her version of a college tutorial. He gets his summer internship.  
</P>
<P>
 Russell has an adept visual sense but what really distinguishes "Spanking the 
Monkey" is the acting. Russell is unusual among first-time directors in his 
ability to mold and shape performance. Ray isn't some goggle-eyed twerp; he's a 
quirky, funny boy in pain. His mother is in pain, too, which she inflicts with 
abandon -- with innocence, almost -- on her son. Davies and Watson are both 
extraordinary. They're like a creepy Jean Cocteau couple in home-grown suburbia 
U.S.A. The ending of "Spanking the Monkey" is a large letdown, and the film 
could be even wiggier and more disturbing, but it's much more than a promising 
first feature. Russell bears watching.

MUSIC REVIEW; RHAPSODIC HUNGARIANS BRING BIT OF BUDAPEST TO BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Budapest Festival Orchestra, which made its U.S. debut on Tuesday with the 
first of four different programs at the Hollywood Bowl, isn't the 
smoothest-running symphonic apparatus in the world. It doesn't pretend to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed only 11 years ago, the ensemble didn't begin full-time operations until 
1992. Although the youthful players assembled by conductor Ivan Fischer don't 
seem to make finesse a primary goal, they do muster a lot of gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the right conditions, a lot of gusto can go a long way. The conditions 
were right, for the most part, on this occasion. Our rhapsodic Hungarian 
visitors exuded warmth and sincerity that often compensated for rough technical 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowl hardly provides an ideal acoustical showcase for any orchestra these 
days. The amplified sound tends toward dullness, and the microphones exaggerate 
the separation of choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to gauge how the Budapest band might sound in an indoor 
concert hall. In the wide open spaces, the strings seemed resonant, the brass 
raucous and the winds thin. Precision of articulation tended to give way to 
cozy approximation -- a performance practice the Germans like to call 
Schlamperei.  
</P>
<P>
 Opening-night nerves may have taken their toll. Still, the spirits were 
willing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless one counts the elegiac Hungarian anthem that followed a very stately 
"Star-Spangled Banner," the introductory agenda avoided native impulses until 
encore time. Even then, with two Hungarian Dances of Brahms, the nationalism 
came second-hand. At least a little Liszt was scheduled for Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who first appeared with the Los Angeles Philharmonic back in 1983, is 
something of an old-fashioned romanticist. He favors sentimental rhetoric and 
broad tempos, especially when cadences loom. He also savors the impact of 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 He may allow certain transitions to sag. He invariably rises, however, to the 
zonking climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many a more famous maestro, he doesn't seem to take much for granted 
when riding tired warhorses to battle. That's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be especially good in a program that began -- blithely -- 
with the hum-along platitudes of Schubert's "Rosamunde" overture and ended -- 
grandly -- with the familiar convolutions of Brahms' Symphony No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The fun came in between, thanks to the soloist, Lynn Harrell. The American 
cellist made an appropriately elegant and silly escapade of Haydn's Concerto in 
C, Hob. VIIb:1, interpolating his own wildly comic cadenza in the opening 
movement. Then, equally inspired, he played Tchaikovsky's "Rococo" Variations 
with mock nonchalance that masked bravura complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 In both challenges, his tone was rich, his expressive scale mellow, his range 
of dynamic nuance subtle. Too bad the amplification system destroyed any 
semblance of natural balance, exaggerating the cello at the expense of the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * A program insert memorialized Rudolf Firkusny, grand seigneur of the 
keyboard, who died last week at 82. A musical tribute would have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 * The attendance figure was officially tabulated at a modest 7,964 (the Bowl 
can accommodate as much as 18,000). The concert, occasionally embellished with 
police-siren obbligatos, also attracted 11 noisy airplanes and one friendly 
skunk.

ART REVIEWS; VISTAS CAPTURED IN BLURRY TRACES OF LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The palette and format of Tom Lieber's abstract paintings at Koplin Gallery 
evoke the natural landscape, recalling that the roots of a major branch of 
American abstraction run back to nature, where sweeping, panoramic views and 
breathtaking vistas seem to happen by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning that the artist splits his time between a redwood forest north of San 
Francisco and a summer home on an island in Maine adds to the impression that 
he is a painter of the great outdoors. Yet, a restless, urban energy pulses 
through Lieber's highly traditional compositions, giving them enough tension to 
ensure that they are more than nostalgic visits to an outdated style. 
</P>
<P>
 The luminous flashes and burning lights that shine forth from his otherwise 
subdued, mist-saturated canvases look like the tail lights of distant cars on 
rain-soaked city streets. Even Lieber's calligraphic brush strokes possess the 
whiplash pace of the city, echoing the swift movement of traffic as it switches 
directions in split-seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The impersonality of these scribbled, gestural flourishes distinguishes 
Lieber's paintings from their Expressionist forebears. The freewheeling sweeps 
of his paintbrush don't lead viewers back to a hidden, secret self, but out 
toward an accessible realm of shared, social space. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't difficult to imagine that Lieber's images are the juicy, painterly 
versions of photographs made over long exposures, or when the camera itself is 
subjected to jerky movements. All three techniques cause the visible world to 
dissolve into blurry traces of light. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieber's fluid landscapes give substantial shape to the intersection between 
expressions and impressions, revealing that painting and viewing travel on the 
same two-way street, and often catch you looking in both directions at once.

 Aggressive Banality: Covered with wads of paper pulp, clusters of cigarette 
butts, a fuzzy toilet-seat pad, macrame, macaroni and paint squirted through 
cake frosters, Randy Wray's four abstract paintings at Christopher Grimes 
Gallery seem to embrace a voracious, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink 
inclusiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost anything that isn't too heavy and might be found in a middle-class home 
is stuck to their tacky surfaces. Plastered with doilies, tie-dyed fabrics, 
braided hair extensions and the little cushions that pad the corns on people's 
feet, Wray's canvases have instantaneous appeal. They function like giant 
sheets of fly-paper. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the young, New York-based artist's aggressive mixes of media lack the 
vitality suggested by their outlandish inventories of materials. Visually, 
these pieces don't hold your eyes for much longer than a glance. It is as if 
Wray has forgotten that viewers are more complicated than flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon you begin to feel that you've seen all this before. Wray's images too 
explicitly imitate 1970s Pattern and Decoration painting. They are also too 
heavily indebted to a cliched version of collage and a lightweight 
interpretation of assemblage. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling domestic leftovers is easier than reinvigorating past styles of art. 
Far from being inclusive explorations of unexpected materials, Wray's works 
turn out to be tight-fisted revisions of earlier art forms. His paintings fail 
to hide their art-school opportunism under thick layers of stuff.

 Life's Intermissions: Uta Barth makes captivating photographs of the spaces 
between things. Even more remarkably, her beautiful little pictures at Domestic 
Setting seem to take place in the uneventful time between ordinary incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Inhabiting dead time and consisting of almost nothing but negative space, 
Barth's images of plain, white walls are often just barely interrupted by an 
out-of-focus window sill, a curtain's edge, a section of molding, a picture 
frame or a bookshelf's corner. At first glance, her pictures resemble snapshots 
made by mistake, when the camera was aimed away from its intended subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Barth's seemingly random photographs are beautifully composed. Impeccably 
mounted on handsome wood panels, her Ektacolor prints embody a solid sense of 
deliberation. Their rich, creamy tones and masterful treatment of ambient light 
give them the palpability and presence of accomplished monochrome paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 These blurry pictures of nothing in particular are visual analogues to 
inattentiveness. By inviting the viewer to focus on background information that 
is usually ignored, Barth elicits an intriguing type of attention, in which 
incidental details are more persuasive than whatever is at the center of your 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hypnotic images recall Gerhard Richter's representational paintings that 
have been carefully smeared to give them the appearance of unfocused 
photographs. Likewise, Barth's entrancing photographs emphasize the 
malleability of memory, asking you to decide if their realism is accurate, 
artificial or somewhere in the middle.

 Redefining the Original: The exhibition "Changing Times: A Historical Survey 
of the Mixografia Workshop, 1969-1994" presents more than 65 prints, multiples, 
copper bas-reliefs and sculptures in an impressive, almost overwhelming 
demonstration that editions are not mass-produced duplicates of original works 
of art, but complex media with qualities and properties all their own. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, the exhibition at the newly relocated Remba Gallery dispels the 
notion that prints are inexpensive copies meant to popularize the messages and 
pleasures of elitist art forms. The desire to ensure that printmaking is a fine 
art, on equal footing with painting and sculpture, unites the diverse works in 
the sprawling summer show. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface texture and three-dimensional volume distinguish the editions produced 
by the Mixografia Workshop, which Luis and Lea Remba began in Mexico City in 
1969 and expanded to Los Angeles in 1984. In response to a request made by 
Rufino Tamayo, who had been invited to produce a print at their workshop, Luis 
Remba invented a process that employs beeswax instead of stone, freeing prints 
from the flatness to which they had been restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Remba extended this technique to casting, developing a method to produce 
high-definition reliefs in copper. Examples by Henry Moore, Jonathan Borofsky, 
Robert Graham and Arman demonstrate the flexibility of the unique "Mixocast" 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some works on paper approach the three-dimensionality usually associated with 
sculpture, including Luis Nishizawa's fish that resemble fossils, Pedro 
Friedeberg's imprinted keys, Larry Rivers' cut-out reliefs and Costas Tsoclis' 
illusionistic rocks. 
</P>

 More than half the works in the show were made in the last five years, 
suggesting that the exhibition is less a historical overview than a survey of 
the various uses to which different artists put a technical invention, which 
effectively blurs the boundaries between so-called originals and secondary 
prints.

BACK TO BASICS: THE CHILLY BAVARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cool, creamy Bavarian and hot summer days -- a dynamite pairing made even 
better when fresh summer fruit is added. The texture of the chilled dessert 
teams well with peaches, nectarines, plums or berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla-flavored Bavarian cream makes an excellent foil for the fruit, but for 
variety you can reduce the extract and substitute fruit juice, liqueur or wine 
for part of the milk. Berries or small pieces of fruit can also be folded into 
the cream mixture before gelling. 
</P>
<P>
 For a dramatic presentation, chill the Bavarian cream mixture in a decorative 
mold or parfait glasses. Layering or marbling two different colors of custard 
is equally attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Bavarian cream recipes call for folding beaten egg whites into the 
cooked custard along with the whipped cream. Due to concern over salmonella, 
updated versions omit the raw egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The yolks are cooked with gelatin, sugar and milk until the mixture coats the 
back of a metal spoon (Step 1). 
</P>
<P>
 After removing from the heat, vanilla is stirred in and the mixture is cooled, 
then chilled, stirring occasionally, until it mounds when dropped from a spoon 
(Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Sweetened whipped cream is folded into the custard mixture (Step 3) before it 
is poured into a decorative mold (Step 4), which has been coated with vegetable 
spray. Chill at least three to four hours overnight before unmolding -- 
overnight is preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip the mold briefly in warm water before unmolding onto a platter (Step 5) or 
serving dish. Garnish with fresh fruit just before serving. VANILLA BAVARIAN 
CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 envelope unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 3 egg yolks, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh fruit 
</P>
<P>
 Combine sugar, gelatin and milk in top of double boiler. Heat over simmering 
water until steaming hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir small amount of hot mixture into egg yolks. Add back to remaining hot 
mixture and cook, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes or until mixture coats back of metal 
spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool, then chill, stirring occasionally, 
until mixture mounds when dropped from spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Whip cream with powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Fold into custard 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour into 1 quart mold coated with vegetable spray or 6 to 8 custard cups or 
parfait glasses. Chill 3 to 4 hours or overnight until firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Unmold onto platter or serving dishes. Garnish with fresh fruit. Makes 6 to 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : To vary flavor, vanilla may be reduced to 1 teaspoon and 1/2 cup fruit 
juice, liqueur or wine may be substituted for part of milk. Berries or chopped 
fruit may be folded into custard mixture before chilling.

 DEAR SOS: I've lost my recipe for tabbouleh salad you published a few years 
ago. The premise was that most tabbouleh recipes were heavier with wheat than 
parsley. Your recipe called for a higher proportion of parsley and it was 
perfect. Please search your files for this recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- REGINA 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR REGINA: Every cook has his or her own preference for the proportion of 
wheat to parsley in this ancient Middle Eastern salad that is ideal for a 
summer table. Here is a tabbouleh we published with a higher proportion of 
greens to wheat. We like it, too. TABBOULEH 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fine bulgur wheat 
</P>

<P>
 Place drained wheat in bowl and add parsley, green onions, chopped tomatoes, 
mint, basil, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve garnished with endive leaves and tomato and lemon wedges. Makes 8 
servings.

 On its 30th anniversary July 1, Restaurants & Institutions Magazine published 
its annual list of the largest outfits that feed the public. No real surprises 
-- they're McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, Taco Bell, 
Hardee's, two institutional feeders (ARA Services and Marriott Management 
Services), Dairy Queen. The interesting thing was to compare the top 10 in the 
magazine's first year. Half the 1964 list was governmental: four military food 
services and the USDA lunch program. The rest included ARA, McDonald's (which 
was only No. 10), Bob's Big Boy (now No. 30), Howard Johnson (now No. 256) and 
F.W. Woolworth (now No. 264). Don't Try This With a Sore Throat, Kids

 As of July 31, the 45-year-old California Raisin Advisory Board will no longer 
exist, due to irreconcilable differences among raisin packers about the 
fairness of the fees they were required to pay. This means, of course, no more

memorabilia you can, they'll be collectable. Ride 'em, Genghis!

 Mongolian barbecue -- that '70s fad of all-you-can-eat stir-fry -- is not the 
traditional cuisine of Mongolia, which runs instead to things like horsemeat 
jerky boiled in fermented horse milk. (Would this be a good time to mention 
that the original name of Mongolia's capital, before it became Ulan Bator, was 
Yihee Huree?) The Inner Pan

 A new wrinkle, as it were, in the meatloaf pan: a perforated porcelain rack 
(in effect, a pan within a pan) with lift-out handles. The manufacturers say 
this lets fatty juices drain off during cooking, but what they really like to 
emphasize is the way it lifts out for serving, so you don't have to scrape the 
sides of the pan while cutting your meatloaf. The meatloaf pan with drainer 
rack is in the Baker's Secret line of non-stick bakeware, available at K-Mart.

GARDEN FRESH; GINGER: THE UNDERGROUND SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This morning, chatting with a friend about ginger, she mentioned that she took 
a hand of ginger and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'd forgotten that wonderful expression, "a hand of ginger." Squint your eyes 
and the plump root with many stubby branches might conceivably be a hand, but 
that asks for poetic license. Considering the value of a hand, ginger's license 
is granted. Ginger's sweet, hot, catch-in-the-throat pungency is indispensable, 
after all, around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Ginger was born in the tropics and its complex flavors blend well with the 
simple flavors relished in hot climates. Ginger with crab and shrimp. Ginger 
with white-fleshed fish and pork. Ginger with dried legumes -- central to 
India's vegetarian cuisines. Ginger with almost every fruit and vegetable on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 When ground dried ginger found its way to cooler climates, its brilliance in 
baked goods was discovered (this was little known in the not-big-on-baking 
tropics). I can't imagine life without gingerbread. As a girl, I baked it every 
Christmas for years, pouring the fragrant batter into molds shaped like 
butterflies and Christmas trees, ginger boys and ginger girls. One Christmas 
after I grew up, I replaced powdered ginger with grated fresh -- glorious.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides its heavenly ways with flour, ginger has special affinities for 
garlic, cilantro and chilies. Bruce Cost, the knowledgeable writer on Asian 
cuisine, notes this in his book "Ginger, East to West" (Addison-Wesley). One of 
the things this collection of delightful recipes and lore taught me is that 
when ginger's skin is thin, you needn't peel it. Another -- it had never 
occurred to me -- is that I can dry thin peeled slices of mature ginger in the 
sun, then grind them in the blender for ultra-fresh spice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger is a handsome plant. The bright green leaves are long, flat and narrow, 
and their thin round stalks grow three feet tall, like some kind of bamboo. The 
leaves have a wonderfully gingery flavor too, and they're a big reason why I 
grow the plant. I slice thin ribbons of young leaves and add them to salads and 
fruit cups, toss them in stir-fries, and use long ribbons to tie bundles of 
snap beans or slender leeks or skinny wedges of zucchini -- a pretty 
presentation. We also wrap chunks of sea bass in young ginger leaves, fix them 
with a bamboo skewer and grill them, making a packet that is entirely edible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes in spring, ginger bears small yellowish flowers touched with purple, 
but they're infrequent and indifferent blooms. They are edible, however. In 
recipes, the petals of one ginger flower can be substituted for one tablespoon 
of chopped root. 
</P>
<P>
 (By now, some of you must be wondering why I've called ginger a root when it's 
a rhizome -- a fleshy stem that sends shoots up and roots down. Well, I agree 
that it's a rhizome when I'm thinking of it as part of a plant, but when I'm 
cooking, like most people I think of it as a root.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Being native to the tropics, ginger revels in warmth but not blazing sun, 
humidity but not soggy soil -- and the soil must be super-rich in humus and 
well-drained. You can start your plants with ginger rhizomes from an organic 
produce stand (those from the supermarket may have been treated not to sprout; 
to be absolutely sure of a crop, buy rhizomes from a nursery). Choose pieces 
that are plump and fresh with lots of little knobs, which are the sprouting 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fastest growth is from plants started in early spring, rhizomes grow 
all summer long. For each plant, use a knobby piece the size of a large egg. If 
cut, let the cuts dry, then set the piece knobby side up in moist rich soil or 
compost just beneath the surface. Warmth speeds growth, so I start the rhizomes 
in a pot and set it by the stove. I water the soil well, then cover it with a 
few inches of straw or coarse leaves -- something light that lets in air but 
conserves moisture. Until there are sprouts, I water only enough to keep the 
soil moist.  
</P>
<P>
 When sprouts appear, the pot goes in our warmest sunniest corner -- whether 
indoors or out, depending upon the time of year -- and I remove the mulch. When 
leaves are growing vigorously, the plant needs lots of water; the soil must be 
kept just this side of wet. Feed ginger with a weak fish emulsion monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 To create a gingery environment, pile heat-gathering rocks around a patch in 
the warmest part of your garden that gets sun in the morning, then bright shade 
the rest of the day. Add humidity to the air with a couple of inches of ground 
bark around the plant. Wave the hose fitted with a misting nozzle over the 
plant and mulch every morning, and in the afternoon too, if the air is dry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If your garden is frost-free, you can grow ginger in the ground the year 
around. For a hedge of ginger, which is lovely behind tuberous begonias, set 
plants a hand's-breadth apart. If you get frost, either grow plants in the 
ground through summer, then pot them up and bring them indoors for cold 
weather, or grow your ginger in a pot from the start. Ultimately each plant 
needs a container 15 inches wide by a foot deep -- about 1 3/4 cubic feet of 
soil mix, which must be rich and fast-draining. In a slightly bigger pot, you 
can give ginger a brilliant border of impatiens (Busy Lizzie). Give ginger in 
pots the same situation in the garden as in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger grows well indoors, given light, warmth and humidity. The kitchen and 
bathroom are the moistest rooms in the house, and a cozy sunny spot in one of 
them is ideal. For added humidity, set the pot on a large tray of pebbles 
several inches deep, with water just below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason I grow ginger is to harvest it at the baby stage. Whereas the 
skin of the ginger at the supermarket is tan and papery, baby ginger's is 
translucent and sheer. The flesh of mature ginger root is fibrous, but baby's 
is succulent. The older the roots, the more their bite and snap, so baby ginger 
tastes mild as May. In China, young ginger is sliced into coins or matchsticks 
and stir-fried as a vegetable on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Given its wants, ginger races -- you can be harvesting baby roots in three to 
four months. But before then, if you grow several plants, treat yourself to a 
handful of ginger shoots -- snip them at a few inches and toss with snow peas 
in a stir-fry. For larger roots with deeper flavor, wait at least five months 
or up to eight or nine months to harvest. Plant a piece of the root and start 
the process over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a deciduous perennial, ginger goes dormant in winter, its leaves dying 
back. At that point, keep the plant warm, but only give minimal water until 
early spring, when you'll water and wait as before. 
</P>
<P>
 Your harvest of ginger root will stay fresh for several weeks in the 
refrigerator's vegetable drawer. Wrap it in a paper towel and tuck it in a 
plastic food bag (the paper towel absorbs moisture that might produce mold). My 
friend of the ginger hand freezes small pieces and then grates them still 
frozen, since the ginger will turn mushy when thawed. I keep nuggets of peeled 
ginger on reserve in a jar of Sherry in the refrigerator -- they stay plump 
indefinitely, and the tipple adds warmth in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best way to keep ginger is to candy it, then dip it in bittersweet 
chocolate. It lasts ages in an airtight box. Right. Sources 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh: There are mature roots in every supermarket -- buy the plumpest. Look 
for baby ginger in Asian markets from early summer to early autumn.

 This sauce turns the simplest fish, fowl, meat and full-flavored vegetable 
into something special. It may be prepared hours in advance, adding the garlic 
before serving. To serve with something not steamed, cook unpeeled garlic 
cloves in simmering salted water until tender, about 15 minutes, then peel and 
press into the sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Steaming is one of the leanest and most satisfactory ways to cook fish -- it's 
certainly the fastest and easiest. You'll need a heat-proof 9 1/2-inch plate 
that's 3/4-inch deep. Set the plate on a large Chinese steamer or cake rack 
over a wok, or directly in an 11-inch skillet that's about 2 inches deep. Pour 
1 inch of hot water in the wok and 1/2 inch of hot water in the skillet. Bring 
to a boil, reduce the heat until the water simmers, lay in the fish, then cover 
and start timing. FRESH GINGER SAUCE OVER STEAMED RED SNAPPER 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup rice vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 4 fillets red snapper or other white-fleshed fish, to equal 1 pound total 
</P>
<P>
 8 garlic cloves, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 clusters red grapes 
</P>
<P>
 Small bunch cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Peel ginger and cut in small pieces. Process in food processor until minced, 
about scant 1/2 cup, fairly loosely packed. Turn into serving bowl. Blend with 
soy sauce, vinegar and sugar. Cover and reserve in cool place until serving 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare steaming arrangement as above. When water simmers, lay fish and garlic 
on plate. Cover and steam. Test for doneness after 3 minutes, when fish is slit 
with tip of knife and flesh is opaque, about 5 minutes. Lift fish with spatula 
onto heated platter, leaving juices behind. 
</P>

WINE: DATING A COGNAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atomic science is now a factor in the Cognac market. 
</P>
<P>
 More on that story later. But first, an important point: Although both wine 
and brandy begin their lives as grape juice, the length of time they spend in 
the bottle is critical in the case of one and immaterial to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 With wine, it's essential to know the vintage year, because almost all wine is 
bottled within two years of its harvest. From that moment on it ages, either 
gracefully or fitfully, right up until the cork is pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 But brandy, even that special brandy made in the French village of Cognac, 
ages and develops only while it is in wooden casks; for all practical purposes 
its growth comes to a complete stop once it's bottled. If you were to sip a 
brandy made in 1849 and bottled in 1854, it would taste no more than 5 years 
old, even though the stuff was physically made before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason you don't see vintage years on Cognac bottles. Another is 
that most Cognac houses prefer to blend their vintages to make a product with a 
consistent house style. However, exceptional years do come along that can stand 
on their own, without blending. They offer the opportunity of tasting the 
unique character of a single vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soon we'll actually have that option, because vintage-dated Cognac is 
appearing once again in the United States. A few weeks ago the famous Cognac 
house Hine announced the release of a vintage-dated 1953 Cognac, noting that 
1953, in addition to being an excellent year for the red wines of Bordeaux, was 
a great year in Cognac. It is selling for $690 a bottle. The bottling also 
commemorates the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the firm says, which is 
important because Hine is holder of the royal warrant as Cognac supplier to the 
British Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always been very keen on vintage (Cognac)," says Bernard Hine, 
proprietor of the house of Hine. "We put 20 or 30 casks of each vintage aside. 
Of course, we don't know until it's 10 years old whether it's good or it's 
bad." Hine says the 1953 Cognac spent 34 years in cask, was bottled unblended 
in 1987 and has spent the last seven years in bottle -- "marrying," as they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the very existence of vintage-dated Cognac is largely unsuspected in this 
country. If you ask a merchant for it, likely as not you'll be told there is no 
such thing, except maybe in England.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, that would have been correct. Some Cognac producers (including 
Hine) bottled vintages 50 or 75 years ago, but in 1961 the Bureau National 
Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC), the French agency that regulates Cognac, 
prohibited the vintage-dating of Cognacs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Hine explains the BNIC felt that it was best to terminate the vintage 
category because there had been some irregularities in dating. "It was outlawed 
for many reasons," says Hine, "but one of them was that some people overdid it. 
And also, since most of the Cognac (area's) philosophy was blending, there were 
few reasons to vintage-date." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the BNIC ruling only prohibited bottling of vintage-dated Cognac by 
the Cognac producers themselves. It didn't stop the long-established practice 
of sending vintage-dated barrels of Cognac to England, where it was known as 
"early landed" Cognac. After varying periods of barrel-aging, English wine 
merchants would bottle this Cognac with a vintage year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the BNIC changed its mind and ruled that Cognac producers could 
bottle vintages once more. However, Hine says, aging the barrels at the 
producer's cellar remained a dicey proposition for the authorities, since they 
weren't able to ensure there was no fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 The guesswork has ended with the advent of carbon-14 dating. (That's the 
atomic science angle to this story.) Now a sample of Cognac can be sent to a 
lab and carbon-14 dating methods will determine its precise age. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, all vintage Cognacs being held in cask must be placed in a special 
cellar under the eye of the authorities. It has two locks; one key is held by 
the producer, the other key by the government. Neither party can enter the 
aging cellar without the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Corti, the Sacramento wine merchant who may know more about Cognac 
than any other American, says, "The vintage on a bottle of Cognac always was a 
date that was sort of taken cum grano salis. The British didn't concern 
themselves with the fact that some of the product was not from that vintage." 
</P>
<P>
 He says pressure to issue vintaged Cognac came from Armagnac, Cognac's great 
rival among French premium brandy regions. Armagnac producers, he says, had 
less stringent regulations about the use of vintages -- "provided you stated 
that the product was aged at least seven years (in barrel)." These dated 
Armagnacs particularly appealed, Corti observes, to people who wanted a 
beverage from their birth year but were born in bad vintages for red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Corti says, Cognac producers got tired of watching the British buy 
early-landed Cognac in barrels and sell vintaged products that they, the Cognac 
producers themselves, were forbidden to sell.  
</P>
<P>
 Corti, who long has imported early-landed Cognac in barrel, is now selling 
early landed Hine 1972 for $175 per bottle; next year he will have Hennessey 
1972 "Domaine de la Bataille." It is not yet bottled or priced.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: CLAYUDA ME

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighth Street is becoming one of the most interesting restaurant streets in 
L.A., Korean barbecue joints bumping up against pupuserias , Chinese 
handmade-noodle restaurants down the block from the last of the old-line 
Ambassador district steakhouses, Korean coffee houses near Latin chicken 
grills. Now there's Guelaguetza, the tiniest place, a few tables and some 
feathered ornaments on the walls, blaring brass-band music, a dining room that 
sometimes seems half taken up by buckets of homemade beverages and woven 
baskets of peppers. Named after the midsummer Zapotec fiesta, Guelaguetza is 
one of the few Oaxacan restaurants in town, and perhaps the only local place to 
specialize exclusively in the food of the region. The only dishes you are 
likely to recognize on the menu are quite unlike their border-Mex equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
 At Guelaguetza you'll find the sort of Oaxacan dishes you've only read about 
in travel magazines, the dense, banana-leaf wrapped tamales filled with pungent 
mole , the unstuffed enchiladas sprinkled with cheese and bathed in a musky, 
red chile sauce, the homemade drink tejate , served in a gourd, that looks like 
the Cuyahoga River circa 1967 but tastes a little like oatmeal. There is a 
terrific spiced drink, chilacayote , made with steeped shreds of squash. The 
rice drink horchata is garnished with chopped pecans and topped with an inch of 
a syrup that may remind you of melted Popsicles. 
</P>
<P>
 When you show up late in the afternoon, everybody is sipping horchata and 
eating clayudas , sort of pizza-size Oaxacan tostadas smeared with black beans, 
sprinkled with lettuce, topped with crumbles of white cheese and a few squirts 
of smoky chipotle salsa. On top of the clayuda , more as a garnish than 
anything else, is a bit of meat: the salt-dried beef called cecina , the 
salt-dried pork tazajo or four tiny spheres of mellow Oaxacan chorizo. A couple 
days a week, there are Oaxacan empanadas, tough, thin envelopes of masa , about 
three times the bulk of South American empanadas, filled with a stew of chicken 
and amarillo mole , or with a tasty, curiously herb-flavored saute of fresh 
mushrooms, squash flowers and white cheese. Nopales (cactus) salad is fresh and 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the classic seven moles of Oaxaca, dark, complex sauces flavored with 
seeds, nuts, herbs, chiles of every description, Guelaguetza has quite a few: 
the coloradito , brick-red, elusively spicy, with a slightly tangy sweetness; 
the amarillo ; sometimes even the dusky chichilo . Verde de espinazo is an 
astonishing mole -like stew, a thick, spicy broth enriched with pureed spinach, 
barely tart, exotically flavored with mint, that is quite unlike anything 
you've ever tasted. Estofado , a sweet-sour yellow mole with a tang of sharp 
green olive, is a little like a cross between traditional black mole and the 
tomato sauce you might encounter on a good fish a la Veracruzana . In addition 
to those, Guelaguetza uses a different mole to sauce the enchiladas, and still 
another to fill the tamales. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbacoa de chivo , intricately flavored, almost the essence of stewed goat, 
could pass as one of the better birrias in town, though the meat is less 
interesting than the broth; chiles rellenos , are hot chiles in a loose, crisp, 
egg batter, stuffed with minced chicken, thoroughly good. 
</P>
<P>
 But the black mole , based on ingredients the restaurant brings up from 
Oaxaca, is extraordinary, rich with chopped chocolate and burnt grain, 
undertones of toasted chile, wave upon wave of textured spice, as simple yet as 
nuanced as a great, old Cote Rotie, and so much better than other moles locally 
available -- including the fine one at that Oaxacan restaurant in Santa Monica 
-- that it is almost like seeing a Diego Rivera mural up close for the first 
time after years of seeing nothing but reproductions.  
</P>
<P>
 All the moles here are served with a piece or two of boiled chicken or pork, 
but really, all you need with these moles is a glass of horchata alongside, and 
a basket of hot tortillas to mop up the sauce.

NEW VIETNAMESE CUISINE; ONE LAST COFFEE BEFORE I GO; TRANSITION: AFTER THE 
ECONOMIC REFORMS OF 1986, BUT BEFORE THE LIFTING OF THE U.S. TRADE EMBARGO, ONE 
FOOD LOVER FOUND SOME OF VIETNAM'S BEST EATING IN URBAN STREET STALLS AND TINY 
CAFES.

<P>
 The day I was scheduled to leave Ho Chi Minh City was my birthday. I had spent 
11 days in Vietnam, rigidly supervised by the government and prohibited from 
traveling without watchful guides. That was in 1991. And it was a relief to be 
in Ho Chi Minh City, where the mood was more friendly and open than in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 On this last morning, I walked along tree-shaded Dong Khoi Street to the 
Continental Hotel. A top-drawer meal in this beautiful hostelry, still imbued 
with the romance of French colonial life, seemed fitting for a celebration. It 
had to be breakfast, though, because my flight was set for early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Marble floors, elegant columns, crystal chandeliers, intriguing people, an 
exotic Euro-Asian buffet laid out on starchy white linens: The Continental had 
it all. And soon I was comfortably filled with croissants and charcuterie , 
fried noodles, Chinese sausage and succulent sweet fruits including fresh 
longans, chikus ( sapotes ), pineapple, papaya and the exotic thanh lom. When 
cut into wedges, this large red-skinned fruit looks like white poppyseed cake 
with red frosting. I have not seen it elsewhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderful though breakfast was, something was missing, tugging at my heart. It 
was this: I simply could not leave Vietnam without a last visit to my favorite 
sidewalk stall, a place of cheerful camaraderie and extraordinary rich, sweet 
coffee. The clock indicated I should leave for the airport. Instead, I raced 
over to Nguyen Hue Street, across from the Rex Hotel, for one last coffee 
before catching my plane. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had become a regular at this place, where customers perched on doll-sized 
stools much too tiny for the human frame. Usually, I would have a plate of 
silky rice dough wrappers stuffed with ground meat, topped with bean sprouts, 
cilantro and other greens and slices of what the Vietnamese call pork pie, a 
finely textured cold cut.  
</P>
<P>
 The coffee -- ca phe sua -- was quite a production. A small coffee filter 
dripped its strong brew into a glass containing sweetened condensed milk placed 
in a cup of steaming water. I would sit in the shade of the pepper trees, 
reading the English-language Vietnam News and sip this marvelous treat. When 
the coffee was almost gone, the stall's proprietor would bring over a pot of 
tea. (This custom of coffee with a tea chaser surprised me, but it is not 
unique to Vietnam. I found it also on the streets of Bangkok.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, I stopped instead at a wooden cart laden with French rolls. In 
Vietnam the quality of the French bread is astounding. Nowhere in Los Angeles 
have I found bread that can compare. Racks of it were set out here and there in 
Ho Chi Minh City. At this cart, I ordered banh mi pate -- a sandwich. The woman 
vendor split the bun, dabbed on pate, added bits of charcuterie , marinated 
carrot, jicama strips, cucumber slices, cilantro, a cloud of pepper and thin 
chile sauce. It was a fantastic bundle of food for 15 cents. The noodle and 
coffee breakfast, by the way, was 47 cents; the sumptuous breakfast at the 
Continental came to slightly more than $4.  
</P>
<P>
 Back home, my friend Steve was horrified to hear that I had eaten street food 
-- a lot of it. In Vietnam this is extremely risky, he says. And it was 
miraculous that I had not become ill. Steve should know. He has gone to Vietnam 
on countless charitable missions and speaks the language fluently. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are risks in restaurants too. I'll never forget a quick restroom 
stop at what looked like a very pleasant cafe in Hanoi. To reach the restroom I 
had to squeeze past a tethered pig and a hostile dog in a tiny passageway that 
smelled horribly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day after I arrived, my government control, Mr. Qynh, packed me off on his 
Honda bike to a cafe that specialized in Chinese "rolling cakes." These are 
sliced rolls of rice dough filled with finely shredded pork, fried garlic and 
that Vietnamese "pork pie" cold cut. They are meant to be eaten with a sauce 
and fresh herbs, which I bypassed, although they looked temptingly crisp and 
super-fresh; rule No. 1 for staying healthy while eating in Third World 
countries is to avoid raw fruits, vegetables and lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vietnamese custom is to eat fresh greens with food, so by avoiding 
them I was missing the point of this appealing light cuisine. It took only two 
more days to give in.  
</P>
<P>
 Three of us were eating charcoal-grilled pork and rice noodles in an alleyway 
lined with tables and those ubiquitous miniature stools. My guide and driver 
helped themselves liberally from bowls of chopped garlic, red chiles and rau , 
the generic name for greens. The assortment included lettuce, cilantro, shiso , 
bean sprouts, mint and a couple of kinds of basil. I did the same, with no 
unpleasant aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, I ate anything placed in front of me -- pig's womb, frog legs, 
eel, snail, cobra -- but not dog. I did spot roasted canine hindquarters on a 
market street in Haiphong. My guide, Mai, said the meat is grilled to remove 
the hair and then boiled. In Ho Chi Minh City, I was taken to see a restaurant 
that specialized in dog, but when I tried to photograph a meat stall outside, 
people chased me away.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was called 9 Mon Cay To because it served a nine-course meal 
made with dog meat. In the South, the word for dog is cay , and cay to means 
young dog.  
</P>
<P>
 One night in Hanoi, which was my first stop, I was left on my own for dinner. 
Economic controls had eased, allowing people to set up little businesses, and 
the streets were sprouting with food stalls. Housewives placed tables in front 
of their dwellings and brought out pots of food.  
</P>
<P>
 There were also modest open-fronted cafes. I picked one of these and wedged in 
among Vietnamese families and soldiers. Fans cooled the room and lizards 
skittered across the ceiling.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was no menu, so I ordered pho bo , Hanoi's famous beef and rice noodle 
soup, because it was all I could ask for in Vietnamese. The soup came with 
chopsticks for the meat and noodles and a flimsy tin spoon for the broth. Meat 
was boiling in a large food can in the alley outside, where a girl rinsed the 
soup bowls in a plastic dishpan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ho Chi Minh City, I bought spongecake from a tray atop a little boy's head, 
admired shiny pastries set out on street corners by sun-bronzed country women 
and happily sipped sugar cane juice extracted on an old press and cooled with 
ice chipped off a lump in a bucket. The cane was squeezed with a mandarin 
orange wedge, which gave the juice a nice flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a side street, I found a place to get incredible sweet, plump river 
lobsters. The seafood and other prepared dishes were displayed in a 
glassed-enclosed booth on the sidewalk. Soups bubbled away in pots on the 
ground. You ordered from this display, then took a seat in the adjacent 
shoebox-shaped open-air cafe. Ceiling fans whirled away, and the cat under my 
table lay stolidly in place, unmoved by an invasion of feet. The owner brought 
over his two daughters to meet the foreigner, but the girls were too shy to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the lobster, I ate water spinach garnished with fried sliced 
garlic, an egg-topped crab cake cooked in a tin fluted like a flower, white 
rice and a can of 333 beer. The bill was $3. While I ate, the young waitresses 
snatched the sandals of a fellow seated at another table and hid them, giggling 
like school children on a playground. As I left, the woman tending the food 
booth touched my chin to see what Western skin felt like. She waved when I 
looked back from far down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Warm-hearted experiences like these made street eating much more fun than 
dining in stylish restaurants, although I did that too and found the food 
admirable, and amazingly cheap. Feasting in Cholon (Chinatown) cost all of 
$6.43 for three people. It was a bargain, considering that we had special 
dishes such as gamey-tasting roast pigeon and black chicken cooked with 
medicinal Chinese herbs. But my driver and guide were outraged at the price and 
argued with the proprietor (to no avail). I had been cheated, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting about in Vietnam was not easy. Traveler's checks and credit cards 
weren't accepted, which meant I had to carry a great deal of U. S. cash. It 
didn't make for a secure feeling during the flight over the Pacific or the days 
I spent in Bangkok arranging my visa. Although I had planned to visit central 
Vietnam, my government supervisor jacked up the price of travel there so high 
that I had to say no. I had brought more money than the amount advised, but it 
would not have been enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel in Vietnam is easier now. Since the lifting of the U. S. trade embargo 
in February, American traveler's checks are accepted. However, a 3% surcharge 
is imposed, a friend just back from a business trip tells me. It is also 
possible to use credit cards. Prices have gone up, though, and it is probably 
no longer possible to eat as handsomely as I did for so little money -- unless 
you are willing to risk the food of the streets.

NEW VIETNAMESE CUISINE; MARKETS; THE BEST OF LITTLE SAIGON: MADE IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BURUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Little Saigon Supermarket, 9822 Bolsa Ave., Westminster, (714) 531-7272, 9 
a.m. to 9 p.m. daily.  
</P>
<P>
 The powerful whirling helicopter blades kicked up thick clouds of dust as Twan 
Ngo pushed her youngest child into a hovering American chopper. It was April 
27, 1975, three days before the fall of Saigon and the last time Ngo would see 
her suburban Saigon home. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 165,000 Vietnamese who came to the United States in the first 
post-war wave of immigrants were relocated in Northeastern or Midwestern 
cities. At first the Ngos found themselves in Green Bay, Wis., where, as you 
might expect, they found little in the way of Vietnamese food. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, along with many fellow transplanted Vietnamese, the Ngos wound up 
in Orange County near the neighborhood centered on Bolsa Avenue -- and running 
from Westminster through Garden Grove to Santa Ana -- that came to be known as 
Little Saigon. Lured by the warmer climate and a growing, cohesive Vietnamese 
community, the Ngos found many ties to their culture here, one of the strongest 
being the ready availability of Vietnamese foods and ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find most of these vegetables in Wisconsin," Ngo says, picking over 
the greens in the produce section of the bright, ultra-modern Little Saigon 
Supermarket on Bolsa Ave. By "these vegetables," she means the dozens of 
Vietnamese specialties such as bac ha , the pale green spongy stems that go 
into sour soup, or muop huong , a squash resembling a large zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, specialty produce farming has turned into a livelihood for a 
number of local Vietnamese farmers, evolving hand in hand with a now-sizable 
Vietnamese food industry. Many of these California-grown or -made goods are 
distributed nationwide to serve the million or so Vietnamese who have come to 
the United States over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this commercial activity is Orange County, where Vietnamese 
residents officially increased 271% in the last decade (the Vietnamese-American 
Political Action Committee contends the number is nearly twice what the census 
reports). The sheer size of this local customer base opened up a lucrative 
market for prepared foods as well as shelf-stable items; in much smaller 
Vietnamese communities, it probably wouldn't be economic to market these 
perishables.  
</P>
<P>
 But at Little Saigon Supermarket, Ngo chooses from an increasing range of 
Vietnamese-style processed meats, all sorts of fresh noodles, herbs, pickled 
vegetables and soy products (such as fresh tofu and soy milk) that are 
impossible to import. The selection has made Vietnamese eating here as close to 
authentic as it gets outside of Vietnam itself. 
</P>
<P>
 As the selection shows, Little Saigon Supermarket owner David Tran knows the 
Vietnamese food business inside and out. Tran came to the Little Saigon area 
when it was still in its awkward growth stages -- a mere stretch of bean and 
strawberry fields, flower warehouses and bottling plants, and just a few 
Vietnamese stores and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had left Vietnam in '78 on a crowded boat and ended up temporarily in 
Escondido, learning English and studying to be an electronic technician. Tran 
found it impossible to support his family on a technician's wages, but having 
been a businessman (a bicycle wholesaler, to be exact) in Vietnam, he perceived 
a growing need for Vietnamese wholesale food distribution. He formed Delta Food 
Company and began to supply Orange County's escalating number of Vietnamese 
restaurants and markets with wholesale produce and other ingredients used for 
Vietnamese and Chinese cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 As time went on, local Asian farmers began to produce small quantities of 
specialty herbs and vegetables. "Some would ask him to distribute them," says 
Denise Tran, who is David's sister-in-law and also vice-president of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 Vietnam trade embargo meant an end to Vietnamese imports. Producers 
in other Asian countries, particularly Thailand, began putting 
Vietnamese-language labels on foods they had in common with Vietnam, such as 
fish paste, dry rice noodles and curry powder, and exporting them to the US for 
the expatriate market. In the beginning, Tran stocked a lot of these items, but 
they weren't created specifically for the Vietnamese palate, and many 
Vietnamese cooks have never ceased to regard them as mere substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Vietnamese in this country are no longer dependent on imports. 
They're producing their own extravagant assortments of Vietnamese-style sauces, 
spice blends, pickled fish, fresh rice papers, deli foods, sweets, beverages 
and baked goods, all made in America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's as much competition among the various brands of these foods as there 
is between American breakfast cereal or coffee companies. You see five or six 
styles of curry powder and at least that many of the fresh hot chile sauce 
called tuong ot toi (not to mention many other varieties of hot sauce). Four 
companies manufacture the skinny fresh rice-noodle cakes called banh hoi and at 
least half a dozen make the bologna-like Vietnamese sausages chua lua and cha 
bi. The UPC bar-coded packages of fish dumpling paste in the freezer case also 
come from several companies.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Little Saigon Supermarket stocks prepared deli foods such as 
cakes, vegetable-filled rice noodle rolls, taro balls, mung bean desserts and 
other tidbits, all from bakeries and snack shops in the area. These are 
displayed on a huge table in the middle of the store and their packaging is 
still rather basic: foam trays enveloped in shrink wrap or "clam shell" boxes 
designed for take-out foods. But the manufactured foods' packaging is starting 
to get more sophisticated.  
</P>
<P>
 Now there are even convenience products such as spice packets to flavor duck 
soup, mixes for Vietnamese rice rolls and a Hamburger Helper-like mix to season 
bo kho , the Vietnamese beef stew. So far though, no Vietnamese TV dinners have 
become part of this burgeoning industry's repertoire. Shopping List 
</P>
<P>
 It's not possible to cover all the locally made Vietnamese products here but 
this will give you a little taste of what's out there. SOUP SEASONING MIXES 
</P>
<P>
 Noodle soups are a daily food in Vietnam, as popular as breakfast cereals or 
hamburgers in this country. Over there, few people bother to make them at home, 
since the soups are sold on practically every street corner. Expatriates 
apparently take a different view, for there are scores of styles and brands of 
convenience-style soup seasoning blends on the market. These aren't instant 
soups but rather a combination of spices in a tea bag-like sachet that you cook 
(usually with meat) to make broth with just the right taste.  
</P>
<P>
 Vifaco, in La Mesa, makes seasoning for pho , the famous Vietnamese beef 
noodle soup, and they've put fairly good English directions on their box. (You 
can also get the right meats for this soup in the butcher section and the 
proper fresh thin rice noodles in the fresh rice noodle section, near the 
produce.) Anise, cinnamon, ginger and allspice are the soup's predominating 
flavors.  
</P>
<P>
 Pho originated in the beef-eating North, but in Hue, where the food is spicy, 
they use beef and pork-hock for their soup called bun bo Hue (pronounced boon 
bo whey ). Bun is the style of fresh rice noodle that goes into the soup; bo is 
the braised beef that garnishes it. Kung Sing, based in Santa Ana, makes bun bo 
Hue seasonings, available in sachets. Kung Sing also makes a pho seasoning and 
has a long list of seasoning mixes in its line. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone by all this, the D & D Gold Product Corporation in Santa 
Ana, which often packages products under the Golden Bell label, has the 
exclusive rights to manufacture a pho soup seasoning base from a recipe of the 
well-known noodle soup restaurant chain Pho Hoa. (For a Vietnamese company 
that's kind of like having the recipe for McDonald's secret sauce.)  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Dinh, the nephew of one of D & D's owners, suggests that for the best 
flavor, you should not make soup the regular way, adding the spices at the 
beginning. Instead, you should simmer meat and onion in water until the broth 
is almost done and add the seasoning packet only in the last 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 D & D also makes seasoning packets for duck noodle soup and is a manufacturer 
of Vietnamese-style spice mixes, condiments, and mixes for flour products such 
as dumplings and pancakes. One of the company's principles, Sam Tieu, 
manufactured chile paste and plum sauce in Vietnam. At first he worked as a 
chef in this country and eventually used his food production expertise to 
become a major partner in D & G Gold which does have an excellent chile sauce 
in its line. CURRY PASTE AND POWDER 
</P>
<P>
 Although the French and Chinese have left a more significant mark on Vietnam's 
cooking, India has contributed curry, primarily in the south. Unlike the Thais, 
with their various red, green, orange, yellow and roasted curry mixtures, the 
Vietnamese have just one sort of cari (as they call it). It's Madras-style, 
ocher-colored and tasting predominantly of the warm Indian spices: turmeric, 
cinnamon, cloves and cumin. What goes into the curry dish is another matter -- 
it may be chicken with lemon grass, or shrimp or squid or tofu. I've even had 
goat curry in our Vietnamese restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon Supermarket devotes a sizeable hunk of shelf space to curry 
powder mixtures and curry pastes suspended in oil. Kung Sing brand cari ni an 
do is the curry powder and cari dau an do is the paste. Golden Bell, of Pho Hoa 
fame, also makes curry powder and paste, as does Zesty Foods, the distributor 
for Pepper House International. MORE SEASONING MIXES: 
</P>
<P>
 Among the spice mixtures in Kung Sing's extensive line is Seasoning for Orange 
Duck. The instructions are in English and Vietnamese and they tell you blend 
the seasoning mix with butter, rub it on four pounds of whole duck legs, then 
bake. Kung Sing also makes Oriental Spices for Catfish. Denise Tran says, "You 
simply sprinkle on the filleted fish before cooking it, preferably over 
charcoal -- but broiling is OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Kho Seasoning: Vietnamese beef stew, which has Chinese seasonings and is 
served with French bread, is basically a simple dish to make; the only 
complicated thing is gathering the long list of seasonings that go into it. To 
the rescue: Kung Sing's gia vi nau kho , which means (roughly translated) "stew 
seasonings." You use the seasoning to marinate the stew beef before simmering 
it in liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Chile Sauce: Many companies make Vietnamese fresh chile sauce called 
tuong ot toi , but Huy Fong brand is the one that seems to be everywhere -- 
from Mexican delis to gourmet shops. Maybe it's because Huy Fong was smart 
enough to print the label in Spanish, French, Chinese and English as well as 
Vietnamese. This sauce of roughly pureed fresh red chiles, with their seeds, is 
potent -- nothing you'd want to dip corn chips into. Huy Fong also makes a 
chile and garlic sauce and a smooth seedless chile puree labled Sriracha, after 
the Thai sauce. MARINATED, PRESERVED FISH PRODUCTS 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Binh Harrison started Viet-My, her fish importing and packing company, in 
Alexandria, Va., back in 1972. She procured Vietnamese mudfish, gourami and 
anchovies, marinated them and packed them in the Vietnamese manner (but in a 
USDA-approved plant, using the purest sea salt, imported from Holland). To most 
Vietnamese, the flavor of these salted fish is as basic as salt and pepper in a 
Western setting. Without them, certain dishes are like garlic bread without the 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 When the embargo cut off her import supply, Harrison had to scout around for a 
new way to get the salted fish she required. After an unsuccessful attempt to 
make her product from Thai preserved fish, she eventually found a Singaporean 
supplier that could cure the product to her exacting standards. The freshwater 
fish she uses, such as mudfish and gourami, must be cleaned and salted down 
within 40 minutes of being alive. 
</P>
<P>
 And what do you do with Viet-My's anchovies of the East? Mam thai chau doc, 
which is marinated fillet of salted mudfish, is the obligatory seasoning for 
mam chung , a sort of steamed Vietnamese-style meatloaf. It's also eaten with 
pork belly slices with mint and herbs, rolled in rice paper burrito-style. Mam 
nem xay, or ground anchovies, is an essential ingredient in the dipping sauce 
for Vietnamese-style beef fondue and many other dishes. And mam loc chau doc, 
whole salted and marinated mudfish, is delicious steamed under a layer of 
seasoned pork puree (see meats).  
</P>
<P>
 Viet-My now makes about 16 other products including a soy bean paste sauce 
called tuong bac cu da, which serves as a dipping sauce for fried tofu or 
stir-fried rau muong (Chinese watercress). Because it is high in protein, tuong 
bac cua ca is popular as a vegetarian food. BEVERAGES 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Soy, Vita Soy, Wy Ky Foods, Soy Foods of America and Visoy Foods are 
all makers of soy milk. Both Chinese and Vietnamese love this lightly 
beany-tasting liquid as breakfast. They often eat the unsweetened version warm 
with a dash of chile oil and Chinese crullers (yu t'iau, which are sold here in 
the deli area). The sweetened soy drinks aren't ignored at breakfast, but they 
are also popular as a pick-me-up snack and come in handy six-ounce bottles as 
well as larger containers.  
</P>
<P>
 Visoy also makes an herb-infused sugar cane drink that they label Imperatae 
and Cane Drink. No one could figure out what imperatae means, but the Chinese 
characters on Visoy's label say that the cane juice is steeped with mao gen , a 
plant or medicinal herb that is thought to be a cooling element in the diet. 
This is why the drink is so popular on hot days. If sugar cane juice doesn't 
sound appealing, you might want to try Visoy's Iced Chrysanthemum Tea.  
</P>
<P>
 Roasted Brown Rice Drink Mix: This mild-tasting flour with roasty overtones 
contains barely a trace of sugar. The label claims it is good for babies and 
explains that you can drink it hot or cold. The drink is another product made 
by Kung Sing spice company. According to Denise Tran, you mix it into milk or 
water like Milo (a prepared drink like Ovaltine, popular all over Southeast 
Asia). GREEN VEGETABLES 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon Supermarket's produce department has all sorts of vegetables I'd 
never seen before my visit. Fortunately, I met Mrs. Tuyet Luu, a steady 
customer at the store, who explained in great detail how to cook my newly 
discovered greens.  
</P>
<P>
 "For this," she said of the muop huong, a large slender green squash, "you 
peel off the skin and fry your meat in garlic first and then toss in the squash 
for a few minutes, because it cooks very fast." It's also best to cut the 
squash, which has a slightly spongy texture, into rather large pieces so it 
won't overcook so readily. For soups, muop huong is traditionally paired with 
rau den, the red amaranth leaves often called Chinese spinach or red spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile leaves may be called la ot or rau ot in Vietnamese. Unlike the spicy 
fruit of the chile plant, the pointy, triangular leaves have a mild flavor, 
rather like a somewhat intense spinach. Because their texture is more 
substantial, they are much easier than spinach to fry. There are often 
delicious little flowers in the bunches, and both leaves and flowers are 
wonderful deep-fried. Mrs. Luu also suggests using them in shrimp soup or any 
stir-fry dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Dot bi, or opo squash leaves, are broad and slightly fuzzy with hollow stems. 
I suggest removing the stems because I find them harsh-tasting and stringy, but 
the leaves lose their slightly fuzzy quality when they are cooked in broth.  
</P>
<P>
 La trau, also known as betel palm, are flat, sturdy, vividly green leaves 
shaped like teardrops. They are not for cooking but "for the old people to 
chew," in Tran's words. 
</P>
<P>
 Can nuoc is a milder breed of celery than the Chinese celery called ca vin in 
Vietnamese. The latter is added to stir-fries as a seasoning, while can nuoc is 
stir-fried either with meat or on its own. It's especially good with strips of 
beef, Mrs. Luu says. NOODLES 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,000-year Chinese presence in Vietnam imposed more than chopsticks and 
stir-frying on the local eating habits. It also left noodles, which loom large 
in the Vietnamese diet. Noodles are not just lunch dishes or midnight snacks. 
They appear at almost every meal -- in soups, in stir-fries, or mixed with bits 
of meat or fish and fresh herbs and wrapped in lettuce and/or rice paper. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to go to three parts of the market to see all the noodles. Dry 
noodles are on the right wall at the front of the store. There's a cooler in 
one of the aisles for fresh wheat noodles.  
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Rice Noodles: Fresh rice noodles, which come in half a dozen widths, 
have their own section next to the produce department. They include products 
from the V.N. noodle company and Ban Hoi Chao Doc No. 2, who make the fresh 
rice vermicelli called bun toi. Several other companies make the familiar wide 
flat rice noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 You can tell competition is fierce in the fresh rice noodle business because 
there are at least four brands of banh hoi. These are lacy noodle doilies that 
look like they've been made from thread. Banh hoi are used like a tortilla to 
pick up morsels of barbecued meat or grilled meat balls wrapped in a morsel of 
lettuce and garnished with a few leafy herbs from the ever-present Vietnamese 
salad platter. MEATS  
</P>
<P>
 Cold Cuts: The Vietnamese love their French-inspired cold cuts, and they show 
up in many guises. Thinly sliced, they're eaten with sheer rice noodle sheets, 
several sprigs of a fresh herb and dipping sauce. Or they may be layered on a 
French roll spread with mayonnaise to make the Vietnamese-style submarine 
sandwiches called banh mi.  
</P>
<P>
 There are products from no fewer than six meat companies in Little Saigon 
Supermarket's cooler against the back wall and in the freezer opposite it. A 
random sampling of their wares would find the inevitable cha lua (also called 
gio lua ), with its bologna-like texture and banana-leaf wrapper. Cha bi has a 
similar flavor but a crunchy texture from pork skin threads. There's a 
Vietnamese version of fromage de tete (head cheese) -- unappetizingly labeled 
by one company as "steamed pig's head loaf." All these and more sausage 
varieties are produced by Great Wall, Great River, Tay Ho, Phu Huong and the 
Viet-Hung Paris company. 
</P>
<P>
 Que Hong, another meat company, makes thit doi, a cured pork roll with an 
ultra-thin wrapping of steamed pork-skin. The snowy covering makes the roll 
look like a cylindrical French pate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meat Balls: A popular specialty made by Que Hong, among several other 
companies, is bo vien, a smooth-textured meat ball that is put into soups and 
used as one of the ingredients in hot-pot dinners. Tay Ho makes a seasoned, 
ground pork mix, nem nuong, which is usually made into meatballs and barbecued. 
Similarly, Phu Hong makes gio song, a smooth seasoned pork paste that can also 
be barbecued or mixed with salted fish and steamed as a sort of meat loaf. The 
paste is sold frozen.  
</P>
<P>
 Frozen Fish Paste: If fish meat emulsion doesn't strike you as particularly 
appetizing, you haven't yet learned to ignore the creative names on some Asian 
labels. If you were to call the Gai Phat Food company's fish paste a quenelle 
base, or even a dumpling, it might be more appealing. In any case, this smooth 
puree of mild fish is lightly seasoned with garlic, onion and spices and its 
wonderful fried as little patties or scooped with two spoons into tiny egg 
shapes and poached in hot broth.

CATFISH FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE SIMMONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Come summer, as youngsters growing up in rural Georgia, we would fish every 
day. My Mom called it 'catfish fever.' First Grandpa would clean it, then Mom 
would bread it with cornmeal and fry it nice and crisp in bacon fat. We loved 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator of this fish tale now lives far from the catfish-filled creek of 
his childhood memories. But, thanks to a recent phenomenon called the catfish 
industry, he can still enjoy catfish when the spirit moves him. 
</P>
<P>
 Catfish -- all 459 million pounds of them -- are now raised on farms in 
quality-controlled ponds filled with fresh water. The farms are located 
throughout Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana, so the catfish are 
still Southern-born and bred. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you new to catfish, the flavor is sweet and mild and the texture 
is firm. This versatile fish is available as fillets and is great fried, 
broiled, baked, grilled, sauteed and even stir-fried. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the following recipe, I suggest breading the fish fillets with fine bread 
crumbs or cornmeal and oven-frying. Serve with carrot and corn salsa. For 
dessert, serve scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with diced mango. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a little extra spice, add a dash of cayenne or chili powder to the bread 
crumbs or cornmeal.  
</P>
<P>
 OVEN-FRIED CATFISH 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 (6- to 8-ounce) catfish fillets 
</P>
<P>
 Salt

 1 cup fine bread crumbs or yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg white, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 Drizzle oil on 15x10x3/4-inch pan. Pat catfish fillets dry with paper towels. 
Sprinkle both sides to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Place flour on 1 sheet of wax paper and bread crumbs on another sheet. Coat 
both sides of catfish with flour. Shake off any excess. Dip catfish in egg 
white. Roll in crumbs to coat. Place fish on prepared pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Oven-fry fish on lowest oven rack at 425 degrees until golden and cooked 
through, about 6 minutes per side. Makes 4 servings. CARROT AND CORN SALSA 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons seeded and minced jalapeno chiles 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Combine carrots, corn, sweet red pepper and cilantro in large bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle cumin in small skillet and heat over very low heat until warm and 
fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add oil, lime juice and jalapenos.  
</P>
<P>
 Toss dressing with vegetables. Season to taste with salt. Cover and 
refrigerate until ready to serve. Makes 4 servings. VANILLA ICE CREAM WITH 
MANGO AND GINGER

TAKING THE SOUR WITH THE SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A taste for sweet and sour is shared by people in diverse areas of the globe. 
In Poland, stuffed cabbage is cooked in sweet and sour tomato sauce. The Dutch 
like sweet and sour red cabbage with apples, the Germans prepare cabbage with 
raisins, and Ashkenazi Jews are fond of sweet and sour fish. Europeans cook 
poultry with prunes or raisins and finish the sauce with vinegar and sugar. To 
accompany game, they love sweet and sour sauces made with red currant jelly and 
either wine vinegar or lemon juice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle East, Syrians like sweet and sour okra, while sweet and sour 
winter squash with raisins is a specialty of the Kurds. Iranians prepare 
meatball soup with prunes, dried apricots and walnuts seasoned with sugar and 
vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 But by far our most popular image of sweet and sour comes from Chinese 
cuisine. We go to Chinese restaurants and feast on sweet and sour fish, pork or 
chicken. Yet many of us don't realize how easy sweet and sour sauce is to make. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite versions is based on a simple formula -- equal amounts of 
ketchup, sugar, vinegar and soy sauce. It is easy not only to prepare but also 
to remember. Indeed, it's one of the fastest sauces to make, essentially a 
mixture of four ingredients. The sauce keeps the shopping list brief too, as 
it's made of ingredients you most likely have in the pantry. This tasty sauce 
has another virtue: It's fat-free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To vary the basic recipe, enhance the flavor of sweet and sour sauce with 
chopped fresh or sauteed ginger or garlic. Add bottled hot pepper sauce or 
chile flakes to make it spicy. Or substitute honey for the sugar or orange 
juice for the vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Use sweet and sour sauce as a dipping sauce to accompany a variety of foods, 
from fried fish to barbecued chicken to broiled eggplant. Serve with plain 
steamed shrimp as an alternative to cocktail sauce. Even raw vegetables, such 
as carrot sticks, cauliflower florets and sliced mushrooms, benefit from being 
dunked in the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet and sour sauce is fabulous for glazing grilled chicken wings. For this 
purpose I add more ketchup so that the sauce adheres well to the chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can also braise diced chicken breasts in the sauce for a tasty, low-fat 
entree. When you have leftover roast chicken, turkey or pork, heat the sliced 
meat and top with warm sweet and sour sauce for an almost instant entree. To 
complete the meal, serve the sweet and sour chicken or meat with steamed rice 
and a boiled or stir-fried green vegetable, such as broccoli or asparagus. 
BASIC SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup ketchup 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl thoroughly mix sugar, vinegar, ketchup and soy sauce. Serve hot or at 
room temperature as sauce or dip or to accompany vegetables or roast meats. 
Makes generous 3/4 cup, or 2 to 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a quick, easy and low-fat dish. The sauce flavors the chicken and 
keeps it moist as it cooks.  
</P>
<P>
 SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN BREASTS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup white or red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup ketchup 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon Asian hot sauce or to taste, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 teaspoons cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
 Trim visible fat from chicken and cut meat into 1-inch cubes. Heat oil in wok 
or saute pan. Add chicken and saute, stirring, over medium heat, 1 minute. 
Cover and saute 3 minutes, stirring once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl thoroughly mix sugar, vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and hot sauce. Add 
to chicken in pan and mix well. Bring to simmer. Cover and cook over low heat 
until chicken is tender, 5 minutes. Chicken is done when color is no longer 
pink. Cut into thick piece to check. 
</P>
<P>
 Blend cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water in small cup. Add to simmering sauce 
in center of pan, then quickly stir into remaining sauce. Heat until bubbling. 
Serve hot. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chicken wings like these have become one of the best-loved American 
appetizers. The wings are briefly roasted, then brushed with the sauce and 
baked. Instead of chicken wings, you can use drumsticks.  
</P>
<P>
 CHICKEN WINGS GLAZED WITH CHINESE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds chicken wings 
</P>
<P>
 Oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 White pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup ketchup 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons peeled and minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 2 garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup chicken broth or water 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
 Few drops chile oil or cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Orange or kiwi slices for garnish, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Cut off wing tips and reserve to make stock. Cut wings apart at joint. Lightly 
oil roasting pan and place wings in pan in 1 layer. Season to taste with salt 
and white pepper on both sides. Roast at 400 degrees until meat is no longer 
pink (cut in thickest part to check), 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, combine vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, sugar, ginger root, garlic, 
broth and cornstarch in small saucepan and mix well. Cook over medium-high 
heat, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens and comes to simmer. Add chile 
oil to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain off fat from pan of wings. Brush wings lightly with sauce and bake 5 
minutes. Turn wings over and brush with sauce. Bake until wings are glazed and 
browned, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Place wings on serving platter and garnish 
with orange slices. Accompany with remaining sauce for dipping. Makes 4 to 5 
appetizer servings.

 Chicago has a lot of things going for it: beautiful Lake Michigan, deep-dish 
pizza, the Bulls, deep-dish pizza, a wealth of architectural styles, 
ever-changing weather conditions (as Chicagoans say, "If you don't like the 
weather, wait a day") and deep-dish pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Philadelphia, it does not have a sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the city's deluxe double-crust pizza is a layer of cheese and sausage 
nestled between a top and bottom crust, but it can't be passed off as a 
sandwich. And though the Italian beef sandwich gets rave reviews from writer 
Calvin Trillin and comedian Jay Leno, few people know it's a local specialty 
and not something brought over from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Always eager to satisfy a need and point with pride to my home town, I created 
the Chicago sandwich for two. I'm not sure what Philadelphia's cheese and steak 
combo signifies, but this two-fister says "Chicago" in every bite. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a robust sandwich. It's perfect during these dazzling summer evenings 
when everyone wants to eat and play. And it has gutsy seasonings: onion, 
rosemary, garlic, oil, vinegar and mustard -- and anyone who knows Chicago, 
knows it's a gutsy city. CHICAGO CHEESE-PORK SANDWICHES 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 sprig rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 2 garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 (6-ounce) pork round bone steaks, trimmed of fat and bone 
</P>
<P>
 4 large slices Italian bread, 1/2-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet onion, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 4 slices Muenster cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Combine oil, rosemary, garlic and vinegar in bowl. Add pork and marinate at 
room temperature 1 hour. Pour marinade into medium skillet. Add pork and cook 
over medium heat until done, about 5 minutes per side. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange steaks on 2 slices bread. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. 
Top with onion slices, then cheese. Spread remaining 2 bread slices with 
mustard and close sandwiches. Wrap each in foil. 
</P>
<P>
 Place over smoldering coals of grill and heat until cheese melts, about 15 
minutes, or bake at 350 degrees about 15 minutes. Serve warm. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Some may find that each sandwich is enough for 2. Light eaters can 
halve ingredients, or make both sandwiches and refrigerate 1 (before heating) 
for a second meal. MANGO-PEPPER "SLAW" 
</P>
<P>
 1 ripe medium mango, peeled, pitted and cut into 1/2x1 1/2-inch strips 
</P>
<P>
 1 green onion, halved and cut into 1/2x1 1/2-inch strips 
</P>
<P>
 1 jalapeno chile, cored, seeded and cut into matchstick strips 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 
</P>
<P>
 Juice 1 lime 
</P>
<P>
 Place mango, green onion and chile strips in serving bowl. Combine salt, 
ginger, cumin and lime juice in cup. Stir well and pour over fruit. Stir slaw 
gently. Set aside 10 minutes for flavors to blend. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : This is fiery slaw. For tamer version, reduce jalapeno to 1 teaspoon 
minced.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Perfectly sun-ripened fruit is one of the great pleasures of summer. The 
following baked desserts count on the seasonal freshness of fruit to make them 
special.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of those old-fashioned bundt cakes where one slice is never 
enough.  
</P>
<P>
 LEMONY BLUEBERRY BUNDT CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/4 cups plus 3 tablespoons cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened

</P>
<P>
 Sift 3 1/4 cups flour with baking soda and salt onto sheet of wax paper. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar and lemon zest until light and 
fluffy. Add eggs and lemon extract. Beat until thick and smooth, 3 minutes. Add 
sifted flour and buttermilk. Mix well to combine. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss blueberries with 3 tablespoons flour to coat. Stir into batter with 
wooden spoon. Batter will be very thick. Transfer batter to greased and floured 
12-cup bundt cake pan. Bang pan on counter to settle batter. Smooth surface 
with spatula. Bake at 350 degrees until wood pick inserted in center comes out 
clean, 55 to 60 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove pan from oven and let cool on rack 10 minutes. Gently invert cake onto 
rack. Set rack on baking sheet. Brush warm cake with glaze, reapplying glaze as 
it drips onto baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Let cake cool completely. Can be made day ahead. Store at room temperature, 
covered airtight. Makes 16 servings.

</P>
<P>
 Zest 1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>

 Here, peach slices are sandwiched between a chewy, crunchy base and a crumb 
topping. Lightly brushing the egg white on the crumb topping gives the squares 
a crisp finish. The squares are best served the day they are baked, but they 
can be made a day in advance. Refrigerate overnight on baking sheet, arranged 
in a single layer, covered with foil.  
</P>
<P>
 CHEWY CARAMEL-PEACH SQUARES WITH PECANS 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 2 firm, ripe large peaches, peeled, pitted, thinly sliced, to equal about 2 
1/2 cups 
</P>
<P>
 White of 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
 Use mixer to cream sugar, butter and generous dash salt. Add 1 cup flour and 
mix until just combined. Reserve about 1/2 cup mixture for topping. Refrigerate 
until ready to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon remaining mixture into greased 9-inch square baking pan, distributing as 
evenly as possible. Press dough into thin, even layer using piece of plastic 
wrap or wrapping hand in small plastic food bag. Bake at 350 degrees until 
lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, dash salt and cinnamon in 1-quart bowl. 
Toss peach slices with flour mixture. Closely overlap peach slices over 
slightly cooled crust. Use all peach slices. They will cook down. Crumble 
reserved topping evenly over peaches. In bowl beat egg white with fork until 
frothy. Dab crumbs and surface with egg white. Scatter pecans over top. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned, about 50 minutes. Cool completely 
on rack, then refrigerate until chilled. Cut chilled pastry into quarters, 
transfer quarters to cutting board and cut each into 4 squares. Serve chilled. 
Makes 16 (2 1/4-inch) squares.

 The extra step of cooking the fruit before assembling is essential; I have 
tested this recipe without doing this and the juices were much too thin. The 
cobbler can be baked a day ahead, cooled and refrigerated uncovered. To serve a 
refrigerated cobbler, place in a cold oven, set to 350 degrees and bake, 
uncovered, until warm (not hot), about 12 to 15 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 OLD-FASHIONED RUBY FRUIT COBBLER 
</P>
<P>
 6 large firm plums, pitted, cut into 1/2 inch slices, to equal about 5 cups 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint strawberries, hulled and halved 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1 pint raspberries 
</P>
<P>
 Biscuit Dough 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla ice cream 
</P>
<P>
 Combine plums and strawberries in 12-inch skillet. Add tapioca, sugar and 
cinnamon. Gently toss until well mixed. Cook just until fruits simmer, about 7 
minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to shallow 8-cup baking dish. Scatter 
raspberries over top. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll out Biscuit Dough on heavily floured board to rough shape of baking dish. 
Remove excess flour with soft brush. Place dough on top of fruit and gently 
tuck edges down into fruit. Patch dough where necessary (dough does not need to 
cover entire surface of fruit). Place dish on jelly roll pan. Set in oven and 
bake at 425 degrees until crust is lightly browned and fruit is bubbling, about 
25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm topped with ice cream. Makes 8 servings.

HOME COOK: IT'S NOT JUST FOR INVALIDS ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't have to know how to bake to be remembered for making a fine summer 
dessert. Just make summer pudding, which requires no more cooking than a brief 
heating. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a total mystery why this delicious English specialty has never been 
popular in this country. Its convenience doesn't stop with the fact that it 
requires no baking. You can remold it, rechill it and serve it up to four days 
later, and it will still taste good. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's good for you. In 19th Century England it was called hydropathic 
pudding and was often served to invalids, because it is almost fat-free and 
easily digested. 
</P>
<P>
 I think raspberries make the best summer pudding, but lots of people love 
blueberries instead. Somehow, strawberries just aren't right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This pudding holds its shape and is easy to slice. It is sometimes served with 
unsweetened heavy whipping cream.  
</P>
<P>
 SUMMER PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 9 slices firm, fresh white bread trimmed of crusts  
</P>
<P>
 6 cups fresh raspberries or other berries, stemmed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 to 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Line 1-quart bowl or Charlotte mold completely with slices of bread. Fill in 
cracks with pieces of bread trimmed to fit, so inside of bowl is completely 
covered. Save enough bread to cover top. 
</P>
<P>
 Put berries in skillet and add sugar to taste. Cook briefly over medium-low 
heat, stirring gently to dissolve sugar and get berry juices flowing. Pour 
berries and juice into bread-lined bowl. Cover top with remaining bread slices. 
</P>
<P>
 Place saucer or salad plate on top and gently press down. Put weight on plate 
(28-ounce can of tomatoes works well) while pudding is settling and chilling. 
Refrigerate at least 6 hours. When ready to serve, turn onto platter. Makes 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 308 calories; 272 mg sodium; 1 mg cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 69 grams 
carbohydrates; 5 grams protein; 0.88 gram fiber.

AROUN THE SOUTH BAY: OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH A PARKING LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HISTORY IN THE BREAKING: On 6th Street in San Pedro, the one-story Gian Franco 
Building was reduced to rubble recently to make room for a 50-car parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the San Pedro Revitalization Corp. spent hundreds of thousands 
of dollars renovating the building, which is believed to have been built in the 
1920s, resident Frank O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency bought the building 
and property, as well as two surrounding parcels, for $1.22 million. At the 
time, merchants were pressing for additional parking in the San Pedro area. The 
agency's solution: the land occupied by the Gian Franco Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was controversial . . . but the community finally came to a consensus," 
said Jeffrey Skorneck, manager of the Beacon Street Redevelopment Project.

 TAKE 'EM TO COURT: There may not be enough room in Redondo Beach for the two 
of them, but they'll just have to find some way to work it out. 
</P>
<P>
 A Torrance Superior Court judge this week denied City Treasurer Alice E. 
DeLong's request for a restraining order against City Councilman Joseph 
Dawidziak. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, 60, requested the order after a shouting match in the councilman's 
City Hall office last month. The argument resulted from a memo written by 
Dawidziak that accused DeLong of possible ethics violations. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, who complained that Dawidziak had been documenting her comings and 
goings in City Hall, told the judge she needed to protect herself from his 
"violent, explosive outbursts."  
</P>
<P>
 But Judge John P. Shook said DeLong's complaint "doesn't even approach what's 
required for a permanent injunction" and ordered her to pay $2,682 in legal 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it sent a clear message that we're supposed to work these things 
out among ourselves," Dawidziak said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong left the courtroom disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I didn't know the law," she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A NEW START: After undergoing 10 operations to combat a disfiguring and 
potentially fatal disease, a 4-year-old Russian girl is saying goodby to her 
temporary home in Harbor Gateway and is on her way back to her hometown of 
Zelanadolsk, 350 miles east of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Baranova was afflicted with a giant hairy nevus, or furry mole, that 
covered most of her chest and back and had a high risk of becoming cancerous. 
Russian doctors had said they were unable to correct the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 But retired Palm Springs pediatrician Wayne McKinny met the girl and her 
mother during a tour of Russia and, with help from former international relief 
worker Ted Werner of Rancho Palos Verdes, arranged for them to come to the 
United States. Members of the First Christian Church of Torrance also helped 
the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 In operations at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and in San Diego, plastic surgeons 
cut away the mole and replaced it with skin grafts taken from other parts of 
the girl's body. Although some scars remain, they will fade as Eleanor gets 
older, McKinny said. Eleanor will return in two years for one more operation on 
her scalp. 
</P>
<P>
 And after 18 months in America, Eleanor and her mother, Roza Yagudina, 38, 
speak fluent English. Eleanor also has developed a fondness for American 
cartoon characters, particularly Tweety Bird and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew there were so many nice people," Yagudina said Tuesday as she 
and her daughter prepared to fly home. "God bless America."

 BYE TO BANDIT: He seized hundreds of pounds of marijuana and cocaine, won 
medals in the California Police Olympics and got his own baseball-style trading 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandit, the Palos Verdes Estates police dog, was put to sleep on July 20. The 
German shepherd was 9 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 During surgery in April to relieve back pain, Bandit's rear legs were 
paralyzed. He continued to move around with the aid of a cart with wheels. Two 
weeks ago, Bandit began to lose weight, and his owners decided to euthanize 
him, said his veterinarian, Chris Omoto. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held at noon Friday in Memorial Gardens across from Palos 
Verdes Estates City Hall. Bandit's ashes will then be buried in Beawyse Park, 
behind the police station. QUOTE OF THE WEEK

REMEMBERING THE HEARTACHE OF TERMINAL ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forced to evacuate his childhood home near San Pedro Bay during World War II, 
Kenji Yamamoto packed the only valuable possessions he had: his clothing, shoes 
and a portable radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a .22-gauge rifle and took it to the Japanese community hall" where it 
was confiscated by American soldiers, Yamamoto said. "They said they would give 
it back, but I never saw that (again.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Yamamoto, 76, now lives in Boyle Heights. He was among the last to see 
Terminal Island as a thriving 3,000-member Japanese community of fishermen, 
fish-cannery workers and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rumors that the village on Fish Harbor was a spy colony, American 
soldiers evicted at gunpoint all people of Japanese descent on Feb. 25, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 In 48 hours, the community was destroyed. Terminal Island was later turned 
into a military base, and Japanese-owned stores, fishing boats and other 
property were razed or taken over by outsiders or industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the island now stands as a slab of landfill in Los Angeles Harbor, 
Little Tokyo's Japanese American National Museum for the first time is 
revisiting the lost community through an exhibit of historic photographs and 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Island In Time: The Terminal Island Story" runs through Nov. 13.  
</P>
<P>
 The close-knit group of Terminal Island residents, who still hold reunions 
around Los Angeles County, formed a campaign committee earlier this year and 
raised more than $200,000 for the exhibit -- twice its $100,000 target, 
Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money has gone to pay for labor and equipment costs for the 
exhibit, which features 70 historic photographs and 40 artifacts, including a 
model of a Japanese fishing boat, a handmade box containing fishing hooks and 
bait, newspapers of that period and report cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Any remaining money will be used to establish a permanent Terminal Island 
collection and possibly allow for a traveling show, said Chris Komai, a museum 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Terminal Island group hopes mementos from the past will raise public 
awareness of their former community and their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people, even the people from Japan, don't know about Terminal 
Island," said Yamamoto, whose family moved there from Long Beach when he was a 
year old. He evacuated at age 25, a single man working for his brother-in-law's 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important for younger Japanese Americans to understand what their 
first-generation relatives -- the Issei -- had to endure during World War II, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit could encourage them "to carry on and appreciate what the previous 
generation did for them," Yamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, we couldn't live anywhere we want," he said. "There was a lot 
of prejudice and a lot of the whites didn't want to associate with the Oriental 
and minority."

 Since the Biltmore was razed in 1965, 13 ballot measures have been placed 
before voters to determine how to use the city-owned lot on The Strand between 
14th and 15th streets. In the latest vote in 1992, residents designated the 
land as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with plans under way for a grass and sand park, officials are considering 
putting the issue on the ballot one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Three City Council members said at a meeting Tuesday they have doubts that a 
park is the best use for the site, which is slightly less than an acre.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not altogether sure people knew what they were voting for on this thing," 
said Mayor Pro Tem Robert (Bergie) Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 The council plans to vote Aug. 9 whether to put the issue on the November 
ballot in conjunction with the statewide election and give voters another 
alternative -- to have 60% of the site designated for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 A park "can be a maintenance nightmare and it could be a security nightmare," 
said Councilwoman Julie A. Oakes. Although voters approved a park in 1992, 
Oakes believes the city's financial situation has worsened and said maintaining 
the park might be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a member of the Sierra Club for 20 years; I love parks," she said. 
But Oakes said similar parks in Venice have attracted crime. She prefers that 
only a portion of the site be made into a park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see perhaps a bed-and-breakfast and a nice outdoor restaurant 
that residents could use," Oakes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 to consider the issue at its next meeting. Mayor Sam 
Y. Edgerton was absent and Councilman J. R. Reviczky opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reviczky voted against the development of a park in 1992, he said the 
council must uphold that vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an elected official I'm forced to do things I don't necessarily agree 
with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the city's plans for the land in the past were houses, businesses, open 
space and combinations of the three. In 1991, residents voted to designate the 
land for commercial and residential use, but the city sat on the land in the 
face of a lagging real estate market. Parker Herriott, a Hermosa Beach 
resident, spearheaded a movement in 1992 to convert the lot into an oceanfront 
park. "They're rotten, dirty, filthy bums," he said after the vote Tuesday. 
"They don't believe in elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the park will continue as planned, despite the controversy, 
officials said. Construction, estimated to cost $89,000, is not expected to 
begin until November. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed design calls for granite pathways to meander through grassy 
knolls and sandy areas around the site, but council members said at least part 
of the park must be redesigned for safety reasons. Proposed sandy areas 
adjacent to The Strand could cause roller-skaters and cyclists to fall, and 
grassy knolls could allow lawbreakers to hide, said Herriott, who favors the 
safety modifications.

CULVER CITY ELECTRIC PLAN IS DEADLOCKED; UTILITIES: CITY COUNCIL IS UNABLE TO 
DECIDE WHETHER TO PURSUE A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF TAKING OVER SERVICE FROM 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. COMPANY OPPOSES THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, the question has been on the table: Should Culver City take over 
local electric service from Southern California Edison? 
</P>
<P>
 After a contentious four-hour public hearing Monday before the City Council, 
the question remains unanswered. Council members deadlocked over whether to 
even consider pursuing a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest was so great that the meeting had to be moved from the City 
Council chambers to the Veterans Auditorium across the street to accommodate 
the more than 130 residents who attended. 
</P>
<P>
 With Councilman Steve Gourley absent, the council split 2-2 on whether the 
city should do a detailed feasibility study on providing electric service to 
residents. The vote effectively shelved the proposal, although the matter could 
come up for further consideration with support of at least three council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Albert Vera proposed last September that a municipally run utility be 
explored because it might generate additional cash for the city. On Monday, he 
and Councilman James Boulgarides voted in favor of a feasibility study, but 
council members Mike Balkman and Ed Wolkowitz opposed the move. Gourley, who 
could not be reached for comment, has supported studying the city-utility 
proposal in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants who prepared a preliminary study on the subject said that although 
there would be operating losses immediately after the takeover, the financial 
risks would be minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, prepared by Sacramento-based consultants R.W. Beck & Associates at 
a cost of $24,000, concluded that the city could ultimately make a profit after 
buying out the utility's local operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison officials, however, assailed the Beck study. Tom 
Bryson, an Edison regional manager, said it is "seriously flawed by errors, 
incorrect assumptions and omissions." 
</P>
<P>
 The $225 million it would cost to take over the utility is so great, Edison 
officials said, that it is unlikely the city would ever realize a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Culver City would be not be able to match the swift and effective 
service provided to the city during last January's earthquake, Edison officials 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Vera proposed the Edison buyout last September, residents have organized 
to oppose it. Meanwhile, Edison has waged an all-out public relations campaign, 
sending questionnaires, letters and reports, one titled "Flaws in the R.W. Beck 
Report," to its Culver City customers. All but a few of the 27 speakers who 
addressed the council criticized the takeover idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should drop the whole thing and not waste any more money," said resident 
Margaret Clark. As a seven-year Edison customer, she said, she has had no 
complaints about the utility's service. Culver City, she said, is a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Hall-Esser, the city's chief administrative officer, said that although 
risks do exist, "the revenue potential is significant enough to suggest another 
analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Wolkowitz said he was worried about the cost to Culver City 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the users of electricity in this city," Wolkowitz said. "I'm concerned 
about the idea of stabilizing city revenue by generating revenue through 
members of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera criticized Edison's public relations blitz as "a cheap scare tactic." He 
stood behind his idea, saying the financial gains from a municipally run 
utility would greatly benefit the city. He disagreed with those who contended 
that the city could not provide adequate service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't give a damn about owning Edison," Vera said. "But if we did, we would 
do a better job."

TUGBOATS TAKE A BOW AT EXHIBIT; SHIPS: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEMORABILIA AT SAN 
PEDRO'S MARITIME MUSEUM REFLECT THE 'UNIVERSAL APPEAL' OF THE POWERFUL LITTLE 
VESSELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They're short, squat and not very glamorous, seemingly mere attendants to the 
great ships that ply the open seas. But without them, many of those great ships 
would be so much floating junk, unable to maneuver into ports to unload their 
cargo of goods and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are tugboats, the powerful little vessels that spend their lives pushing 
or pulling vastly larger ships where they need to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tugboats seem to have a universal appeal," says Jackson Pearson, assistant 
curator at the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in San Pedro and a former tugboat 
captain and harbor pilot. "They're like little Davids moving big Goliaths. They 
aren't glamorous, but they're vitally important." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, maybe tugboats are glamorous -- if by glamorous you mean having a 
television series based on your exploits. Most Americans may be too young to 
remember, but from 1954-57 the syndicated TV series "Waterfront" dramatized a 
tugboat called Cheryl Ann and its skipper, Capt. John Herrick, portrayed by 
Preston Foster, who chugged around Los Angeles Harbor encountering smugglers, 
saboteurs, escaped convicts and other waterborne bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson, the real-life skipper of the tugboat that portrayed the Cheryl Ann in 
location scenes for the TV series, doesn't remember running into any smugglers 
or escaped convicts when he was a tugboat captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't quite as exciting as it was on TV," Pearson says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pearson does have fond memories of tugs, so he and others at the Maritime 
Museum have put together an exhibit of photographs and memorabilia highlighting 
the Wilmington Transportation Co., the longest-operating tugboat company in Los 
Angeles. It is one of a series of "salutes to the maritime industry" planned by 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Phineas Banning, known as "the father of Los Angeles Harbor," 
Wilmington Transportation Co., or WTCO, has operated tugs in Los Angeles Harbor 
for more than a century. Banning started a harbor tug and barge business in 
1877, later incorporating it under the WTCO name. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the company, then run by Bannings' three sons, purchased Catalina 
Island and used the company tugs as both tugboats and passenger ships taking 
tourists to the island. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1919, the Santa Catalina Island Co. was bought by William Wrigley Jr., who 
got the tugboat company as part of the deal. WTCO remains a subsidiary of the 
Catalina company and still operates a fleet of six tugs in the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach. It is the oldest of four tugboat companies in the 
harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
 The tugboat exhibit will remain on display until the end of the year. The 
Maritime Museum on Harbor Boulevard at 6th Street is open Tuesday through 
Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

IMAGES OF L.A.; HISTORY: VAST COLLECTION OF FORMER NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER SHOWS A 
CENTURY'S WORTH OF FAMOUS NAMES, INCLUDING WILLIAM MULHOLLAND, CHARLIE CHAPLIN 
AND 'THE BLACK DAHLIA.'

 Delmar Watson narrows his eyes, looking through the row of binders for the one 
labeled gore.  
</P>
<P>
 He finds it and flips through the photos -- a catalogue of mayhem shot almost 
50 years ago. As the former news photographer points to a picture of a bloody 
and dismembered body, or a pair of ankles dangling over train tracks, he says: 
"Look at their shoes. Whenever I shot a corpse, I'd wonder if, when they put on 
their shoes in the morning, if they knew this would be the last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, 68, puts the binder back, and quickly grabs another. "Hey, let me show 
you these. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson can go on and on, and will do so if you give him the chance. But, with 
the exception of a photo exhibit here and there, few have had an opportunity to 
enjoy his private collection. Some of the photos were shot by his uncle, George 
Watson, a pioneer photojournalist. Others were willed to Delmar by colleagues, 
who knew he would take care of their treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's dream is to find the money, hopefully from corporate sponsorship, to 
open a "Photographers Hall of Fame" -- a museum that would be a fitting place 
for his archives. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he keeps his memorabilia in the office of his company, Images of the 
Past Inc., His home away from home is situated in a drab, green two-story house 
in Hollywood that he bought in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years the place has become a cluttered vault, containing nearly 2 
million photos, turn-of-the-century cameras, newspapers yellowed with age and 
old maps -- priceless records of 20th Century Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are photos shot by George Watson of William Mulholland's anguish over 
the failure in 1928 of the San Francisquito Dam near Castaic, in which more 
than 400 people died. Among George Watson's thousands of celebrity photos is 
one of a smiling Albert Einstein posing with a young Charlie Chaplin, both 
dressed in tuxedos. In the gore file are photos of the mutilated nude body of 
the aspiring actress known as "The Black Dahlia," whose murder almost 50 years 
ago remains one of Los Angeles' most famous unsolved cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmar Watson's dry sense of humor is evident even before he opens his mouth. 
Above the office entrance are three photos -- a former mayor of Los Angeles and 
two former Presidents with appropriate ID's underneath: "Tom, Dick, Harry." 
Although his hair is gray, his eternal enthusiasm and energetic manner make him 
appear 10 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson wears a rumpled white shirt and a loosened tie, and he has an amazing 
capacity to talk and talk -- dishing out anecdotes about his days as a 
photographer for the now-defunct Los Angeles Mirror, bemoaning the loss of 
family values in society and telling of growing up as a true child of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 His five brothers and three sisters all worked in the movies. "I was born 800 
feet from Mack Sennett's studios (near Silver Lake). They made a lot of 
comedies, and whenever they needed kids, they called us," said Watson. He said 
he had a lot of fun acting in about 300 films during his youth, playing Shirley 
Temple's goatherd friend in "Heidi," as well as a small part in the 1939 film 
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 But their father, Coy Watson, a casting director who got his start in the 
business training horses for Westerns, kept his children from signing contracts 
with the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father knew the business, and he knew that long-term contracts would ruin 
the kids," Watson said. "In those days, the studio owned you, and when you 
reached puberty, they didn't want you anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Photography -- and the ways of the pack rat -- seemed to be a hereditary trait 
in the Watson family. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle George Watson in 1917 became the first full-time photographer hired by 
the Los Angeles Times. Two years later, he shot the first aerial photos of Los 
Angeles, one of which ran the next day on the front page below a banner 
headline. In addition to shooting some of California's most spectacular news 
events, such as the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games, he founded the Los Angeles 
Press Photographers Assn. in 1935. In 1913, he invented the process by which 
pictures are put on microfilm, selling the rights for $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mind was inventive," Delmar Watson said of his uncle. "He didn't know how 
to take a picture of the city from 2,000 feet because it had never been done 
before. But nothing would stop him. He would try anything." 
</P>
<P>
 His uncle kept everything, said Delmar, from old cameras to press credentials 
from every major assignment that The Times sent him on. The other Watsons, 
meanwhile, were hoarding publicity stills from the movies they worked on, as 
well as memorabilia such as party invitations from Fanny Brice, Christmas cards 
from Lionel Barrymore and a hand-written thank you letter from director Frank 
Capra. 
</P>
<P>
 As he outgrew children's roles, Delmar started taking pictures, first for his 
high school yearbook. After a two-year stint in the Army as World War II was 
winding down, he got a job working the wire photo machine at Acme News Pictures 
(later taken over by United Press International). "That's where I learned how 
to crop photos, and what made a good picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his five brothers all became photographers in the Los Angeles press 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, Delmar Watson started working for the Los Angeles Mirror, covering 
everything from visits by foreign heads of state to grisly crimes and 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his more memorable assignments, he said, was covering the Kathy Fiscus 
tragedy. The entire nation was moved by the drama as rescue crews spent nearly 
two days and nights in April, 1949, trying to save the 3-year-old girl who had 
fallen 94 feet down an abandoned well in San Marino. Millions watched on live 
television as her lifeless body was retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our paper was lucky because we got a shot of the parents, holding each 
other," Watson said. "The television coverage also made it memorable because it 
was so new, and a lot of people ran out to buy televisions just to watch this." 
</P>
<P>
 During his career as a news photographer, Watson won awards from Life magazine 
and the Associated Press. He said he left the Mirror in 1958 because he knew 
the advent of television would diminish the importance of still photos. The 
days of the ambulance chasing news photographer, he observed, were quickly 
coming to an end. He worked with his five brothers, shooting publicity photos 
for clients such as real estate firm Coldwell Banker or air carrier Flying 
Tiger Line. He bought the house on Hawthorn Avenue in 1967 and started Images 
of the Past. Soon, documentary producers and filmmakers working on period 
pieces would call him to use his photos or to seek his technical advice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, he published "Quick, Watson, the Camera," a chronicle of nearly a 
century of Los Angeles history, which included photos taken by George Watson 
and Delmar and his brothers. He also edited an Olympic retrospective published 
in 1984 and a collection of movie stars' photos called "Goin' Hollywood 
1887-1987," published in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could spend about eight months there, just looking at stuff," said 
Nick Nixon, who publishes "I Collect Magazine," a monthly targeted at sports 
cards and comic book collectors. Watson has contributed 15 cover photos, 
including those of several sports legends, for Nixon's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's collection "is priceless," said Nixon, 40, who lives in Colorado. "He 
has it all -- the good, the bad and the ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like photographs," Watson said. "They take you back 
immediately. It's like a song you remember from high school. The minute you 
hear it, you're back."

AFRICAN DELEGATION ARRIVES IN INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-month delay, delegates from the West African nation of Sierra 
Leone finally have arrived in Inglewood for a two-week cultural exchange.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bo Sister City delegation arrived last week for a tour of the city's 
hospitals, public buildings and agencies, Inglewood spokesman Truman Jacques 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the delegation originally were scheduled to visit Inglewood in 
April, but a miscommunication between officials left them stranded at a Sierra 
Leone airport for more than a week. Bo officials viewed the incident as a snub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was frustrated and we got a different picture of America . . . that 
Americans don't fulfill their obligation," said PrinceBrima, the Sierra Leone 
News Agency bureau chief who is traveling with the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation had been promised plane tickets from an Orange County 
businessman with the consent from then-Sister City committee chairman Art 
Davis. But the deal fell through and the tickets were never sent, officials 
said. "It was confusing (about) who had the authority to do what," Brima said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul D. Eckles called the incident "a major embarrassment to the 
city of Inglewood" in a May 24 memo to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the council agreed to pick up the $22,000 air fare for the 
delegation, Jacques said. Normally, city funds are used to pay only for 
sister-city delegation accommodations and expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo officials say no animosity remains between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now understand that it wasn't the fault of the Inglewood City Council," 
Brima said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates are learning how the city operates, from running social programs 
such as the senior center to funding a redevelopment agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive thing about Inglewood is the physical layout and design of 
the streets and buildings, said J.K. Boima, town council president of Bo, a 
city with roughly the same population as Inglewood.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are badly in need of roadwork" and a new fire station, Boima said. JON

LAWNDALE TAKING APPLICATIONS FOR TAX EXEMPTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawndale officials are accepting applications for exemptions to the city's new 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.5% tax approved June 16 excluded senior citizens and low-income or 
disabled residents. But residents who qualify must apply for the exemption, 
said Thomas A. Devereux, director of community services for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no deadline for filing, the higher rates will begin to 
appear on residents' bills after Monday. Residents who file for exemption after 
the new rates go into effect will be eligible for a refund, Devereux said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications may be picked up at the City Hall finance department.

CITY HALL NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES; PARK UPGRADE, PLAQUE FOR SLAIN OFFICERS 
OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $226,000 renovation of Palos Verdes Estates Memorial Gardens, which received 
preliminary approval from the City Council on Tuesday, includes a bronze 
sundial and a plaque bearing the names of Capt. Michael Tracy and Sgt. Vernon 
Thomas Vanderpool, police officers who were killed by a gunman Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The council scheduled a public hearing on the renovations Aug. 9, when it is 
also expected to give final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to pay for the renovations with donations, and a committee 
appointed by the mayor has raised about $5,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents and planning and parks commissioners at Tuesday's meeting were 
concerned that, like several city fountains, the memorial would fall into 
disrepair. Some also complained that the design is too flashy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is neither Washington, D.C., nor Beverly Hills," resident Bunny 
Jezewski said. A short stone column in the gardens lists the names of three 
Palos Verdes Estates residents who lost their lives in World War II. As part of 
the renovations, residents who died in all U.S. and other wars would be 
commemorated.

 Sworn officers and other Police Department workers will receive 3% pay raises 
under a new contract approved Tuesday night by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council imposed the one-year contract after failing to reach an agreement 
with the 31-member Police Officers Assn. after more than a year of 
negotiations. Other municipal employees received 3% pay raises early this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Dave Blitz, head of the association, said he was disappointed with 
the contract. Police officers were hoping for raises of 5% to 6%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer's salaries will range from $34,800 to $43,600 under the new contract.

CITY HALL NEWS: HAWTHORNE; CITY TO STUDY WHETHER TO RETAIN FIRE DEPT.

 The City Council voted Monday to study whether to keep the city Fire 
Department, join the Los Angeles County Fire District or cooperate with 
neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash-strapped city slashed more than $800,000 from the city Fire 
Department budget this year and eliminated several department management 
positions, Interim City Manager James A. Algie said. The cuts have delayed 
regular maintenance of fire equipment and the scheduled replacement of a fire 
engine, said Hawthorne Fire Capt. Mike S. Mungovan. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which could cost as much as $20,000, will determine how much money 
will be saved if the city changes its fire service, Algie said. The study is 
scheduled to begin in the next few weeks. JON GARCIA

TOPICS / HEALTH; HARD-HITTING ADVERTISEMENTS PUSH PRENATAL CARE; GROUP USES A 
VARIETY OF INFORMATIVE METHODS, INCLUDING SHOCK TACTICS, IN BID TO GIVE BLACK 
BABIES A GOOD START IN LIFE. AND THE CAMPAIGNS SEEM TO WORK.

 The colorful, carefully detailed ad is hardly the sort associated with babies: 
a fetus curled up in an umbilical cord, suckling a grotesquely oversized bottle 
of malt liquor for nourishment, a tear squeezing out of one closed eye. "Her 
Birth Defects Came In 40 oz.," reads the ominous slogan across the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo assaults viewers rather than giving them the warm fuzzies, and that 
is exactly the effect that Zola Jones is after. "We have a serious problem with 
alcohol, and it needs to be addressed seriously," said Jones, project director 
of Great Beginnings for Black Babies, which, in collaboration with Daniel 
Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, provides prenatal care and information 
services. "It's not negative, it's provocative." 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Jones and other Great Beginnings staffers plan to launch their 
latest media campaign, this time aimed at reducing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome among 
the black population. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-hitting ads -- more than 4,000 of them -- will go up this summer all 
over Los Angeles County on billboards and buses, and in shopping malls and 
subway and rail stations. The warnings against drinking during pregnancy will 
also be disseminated in community lectures, forums, workshops, radio ads, 
health fairs and exhibits over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Great Beginnings generated some controversy with its last campaign, 
a graphic depiction of the effects of a mother's drug use on a newborn, and the 
new campaign is also controversial. At a recent unveiling of the ad, some 
health educators objected to its implication that all African Americans swill 
malt liquor, which is cheap and potent. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fact is that Olde English, Colt 45, these companies target blacks in 
their marketing," Jones said. "We have to target just as hard. We're out there 
competing with lots of other ads and billboards, the malt liquor ones among 
them."  
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will run in South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, Inglewood, 
Compton, Pasadena and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jones had her way, the word would be spread even farther. A retired nurse 
for the county health department, Jones and a core staff of about six have 
worked tirelessly since 1990 to reduce the black infant mortality rate, which 
is startlingly higher than that of other ethnic groups. (In 1991 in Los Angeles 
County, the mortality rate for blacks was 15 per 1,000 live births; for whites, 
8.7; for Latinos, 6.7, and 4.9 for Asians and Pacific Islanders.) 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of Great Beginnings have paid off. Last year, the state reported 
that black infant mortality was down from 21 per 1,000 in 1989. Officials cited 
Great Beginnings as one of the reasons for the improvement.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In its four years, the nonprofit organization has grown dramatically. It now 
has a center staffed by public health nurses at Daniel Freeman Hospital, as 
well as a family and community service center in the Hawthorne Mall. It is 
providing 400 women with free prenatal and parenting services. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said her organization must now focus on morbidity -- the rate of disease 
in a designated population. Pressing problems among black babies, she said, are 
low birth weight, developmental and emotional problems, congenital heart 
problems and other effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morbidity is just as important as mortality -- it affects education and a lot 
of other things later on," Jones said. "We want to continue to be the best we 
can be."

TOPICS / RELIGION; SCHOLAR PROBES BELIEFS OF ANCIENT ISRAELITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ancient Israelites were flailed for centuries by biblical prophets as 
shameless, compulsive idolaters who scoffed at God's laws. Now a Jewish scholar 
hopes to give them a much-belated fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziony Zevit of the University of Judaism in Bel-Air, who has been awarded a 
prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship that begins next month, said he will use the 
time and money to go beyond the biblical polemics to determine the range of 
beliefs of the Israelites, the people whose religion eventually gave rise to 
modern Judaism and Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems to be emerging from his eight years of research, Zevit said in an 
interview, "is that the monotheists (believers in one god) were a small and 
insignificant movement until after the destruction of the first Jerusalem 
Temple -- not the mainstream religion from which everybody was falling away" 
when the biblical prophets excoriated them for backsliding. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, Zevit said, that the Bible is not representative of what most 
Israelites were thinking 25 centuries ago because the later victors in the 
ideological struggles obscured the beliefs of polytheists, who believed in many 
gods and who apparently dominated Israel's early history. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought that polytheism can be nothing other than stupidity, so they 
couldn't represent it fairly," said Zevit, professor of biblical literature and 
northwest Semitic languages at the university, which is aligned with the 
Conservative branch of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects to be helped by inscriptions and other material from ritual 
sites discovered by archeologists in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran archeologist William Dever of the University of Arizona, in a 
telephone interview, praised Zevit as eminently qualified in archeology as well 
as historical-critical analysis of the Bible -- which Dever called a rarity 
among scholars specializing in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is deeply committed to Judaism but is willing to look at new sources, no 
matter how disturbing," Dever said. Zevit's history of Israelite religion "will 
be a landmark study," Dever predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the books of what became the Hebrew Bible, called the Old Testament by 
Christians, were written between 1100 and a period shortly after 586 B.C., when 
the temple of King Solomon, called the First Temple, was destroyed by the 
Babylonians. 
</P>
<P>
 The biblical texts represent the viewpoint of the priestly elites of 
Jerusalem, monotheists who ultimately prevailed over Israelite polytheists, 
Zevit said. The Judaism of rabbis and synagogues developed several centuries 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit said that important inscriptions have been found at three sites in lands 
once populated by the early Israelites that link Yahweh, the God of the Bible, 
and Asherah, "the name of the goddess we know very well from Canaanite 
mythology." The Canaanites were Semitic neighbors of the ancient Israelites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bible usually links the Canaanite gods Baal and Asherah, but here we have 
sites where Yahweh and this goddess are clearly associated," he said, 
indicating they were once worshiped together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Israel's neighbors in that time seemed to have their own 
national gods," he said. "The Israelites may have been hedging their bets or 
had divided loyalties: 'The God of Israel takes care of these things and these 
other gods take care of other things.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Jerusalem Temple built during Solomon's reign was supposed to be the only 
place of worship for the Israelites, but to the south in Arad have been found 
the remains of a temple-fortress that functioned for almost 300 years during 
the Israelite period, he said. "Furthermore, at the temple at Arad they find 
curved standing stones, which are specifically prohibited in the Pentateuch 
(the Five Books of Moses)." 
</P>
<P>
 A 10th-Century temple was also excavated at Hazor. The Bible has to be seen as 
a collection of partisan documents -- sometimes preaching to the converted but 
also written to persuade others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the final authors of the book of Kings were advancing an answer to the 
question of why the Israelites were then in enforced exile: "Here is the 
history that proves that you have blown it consistently. Why? You haven't 
obeyed these laws and these laws, and you can't plead ignorance. Why? Because 
God sent the prophets." 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to the biblical picture that monotheism had reached the status 
of an orthodoxy that backsliders or pagans resisted, "Israelite religion was 
very heterogeneous in a lot of its practices -- much more than the biblical 
literature would allow us to suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not enough to say, 'Oh, that's not Israelite religion, that's paganism,' 
" he said. "Paganism is the name we give to something we don't like. . . . The 
struggle that monotheism underwent to be accepted was long and immense." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit said he will spend a year working primarily in two Jerusalem museums 
during his fellowship and visit several archeological sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people out there -- Jews, Christians, believers, nonbelievers, 
affiliated, non-affiliated -- still take the Bible seriously as an intellectual 
monument to the past," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are very curious about it," he added. "The religious can be curious 
about what their spiritual forerunners believed. Atheists and agnostics can be 
interested in what their intellectual forerunners thought. 'Ah,' they say, 
'that's the religion I don't believe in but I didn't know about it before.' "

<TEXT>
<P>
 California State Dominguez Hills has announced that the school will consider 
establishing an academic department for Chicano/Latino studies. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of faculty, staff, student and community representatives will 
meet to discuss policies concerning the Chicano/Latino curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills students can now earn a bachelor's degree or a minor in 
Mexican American studies by taking classes in several departments, said school 
spokesman Greg Klerkx. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, the Latino population at the school has increased from 
14% to 22%, the fastest growing segment of the campus student body, Klerkx 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the school's Latino population has grown, so has interest in having a 
separate department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the students are looking for is an academic home for the study 
of Chicano and Latino culture," Klerkx said. MARY GUTHRIE

<P>
 A Los Angeles County program has been cited as a national model for decreasing 
violence in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Office of Education's Teacher Expectation and Student Achievement 
program, begun in 1971, was recently recommended by the New York State Board of 
Regents as a model training program to help teachers promote school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The program concentrates on helping teachers become more aware of the needs of 
their students, addressing such issues as teacher bias and ethnic diversity. It 
was cited in a study conducted by the New York State Education Department and 
the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing decreased revenues and public outcry, Palos Verdes Library District 
Trustees have voted to cut $336,000 from their furniture budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The district originally voted to spend $1.25 million on furniture as part of a 
plan to renovate the Peninsula Center Library, and $93,984 worth of furnishings 
already has been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the watchdog group Save Our Libraries criticized the 
trustees for approving the expenditures, which included $274,000 worth of 
artwork and trash cans that cost $343 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees voted on July 21 to cut the remaining money earmarked for furniture 
to $820,350.  
</P>
<P>
 Savings, in part, will come from refurbishing and refinishing existing chairs 
and tables rather than purchasing new ones. Other chairs will have fabric 
instead of leather. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR AREA; EPA PLAN FOR PORT USER FEES CHALLENGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are challenging an Environmental 
Protection Agency proposal to impose fees on vessels that pollute the air as 
they enter Southern California waters. 
</P>
<P>
 In efforts to meet the federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, the EPA has 
suggested charging ship operators up to $10,000 per ton of nitrogen dioxide 
emitted, starting from a distance of 100 miles from port.A three-tiered fee 
system for marine vessels, effective beginning in 2001, would be enforced only 
in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Dykman, an environmental scientist with the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department, said the port supports reduced air emissions in the South Coast Air 
Basin, which has the worst ozone pollution in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, the department believes that the EPA Federal Implementation 
Plan, which also aims to regulate locomotive and truck emissions, will affect 
cargo transport throughout the basin, hurting jobs and the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykman calculated that a modern container ship entering one of the ports for a 
36-hour stay would face a fee of more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened with the costs of retrofitting their vessels to meet new standards, 
she said, many shipping lines will simply divert their cargo to a port without 
the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the two harbor departments are meeting to devise 
alternatives to be submitted to the EPA by an Aug. 31 public comment deadline.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; PARENTS PICK UP 48 WHO VIOLATED CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents of 48 minors were called to pick up their children at the Carson 
sheriff's station last weekend, after deputies began strictly enforcing the 
city's 10 p.m. curfew.  
</P>
<P>
 Many parents were surprised to find that their teen-agers were not home in 
bed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd call them, and they'd say, 'Joey's asleep in his room.' . . . The 
majority of them had no clue," Sgt. Steve Bellino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's new policy, deputies hold minors until their parents or 
guardians come to the station to get them. Officials hope that enforcing the 
curfew will cut down on crimes such as graffiti and vandalism.  
</P>
<P>
 The curfew requires that anyone under the age of 18 be en route to a specific 
destination or have written permission from a parent to be out after 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, curfew violators were cited and released, but youngsters often 
did not tell their parents about the citations. By requiring parents to pick up 
their children, officials can be certain that guardians are aware of 
violations, Bellino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine for curfew violations can be up to $1,000 and/or six months in jail, 
police officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies will continue through early September to pick up minors on Friday and 
Saturday nights. On weeknights, deputies issue citations, but parents are not 
called to pick up their children. MARY GUTHRIE

LITTER PATROL

 Every Monday morning in an alley off Rose Avenue in Venice, the homeless go to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Greater Rose Avenue Cleanup Effort, headed by a team of homeless 
people and sponsored by the St. Joseph Center, a support center for homeless 
and low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, which began in June, half a dozen homeless people armed 
with gloves, bags and brooms sweep the alley from 4th Street to 7th Street and 
deposit the trash in dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the work is done, they sit down to a free meal at the nearby Bread and 
Roses restaurant, which was started by the St. Joseph Center to serve the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though people are of low income and homeless, they like to do something 
for their community," said Jeanette Rowe, a staff member of the St. Joseph 
Center. "They live here. This is their community, although they are identified 
as a problem in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers and participants say the program is accomplishing its twin goals -- 
to help the homeless develop a sense of responsibility for their surroundings 
and to establish a rapport with the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This effort has really helped to make a difference," said Patrick Dolan, 
director of the program, which is known by its acronym, GRACE. "The neighbors 
have given us some positive responses from the work we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Herb Yates, a 59-year-old homeless man: "It keeps me occupied. It makes 
the alley look better, and people don't complain anymore about the homeless 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 If the cleanup effort continues to be successful, the St. Joseph Center hopes 
to extend it to two times a week and increase the number of homeless people who 
pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the shelter and the homeless are happy with their effort, which 
participants now call "Patrick's Posse." Said Jose Jimenez, a 67-year-old 
homeless man: "I enjoy being a part of Patrick's posse. I guess I've just got 
that volunteer spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors also appear pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Venice resident Candy Ibarra2 "It shows that (the homeless) have a heart 
and they give to the city when the city does not give them anything in return."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; FLOOD, LANDSLIDE CONTROL FUNDS OKD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency 
Services have approved the city of Malibu's request for just over $8 million to 
mitigate flooding and landslides in Las Flores Canyon and to reopen Rambla 
Pacifico. 
</P>
<P>
 The city qualified for the funds because of the November brush fires, which 
exacerbated existing problems and created long-term hazards to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The total project cost is estimated at $11 million, with Malibu's share being 
roughly $700,000. Los Angeles County will pay about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest project, estimated at about $10.5 million, is intended to 
stabilize the slide that closed Rambla Pacifico in 1984. Plans include 
buttressing the hillside, possibly with pilings, and using stones and boulders 
to combat erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also include improving a bridge at Pacific Coast Highway and Las Flores 
Canyon Road, at a cost of about $350,000.  
</P>
<P>
 A third project, estimated to cost about $150,000, will improve the storm flow 
out of Las Flores Mesa Canyon by building a debris basin and constructing an 
underground culvert. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

<P>
 Twirling a wooden staff festooned with silver ribbons with the deftness of a 
drum majorette, Ellaraino led a curious group of parents and children into a 
world few said they had visited before: storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a make-believe world that has something for people of all ages, said the 
actress-turned-storyteller, her radiant smile undimmed by dubious looks from 
the audience. "You know why I love to tell stories? Because in stories, you can 
be anything you want to be. Anything!" 
</P>
<P>
 And for the next hour, they are, adults and children alike, assuming roles as 
goats, old women, leopards, horses, even yams. Lighthearted though it was, the 
session at the Head Start center on Western Avenue had serious intentions of 
planting seeds of literacy, a knowledge of ancient African culture, and perhaps 
most important, a sense of family togetherness in participants.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to encourage families to start traditions by telling personal 
stories," said Ellaraino, colorfully dressed in African garb and surrounded by 
African dolls, figurines and other tools of her trade. "It doesn't matter that 
you haven't heard any before. You can start where you are." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly storytelling workshop is the newest and most creative program 
launched thus far at the Head Start Family Service Center at 6801 S. Western 
Ave. The year-old facility provides a variety of services aimed at improving 
family life for its low-income clients. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only three Head Start Family Service Centers operated by the county, 
the center opened last year in response to the 1992 riots and the need to 
address such problems as illiteracy, substance abuse and unemployment with free 
classes and job training. The center serves qualifying families living in the 
area bounded by Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, the Harbor Freeway on the east, 
Adams Boulevard on the north and Imperial Highway on the south.  
</P>
<P>
 The pilot storytelling program, says social worker Cheryl Darden, brings 
together several important elements in a single, enjoyable activity. "It fits 
in with what we do here because it serves the whole household," said Darden, a 
family service specialist at Head Start. "It's a nice activity for families 
that doesn't cost anything, either." 
</P>
<P>
 During the workshop, Ellaraino literally kept her audience on their toes. She 
called upon them to help act out stories, gathered them in semicircles for 
"ring" games, and paraded them around the room in a dramatization of an African 
folk tale about an old woman trying to cross a river. 
</P>
<P>
 Each tale imparted a message: the travails of "The Knee High Man" encouraged 
listeners to be satisfied with their physical appearance, while the " hujambao 
" chanting game called upon each participant to describe what they want to 
achieve in life. Hujambao is a Swahili greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be an adult," Darlene Walker said with a laugh during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the 15 other participants, Walker began the session sitting in a chair 
with her son in her lap, but when the storytelling began, she was quickly on 
her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," said Walker, who has been coming to the center since it 
opened and describes herself as a "neighborhood nanny." "The good thing is, it 
got me out of the house and away from the television set." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellaraino, a veteran film actress who turned to storytelling six years ago, 
said she hopes to build family solidarity, something she said has eroded too 
much over the years in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got inspired to do this after I heard my son tell a story his father had 
told him," she said. "He told it so vividly, so well. The seed was planted for 
me. . . . I realized that you can be very creative about doing things with 
family, which is something we've forgotten. You don't need money. You only need 
imagination."

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; GANG TRUCE CREATES CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nine months of bloody gang warfare, a tenuous cease-fire appears to have 
brought peace -- at least temporarily -- to the troubled Oakwood neighborhood 
of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Social service workers are applauding an "unofficial truce" reached last month 
between black and Latino gangs, whose feud has claimed at least 15 lives since 
September. But police wonder whether the truce will last or merely mark a pause 
in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Carson, a Los Angeles County probation officer, said the community should 
use this window of opportunity to develop jobs and social programs for young 
people involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said the youths agreed to meet three days after the June 10 drive-by 
slaying on Venice Boulevard -- outside of the Oakwood neighborhood -- of two 
Latino teen-agers, neither of whom was believed to be a gang member. Community 
outrage had pressured gang members to halt such killings, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gang members) wanted to stop it themselves. They just didn't want to be the 
first ones to make the move," Carson said. "They just had a definite lack of 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said he and another probation officer led the youths to a neutral site 
in South-Central Los Angeles, to talk about their differences. No treaties were 
signed or firm promises made, but Carson and others believe the talks were an 
important first step. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood has seen no major gang violence since, police and social 
workers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're now seeing all the guys out in the parks, which you didn't see 
before," said Bill Martinez, executive director of Community Youth Gang 
Services in Los Angeles. "One gang is still at one end and another is at the 
other end, but there is now some communication between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to the kids to decide when this thing is over . . . but things look 
very good right now," Martinez added. 
</P>
<P>
 But police are taking a cooler attitude toward the cease-fire. Lt. John 
Weaver, of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang CRASH unit, said that 
gang members may have called a temporary truce because the violence was leading 
to increased police patrols, which in turn were interfering with drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we're out there, it interferes with their business," Weaver said. 
"People who go into the neighborhood to buy drugs will probably get discouraged 
if they see us there." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the motive, Carson and others are hoping the talks will soon lead to 
something even better. 
</P>
<P>
 "For nine months, we had people getting shot and it was a war zone," Carson 
said. "What we have now is an unofficial truce, and that means we're taking it 
on a day-by-day basis." SCOTT COLLINS

COMMUNITY NEWS: KOREATOWN; JUSTICES REJECT CASE ON RIOT-DAMAGED STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Koreatown-based advocacy organization has suffered a major setback in its 
campaign to help grocers escape city regulations imposed on rebuilding efforts 
after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 18, the Korean-American Grocers' Victims Assn. lost its bid to 
overturn a March state Court of Appeal decision when the California Supreme 
Court refused to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has argued that the regulations, which include requirements 
such as security guards and limited hours of operation, are unfair because they 
are not applied to grocers whose establishments were not damaged in the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "These regulations are sporadic and they penalize these people for being 
unfortunate," said Mehee Kim, an association spokeswoman. "This is not a 
victims' issue; it is a community issue and a fairness issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said the Supreme Court decision was very discouraging to the grocers 
represented by her group and the Korean-American Legal Advocacy Foundation, 
which had assisted with the legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to decide what to do next," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's leaders said they will monitor similar cases that dispute the 
fairness of store regulations in Oakland and Hermosa Beach. Kim said those 
cases might lead to precedents that could be favorable to the local grocers' 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is backing an Assembly bill that would exempt liquor store owners 
whose businesses were destroyed during the riots from a range of requirements, 
including the hiring of full-time security guards. The Assembly passed the bill 
and sent it to the state Senate, but Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan asked to 
have it put on inactive status, promising to seek a local solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the eight grocers who brought the suit, and the dozens of others 
affected by the regulations, will have to hope for the best, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot we can do," Kim said. GEOFF BOUCHER

SANTA MONICA / CITY COUNCIL ROUNDUP; DOGS HAVE THEIR DAY; OFFICIALS HAVE A 
CHANGE OF HEART ON PANHANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dogs in Santa Monica won the right to romp in city parks, beggars were 
prohibited from panhandling near automated teller machines, and voters may soon 
decide a bond measure to pay for a much-needed Santa Monica police and fire 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions on the three disparate but significant matters were reached -- in 
all cases unanimously -- at an action-packed Santa Monica City Council meeting 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearings drew dozens of dog lovers, but less than a handful of 
speakers on the panhandling issue. The police bond measure, arguably the most 
important of the three, was considered after 11 p.m., following testimony from 
fewer than a dozen speakers. Going to the Dogs 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members clearly enjoyed delving into the dogs-in-the-park issue 
-- perhaps in part because there are 4,000 registered dogs in the city, many of 
whose owners cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Canines were banned from city parks for 50 years until a dog owners group 
called Santa Monica Dog organized a two-year effort to gain park access for 
their pets. The vote Tuesday was, among other things, to make permanent a 
six-month trial period that has allowed dogs in city parks, provided they are 
kept on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also creates permanent off-leash dog areas in Joslyn and Marine parks, 
both of which are in the southern portion of Santa Monica. Dog owners extolled 
the virtues of the two off-leash parks, crediting them with everything from 
fostering community spirit to ridding the area of prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Howard Israel, who described himself as unsociable, said he was 
astonished to see how many at the hearing were friends he had made while 
walking his pooch. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also set a minimum fine of $50 for those caught without a scooper, 
plastic bags or other means of removing dog droppings. Failure to control your 
dog could bring a stiffer $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, hours at the off-leash areas are 7:30 to 10 a.m. and 5 to 
8:30 p.m. weekdays. On weekends the hours are 8:30 to 11 a.m. and 5 to 8:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 To the relief of seven homeowners whose back yards abut the Marine Park dog 
run, the city is going to move the off-leash area to another part of that park. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining neighbors of the Joslyn Park run did not get relief, however. 
Linda Wilson said she had achieved her fantasy of owning a home adjacent to the 
park -- where, she said, she used to live contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then the dogs came," Wilson said, "dozens of them barking early in the 
morning and late at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Dog owners, however, noted that parks are filled with noise from tennis and 
basketball courts, as well as from children playing. "You wouldn't close parks 
to children just because they make noise," said Callie Warfield, who said she 
considers her two dogs her children. Panhandling at ATMs 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, any effort to place restrictions on homeless residents has met 
with stiff opposition. Yet there was hardly a murmur Tuesday night when the 
council unanimously passed a law banning solicitation, which includes 
panhandling, within 80 feet of automated teller machines, in outdoor dining 
areas and on buses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also be illegal to ask people for spare change while they are driving 
or while they are in city parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The panhandling issue has been aired many times before, but it has been 
considered one of the trickiest matters to deal with because panhandling is a 
form of legally protected free speech. Also, many in the city believe further 
difficulties should not be imposed on the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 However, City Atty. Marsha Jones Moutrie, who had previously expressed 
reservations about the legality of the restrictions, said an argument could be 
made for them in court. The rules must apply equally to all, which means, for 
example, that Girl Scouts won't be able to sell cookies near an ATM. 
</P>
<P>
 The stated reasons for the restrictions are public safety, preventing traffic 
tie-ups and respecting the privacy of restaurant patrons and those who use 
public transportation. Retro Policing 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Webb would have felt at home in Santa Monica police headquarters, but 
pretty much everyone agrees that the station has gone from past-its-prime to 
dangerously inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Police Chief James T. Butts said he warned the city when he was 
hired almost three years ago that the facilities were antiquated and might not 
withstand a major emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts was proved right on Jan. 17, when the city's 911 system failed for six 
or seven hours after the Northridge earthquake. There was no backup system 
because the station lacks the technical capacity to maintain one. 
</P>
<P>
 Firetrucks had to roam the city looking for fires to put out, and police 
operated with one walkie-talkie out of a camper seized in a drug raid. 
Fortunately, no calamities resulted from the communications blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 The police station, built in the 1950s for 166 employees, is occupied by a 
466-member force, Butts told the council. The jail, the second oldest in the 
state, lacks security features, making escape attempts a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 To build a station that would consolidate police and fire headquarters and 
emergency dispatch, and give elbow room to the police force, the city would 
need a $33-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday passed the first of three measures needed to place that 
bond issue on the November ballot, amid concern that it would interfere with 
efforts to pass a school parcel tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Dennis Zane urged the council to delay the police bond question 
until 1996, while going ahead with design and environmental review of the 
station to avoid delaying its construction. But council members said they were 
bound by their word to the voters this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In signed ballot arguments for a plan to revamp the Civic Center, council 
members successfully urged voters in June to approve a zoning plan that paves 
the way for construction of a police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture presented to us is pretty grim and shocking," said Councilman 
Paul Rosenstein. "We have an intolerable situation now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some speakers argued against the bonds because the possibility of 
decentralized police substations had not been explored. Nor had efforts been 
made to see what residents prefer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts said that a city the size of Santa Monica doesn't need fully equipped 
substations, which, he said, would be more expensive and require more officers 
in administrative posts. After the hearing, however, Zane promised that he and 
others would continue their effort to delay the police bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane seemed to find allies in Councilman Antonio (Tony) Vazquez and Mayor Judy 
Abdo. "My major concern is for the school parcel tax," Abdo said.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; THE HIGH-ALTITUDE HIGHWAY; ABOUT 2.8 BILLION POUNDS OF 
AIR CARGO MOVES THROUGH LAX EACH YEAR, FROM APPAREL TO EQUIPMENT TO ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Hasenauer is in a hurry. He has to get to Los Angeles International 
Airport to meet a flying horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually Hasenauer is meeting five flying horses, all of them inbound to LAX 
from Auckland, New Zealand, aboard an Emery Worldwide Airlines DC-8 cargo 
plane. Their owners have paid something in the neighborhood of $5,000 each to 
have them shipped to the United States by air, instead of saving money by 
putting them on a ship for a two-week transpacific voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Hasenauer's job to pick them up at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hasenauer, president of an animal air-shipping company called Jet Pets 
Inc., hops in his pickup truck and heads for a dilapidated former Nike missile 
site in a remote corner of LAX. The DC-8 lands and then taxis onto the apron, 
and with Hasenauer carefully eyeing the cargo, handlers start unloading -- 
first some pallets piled high with bulk cargo and then the horses, which are in 
large open-topped wooden shipping boxes, three in one box, two in the other. 
They're accompanied by a New Zealander groom, Bernie Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett says the horses did just fine. Top shape. No problems. They didn't 
even get airsick, although he admits it's a little hard to tell if a horse is 
airsick, considering that horses can't throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handle about 700 or 800 horses a year," Hasenauer said. "A lot of horses 
get sent to Japan or Australia for races or shows. They're flying all the time. 
Some of them have more flying miles behind them than most people do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands more horses pass through LAX on domestic flights every 
year. So do sheep, goats, fish, cattle, parrots, chickens -- well, just about 
everything that walks, crawls or flies. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the living, breathing part of the LAX air cargo world. 
Although most people think of LAX as a place that moves people, it also moves 
an astonishing array and volume of freight -- about 2.8 billion pounds of cargo 
every year -- everything from horses to textiles and soup to nuts, a little 
more than half of it packed in the bellies of commercial airliners along with 
your luggage, the rest in cargo aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX is now the busiest air cargo center in the nation. Every day about 7 
million pounds of air cargo goes through LAX on 1,000 arriving and departing 
cargo and cargo-and-passenger flights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of like a flying warehouse in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. Department of Commerce figures on international imports and 
exports -- which account for just under half of all LAX air cargo -- the 
largest imported commodity coming through LAX was apparel, with 47,000 tons 
arriving in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. The biggest 
export from LAX was 33,000 tons of vegetables, fruits and nuts. In that same 
year, 18,000 tons of computer equipment and parts worth about $2.4 billion were 
exported through LAX, and 24,000 tons of computer equipment worth about $3.3 
billion were imported. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were 7,000 tons of taps, valves, bearings and gaskets imported and 
exported, along with 6,000 tons of live animals and meat, 550 tons of feathers, 
artificial flowers and wigs; 16,000 tons of fish and crustaceans; 1,400 tons of 
musical instruments; 1,100 tons of arms and munitions; 1,700 tons of beverages, 
spirits and vinegar; 2,600 tons of jewelry and coins; 208 tons of animal and 
vegetable fats and oils. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 There were even 57 tons of a category the Commerce Department describes, 
somewhat curiously, as "umbrellas, walking sticks and whips." 
</P>
<P>
 About 43% of LAX air cargo exports go to Asian countries, with Europe and 
Australia/Oceania following at 35% and 11%, respectively. About 70% of LAX 
imports come from Asia and about 17% from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also about 175,000 tons of mail, domestic and international, moves through LAX 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that's valuable and can fit in a plane, alive or dead, moving or not 
moving, comes through here," said Rick Wells, assistant chief of airport 
planning for the Los Angeles Department of Airports.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the air cargo is illicit. In May, U.S. Customs agents discovered a 
ton of Colombian cocaine hidden in a shipment of flexible rubber tubing inbound 
from Mexico aboard a chartered cargo plane. So far this year, customs agents 
have made four seizures of drug shipments hidden in air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 All imported cargo passing through LAX is subject to U.S. Customs inspection. 
But with so much cargo moving through, officials can only inspect a portion of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a daunting task," spokesman Michael Fleming said. "We have limited 
resources on what we can examine. The vast majority of cargo is legitimate, and 
we don't want to impede legitimate cargo, which could cause economic impacts. 
So we work selectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Air cargo is an important if little known -- to the public at least -- aspect 
of airport operations, Wells said. It doesn't have the glamour of passenger 
operations, and thus it traditionally hasn't gotten as much attention from 
airport officials as the passenger side of the flying business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as LAX air cargo tonnage has increased by about 50% in the last decade, 
LAX cargo facilities have expanded to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway Freight Services Inc., a contract cargo handler for 22 airlines that 
operate in and out of LAX, recently expanded its facilities. Federal Express, 
Japan Airlines and Qantas also plan to expand cargo handling facilities at LAX. 
Currently about 1.6 million square feet of air cargo terminal space is 
available at LAX, about two-thirds of it used for international import-export. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 people in Los Angeles are directly employed in air cargo-related 
jobs with airline and freight companies. That represents about 10% of the total 
number of people who work at LAX. Airport officials estimate the "economic 
impact" of LAX air freight in the Los Angeles region at about $11 billion per 
year, or about $9,000 for every ton of air cargo that passes through. 
</P>
<P>
 True, LAX's 1.4 million tons of cargo annually pales in comparison with the 75 
million tons of goods that move through the Port of Los Angeles by ship every 
year. But the value of LAX import-export goods -- about $34 billion -- is a 
little over half of the value of goods that move through the port. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, air cargo may be relatively small in quantity. But pound for 
pound it's some of the most valuable cargo in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, larger airlines with numerous LAX flights handle their own air 
cargo, but for smaller or foreign-based airlines with limited numbers of 
flights it's more cost-effective to contract out their cargo handling 
operations to companies such as Gateway Freight Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost anything that's for sale, anything people want, anywhere in the world, 
comes through here," said David Abe, chief operating officer of Gateway, which 
handles nearly 600 million pounds of air cargo annually, making it the largest 
contract air cargo handler at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 Abe is standing in a 38,000-square-foot warehouse, one of five cargo handling 
centers Gateway operates at LAX. In the vast, high-ceiling building with row 
upon row of shelves, cargo waits to be put on a plane or picked up for 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are pallets of pearl onions and stacked boxes of rhubarb. There's a box 
of live koi fish being shipped from Monterey Park to Seattle. There are boxes 
of lamb and venison from New Zealand and Australia, large slabs of tanned 
leather, a film canister bound for Hollywood from Portugal, boxes of men's 
belts from Italy, sealed boxes of unknown goods from India bound for the Target 
Stores of America, "special handling" boxes marked flammable and corrosive.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every single day it's something different," said Mark Wood, Gateway terminal 
manager. "We've had cars, reptiles from Africa, birds. Once we had a bear that 
was going to the Los Angeles Zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Human bodies -- dead human bodies -- also constitute part of LAX air cargo. 
Exact figures aren't available, but airport spokesmen and air shippers say that 
every year hundreds of human corpses pass through LAX, in coffins inside 
shipping boxes marked "human remains," bound for burial in other states and 
countries. They are handled like any other piece of air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sending goods by air freight isn't cheap, compared to sea or truck or rail 
shipping. Prices vary widely, depending on the weight and bulk of the shipment, 
but generally air freight costs three to 10 times more than shipping by sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Some items, such as sea urchins bound from California to the sushi restaurants 
of Japan, or prepared fugu fish from Japan bound for the Japanese restaurants 
of California, have to get from Point A to Point B fast or they'll spoil. At 
other times, market conditions, not perishability, make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a store owner selling winter jackets and they're going like hot 
cakes and you need more of them, they have to get here fast," Wells said. 
"Sure, it costs more to send by air, but they won't do you any good if they get 
here two months from now." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need a shipment by tomorrow, then cost isn't really that much of a 
consideration, is it?" said Wayne Gatewood, office manager at Rainbow World 
Transport in Inglewood, one of about 300 freight forwarding companies in the 
Los Angeles area.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, for some people cost really isn't a consideration. A few months 
ago, for example, Gatewood's company shipped a 48-foot horse trailer to Berlin 
by air freight at a cost of $17,000 -- at least three or four times what it 
would have cost to ship by sea. Gatewood figures that people who can afford to 
air ship horse trailers probably don't worry too much about money in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatewood's company also has shipped Harley-Davidson motorcycles to Italy, and 
Ferrari cars from Italy, along with 1,200 pounds of explosive detonators and 
some Italian space satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes people simply run out of time and have no choice but to ship by air. 
That's what happened with Gary Harper and his $30,000 Gatling machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper is a Ramona gas station owner who belongs to a military re-enactment 
group called the Gordon Highlanders, who wear the uniforms of Scottish soldiers 
of the 1880s. They were scheduled to participate in a ceremony in Scotland, and 
Harper wanted to take his 4,000-pound Model 1874, .45/70-caliber Gatling gun. 
The problem was that he only had a week, and cargo vessels couldn't get there 
that fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, it would have cost Harper about $3,000 each way to air freight the 
Gatling gun, but only $300 to $400 by sea. But Northwest Airlines took a liking 
to his group and "helped us out" on the freight charges, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a time problem," Harper said. "Besides, every time I've ever shipped 
something by sea there's been a problem. The shipment gets damaged, or it gets 
wet; it's always something. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, air cargo is the only way to go."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: LATE-NIGHT SNACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transplanted New Yorkers always complain that there's no place to eat late at 
night around here. All the restaurants close by midnight, they say, just when 
things would be heating up in the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they're wrong. The next time somebody complains about the South Bay's 
late-night restaurant scene in the wee hours of a Saturday, take them to the 
Nutwood Cafe in Inglewood, which is open until 4 in the morning on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nutwood is the new occupant of an old Boulevard Cafe located on the ground 
floor of a medical building. Patricia Estis took it over just seven weeks ago, 
and hired Rod Morris, a friendly Bostonian who was tired of his job in the 
legal profession, as manager. Estis has retained the original Boulevard Cafe 
chefs, Thomas Lambert and Jimmy Whitaker, who have been cooking at the site for 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 From the coffee shop atmosphere you might not expect the pronounced Southern 
influence here. At breakfast, one of the big sellers is the Southern 1 ($4.95), 
three fried chicken wings with two eggs and a choice of grits, rice, hash 
browns, or biscuits and gravy. Eggs are also teamed up with catfish ($6.50), 
hot links ($5), pork chops ($6) or a salmon patty ($6.50). 
</P>
<P>
 The crunchy, peppery fried chicken dinner ($7.25), consisting of three pieces 
of your choice, comes with rice, two vegetables and corn muffins. Tender beef 
short ribs ($8.95) are another highlight. Perhaps the restaurant's most popular 
dinner entree, available as a special on Sunday and Monday, is baked game hen 
($7.95) with a stuffing made of corn bread, chicken broth, bell peppers, 
onions, celery, garlic, sage and thyme. 
</P>
<P>
 For $4.95, the Nutwood offers a changing daily lunch special such as oxtails 
(Wednesday), smothered chicken (Thursday) or barbecued ribs (Friday). The 
specials give you a choice of two side dishes like black-eyed peas, corn, yams, 
potato salad, and macaroni and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nutwood Cafe is at 504 E. Nutwood Street, Inglewood. (310) 674-9684. Open 
seven days, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday and Saturday nights also 11 p.m. to 4 a.m.

NOTEBOOK / ROB FERNAS; EL SEGUNDO ADVANCES TO AMERICAN LEGION DISTRICT FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a lineup stacked with South Bay all-stars, El Segundo's American Legion 
baseball team will attempt to win its third District 19/Area 4 title in four 
years today. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo, the only unbeaten team remaining in the double-elimination 
tournament with a 3-0 record, will play either Torrance or Gahr at 5 p.m. at 
Blair Field in Long Beach. Torrance and Gahr met Wednesday night, with the 
winner advancing to today's final. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory will give El Segundo the title, which it won last year and in 1991. 
If El Segundo loses, a second game would follow tonight to determine the 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo (25-9) put itself in commanding position Tuesday night with a 2-1 
victory over Gahr. Phil Costello pitched a three-hitter and the team scored 
both of its runs in the fifth inning on a sacrifice fly by Scott Albin and a 
run-scoring single by Mike Poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Costello's performance continued El Segundo's impressive pitching in the 
tournament. Bill Brown threw a five-hitter Saturday in a 9-1 victory over La 
Serna, and four pitchers combined on a three-hitter Sunday in a 19-1 rout over 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key has been our defense and our pitching," said Coach John Stevenson 
said, adding that the team has benefitted from a deep staff bolstered by the 
addition of Albin, an all-star pitcher from Redondo High. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where the pitching depth helps out," Stevenson said. "It doesn't help 
too much in the high school season, but it helps out in these types of 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson said Dan Croxall, who has pitched only one inning in the tournament, 
will start today's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, El Segundo received a boost last week when Steve Rawson, an 
all-star third baseman from Redondo, joined the team. Rawson, who had been 
playing for the Mary Star Connie Mack team, is playing right field for El 
Segundo and had three hits Saturday against La Serna. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Morgan Ensberg, another all-star from Redondo, had four hits, 
including a home run to center field, in El Segundo's 19-hit barrage Sunday 
against Torrance. Kirk Mayer also had four hits, and Paul Bartolucci had three. 
</P>
<P>
 The area champion advances to the state tournament Aug. 4-6 in Upland. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The 11th annual Slam-N-Jam National Invitational basketball tournament ended 
with an entertaining final last Thursday as New York Riverside Church edged 
Kansas City Blue, 56-53, at South Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-capacity crowd included Kansas Coach Roy Williams, who hopes to sign 
Derek Hood, a 6-foot-8 forward from Kansas City's Central High. Hood was named 
all-tournament and recently was chosen one of the top 10 senior prospects in 
the nation by Blue Chip Illustrated. His list of potential colleges includes 
Kansas, Duke, Iowa, UCLA, Kansas State and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Riverside Church continued its impressive play this summer -- the 
team has won several prestigious tournaments -- behind a strong front court led 
by 6-8 Vasila Estinov and 6-6 Tyrone Grout. Estinov won the Slam-N-Jam's 
three-point shooting contest and was named all-tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the all-tournament team included Mater Dei sophomore Schea Cotton, 
Fontana junior Corey Benjamin and seniors Paul Pierce of Inglewood, Jamar Reid 
of Carson, James Brown of Long Beach Poly and Tommy Prince of Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 Benjamin won the dunk contest, beating Hood in a dunk-off. Cotton was 
unable to defend his dunk title after being poked in the left eye during a 
game, an injury that required stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the tournament's most remarkable players was Baltimore's Shawnte 
Rogers, a 5-5 point guard who has been called "Mugsy Bogues with a jumper." 
Rogers helped Baltimore rally for an 90-87 overtime victory over Washington, 
D.C., in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Moore of South Torrance looked at home in the three-point shooting 
contest, finishing second to Estinov in a shootout after advancing through two 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, played at South and West Torrance, attracted 57 all-star teams 
and more than 600 players from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former Hawthorne High defensive back Omarr Morgan, The Times' 1993 South Bay 
Back of the Year, had two pass breakups, three solo tackles and two assists 
Saturday night for the South in a 7-7 tie with the North in the Shrine All-Star 
football game at Citrus College. The game featured many of the state's top 1994 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Lundquist, starting center on the Loyola Marymount women's basketball team 
for the past two seasons, has transferred to DePaul. The 6-5 Lundquist, a 
junior, led the West Coast Conference in blocked shots and ranked second on 
Loyola in scoring and rebounding last season. She set an NCAA record for most 
blocked shots in a game with 15 against Western Illinois in 1992. Lundquist, 
from Frederic, Wis., reportedly wanted to attend a school closer to home. 
DePaul is located in Chicago. Lundquist's departure opens the door for Emily 
Hart, a 6-4 freshman from Sacramento, to become Loyola's center. The Lions were 
7-20 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Millinder, a former pro soccer player who coached the El Camino College 
men's and women's teams in recent years, has been named coach of the Loyola 
Marymount women's soccer team. Millinder's post is a new full-time position 
established before Loyola's second season as an NCAA Division I team. Peter 
Novakovic, who coached the Loyola men's and women's teams, will continue to 
coach the men's program. Millinder, 35, guided the El Camino men's team to 
state titles in 1987 and 1992, and led the women's team to the state title in 
1990. . . . Gary Ferrin, an assistant last season, has been named Loyola's 
softball coach. He replaces Steve Combs, who coached the Lions to an 11-30 
record in one season. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay Stingers roller hockey team, recent winner of the California Cup 
junior gold division title, is seeking sponsors in order to compete in the 
North American Championships in St. Louis on Aug. 27-30. The team, composed of 
area teen-agers, needs to raise more than $10,000 to make the trip. Interested 
parties should call J.J. Van Niel at (310) 378-7828 or (310) 534-3100. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gardena Recreation and Human Services Department is starting a women's 
adult basketball league, with games tentatively scheduled to begin Sept. 8 at 
Rush Memorial Gym in Gardena. At least six teams are needed to form a league, 
which will play on Thursday nights. Information: Evette Benjamin on Monday 
through Thursday at (310) 217-9598.

REGIONAL REPORT; PALOS VERDES ESTATES; CITY TO HONOR 150 OFFICERS AT BARBECUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates, where two police officers were killed on Valentine's 
Day, plans to send out invitations Monday for a barbecue honoring more than 150 
police officers from surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Feb. 14 shootings of Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 57, and Capt. 
Michael Tracy , 50, sent shock waves through the small Palos Verdes Estates 
Police Department, officers from neighboring agencies stepped in to protect the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 To thank those officers, the city will hold a Sept. 10 barbecue at Skunk 
Hollow that is estimated to cost several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The cost) is relatively minor compared to what they did for us," said Bill 
Yeomans, city finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy and Vanderpool were killed when gunman David Fukuto burst into a 
Torrance Holiday Inn meeting room during a motivational seminar for Palos 
Verdes Estates city officials. After the two officers were shot, other officers 
wrestled Fukuto to the ground. Fukuto died of head injuries and asphyxia in the 
scuffle, said Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who ruled that the use of 
force in subduing Fukuto was justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 23 Palos Verdes Estates officers were given time off to grieve, 77 
Torrance police officers, 57 sheriff's deputies, 33 Redondo Beach officers and 
10 officers from other cities such as Hermosa Beach and Los Angeles helped out. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors of each city also will be invited to the barbecue, along with 
elected officials, city employees and police officers from Palos Verdes 
Estates.JEFF KASS

PEOPLE: CHAMPION WINDSURFER ALSO CHARTS A COURSE FOR SUCCESS IN COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance windsurfer Mariel Devesa has glided across wind-whipped waters from 
San Pedro to Maui to become the women's national champion, but the journey 
hasn't always been a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last five years, the 19-year-old El Camino College student has 
balanced not only her colorful windsurfing board, mast and sail but the demands 
of a busy school schedule, often racing from class to the windy shores of 
Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro to practice her moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Devesa's discipline has brought her high marks at the college and more than a 
few victories at sea. Her parents' home is dotted with plaques and trophies 
marking her achievements in the sport, a combination of surfing and sailing 
invented in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the freedom of windsurfing," says Devesa, one of the country's 
youngest champions. "You're being powered by nature and you're out on the 
water. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Devesa and several other award-winning windsurfers will sail in 
the UP Sports Windsurfing Expo and Race at Cabrillo Beach, an event that 
combines competition and clinics designed to educate spectators. Devesa will 
compete in the races around buoys and give a speech about women in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The course is along the same shores in San Pedro where Devesa frequently hops 
on her lightweight board, clutches the wishbone-shaped bar that wraps around 
her transparent sail and leans back over the cold, murky water as she rushes 
over the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Devesa frequently practices the tacks and jibes -- turns into and away from 
the wind -- she hopes will one day make her a world champion or an Olympic gold 
medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 To become the world champion, Devesa must windsurf past many women from 
Europe, where windsurfing is among the most popular sports. At CabRillo, she 
frequently sails past seamen with years more sailing experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's great," says Art Moore, 52, a Malibu resident who frequently makes the 
drive to Cabrillo to windsurf within a splash's distance of dozens of other 
sailors on weekday afternoons. "She's definitely one of the best out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Windsurfing wasn't always easy for Devesa. She learned to sail nine years ago 
when her parents loaded a single board and sail onto their RV and drove for 
days down the coast of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Devesa, her parents and her older sister, Monica, took turns learning 
to maneuver the clumsy board and sail in the warm Mexican waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the South High School honor student began making regular trips 
to Cabrillo with her parents to practice the sport. After school let out in the 
afternoons, Devesa's mother, Elsa, 46, and father, Celso, 54, drove the family 
to the beach, where the four of them practiced riding short, hot-rod-style 
boards near the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Devesa soon tackled the tricky task of turning the board and began racing 
alongside veteran windsurfers. Several years ago she began competing in local 
races, and this year, with the financial support of several sports companies, 
she traveled as far as Korea for a competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was over clear Hawaiian waters last year that Devesa won the national 
championship. She sailed past about 24 other expert women windsurfers in three 
kinds of races. The women had traveled to Maui after winning regional races 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a great feeling because I had worked so hard for it," Devesa 
said. "Afterward, I just went, 'Wow, I'm the national champion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes even national champions have to do homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before a recent Hawaiian competition, Devesa sought out a public library 
to finish work for her speech class. While many competitors stretched on the 
beach, warming up before the contest, she researched news events that have 
occurred on her birth date. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard," she said. "I'd wake up really early in the morning to read and 
then study more every night. Everybody else would just go out and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 She continues to struggle maintaining that balance. Take the time she 
dislocated her knee while trying a high-flying windsurfing trick off a remote 
beach in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 With the closest hospital hours away and the possibility of sharks lurking 
below the cold water, Devesa thought: "Oh gosh, I have to take my finals next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 And she still earned straight A's on the exams.

FIREFIGHTERS: THE ROLE OF FAMILY TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Diane Cameron's comments on July 7 regarding Gordon Dillow's 
June 23 article "In the Line of Fire": 
</P>
<P>
 Nepotism should not be confused with tradition. The phenomenon, as she so 
calls it, that is highly prevalent throughout the state of California is due to 
tradition, not nepotism. Nepotism is favoritism extended toward relatives. 
There is a branch of government called civil service that makes sure the 
testing process is fair for everyone involved and that favoritism does not 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who are still fortunate enough to be part of the brotherhood of 
firefighters know that knowledge, hard work and dedication are the ingredients 
to career advancement, not nepotism. There is a comprehensive testing process 
one must go through in order to advance their career. 
</P>
<P>
 I have watched many of my peers dedicate years of sacrificing and hard work to 
advance their careers, and most of them have no relatives in the fire service. 
Most of them have been drawn to the fire service due to tradition, not 
nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition is the transmission of knowledge, opinions, doctrines, customs, 
practices, etc., passed on from generation to generation. When one grows up 
surrounded by tradition, and is so proud of his father as a role model, who 
also had a firefighting father as a role model, tradition plays a very big part 
when one ponders on what to do with his life. 
</P>
<P>
 These men are "pristine heroes," and the media glamorize them not because of 
nepotism or tradition, but because they lay their lives on the line to protect 
life and property. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dillow's cover story about my family appeared, it was about tradition, 
not nepotism. Perhaps if Diane had stayed with the Los Angeles Fire Department 
longer than a year, with a little hard work and dedication, she too could have 
advanced her career and passed on the tradition of the Fire Service or even 
become a role model for one of her family members. That is the "flip side of 
the coin." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 P.S. Many, many thanks to Dillow for his article and to Ken Hively for his 
great photography. In the name of tradition, this memento I am sure will be 
passed on to another generation of firefighting Schneiders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am the wife/mother/daughter-in-law/aunt of the firefighters mentioned in 
Gordon Dillow's article "A Family Tradition" (South Bay, June 23), and I am 
highly offended by the reaction by Diane Cameron in the July 7 letters column. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, I would like to say that "nepotism" in its proper context refers 
to a family member taking advantage of a position to hire other family members 
(even if they are unqualified). If she had truly understood the article about 
my family's inspiration and dedication, she might not have been as quick to 
react and place blame for her own lack of achievement in the one year she 
served with the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 California fire departments have worked hard to give equal opportunities to 
females, including modifying older stations to accommodate female employees. 
</P>
<P>
 My three sons and two nephews gained positions on fire departments by hard 
work, studying constantly, taking tests (and sometimes being bypassed, only to 
study harder the next time). Not one of them received any accolades or special 
attention because their grandfather, fathers, or uncles were also firefighters. 
It was their own diligence and efforts that got them on to the respective fire 
departments for which they work, not familial dispensation. They have earned 
their careers and the respect of their co-workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Good firefighters are good team members who do not point fingers at others for 
their own lack of success. Each of our family members has achieved success 
through each of their own achievements, not through some "good ol' boy" network 
as Ms. Cameron implied. 
</P>
<P>
 I am proud that my sons and nephews respected their grandfather and fathers 
enough to choose a similar career and follow an honorable tradition. I am proud 
that each of them worked hard to achieve their own goals on their own merit. 
The newspaper article was a tribute to my husband's 40-year career of fire 
service with the city of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 In all fairness, she did get one thing right: I am proud to stand behind my 
"pristine heroes," as she put it. I've stood behind them when it took a lot of 
studying and disappointments trying to get on departments. I've stood behind 
them when they came home exhausted and done without sleep. I've stood behind 
them when their families have missed them. I've stood behind them when their 
lives have been endangered by natural and unnatural disasters. I've stood 
behind them when they attended fellow firefighters' funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ms. Cameron, I'll continue to stand behind them because they continue to 
serve our community honorably and quietly. They don't complain. They don't 
blame others. They do their job.

CITY HALL: REMOVAL OF HARBOR COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is certainly a sad day for Harbor area residents. Wilmington resident 
Gertrude Schwab has been removed from the Harbor Commission by Mayor Richard 
Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 We all know how important the Harbor Department and Harbor Commission are to 
those of us who live in the Harbor area, and we all know that members of the 
Los Angeles City Council have a direct influence on the mayor's appointments. 
So why isn't Mrs. Schwab being reappointed? 
</P>
<P>
 There can be only two reasons. Our councilman, Rudy Svorinich Jr., either has 
no influence with the mayor's office, probably due to a lack of respect, or he 
did not want Mrs. Schwab reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, it is us, the Harbor area residents, who are the losers. Once 
again, as in the past decade, our voices are not heard at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, we have only one member, out of five commissioners, who is a Harbor 
resident. True, the port is owned by the city of Los Angeles, and all residents 
of the city need representation. But the port has a more direct effect on us 
than it does on a San Fernando Valley resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense says that at least two or three Harbor Commission members should 
be Harbor residents. And common sense says that our councilman should fight in 
order for our voices to be heard.  
</P>
<P>
 If Mrs. Schwab was not capable of performing her duties as commissioner (and I 
know that she was more than capable), then replace her with another Harbor 
resident, not someone from the Eastside or the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A great many residents from Harbor Gateway, Harbor City, Wilmington and San 
Pedro are capable and willing to serve as commission members. Surely, our 
councilman can make certain that we are fairly represented. He's not doing much 
these days except collecting a paycheck, so that's the least he could do.

OUT AND ABOUT / C.C. BROWN'S: SUNDAE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 C.C. Brown's ice cream parlor has had its share of licks over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recessions, wars and competition from national chain shops, the 
legendary ice cream parlor has managed not to melt away from its historic home 
on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The parlor was founded in 1906 by Clarence Clifton Brown, an Ohio-born candy 
maker who brought his trade and tools to Southern California in a covered 
wagon. He originally set up shop at 7th and Hill streets in Downtown Los 
Angeles. The parlor moved to its current location in 1928, complete with its 
original booths and metal serving dishes, which keep the ice cream cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown distinguished himself among competitors by concocting toppings that 
tasted more like candy than syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, chemist John Schumacher started buying into C.C. Brown's, acquiring 
it from Brown's son, Cliff, in 1963. Schumacher continued to run the business 
just as generations remembered it, until his death earlier this year. Today, 
the parlor is still family-owned and operated by his wife, Jo Ellen, and their 
children, Heidi, Heather and Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old-fashioned ice cream parlor where everything is homemade," said Jo 
Ellen Schumacher. "We have really tried to preserve things the way Mr. Brown 
would have wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has served as a set for a number of films and television programs 
such as "Highway to Heaven." It has also made its way into David Hoffman's 
guidebook, "The Joy of Pigging Out," which includes only 24 ice cream vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 C.C. Brown's offers more than seven dozen types of sundaes. The menu offers 
vanilla, mocha, chocolate and strawberry ice cream as well as lemon sherbet. 
Three hot toppings, fudge, caramel and golden mocha, are available. Sundaes 
range from $4.95 to $5.75, depending on the selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice cream is also available by the scoop for $1.25 (small) and $1.75 (large). 
</P>
<P>
 C.C. Brown's ice cream parlor, 7007 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. Hours are from 
1 to 10:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 1 p.m. to midnight Friday and 
Saturday. Closed Sundays. Information: (213) 464-9726. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

SPORTS; POOL IS KURZA'S BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is an Olympic hopeful doing sleeping in a tepee on a Malibu ranch? 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the answer, you have to understand Brian Kurza. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza's swimming career has taken many turns: from a sought-after high school 
recruit in Chicago, to an illustrious collegiate career at UCLA, to a battle 
against drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza was a four-time All-American at UCLA in 1989-90 and 1992-93. He has the 
school's second-fastest time in the 50-yard freestyle (19.35 seconds) and ranks 
third in the 100-yard freestyle (43.30). 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza had the school's name tattooed on his left hip. He also has a tattoo of 
the American Flag on his right shoulder and his fraternity's name, Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon, on his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian has always been a free spirit," said former Bruin coach Ron Ballatore, 
who recently accepted a job at Brown University after UCLA dismantled its 
swimming program. "He was a great team swimmer for us and did a great job on 
relays. He had a lot of spirit and fight. He really cared about his teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kurza's ambition to be the best carried him into trouble outside the pool. 
Kurza acknowledged he was a heavy marijuana user and beer drinker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a very insecure person," he said. "I had to always prove myself as the 
biggest partier. I remember bragging to a friend that I smoke more pot than 
anyone in my fraternity." 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying problem, Kurza said, was his desire to impress others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed with people for the wrong reasons," Kurza said. "During the 
last four months, I've taken a step back and took an honest look at myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I saw was a pathetic weak-hearted person. I've decided to stop making so 
many excuses and start living a new life." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza received his first warning after getting kicked off the U.S. national 
team for drinking during the 1989 Pan Pacific Games. 
</P>
<P>
 During his sophomore season in 1990, a depressed Kurza sought guidance from 
Ballatore, who advised him to seek psychiatric help. He returned to Illinois 
for 14 months, where he entered hospitals that specialized in alcohol and drug 
dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he had a problem," Ballatore said. "He was missing practice and he 
wasn't going to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was in the hospital, we called every week to check up on him." 
</P>
<P>
 After 3 1/2 years of sobriety, Kurza had a relapse a day after the Northridge 
earthquake. With his college eligibility exhausted, Kurza could not turn to the 
pool for solace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times where I wanted to wrap my car around a pole," Kurza said. 
"My problems didn't exist when I had pot or alcohol to medicate me." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza received a second warning on Feb. 20, when a family friend committed 
suicide four days before Kurza's 24th birthday. Kurza, who said he contemplated 
suicide, decided it was time to do some soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had several run-ins with death where I was crying for attention," he said. 
"But I decided to straighten out my life because I couldn't put my family 
through another suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 For five months, Kurza lived at a friend's house. In late June, he drove up 
the coast to Rio Carrillo State Beach to camp overnight. Kurza spent six hours 
whittling and waiting for guidance from a higher being. The next morning, Kurza 
crossed Pacific Coast Highway and began hiking up the steep and barren 
hillsides. As a hawk circled above, he followed telephone lines until he met 
the caretaker of a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing a place to stay, Kurza was pointed toward Dry Gulch Ranch where he met 
Maureen Ward, a retired sex therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, you don't see strangers walking down the hillside," said Ward, 
whose ranch could best be described as 15 minutes outside nowhere. "I couldn't 
figure out where the hell he came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he was an athlete who planned to compete in the Olympics. My first 
boyfriend competed in the Montreal Olympics so we had this commonality." 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch is owned by Ward and her husband Carter Ward, a self-employed 
mechanical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was impressed with Kurza, Maureen Ward initially did not offer 
the wayward swimmer a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kurza stumbled back toward the main road to PCH, only to pass through Camp 
Hess Kramer, a summer retreat for Jewish youths. Located at the camp was a 
25-meter swimming pool suitable for training. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza returned to his friend's home and began to inquire about part-time jobs 
at Hess Kramer. He was offered a position as a swimming instructor at 
neighboring Gindling Hilltop Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Kurza talked the Wards into allowing him to sleep in a tepee 
on their ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have seen my dream and they want to be part of it," Kurza said. "It's 
all happening for a reason and that reason is for me not to lose in '96." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza stares at the stars inside his 15-foot high tepee. His workout consists 
of running dirt paths and climbing a 50-foot rope. Carter Ward has started 
constructing an outdoor weightlifting facility. There is even talk by Carter 
Ward to build an Olympic pool for Kurza. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurza demonstrated his potential in his first race back, winning the men's 
50-meter freestyle Saturday during the Janet Evans Invitational at USC. A false 
start delayed the 50 free finals. As a referee walked by, Kurza commented: "Get 
away from my lane ref." 
</P>
<P>
 When the referee disqualified Francisco Sanchez of Venezuela, Kurza said: 
"That's it ref. Get rid of that foreigner." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being out of shape, Kurza swam 23.78 seconds to edge friend Jim Wells 
of the Trojan Swim Club by one-hundredth of a second. After seeing Maureen Ward 
waving her cowboy hat, Kurza turned and saw his winning time on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see at it first because the sun was in my eyes," Kurza said. "The 
50 is a drag race. You just get up with an attitude and swim." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mark Henderson of Cal: "So you decided to walk down from the mountains 
and swim a race." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballatore, who is coaching Team Bruin, was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a big victory," Ballatore said. "You don't need to be in 
shape to swim a good 50. He hasn't trained at all. It's probably wise he 
doesn't go to nationals." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. National Championships are Aug. 14-19 in Indianapolis. Kurza, who may 
enter the event, said his competition would come from David Fox of North 
Carolina State, Seth Pepper of Arizona, Joe Hudepohl of Stanford and former 
Bruin Tom Jager.

NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS; SATURDAY'S SENIOR BOWL IS CANCELED AFTER FINANCIER MIMS 
BACKS OUT 
</P>

<P>
 The Chris Mims Senior Bowl, scheduled for Saturday at Compton College, was 
canceled because Mims did not fulfill his financial obligation to the all-star 
football game, organizer Jerry Weiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner said he has made several attempts to contact Mims but has not heard 
from the former Dorsey High and current San Diego Charger lineman. Mims was in 
the third year of a four-year contract to sponsor the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did he advise me that he was not going to fund his share of the 
game as he has done since 1992," Weiner said. "It's a sad disappointment for 
the 90 players and approximately 60 cheerleaders who were going to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them have been terribly shocked and frustrated because they could not 
have the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Mims was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax Coach Terrel Ray and his staff had organized and run practices for the 
West team last week. Among Westside players scheduled to compete were defensive 
back Kamon Minor (Fairfax), defensive tackle Jose Jimenez (Venice), linemen 
Gregory and Steven Samarge (Venice), linebacker Michael Weber (Kilpatrick), 
running backs Che Johnson and Chris Phillips (Dorsey), quarterback Jovon Jiles 
(Crenshaw) and lineman Norman Ysaguirre (Dorsey). 
</P>
<P>
 "This game is very important to the community because several players have 
received scholarships," Ray said. "I don't blame Mims because he has flipped 
for the bill for the last two games. Things happen in people's lives, and you 
can't always do the things you would like to do." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Steven Pulley of St. Monica and Danny Ragsdale of Murphy were the top Westside 
athletes in the Air 7 Quarterback Challenge July 16 at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, organized by former Palisades High assistant Steve Clarkson, 
attracted 68 quarterbacks and their receivers from as far north as Sacramento's 
Bear River High and as far south as San Diego Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks were tested for throwing ability, accuracy to receivers during 
pass routes, scrambling techniques, rapid fire (two throws within 15 seconds) 
and read-and-react drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik of Los Alamitos won the competition, tying or taking first in 
three of the five events. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulley, a two-year starting receiver, finished eighth and Ragsdale, a 
quarterback, was 27th. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulley caught 25 passes for 591 yards and nine touchdowns. In the fall, he 
will move to quarterback, where he is expected to replace Oscar Casillas as the 
Mariners' starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragsdale passed 1,750 yards and 21 touchdowns as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Carson coach Gene Vollnogle and former Palisades High standout Perry 
Klein, who was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the NFL draft, were among the 
judges. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 After being named most valuable player in the Fairfax tournament, Danny Walker 
of Westchester continued his strong summer play at last week's Nike Slam-N-Jam 
tournament in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for top-seeded Values for a Better America, Walker scored 12 points, 
including three three-point baskets, in a 67-64 victory over New York Super 
Sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm playing pretty well this summer," said Walker, who was being 
watched closely by college coaches, including UCLA's Jim Harrick and Arizona's 
Lute Olson. "I'm trying to be unselfish and do things to help my team play 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker will be a junior in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, D.C., beat Values, 64-62, in the first round of the winner's 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship game, New York Riverside Church defeated Kansas City Blue, 
56-53.

SURFING: SPOTLIGHT; PREPARE TO GET STOKED; CATCH A WAVE -- OR A WAVE-CATCHER -- 
AND YOU'LL BE SITTIN' ON TOP OF THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES and RICK FIGNETTI, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Prime Ticket's Don Meek first began pitching potential sponsors to help 
underwrite a big Southern California surf contest at Huntington Beach, the 
reaction was as cold as one of last winter's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to New York last February for three days," recalled Meek, 
vicepresident for event properties for the L.A.-based cable network. "And it 
turned into seven days because we got snowed in. You really have to believe 
you're on a mission while slogging through snow selling sponsorships to a 
surfing event to major corporations like 1-800-COLLECT and Coca-Cola in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would walk into their offices and they would ask, 'What are you here to see 
us about?' Well, I would say, 'The U.S. Open of Surfing.' And, they would say, 
'Well, it's 10 degrees outside.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meek didn't exactly inherit the Earth on this trip, but neither did he let 
that midwinter disinterest stop him from creating a contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later, with those two sponsors and others in tow, Prime Ticket and 
Huntington Beach are putting on a two-week surfing bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Today through Sunday, the 13th Annual Op Pro Surfing Championship will draw 
top surfers to the southern side of Huntington Beach Pier. With more than 400 
competitors vying on almost everything that floats, organizers are calling it 
the biggest competitive field ever assembled. It is a $70,000 World Qualifying 
Series event. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week (Aug. 2-7), it's the $140,000 U.S. Open of Surfing, the first time 
in two years that a world-tour event has been held in the continental United 
States. All this surf news, said Rockin' Fig, could mean a major revival for 
surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 How so, Figgy? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there are a lot of things affecting surfing this year. The new movie 
"The Endless Summer II" is now out, and it's gonna motivate a lot more people 
to visit the beach. I'm not just talkin' about our inland population in 
Southern California. I'm talking about people in the Midwest and elsewhere. 
They'll be checking out surfing and seeing how much fun it is. With the Op Pro 
and the U.S. Open of Surfing, people are going to focus on Southern California, 
looking to see what happens at both contests because the big names of surfing 
are going to be here.  
</P>
<P>
 Coming to town for the Open are such stalwarts as Australia's Barton Lynch and 
Damien Hardman, world champ Derek Ho of Hawaii, Great Britain's Martin Potter 
and, from the other side of the globe, Brazil's Flavio Padaratz and Fabio 
Gouveia. Southland contenders include Cardiff's Rob Machado and San Clemente's 
Shane Beschen. 
</P>
<P>
 With such talent eyeing the Open, John Warner, Ocean Pacific Surfing Apparel 
Corp.'s chief executive officer, said Op was concerned that its contest might 
take a back seat to the Open. But Op has gotten word that 41 of the world's Top 
44 surfers will also compete at the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, we've also added a tandem event," Warner said. "Kind of like the ol' 
Gidget years, which should be a lot of fun. With both contests, it should be an 
incredible 10 days of surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fig added: Don't forget the best longboarders in the world will be here, with 
guys like world champion Rusty Kealana, former champ Joey Hawkins and others. 
And we have all the best women in the world, including Florida's Lisa Andersen 
and Australia's Pauline Menczer. And they're gonna be having the Op Juniors 
contest, so they're gonna be showcasing the best up and coming grommets.  
</P>
<P>
 So we also have an amateur contest mixed in with the pros, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, that's it. It's gonna be big in all divisions.  
</P>
<P>
 It has even gotten the normally surfing-shy media's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for instance, Sports Illustrated was looking for Hawaii's Sunny 
Garcia for a possible profile. Television's "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" 
-- yep, Robin Leach -- will highlight former world champion and teen-age 
heartthrob Kelly Slater. Sports Illustrated for Kids will be at the U.S. Open, 
as will TV Guide, MTV Sports, the "Today" show and possibly CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, 175 journalists and representatives from 70 media outlets have asked 
for passes and camera space, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figgy, what's so big about having a world tour event like the U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't had one in two years. You only get 10 or 11 world tour events a 
year, and this is the first time in two years that we've been able to sponsor 
one in the continental United States. It takes big bucks to put on a world-tour 
contest.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, I asked Ian Cairns, the Op Pro's contest director, what kind of maneuvers 
these top pros will be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past," Cairns said, "surfers like Tom Curren would pull off, say, an 
off-the-lip turn, a maneuver that's really hot. But you would see one such 
maneuver on a single wave. The key now is to link them up, ride a tube and then 
pull a really radical roundhouse turn into another and then another, linking up 
two or three super moves on a single wave." 
</P>
<P>
 "Southside Huntington," said Nick Carroll, Surfing Magazine's editor-in-chief, 
"is an almost uniquely Californian phenomenon, including a pier-formed sandbar. 
No other wave on the world professional tour even remotely resembles it. The 
result? A wave that simultaneously rewards patience and risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said several people come to mind to win the Open: Dave Macaulay from 
West Australia is "Mr. Patient" personified; countryman Lynch, who won the 1991 
Op, and half a dozen others also are likely. But Garcia and Slater stick out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kelly and Sunny make the final, and Kelly doesn't score four perfect, 
flawless, impossible waves, Sunny will eat him for breakfast, lunch and 
dinner," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even longboarders will dazzle the crowds with hot new moves, said Hawkins, a 
Huntington Beach pro longboarder. Hawkins, 24, the former world champion, said 
today's longboarders have learned radical moves by adapting skateboarding 
maneuvers to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's pros are looking for a series of radical moves rather than just one 
mega maneuver," Hawkins explained. "If you pull off only one big trick, like a 
big (aerial), you won't get as many points (as) if you do a number of easier 
maneuvers that can win you a consistent score. Unfortunately, contests do not 
let you pull off real radical moves because you won't score as high. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for me," Hawkins continued, "you're going to see a lot of nose rides and 
360s, dropped-knee cutbacks and floaters plus a lot of crazy stuff like 
from-the-tail 360s and from-the-nose 360s, when you throw the front of the 
board up into the wave and slide it back down. Also some 'shove it' 360s." 
</P>
<P>
 A "shove it" 360? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Hawkins said. "I sometimes take off, fin first, and shove the 
surfboard into a 360-degree turn and land with a switched stance." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which will be caught on film. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, I asked Meek how an L.A. network that normally just televises events got 
into the business of producing the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the event management company," said Meek, a youthful 36-year-old surfer 
from Pacific Palisades and former Newport Beach lifeguard. "Originally, Prime 
Ticket as the sole sponsor put up $250,000. But we've spent far beyond that in 
television inventory. I would estimate that a non-television company would have 
to spend about $1 million to put this on." 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Prime Ticket put up guarantee money and then sold sponsorships, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," Meek said. "We have 1-800-COLLECT and Sebastian Hair Care products as 
premier sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
 Was there a surfing connection among Prime Ticket execs? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" Meek said. "Roger L. Werner, the president and CEO of Prime Ticket, 
surfs. Also, we never would have gotten into this if not for Don Corsini, 
executive vice president of programming and production. He's also a hard-core 
surf guy. In fact, we all surf together at Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
 Cool. The Fig was happy about that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's kinda neat for Don Meek to be fortunate to have two bosses who are 
bigwigs in the industry, and those same guys surf! It's a stoker. These guys 
are into it, and that gives really everybody else out there in the surfing 
world a little bit of a chance, because Meek managed to persuade them on this 
contest. You gotta give a special thanks to those guys.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, you're making me feel warm and fuzzy all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, maybe they'll give me 20 free passes?  
</P>
<P>
 How will Prime Ticket make money here? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the rights to domestic TV, merchandising, the live gate, concessions 
and sponsorships," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, I guess the boys from Prime Ticket are hoping for sunny skies and nice 
waves, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Riiiiight. Lucky for them, Huntington Beach is well known for its consistency. 
It may not have the biggest waves, but if you're going to hold a contest, 
Huntington is a good choice.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the festivities, Prime Ticket will co-host a dinner and concert 
Aug. 4 to raise money for Surfrider Foundation's environmental projects. The 
fund-raiser, featuring Chris Isaak, is scheduled for the Hard Rock Cafe in 
Newport Beach. Cost is $100 per person. For information, call (714) 361-2612. 
Also, 25 cents from every print program goes to Surfrider, which will also hold 
a raffle for a chance to win a pro's surfboard at the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
Raffle tickets are $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleachers at the Open will hold 7,000 people. It's paid admission. VIP sky 
boxes for companies and reserve seating will also be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Prime Ticket has added a beach expo during the Open, featuring booths 
from ocean organizations and companies interested in the beach lifestyle. 
Rockin' Fig and Dave's Surfin' Glossary 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom Turn -- The surfer lays into a turn at the bottom of the wave, drives 
off the bottom really hard, and that sets up the next move. Says Fig: It's the 
biggest move you're gonna see at any contest.  
</P>
<P>
 Lip -- The top section of a wave that topples over when the wave begins to 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Lip Slash -- No, not a lipstick accident. A big power turn off the top. Fig: 
You wanna be throwin' a lot of water. Basically a whip turn off the face of the 
breaking wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Hop -- Something you're going to be seeing a lot of during the next 
two weeks. It happens when surfers catch an outside wave, then bounce on their 
boards attempting to catch the reform wave or inside shorebreak. It's probably 
not what the judges wanna see. They wanna see guys S-turn their way over flat 
spots trying to look fluid and not lose any speed as they connect to the inside 
section.  
</P>
<P>
 Shred -- When the rider rips a wave going from maneuver to maneuver and just 
shreds it. Cannot use to describe big Hawiian power surfers such as Johnny Boy 
Gomes. Johnny Boy not only shreds, he gouges waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Suicidal -- Figgy says it best describes his buddy, John Parmenter, 1986 U.S. 
Bud Pro Tour champion. Parmenter was surfing close to the pier recently on a 
big, eight-foot day. They were just throwing big and super hollow right next to 
the pier. You would take off and BOOM! You're right inside the barrel going as 
fast as a freight train toward the pier. He was riding my board. Real suicidal. 
He didn't care about the pier. He was getting some mean barrels. Big frothy 
green things. And, he's wearing this Day-Glo wet suit, and I could see him 
right through the lip as it broke over. He was, like, five feet behind the 
breaking lip, just tucked inside this thing. He made it.  
</P>
<P>
 Tailslide -- Usually performed after a cutback where the rider shifts weight 
on his trail foot, pushes down and slides the tail of the board. You'll be 
turning the board around, changing directions and definitely drifting that 
tail, doin' a big 'ol tailslide while you're moving into the next section.  
</P>
<P>
 Wipeouts -- As easy as putting on your shoes. You too can become a member of 
The Fall Off Club. Odds are that you will have fallen off dozens of times 
before you can ride a curl in to shore. Can include a simple dive off the 
surfboard to something more radical. An easy full soul arch can immediately 
turn into mayhem if your fins snag on something. A G-force bottom turn -- full 
tilt with heavy body lean, hand cupped as it slips across the water -- can wind 
up with the tail slipping right outta the water. Result: You slipping into 
traction. Surf and Shop

 Wave-slapping maneuvers at Op Pro Surfing Championships and U.S. Open of 
Surfing will show off skills of the sport's international professional 
contingent. A guide to watching and understanding totally stoked surf 
competition: 
</P>
<P>
 * Making Points 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants are judged on execution of radical moves at fast speeds on any 
size wave that can be surfed. Judges score top four rides from maximum of 10 to 
determine finalists. In final heat, best five of 15 are scored. * Priority Buoy 
</P>
<P>
 First surfer to paddle around priority buoy gets prime choice on wave 
selection for heat. Toward end of heat, leader may use priority buoy to bump 
other competitors off waves, preventing them from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wave selection 
</P>
<P>
 Choice of waves dictates surfer's ability to fulfill other judging criteria. 
Surfers will opt for outside set of waves for their size, shape and potential 
riding distance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal style 
</P>
<P>
 Judges examine how surfer works selected waves and strings together maneuvers 
for fluid ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maneuvers 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasis on big, explosive moves showcasing surfer's talents and harnessing 
wave's power. (More detailed maneuvers illustrated below.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Ride length 
</P>
<P>
 Carving inside section of waves is crucial. Longer rides mean more 
opportunities to perform scoring maneuvers. Working a Wave 
</P>
<P>
 Pros make surfing look easy. But maneuvers take strength, balance, grace and 
endurance. Surfers also assess conditions and decide which waves best showcase 
their skills. Close-up of four moves and their scores: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cutbacks 
</P>
<P>
 Several turns in one. Surfer sets board on edge and slices back against wave 
break. Goal is to slam into foam, setting up a new series of maneuvers across 
wave face. High points awarded for solid cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Floaters 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer climbs to top of wave, then shoots across breaking section. Difficulty 
comes when surfer drops off top and turns back into wave face. Medium to high 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tube Rides 
</P>
<P>
 Good wave selection and timing set surfer inside hollow portion of breaking 
wave. Ability to adjust speed to let tube catch up, then finesse staying inside 
as long as possible always garners high points. 
</P>
<P>
 *Aerials 
</P>
<P>
 Think saltwater skateboarding. Surfer turns hard off wave bottom, gaining 
speed up wave face, and blasts into air. While airborne, surfer flips board in 
opposite direction and prepares for splashdown. High points for those who stay 
on-board. Sources: ASP Media Guide, Ocean Pacific, U.S. Open of Surfing, Los 
Angeles Times reports

 Like the original horde commanded by Genghis Kahn, the one spearheaded by the 
band Blues Traveler is about to reach its goal of galloping across an entire 
continent. Luckily, this one brings a more peaceful vibe than the great Kahn's 
Mongols did when they were head-chopping their way through Asia. But with the 
Allman Brothers Band and Big Head Todd and the Monsters joining Blues Traveler 
in an instrumentally adventurous vanguard at the top of the bill, this musical 
H.O.R.D.E. has some fearsome chops as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The H.O.R.D.E. Festival's all-day encampment at Irvine Meadows on Saturday 
marks the West Coast debut of a phenomenon that has been growing since the 
first tour of H.O.R.D.E. (for Horizons of Rock Developing Everywhere) in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first tour was basically just a group of friends getting together and 
deciding to do some dates," recalled Blues Traveler's manager, David Frey. That 
two-week jaunt along the East Coast involved Blues Traveler and Spin Doctors -- 
brother-bands that emerged from the same high school in Princeton, N.J. -- as 
well as Phish and Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year H.O.R.D.E. gained in numbers and range in a 25-city tour by Blues 
Traveler, Big Head Todd, Widespread Panic, Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium 
Rescue Unit, the Samples and Allgood -- a lineup defined by its members' 
allegiance to the jam-band tradition established by such '60s and early-'70s 
forebears as Cream, Traffic, the Mothers of Invention, the Grateful Dead and 
the Allman Brothers Band. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's H.O.R.D.E. spreads to 32 cities and acknowledges that tradition 
with the reinvigorated '90s version of the Allman Brothers in the headlining 
spot. Besides playing those early-'70s standards, their scheduled 2 1/2-hour 
show-closing set will draw from "Where It All Begins," easily the strongest 
Allman Brothers album since the band's 1990 comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveler's scheduled 1-hour, 45-minute set should include several 
selections from "Four," their album due out Sept. 13. The band, which features 
the distinctive harmonica swirls and philosophic lyrical musings of singer John 
Popper, is still in the cult-following ranks but is looking to follow the path 
of Spin Doctors, whose career took a major commercial jump after the inaugural 
H.O.R.D.E. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Head Todd and the Monsters, scheduled for a 90-minute set, also have 
prospered since their initial H.O.R.D.E. appearance a year ago: The Colorado 
trio's 1993 release, "Sister Sweetly," has gone gold on the strength of 
near-constant touring and solid album-rock airplay. The band hasn't recorded a 
follow-up, but "In the Morning," a new song from the "Blown Away" film 
soundtrack, shows that leader Todd Park Mohr hasn't lost his touch with the 
mid-tempo lyricism that complements the versatile band's more fiery blues-rock 
excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheryl Crow, who has enjoyed success with her debut album, "Tuesday Night 
Music Club," lends a singer-songwriter sensibility to the proceedings. She is 
penciled in for a 45-minute set on the main stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Lollapalooza, H.O.R.D.E. features a midway-style concourse with such 
attractions as a virtual-reality "LSD flight simulator," a traveling exhibition 
of Jimi Hendrix memorabilia, arts and crafts booths, forums for social action 
and political organizations and, for the physically adventurous, a bungee 
trampoline and a surfboard variation on the old mechanical bucking bull ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Also like Lollapalooza, H.O.R.D.E. will expose less-established talents, most 
of which will play 30-minute sets on a concourse stage. The newcomers, in order 
of appearance, are the 2 P.C., Jambay (which starts the main-stage proceedings 
at 1 p.m.), Ugly Americans, Cycomotogoat, Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies and 
April's Motel Room. The second-stage shows will take place only during 
set-change breaks on the main stage, and audio from the second stage will be 
piped over the amphitheater's sound system so that the entire audience can get 
a taste of each band. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour's producer, Peter Barsotti of Bill Graham Presents, points as well to 
a promising new element: workshop performances featuring some of the featured 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is a venerable, much-loved staple of the folk and bluegrass 
festival circuit, allowing fans to listen and, often, ask questions, as 
performers gather on an intimate, remote stage to demonstrate and talk about 
their music. Barsotti says he got the idea from working on this year's version 
of Peter Gabriel's W.O.M.A.D. festival, which features an array of on-site 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 The H.O.R.D.E. workshops were launched last week at the Chicago festival site, 
seven dates into the tour. Blues Traveler's Popper gave a blues harmonica 
demonstration, with help from Sheryl Crow and members of her band and the 
Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies. Allman Brothers percussionists Jaimoe and Mark 
Quinones gave a drum workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do it every place (on the tour) where we can find three 
sonically isolated spots" that will permit a workshop stage that won't be 
drowned out by main stage and concourse stage performances, Barsotti said. That 
could be a challenge at Irvine Meadows. "I'll make it work somehow," he vowed. 
"There's something about being up close to the performers and being able to 
talk to them that makes it special." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Lollapalooza tours have had a disappointing lack of interaction 
between bands, but Frey, the Blues Traveler manager, says that H.O.R.D.E.'s 
jam-oriented lineup frequently features a merger of talents. "John Popper has 
sat in with just about everybody; Sheryl Crow has sung with everyone, and 
Jaimoe and Warren Haynes (of the Allman Brothers Band) have played with 
everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unique thing is the interaction. All the bands are 100% willing to join 
with other guys and invite other people into their scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled times for the main performers are: Sheryl Crow, 2 p.m., Big Head 
Todd, 3:15 p.m., Blues Traveler, 5:15 p.m., Allman Brothers, 7:30 p.m. 
Second-stage performances begin at 12:30 p.m.

 The English Beat 
</P>
<P>
 "Special Beat Service" (1982) 
</P>
<P>
 I.R.S. -- Go Feet  
</P>
<P>
 The English Beat couldn't have come up with a more appropriate name when it 
dubbed its own record label Go Feet. The ska group's songs were as danceable 
and propulsive as any to emerge from the fertile British new wave of the late 
'70s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the bubbly Jamaican rhythms driving such up-tempo dance tracks as 
"Sole Salvation" and "Rotating Head" helped make "Special Beat Service" a 
nearly perfect party album for hipper-than-thou rockers of the post-punk 
generation. The Beat had a remarkable sense of rhythm and groove that rarely 
failed to get the feet moving and the hips swaying. 
</P>
<P>
 While essentially a dance record, the octet's third and final album is also 
noteworthy for its diversity. This disc not only houses plenty of ska madness, 
but it presents irresistible smart pop-craft ("Save It for Later" and "I 
Confess"), entrancing dub-reggae ("Spar Wid Me" and "Pato and Roger A Go Talk") 
and one exceptional ballad called "End of the Party," both uplifting and sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Special Beat Service" is an album marked by a number of unique details and 
adventurous song arrangements. The playful "Jeanette" is possibly the only ska 
song ever with accordion and clarinet. "Spar Wid Me" (featuring master toaster 
Ranking Roger) is colored by a hypnotically lazy saxophone part and some 
decidedly non-Jamaican banjo accents. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalists Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger received most of the attention in 
The Beat. But it was bassist David Steele and guitarist Andy Cox who were most 
responsible for weaving the band's still fresh music. Following the Beat's 
demise, Steele and Cox recruited singer Roland Gift and made two highly 
listenable albums as the Fine Young Cannibals. Wakeling and Ranking Roger 
recorded for a brief time as General Public with less impressive results. JON

 Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "Melody Fair: Songs of the Bee Gees" 
</P>
<P>
 eggBERT  
</P>
<P>
 A Bee Gees tribute album? Not as travolting a concept as you might think. 
Before spreading the disco epidemic in the mid-'70s, the brothers Gibb were 
grandmasters at the '60s games of folk-pop and follow-the-Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 This 21-song compilation consists mainly of little-known, smart-pop bands of 
'80s and '90s vintage rummaging through the early Bee Gees catalogue, with 
results both charming and weirdly appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Material Issue, Dramarama, the Young Fresh Fellows and the late Phil Seymour 
are the only names here with much of a national profile, but virtually the 
entire cast carries itself well. L.A.'s Baby Lemonade attempts the only 
disco-redemption and, if not for a wan lead vocal, would have pulled off its 
Big Star-ish garage-pop revival of "How Deep Is Your Love?" 
</P>
<P>
 The early Bee Gees were big on wistfulness, but as album annotator Alec Palao 
notes, "It's difficult to overlook the group's sense of the bizarre, 
particularly where lyrics are concerned." Druggy parables, hilarious nonsense 
rhymes and inscrutable visions are strewn throughout this compilation, along 
with the sweetly lovelorn and prettily alienated musings more familiar from the 
Bee Gees' best-of volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melody Fair" makes a perfect companion piece for old-line Bee Gees fans who 
swooned and sighed to the early hits packages but didn't buy the original 
albums. The cast here for the most part avoids the hits in favor of obscure, 
but still engaging, fare. The reason is obvious from Material Issue's faithful 
re-creation of "Run to Me." Nice enough, but superfluous.  
</P>
<P>
 The other five bands that tackle well-known songs throw in a few wrinkles of 
their own. The best come from the Movie Stars, who apply a pedal steel guitar 
and a Cowboy Junkies kind of hush to "I Can't See Nobody," and the Insect 
Surfers' splendid surf-rock instrumental take on "Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
 The album strikes a good balance between wispy cotton candy like "Kilburn 
Towers," dreamily rendered by the Idle Wilds, and more aggressive fare. Among 
the latter are Dramarama's raw-and-desperate take on "Indian Gin and Whisky 
Dry" and Spindle's "The Earnest of Being George," a deliciously wrathful 
counterpoint to customary Bee Gees wist. The only dance-pop entry, a dramatic 
diva turn called "I'm Not Wearing Makeup," comes from Beri Rhoades, an 
Australian niece to the brothers Gibb. Uncle Barry produces and sings backups. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs still hold their charm and don't carry the burden of excessive 
familiarity, making this a worthwhile trip to a pleasant patch of the past. As 
for the tribute-payers, in almost every case the level of craftsmanship and 
good pop sense makes one want to hear more of what they do on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
 Available from eggBERT Records, 2755 Via Hacienda, P.O. Box 10022, Fullerton, 
CA 92635.

 (John Easdale, Baby Lemonade, the Jigsaw Seen, Kristian Hoffman and Barry 
Holdship from the "Melody Fair" lineup will perform Aug. 6 from 2 to 4 p.m. at 
Tower Records in the Lab, 2930 Bristol St., Costa Mesa.) MIKE BOEHM

WANNA DANCE?: METROPOLIS: IT'S AN IL WIND THAT BLOWS HOT AND COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed last week that all of the county's club-crawling denizens were at 
the opening of Il's House at Metropolis, a once-a-week hip-hop affair promoted 
by "Beverly Hills, 90210" star Brian Austin Green and his vinyl-spinning 
compadre, Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 hip party-goers age 18 and over cruised in and out of the club 
that Wednesday evening. The place was almost filled to capacity before 10 p.m. 
Even around midnight, 200 to 300 patrons crowded the entrance, vying to get in. 
Amazed Metropolis employees were heard saying the nightclub hasn't seen this 
much action since it opened late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 So what gives? 
</P>
<P>
 Attribute much of the enthusiasm to Green's decision to bring Il's House down 
from its original installation at Bar One in Los Angeles -- something about a 
fallout between Green and Bar One's owner over the direction of the club. Much 
of that club's patronage hailed from the 714 area code anyway, according to the 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Count Green fans among the pack that showed up on opening night in Irvine. 
Throngs of young women with glazed, star-struck eyes and armed with pocket 
cameras flocked to Green, or at least tried to. They grabbed at his hand to 
kiss it, yelled out his name, giggled giddily over catching a glimpse of him 
and tried their darndest to just touch him. Some in this pushy bunch looked to 
be in their mid-20s, but they apparently still subscribe to Tiger Beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Green took it all in stride, noting that it's the fans who make the show 
successful. Still, it was fortunate that the majority of folks had a grip on 
reality and weren't fazed by the presence of their celebrity host.  
</P>
<P>
 The dance floor and any space nearby stayed thick with revelers possessed by 
the talents of deejay Stewart. This guy's got the Midas touch when it comes to 
hip-hop. He brought out plenty of familiar favorites, current and old school, 
as well as a mix of lesser known numbers. As long as Stewart's there, Il's 
House may thrive even without a teen idol on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bringing his club to where the regulars are, Green wanted to grace 
Orange County fans with a taste of what's up. "You guys have awful clubs down 
here," he commented between photo ops with girls. "There's nothing going on in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics who earnestly agree with this opinion might still object to hearing it 
from this trendy teen scream. But his statement was supported with a night that 
any promoter would envy, not just because it boasted one of the more 
fashionable crowds, but because it genuinely raged. Hate to admit this, but 
with all the stylish scenesters crowding Metropolis' fabulous interior, it 
didn't even look like an Orange County gig. 
</P>
<P>
 The key now is to maintain the excitement. It's a challenge to bring back the 
masses every weekend, let alone on a weeknight. And cost is a factor. 
Metropolis charged $5 at the door for patrons 21 and older and $8 for those 18 
to 20 when Il's House premiered last week. But a ridiculous, flat $10 cover 
went into effect this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Add to that bar selections that don't come cheap in the later hours: domestic 
brew, $3.50; import beer and wells, $4 to $5; a glass of wine, $4; soda and 
bottled water $2. (Happy hour half-price specials for all beer, wells, wine and 
appetizers last until 10 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Green hopes to keep them coming with occasional performances of his rap act, 
Il Styles A Rhyme (which the club was named after and which Stewart helps 
produce), as well as from his pals the Pharcyde, Baby Face and even a few rap 
attacks by Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
 With last week's showing, it's no longer an issue of whether county clubbies 
want this sort of party. It's whether they're willing to pay for it.

COMEDY; A FOOT SOLDIER IN THE PRATTLE OF THE SEXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The World According to Robert Dubac: Men will use the remote to watch TV. And 
that's the way it is. Women will shop for the same thing all day. And that's 
the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in the genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Put a bunny in a playpen with a 5-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy, Dubac 
continues, and eventually the boy will get rough with it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in the genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women are different. But rather than try to reconcile it or analyze it 
to death, why not just accept the differences and work with them? That would 
save everyone time, trouble and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Dubac came up with "The Male Intellect (an Oxymoron)," a one-man 
show running at Fullerton's Standing Room Only through Aug. 14. The 90-minute 
production, staged and directed by Mark Lonow, tries to find a navigable course 
somewhere between a lying, forgetful egoist who belches in church and the ideal 
partner who is sensitive, loving, honest and communicative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not bashing men, it's not bashing women," Dubac said recently from the 
club's supply room, which doubles as his dressing parlor. "It's just trying to 
find a balance." 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, Dubac portrays five voices from within, representing one-dimensional 
male stereotypes. He also responds to a female voice, which interjects thoughts 
and questions (a devil's advocate of sorts) over the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, the characters came from women I knew, who liked a certain type 
of guy. The women were attracted to a father figure, or a guy who's very 
unattainable. From there, I make real broad strokes with the characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubac grew up in Atlanta and was making money doing magic at little gigs 
before he was 10. ("I've never had a real job. This put me through high school 
and college.") For years, he kept up the magic act, adding stand-up comedy as 
he went along. Eventually, he was opening for Linda Ronstadt, Jimmy Buffett and 
Toto. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying journalism, psychology and theater at the University of 
Georgia, he moved to Los Angeles in the late '70s, opening for bands at the 
Roxy in addition to doing other stage work and acting. He landed a recurring 
role for three years starting in 1989 on the ABC soap "Loving," as well as 
parts on "Life Goes On" and "Growing Pains." His movie credits include "The 
Rookie" and "Sketch Artist." 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy boom in the '80s, and the ensuing glut of comics, gave Dubac the 
nudge to try something new. Besides, after being in front of the camera, he 
wanted to start creating again, especially something with a point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 This one-man show, with its mix of stand-up and observations, offers no 
answers but does prod some soul searching and push some opinions. Women talk, 
Dubac says, while men watch and do. How can we be equal when we're so 
different?  
</P>
<P>
 "I started this about 2 1/2 years ago, and it took a good half-year to nine 
months for it to be in presentable order, with a beginning, middle and end." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubac brings the show, which is decidedly female-friendly, here after seven 
weeks in Atlanta. He has also taken it to Chicago, Dallas and Phoenix since its 
inception, when he stopped doing his traditional stand-up act. Reviews have 
been favorable. In the fall, he's taking it Off-Broadway. Also, he and Warner 
Bros. are developing a sitcom based on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to invent a couple of new characters; it's too one-sided now. All men," 
he explained. "It's about a guy who's kind of stuck in the middle of 
chauvinistic friends and women who are too far on the other side. He's looking 
for a balance, he's trying to figure out a rational approach to the battle of 
the sexes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, he's working on a couple of films and trying to put together another 
one-person play to stage in three or four years, which is what he figures to be 
the shelf life of "The Male Intellect." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, audience feedback has been good, which is no surprise. Dubac brings 
the characters to life with a polished delivery, covering much ground in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reactions are different," Dubac, single and 39, explained. "I'd say women 
are apt to be more emotional in their feedback. Guys kind of relate to it 
because they go, 'I think like that, and I do want to change. This guys's doing 
it and showing we're not all jerks.' 
</P>
<P>
 "People come back and they bring their friends. It kind of grows into this 
minor phenomenon."

KID STUFF: THIS ROOM IS BUGGED!; EXHIBIT FITS INTO CHILDREN'S MUSEUM AT LA 
HABRA AS SNUG AS A YOU-KNOW-WHAT IN A RUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer guests give you the willies? Until a few weeks ago, Carrie Wictor, 
curator of education for the Children's Museum at La Habra, had house guests 
that made your chain-smoking cousins from Poughkeepsie pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 While preparing the museum's current exhibit, "What's Bugging You?," Wictor 
found herself the uneasy mistress of a bug hotel. Among the tenants: Rosie, a 
rose hair tarantula; a "chorus of crickets," and a pair of king-sized 
Madagascar hissing cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from a nightly serenade by the crickets ("it was kind of like camping at 
home"), Wictor admits she didn't share a lot of warm moments with her 
multi-legged guests, who are now safely ensconced in the museum's changing 
gallery along with dozens of their crawling and/or flying kin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of creepy around giant bugs," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from response to the exhibit, which opened May 23 and continues 
through Sept. 11, there are plenty of visitors who share Wictor's reaction. And 
most of them are adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to watch the grown-ups go in there," Wictor observed. "They kind of 
hang back and peer into the cases . . . you can practically see their muscles 
tense. But the kids just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Designed for children in the lower elementary school grades, "What's Bugging 
You?" features interactive stations that introduce viewers to topics such as 
metamorphosis (the change in an insect's body shape during maturation), 
beneficial versus detrimental insects and the methods used by insects to 
camouflage and defend themselves against predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to its nature, "What's Bugging You?" has fewer hands-on activities than 
this museum's shows usually offer. But there are a few. Kids can play "bug man" 
with jumpsuits, gloves and hand sprayer (empty, naturally) loaned from a local 
exterminating company, or assemble wood-and-pipe-cleaner critters at a "build 
your own bug" display. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit, several young children whiled away the time by attaching 
bits of colored felt to a large butterfly-shaped felt board (an accompanying 
sign explained that designs on real butterfly wings are comprised of tiny 
scales). Nearby, there are insect stamps and stamp pads, bug and bug-eater hand 
puppets and tiny prism lenses through which kids can take an "ant's eye view" 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Visuals geared to older visitors include some detailed anatomy charts and 
several beautifully illustrated posters that explain the life cycle of 
butterflies and moths. Table and wall cases display a wide range of mounted 
insects, ranging from tiny, iridescent beetles to an earth-toned luna moth with 
a seven-inch wingspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wictor's former house guests greet visitors from glass terrariums at the back 
of the gallery. Children are not allowed to handle the insects, but if you time 
it right, they may be able to get a closer view of the tarantula and the 
crickets. Every other day, Wictor opens the former's cage and tosses in a 
couple of the latter as snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "What's Bugging You?" 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Exhibit continues through Sept. 11. Museum hours are Monday through 
Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Children's Museum at La Habra, 301 S. Euclid St., La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the Orange (57) Freeway, exit at Lambert Road and drive 
west. Turn right on Euclid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Gallery admission is $3.50; under 2 is free. The rate changes 
to $4 after Monday, Aug. 1. 
</P>

 * Where to call: (310) 905-9793. MORE KID STUFF

DO IT!: LOS ALAMITOS INDOOR RETREAT SERVES VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS 
</P>

<P>
 In Southern California, volleyball is primarily a summer beach sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But enthusiasts who want to play year-around, or after the sun goes down, can 
play indoors in Los Alamitos. The city's recreation department offers open gym 
volleyball twice a week, Tuesday and Sunday evenings, for $2 per session. 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions are open to players of all abilities on Tuesdays from 7 to 9 p.m. and 
Sundays from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. A special session for advanced players is held 
Sundays from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Participants must be 18 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, "You'll get the people who have been on the beach all day and want 
to keep going," said Jim Ivanick, adult sports coordinator for Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions are held in the gym of a closed junior high school. Two courts 
are open, and a maximum of 36 players can take part in any one session 
(allowing three teams of six to rotate on each court). Ivanick said the 
all-abilities sessions often hit their 36-player limit, while the advanced 
sessions typically draw between 12 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to Ivanick that everyone gets a chance to play and that the 
better players don't show off in the all-abilities sessions.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really recreation-oriented, so we want it to be kind of laid-back," he 
said. "We discourage teams from coming in and using this as a practice time." 
</P>
<P>
 The program started five years ago. Ivanick had planned to have it evolve into 
a league, but the open gym format has worked out well. The city once had open 
gym basketball but dropped it because there were too many arguments and fights 
among players.

 A team of Orange County stockbrokers had a field day at the recent Mud Run at 
Camp Pendleton. They came in as the top civilian team and the second team 
overall, finishing ahead of 49 Marine teams. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Marines feel about that? "I would say they were unhappy, and there 
were some drill commanders who were even unhappier," said Barry Migliorini. His 
teammates were Dreux Valenti, Bill Sayre, Sean Walker, Jim Maynard and Jan 
Maynard. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing as a corporate team, the brokers have won numerous local runs and 
triathlons. The 10K obstacle course at Camp Pendleton was a new experience, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brutal, in a word," Migliorini said. "It was the first time that any of us 
had ever tasted mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to give it a try, start getting ready: El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station's mud run is coming up in about four months. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Open gym volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Tuesdays, 7 to 9 p.m.; Sundays, 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Diego Freeway north to the San Gabriel (605) 
Freeway north. Exit east at Katella Avenue and turn left at Oak Street. The gym

KIDS ON FILM: DOES 'THE CLIENT' GO BY THE BOOK? OPPOSING SIDES TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the movie adaptation of the John Grisham novel "The Client," rebellious 
10-year-old Mark Sway is chased by the mob after witnessing the death of a 
Mafia lawyer and hires a feisty lawyer to protect him. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You think kids today don't read? Try asking a few about masterful storyteller 
John Grisham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love John Grisham. I call the bookstores to see when his next book is 
coming out. I count the days. I call different stores to see who's going to get 
it first," said Kristen Hoppe, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Firm,' 'The Pelican Brief,' I've read all of them," she said. But more 
of her friends have read "The Client" than any other -- not surprising, since 
the main character is a kid who outwits not only the murderous Barry the Blade, 
but also the publicity-seeking federal prosecutor (Tommy Lee Jones) who wants 
him to tell what he knows about the murderous activities of the mob.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was like the perfect kid with the perfect brain. He could think of all 
this stuff to get away. It's like the adventure every kid wants to have," 
Kristen said. "I loved his rebellious attitude."  
</P>
<P>
 She also admired the character of Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), the recovering 
alcoholic lawyer Mark hires for $1. "She was incredible. That's exactly how I 
imagined her in the book! I liked the way she stood up to so many important 
people and how she'd overcome her problems in the past. I thought it was really 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was perfectly cast. All of them. Mrs. Sway (played by 
Mary-Louise Parker) was really good too." Parker plays Mark's low-functioning 
single mother, who can only lash out at the police when they come to take Mark 
into custody for his own protection. "I thought she reacted like a normal 
parent would under those circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen has also seen movie versions of Grisham's "The Firm" and "The Pelican 
Brief" and said: "This was by far my favorite. By far. " Not only was it 
perfectly cast, she thought, but it was also faithful to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Firm' didn't tend to stick to the story as much as this, and 'The 
Pelican Brief' didn't either. This was by far the closest to the story, there 
was nothing different." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agreed. "It was nothing like the book. The book was better, more 
in depth," said Charlie Smith, 15. The novel was able to provide more details 
about the characters and better descriptions of a chase through the woods, he 
said. He added that the continuous legal dialogue -- to explain, for instance, 
why prosecutors think Mark is obstructing justice, or how he can be shielded by 
the witness protection program -- was "over my head a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the movie stars a child, the plot is complex and would likely bore 
younger children.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Summer Stearns, 14, who had not read the book, said she was confused on a 
few points. "It could have been longer. I didn't pick up on why (a senator) got 
murdered and why the Mafia was so interested in this kid. And where did Barry 
the Blade come from? I didn't understand all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, that didn't seem to matter much. "I was trying to keep up with the 
loose ends and they tied them all together," she said. And for the record, she 
liked "The Client" better than "The Firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer gave the movie 4.5 stars out of a perfect 5, but her friend Kristen 
said it merited an off-the-scale 8.  
</P>
<P>
 "I loved 'A Time to Kill' (the latest Grisham novel). I'm hoping they make a 
movie out of that," she said.

SPECIAL SCREENING: MEET ANOTHER CAPRA UNDERDOG, JOHN DOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes

<P>
 Beware of the "heelots." They can make a mess of you, and quick. 
</P>
<P>
 A heelot, as Walter Brennan explains in "Meet John Doe," is "a lot of heels." 
In other words, someone who's greedy, tends to run things, and wants to take 
advantage of all those decent people out there. Big businessmen can be heelots. 
So can TV preachers. Politicians, now they make perfect heelots. 
</P>
<P>
 The heelots are at the center of the predicament facing Long John Willoughby 
(Gary Cooper) in Frank Capra's 1941 sentimental favorite, a mix of mawkish 
chutzpah and anti-fascist purity, which screens Friday afternoon in a free 
presentation at the Cypress Senior Citizen Center. Long John's buddy, the 
Colonel (Brennan), keeps telling him that, but he just doesn't get it, not 
until he's completely ensnared in their plot to control the hearts and minds of 
every adult and child from star-spangled coast to star-spangled coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Yipes. 
</P>
<P>
 It all starts when Ann, an ambitious newspaper columnist played by Barbara 
Stanwyck, tells her corrupt publisher, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold), that she's 
received a letter from a "John Doe" claiming he plans to jump from the top of 
City Hall on Christmas Eve to protest how lousy the world is. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton, seeing a political opportunity of countrywide proportions in the phony 
note, agrees to find a bum to impersonate John Doe, then turn him into a 
national hero primed for a run at the presidency. Pick a dufus, then pull the 
strings once he's elected, that's the plan. Enter Long John . . . and Capra's 
customary blend of moral decay, moral indecision and, ultimately, rousing moral 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of this is Ann, who first exploits Long John and the power of the 
John Doe movement but later is swayed by its goodness. Long John isn't above 
using the situation, either. A bush-league pitcher with an injured arm, he's 
ready to be the bad guys' poster boy as long as they finance his operation. He 
comes around, though, when he sees what the John Doe ideal inspires in all 
those "little people." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Capra pits these two underdogs against the impossibly rich and 
influential villains, a familiar move for the director, one that he first 
introduced in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936 and also starring Cooper) and "Mr. 
Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). 
</P>
<P>
 We know who's going to triumph by the hokey, tearful conclusion, but that 
doesn't blunt the satisfaction. Capra goes over the top with "Meet John Doe's" 
ending, even throwing in biblical references to prime the populist pump, but he 
makes up for it earlier, when his attack on authoritarian ideology seeps 
through all the homilies. Hitler was on the move in Europe when the picture was 
being made, and it clearly influenced Capra. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Stanwyck is wonderfully excitable (even her cornball love scenes have 
a spirited abandon) and Cooper is the handsome dumbbell who surprises; we know 
there's integrity in those watery eyes and sturdy jaw, but the intelligence 
that comes out later is unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really gives "Meet John Doe" some gas is Brennan. Every time things 
get too sappy, there he is, stepping on it. His wild-eyed, desperately 
iconoclastic Colonel speeds us through all the bull, both in the story and in 
the film.

LOST IN O.C.: JUMPIN' JUPITER! CAN'T THE PLANET TAKE A JOKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. T. Jefferson Parker's column resumes in 
this spot next week. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're reading this, I can only presume that we're all still here. I've 
been waiting this past week for a comet-blasted piece of Jupiter to come knock 
the Earth into a corner pocket. Call it wishful thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 Unless you are a) in a drooling coma; b) busy watching the endless O.J. 
Simpson "special reports" or c) someone who thinks there's an appreciable 
difference between a) and b), you've probably noticed that our tubbiest 
celestial neighbor has recently been getting slapped silly by a series of comet 
fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a number of planetary possibilities I was mulling, wondering what 
effect it would have on Earth if Jupiter were destroyed. At the very least 
Sydney Omarr's job would get easier. At most, some glob of Jupiter would come 
our way and destroy us, which I suppose would also allow Omarr to slack off a 
bit. "Focus on still being dead," he might daily suggest to all astrological 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mars is the Angry Red Planet, Jupiter is the Problem Acne Planet, pocked 
with all manner of unsightly blotches, including a prominent one twice the size 
of Earth that scientists call the Red Spot, when Jupiter's out of hearing 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 And now these comet fragments have been causing outbreaks even bigger than 
that, including one huge 9,600-mile-wide zit that has been oozing superheated 
gasses 1,300 miles into the ether. Were Jupiter not 480 million miles from 
Earth, we'd have a major space etiquette question on our hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Like, should we say something, and if so, what? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey pal, thanks for sharing!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, I'm out of Stridex pads; would you like to use Canada instead?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Say, is that a spume of billions of tons of superheated gasses, or are you 
just glad to see me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, these fragments have been hitting the planet with impacts deemed 
greater than hundreds of times the combined force of all the world's nuclear 
weapons -- and at a fraction of the cost! -- prompting one scientist with a 
gift for understatement to remark, "We can be very glad that this comet was 
heading for Jupiter and not Earth." But what if one of these comet McNuggets 
missed Jupiter, and the gravitational pull of the planet -- which maybe heard 
us guffawing at the Red Spot after all -- spun it around so it was headed right 
for us ? What if one of Jupiter's 11 moons -- which all seem to have names like 
Eo and Geo Metro -- got knocked in our direction? 
</P>
<P>
 Not once have I heard a political candidate put forth a plan to deal with 
flaming terrors from outer space, though I'd like to think Ross Perot was 
working up to it in the last presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 How would Earth defend itself? What if we got every armed person in the world, 
or at least Santa Ana, to shoot at the comet at the same time? Could we sue? If 
nothing else maybe some enterprising outfit could send a rocket to hang a big 
sign on it that says, "I'm going to Disneyland!" or perhaps one of those bumper 
stickers that reads "Bend over, I'll drive!" 
</P>
<P>
 But then, if we were about to become extinct, do you think the folks running 
things would tell you? They know you'd just blow off your job, loot the Liquor 
Barn, burn your condoms, cut off the roof of your car and spend your last hours 
on Earth letting your black Labrador steer down I-5 as you slurred the lyrics 
to "Roller Coaster of Love" at every passing car; wouldn't you? Our civic 
leaders know this, because they know they'd be doing the same thing, and they 
don't want competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that a big hunk o' doom is still heading our way, what with 480 
million miles to be traversed before it obliterates us. And why the hell not? 
There are times I'd sure be hard-pressed to justify our existence. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, what can one say of a species where the greatest solar system 
cataclysm in human history is taking place, and nearly all our collective 
attention is instead focused on the minutiae of a tabloid-esque murder case? 
And we're talking way minute minutiae here, such as the one network TV 
affiliate that solicited opinions on O.J. Simpson's character from a man whose 
sole qualification -- no kidding -- was that three years ago he had once sat on 
a couch next to victim Ronald Goldman as contestants on that highly-regarded TV 
show "Studs."  
</P>
<P>
 Here's a theory the Simpson defense hasn't put forth yet, though it's only a 
matter of time: Maybe the "international hero" was set up to provide a 
distraction from -- that's right -- the comet that's rushing to kill us all. 
Wouldn't it be a great, and irrefutable, bit of courtroom dramatics if attorney 
Robert Shapiro were to announce, "Ladies and gentlemen, defense Exhibit A!" 
right as a sputtering fireball the size of Alaska sliced through the Equator?  
</P>
<P>
 And not only would it be the end of the world, but we could watch it on TV.

3-HOUR TOUR: NEWPORT CENTRAL LIBRARY: READ IT AND REAP

 You won't need a dictionary to unravel the menu at Thai Touch, and since its 
remodeling, the restaurant looks as good as the food tastes. If you do need a 
dictionary, the new-from-the-ground-up Newport Beach Central Library stocks 
scores of them nearby. If you have even a modicum of curiosity, you can get 
lost at the library for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5:40: The exterior resembles a high school gymnasium, or a postmodern 
army barracks, and the color scheme is neutral grays and tans. But it's hardly 
the Bauwau-haus, and anyway, libraries are meant to open up worlds within, not 
be architectural trophies. And this $8.2-million steel, stucco and stone 
facility, which has ocean views, also has one thing that many libraries don't: 
"Space," said clerk Karen Scott -- 54,000 square feet of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground floor is like a book, video and record store all rolled into one, 
only with everything available for checkout, plus there are used books for sale 
in a real bookstore. Literacy services are also available, and even if you can 
read, books on tape are great. It took less than three minutes to get a library 
card (you don't have to be a Newport Beach resident to get one); you can check 
out two items the first day, after that up to 25.  
</P>
<P>
 For research, business holdings or classics, head upstairs. I was interested 
in local histories, and the library stocks nearly 1,000 such volumes. I found 
them in a case behind glass and under lock and key where titles such as 
"History of Orange County, California" and "History of Newport Beach" share the 
shelves with "Bad Company" and "A Century of Dishonor." No wonder they're under 
lock and key. 
</P>
<P>
 Also upstairs are microfiche, microfilm and reader/printers, and CD-ROM-based 
computers. There are on-line catalogue computers throughout the building. You 
can place your own holds for books on the computers, or go into the Bulletin 
Board to check the most recent bestsellers. All the instructions you need are 
at the bottom of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Back downstairs, past the copiers, fax machine and newfangled water fountains 
where the water spirals nautilus-like to the drain, children sat blissfully at 
computer stations discovering the joys of the Multi Media Animal Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't find salamanders!" said Bobby Jacobs, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "There it is, you just passed it!" said Cody Fuller, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a zillion types of salamanders were listed on the screen. Cody 
explained that once an animal is selected, you can see pictures of its diet and 
habitat, or hear the sound it makes. Bullfrogs elicited squeals of delight from 
the youngsters. So, do slimy salamanders make a noise? "No, lots of salamanders 
don't," Cody said. " Size, that's how big it is, but let's see what it eats. 
Ee-yooh! Look at this spider that the red-backed salamander eats. Look what it 
eats, Cody!" 
</P>
<P>
 5:40 to 7: Perhaps if the kids had selected "humans" and then "diet," a 
picture of Irresistible Duck or Crazy Catfish would have appeared on the 
screen. At any rate, either of those dishes are just a straight shot two miles 
up San Miguel Drive in the Newport Hills Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 New owners took over Thai Touch a while back and gave it just the design touch 
it needed. Dangling lights, a single exotic stem on every table and oversize 
glasses contribute to an atmosphere that is amazingly at once relaxed and 
slightly formal, and even somewhat sensuous. Wall collages incorporate Buddhist 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Innovative crossover dishes include Thai Taco ($4.50) and Thai-talian Pasta 
($12.95). The appetizer sampler ($12.95 for two) includes the taco as well as 
Golden Nests, crunchy noodles stuffed with shrimp and pork. My wife said, "It's 
to die for," but try the Ambrosia Chicken Coconut Soup ($4.95) instead of 
chicken noodle soup next time you're feeling punk. 
</P>
<P>
 We resisted Irresistible Duck and, instead, ordered Pompano King ($13.95, 
easily serves two) -- whole fish cooked crisp in a sweet chili sauce -- which 
itself proved irresistible. The sweet rice and mango dessert ($3.95) is a 
must-try: The hot and sticky sweet rice with cool and refreshing mango is an 
inspired combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Thai beers, Singha and Amarit, are served, but Gewurztraminer also 
complements Thai cuisine, and one by Clos du Bois is available by the glass. 
The menu suggests you know your tolerance for heat and tell your server on a

FINANCIAL MARKETS; GOODS REPORT HURTS STOCKS AND BONDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An unexpected surge in orders for durable goods sparked investors' inflation 
fears, driving interest rates sharply higher and stock prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that orders to factories for long-lasting 
big-ticket items such as cars and appliances jumped 1.3% in June. Durable goods 
orders are a key barometer of manufacturing industry plans, because increased 
orders often lead to more production and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad-based nature of the surge, which was more than twice market 
expectations, drove investors' fears of inflationary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond shot up to 
7.61% from 7.54% Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, 
dropped 21/32 point, or $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.21 points to 3,720.47 
on a Big Board volume of 251.76 million shares, up from 231.14 million on 
Tuesday. The broader market was also lower. Declining issues outnumbered 
advancers by about 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. Treasury bond prices 
were hammered from the outset by troubles in the European bond market, 
particularly sharp losses in British trading because of technical influences. 
European financial markets open before New York trading begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just planes and defense. There was actually some general strength 
in the report," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter, 
Discover & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising inflation could give the Federal Reserve more reason to raise 
short-term interest rates again. Higher rates tend to curb inflation, but they 
also diminish the value of existing bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 But the negative factors may have helped bolster demand later in the day when 
the government auctioned five-year notes, some analysts said, by lowering 
prices and thus attracting more investors to the new securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury sold $11 billion in the intermediate notes in the second of two 
note auctions this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the decent response, the bid-to-cover ratio -- a measure of auction 
demand comparing the number of bids offered to those accepted -- was 2.56 to 1. 
That was only slightly lower than the 2.70-to-1 average of previous five-year 
note auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The mildly positive auction results, however, failed to spill over into 
secondary trading, where the new securities are bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher bond yield rates make stocks less appealing relative to 
interest-bearing investments, and borrowing more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market spent the day broadly lower, although the relatively light 
volume lessened the significance of the decline, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even stronger-than-expected earnings reports from Ford Motor Co., Walt Disney, 
DuPont and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing inspired little enthusiasm. Ford 
finished with a loss of 1 to 30 3/8, and DuPont slipped 3/8 to 59 7/8; the 
others ended only slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Allyn, managing director at Jefferies & Co, said the lethargic trading 
indicated investors were reluctant to make significant new commitments in 
stocks without more information about the direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's list of 500 stocks 
fell 0.79 point to 452.57, and the NYSE composite index fell 0.40 point to 
249.84. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues, meanwhile, dropped 
3.53 points to 712.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index 
fell 0.48 point to 434.02. 
</P>
<P>
 Share prices also fell abroad. Equities finished sharply lower in Tokyo on 
selling of export-oriented high-tech shares and arbitrage-linked selling led by 
weakening futures prices. The Nikkei 225-share average closed down 208.14 
points at 20,137.23. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times 100-share average tumbled 34 points to close at 
3,082.3. Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average ended at 2,140.44, down 11.52 points. 
Stocks also closed sharply lower in Paris, Zurich and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, however, the Bolsa index soared 39.82 points to close at 
2433.22, its highest level in almost seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow component Bethlehem Steel lost 1 5/8 to 20 3/4 after reporting earnings 
that fell short of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wm. Wrigley Jr. shed 4 1/8 to 44 on disappointing quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Signet Banking gained 1 3/4 to 39 1/4 after the company said it filed an 
application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to spin off 19.9% of 
its credit card unit in an initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biogen rocketed 15 1/4 to 44 3/4 on news of promising results in a trial of 
its drug for treating multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron, though, fell 5 1/8 to 52 5/8 after Wertheim downgraded the stock, 
citing a potential change in dynamics in the market for multiple sclerosis 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar was mixed, strengthening slightly against the Japanese 
yen but falling against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 An influential U.S. economist and adviser to the Clinton Administration said 
trade sanctions against Japan were unlikely, contributing to the dollar's rise 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 But lower bond prices, hurt by strong durable goods orders that aroused 
inflation fears, drove the dollar lower against the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar rose to 98.55 Japanese yen, up from 98.28 on Tuesday. 
The dollar fell to 1.574 German marks from 1.584 marks.

 U.S. Auto Makers Seek Japanese Loans: The Big Three auto makers have asked for 
low-interest loans from the Export-Import Bank of Japan, a Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry official said.The official said the bank has 
not decided whether to provide the funds. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial 
daily said Ford Motor Co. is negotiating for a capital investment loan of more 
than $300 million, to be used to produce right-hand-drive vehicles for Japan. 
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. said they have held discussions about 
low-interest loans.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A GRIPPING TALE SUFFUSED WITH REPRESSED EMOTION, 
LONELINESS; THE WEEKEND BY PETER CAMERON ; FARRAR STRAUS GIROUX $17, 241 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the late British novelist Barbara Pym, Peter Cameron has the rare ability 
to take an ordinary event, a period of time in which almost nothing ostensibly 
happens, and invest it with heart and significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of two collections of short fiction and the novel "Leap Year," 
Cameron might technically be classified as a minimalist, but there is nothing 
"minimal" about the welter of repressed emotion and loneliness that suffuses 
his new, expertly crafted book. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is simple enough: Lyle and his recent "romantic" involvement, 
Robert, visit Lyle's best friends, Marian and John and their strangely quiet 
baby, Roland, at their country home. John's deceased brother Tony was Lyle's 
lover for 10 years, and the weekend of the trip coincides with the first 
anniversary of Tony's death from AIDS. The small, well-drawn cast of supporting 
characters includes Laura Ponti, an aging glamorous expatriate who has rented a 
summer house nearby, her B-movie star daughter, Nina, and Nina's married 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Of weekend guests, Laura muses, " . . . in a way it's so disturbing. To have 
someone for the weekend. They breeze in and disrupt everything, and before you 
can adjust they're gone" -- and indeed, the visit is not a success. The long 
shadow of the past constantly intrudes upon the present, and a sharp tension 
permeates every encounter, no matter how casual. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Marian's prediction that Lyle and Robert's relationship won't last 
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and each man and woman winds up painfully 
alone with thoughts and recriminations, private doubts and worry. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to Cameron's considerable credit that he makes us care deeply about 
these people, feel their hurts, embarrassments and hopes. The book reads 
quickly -- a fascinating literary page-turner -- and then sticks in the 
imagination. The basic situation is at once both common enough to be familiar 
and distinctive enough to be captivating. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron possesses a talent for understated description, making us feel as if 
certain ordinary occurrences have rarely before been so well observed, a skill 
largely derived from an economic attention to telling detail. Here, for 
instance, he relates in a single passage practically all we need know about the 
relationship of John and Marian: 
</P>
<P>
 "John got up and walked to his side of the fence. 'What?' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Nothing,' said Marian. She kissed him, then lay her face on his shoulder. 
John extended his arms around her, but kept his hands in the air, for they were 
dirty, and Marian was dressed all in white. He kissed her neck, and then moved 
his mouth from her jaw to her shoulder. He kept his lips there, in the hollow 
above her collarbone. 'I love you,' he told her, because it was true and 
because he knew it was what she wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 This subtle precision is effective when conveying a physical nuance -- as in 
"beautiful faces usually become closed with awareness of their beauty, but 
Robert's was not. His face was like a gift he had not yet learned to withhold" 
-- but it becomes truly powerful when applied to an abstract emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things you lose you do not get back," Lyle realizes at one point. 
"You cannot have them, ever again, except in the smudging carbon copy of 
memory. There are things that seem irreconcilable that you must find a way to 
reconcile with. The simple passage of days dulls the sharpness of the pain, but 
it never wears it out: what gets washed away in time gets washed away, and then 
you are left with a hard cold nub of something, an unlosable souvenir. A little 
china dachshund from the White Mountains. A shadow puppet from Bali . . . an 
ivory shoehorn from a four-star hotel in Zurich. And here, like a stone I carry 
everywhere, is a bit of someone's heart I saved from a journey I once made." 
</P>
<P>
 Marian, too, is analytical about her reactions to loss. "She thought: it's 
very difficult to memorialize the dead, to make a remembrance of them that is 
not an indulgence of your grief is almost impossible. And you will never have 
them again untainted by your sorrow, never think of them, or see them, with a 
clean flurry of feeling, but always with this grief, this sorrow, this selfish 
feeling of abandonment, which is more about you than about them. She hated 
feeling sorry for herself that Tony was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Weekend" is a short book, but it's concise in the way of a poem or 
brilliant one-act play: each line, each word matters. We close the book not 
only knowing each complicated, "prickly" character better, but also more aware 
and appreciative of the intricate sculpture that underlies all human social 
arrangements.

ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM PLAGUE MONTEREY PARK LIBRARY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after forcing the resignation of its Asian American librarian, 
the Monterey Park library system is again simmering with disputes over alleged 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Tse, one of two Asian Americans on the library board and president of 
the Chinese American Education Assn., accused other board members and their 
political allies of seeking to force her off the panel because of her outspoken 
opposition to Jeannette Cheng's removal as librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to force her removal, the five-member city board tried to use its 
rule that three unexcused absences from the monthly meetings means forfeiture 
of the seat, Tse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation turned bitter after her second absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Kathleen Brzozowski dismissed the allegation as a 
misunderstanding, saying that the board excused the second absence. 
</P>
<P>
 But she expressed doubts about whether Tse belonged on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seems to have problem understanding English. I can't understand how she 
can be on a state committee," Brzozowski said. (Gov. Pete Wilson appointed Tse 
earlier this year to a state education commission.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to help her, but she is obviously not suited for this type of 
position," Brzozowski said. "She needs to take a low position until she can 
speak the language." 
</P>
<P>
 Those statements infuriated Tse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not only an insult. It is prejudice," said Tse, who has a masters 
degree in education from USC and has taught English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems began on April 13 after Tse missed a meeting because of a family 
emergency, her first unexcused absence. 
</P>
<P>
 She missed a second meeting May 4. That meeting had been moved forward a week 
from its regular date to accommodate Brzozowski's vacation. Tse said she was 
only told about the change two days before and could not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski said Tse was notified three days in advance. But Brzozowski also 
acknowledged that the meeting's date had been changed 17 days in advance and 
two weeks before Tse was notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Tse said that at the next meeting in June, she asked to be excused for the 
absence, but received no reply. The minutes of that meeting note only that Tse 
asked to be excused. 
</P>
<P>
 So earlier this month, Tse wrote a letter to Brzozowski saying she had been 
denied her due process rights because of the short notice, and the board 
decided that it actually had excused her at the June meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager acknowledged his oversight in not informing Tse earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lois Marriott, a retired assistant dean who had previously 
supervised the library at Southwestern College in Chula Vista, a city in south 
San Diego County, took over July 1 as interim director of the Monterey Park 
library system.  
</P>
<P>
 Marriott, a librarian for 36 years, retired last month. She said she will be 
interim librarian for six or eight months, and has no plans to pursue the 
position permanently. Marriott will earn $5,000 to $6,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng, who had been one of two Asian American department heads in the city, 
was asked to resign April 21 by the board and given a $60,000 buyout of her 
contract. The move was denounced by the city's Friends of the Library group and 
members of the library staff as a racially motivated action backed by a 
predominantly white group of longtime residents of the city, which now has a 
majority of Asian residents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time racial issues have touched the library. In 1987, 
the City Council took control of the library, saying it had too many foreign 
language books. Civil rights groups sued and a judge said the library board 
could not be removed by the council.

BATTLING BACK FROM TRAGEDY; SEVERELY INJURED IN ALTADENA BLAZE, MAN IS 
DETERMINED TO RETURN TO FIREFIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TALLY GOLDSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriel Larios has gone through 20 surgeries to repair his badly burned body, 
and must go through 20 more. 
</P>
<P>
 The way he looks at it, he's halfway toward getting back to his firefighting 
job, a career he has every intention of pursuing even though it caused his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a once-in-a-lifetime thing," he said, smiling stiffly beneath the 
flexible mask he wears to protect his scarred face. "I'll never have to worry 
about it happening again." As part of Los Angeles County's Air Attack Crew 
based in La Canada Flintridge, Larios and his crew mates battled wildfires by 
using chain saws and shovels to clear brush in the fire's path. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year ago, Larios and seven others made the mistake of descending into 
a ravine in Altadena where they could not see the approaching fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys at the top of the mountain were yelling at us to get out, but the 
ground was too soft for me to get a grip," said Larios, a strapping man with 
broad shoulders and glowing brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only took about 10 to 15 seconds before I was surrounded by the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Larios' fire-retardant clothing could not protect him from the intense heat. 
He suffered third-degree burns on 45% of his body, including his arms, back and 
face. Two of his crew mates, Arthur Ruezga, 33, and Christopher Herman, 25, 
were killed in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I got out. My adrenaline was pumping and my brain kicked 
into survival mode," he said. "A lot of things were racing through my mind, but 
my main goal was to get to safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, Larios' mind has been fixed on getting back to his job and on 
enjoying the baby daughter born four months after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say you're supposed to have depression and nightmares, but 
I'm a strong-willed person," said Larios, 21. "They sent a team of social 
workers and psychologists, but I wasn't interested." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, the burned tendons in Larios' hands kept his fingers curled, but 
the first of two operations and physical therapy allowed him a steady, if not 
firm, handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Larios had skin grafted from his leg to help reconstruct the 
space between his nose and mouth. Over the next five years and another 20 
expected operations, he will also have his nose, ears and lips reconstructed, 
said Michel Brones, Larios' doctor and a specialist in corrective surgery for 
burn patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain in Larios' face is usually minimal, but he wears a mask to keep the 
scar tissue from thickening and to protect his face from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The face mask, attached by a tan strap around his head, elicits a lot of 
attention from strangers and from Acelia, Larios' 7-month-old daughter, who 
likes to tap and tug at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Larios said he is used to being stared at in public, but John P. Harris, a 
fire captain at La Canada Flintridge, said he thinks Larios is far more tired 
of it than he is willing to admit. "After a while, you just want to be left 
alone," Harris said. "Who could blame him?"  
</P>
<P>
 Larios has rejected emotional therapy, but all of his colleagues at the La 
Canada Flintridge fire station have taken advantage of some type of therapy to 
see them through, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of trauma from something like this cannot be measured," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters watched a TV show about firefighters killed recently in 
Colorado, many started to cry, Harris said. "None of us will ever be the same 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Larios' wife, Nesell, 21, says she had a bad feeling the day of the fire. 
"Call it intuition," she said. "But I spent all day on the phone trying to find 
out if Gab was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Larios also had a bad feeling about descending into the ravine that day, but 
he is quick to add that it was a group decision and no one is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we have a fatality or a serious burn, we know mistakes were made," 
Harris said. "But some of the guys have a guilt complex about what happened, 
and that's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Larios cannot remember a time when he did not want to be a firefighter. As a 
child, he used to play at the firehouse across from the police station where 
his father was an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Larios' father, Hector, also had wanted to be a firefighter but did not 
qualify because of his colorblindness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just fun to see people's faces after you've helped them," Larios said. 
"You get a lot of gratitude from society." 
</P>
<P>
 His fellow firefighters say Larios is a lighthearted man who tended to see the 
cheery side of a situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the guy at camp who would always cheer you up if you were having a bad 
day," said crew mate Shawn Ohara, 20, who went through training with Larios in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew mate Christopher Barth, 27, who was burned on 20% of his body in the 
Altadena fire, is back on limited duty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brones said Larios, who receives workers compensation, should not return 
in any capacity for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the most severe burn cases I've seen," Brones said. "But he's a 
healthy individual with a positive outlook and a lot of determination." 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, several firefighters considered quitting or transferring 
to a different department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are very, very jittery out there," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not him, Larios says. "If I could go back tomorrow, I would," he said.

HOMEOWNERS VOICE OPPOSITION TO RACETRACK'S CONCERT PLAN; ENTERTAINMENT: PROGRAM 
WOULD BOOST REVENUE AT SANTA ANITA. RESIDENTS FEAR INCREASES IN NOISE, TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to boost revenue at Santa Anita Park, the racetrack's operating 
company plans to make it one of the Southland's biggest outdoor venues for 
concerts and festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Arcadia City Council unanimously decided to allow 
music and entertainment events at the 320-acre facility on 30 days over the 
next year as part of a pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no Aerosmith or Gun N' Roses. No rock concerts are allowed 
under this ordinance," said Clifford C. Goodrich, vice president of Santa Anita 
Operating Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors of Santa Anita are not so sure about the motives of the track 
owners. Homeowners, who have complained they have suffered through previous 
occasional music festivals, say they believe it is the first move toward a 
full-blown concert venue like Irvine Meadows or the precursor to the 
construction of an arena like the Great Western Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel they are testing the waters for things to come," said Jim Fox, a 
homeowner who lives within a furlong of the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita officials have already arranged "Festival Santa Anita," a Latino 
music and cultural event, on Labor Day weekend on the track's infield, and an 
Irish festival for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concentrating on getting concerts and festivals with a family 
orientation, most with multi-stages rather than one big one," said Goodrich, 
seeking to reassure nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita Operating Co. has been searching for ways to generate extra 
revenue and utilize its huge grassy infield and 22,000-space parking lot on 
non-race days since attendance began declining a few years ago with the 
introduction of satellite wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita officials pitched the concept of a state-of-the-art domed music 
center in the parking lot last October to the City Council, and even hired an 
architect to come up with ideas, Fox recalled. Track officials said it was only 
a concept and that no deals have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 After news of Santa Anita's latest plans filtered into the community in June, 
a tide of opposition grew. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents from nearby streets appeared at a public hearing to 
express fears over concert noise, traffic congestion and intoxicated fans 
collapsing in their front yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're Santa Anita, you're not going to bother with a venture like this 
unless long term you plan for more than 30 days with some popular 
entertainment," said Ben Serar, a resident of an area north of the track known 
as The Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy hearing the roar of the crowd as the horses come down to the wire. 
But when they've held music events there in the past, it's like it's in my back 
yard," Fox said. Music programs in the past were limited to nonprofit events in 
the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners expressed similar fears at a special meeting held in council 
chambers to inform them about upcoming events.  
</P>
<P>
 Their concerns about the future of Santa Anita Park have been exacerbated by 
the death of the man who was considered the heart and soul of Santa Anita, 
Robert P. Strub, chairman of the board and son of the track's founder, Charles 
H. Strub. 
</P>
<P>
 With Strub's death, residents say, the track is likely to take on more of a 
corporate identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodrich said the homeowners' fears are unfounded. He maintained that the 
ordinance keeps a tight rein on all events and that it is specifically designed 
for one year so the council can put an end to the arrangement if it works out 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Track officials said they volunteered the ban on rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dennis Lojeski agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "These restrictions are so tough they really screw them down on everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita will be allowed to hold events, from rodeos to multi-stage music 
festivals, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Fridays 
and Saturdays. The track or event promoter must obtain a permit for each event, 
pay for a city technician each time to monitor sound levels, deposit $2,000 to 
cover costs and could face a $1,000 fine or misdemeanor prosecution for any 
noise violations. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents say they fear the city will not challenge the racetrack's 
actions because it provides substantial revenue to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate the new events will generate $168,000 in admissions 
taxes for the cash-strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anita Operating Co. and Newport Beach-based Santa Anita Realty 
Enterprises Inc., one of the state's largest real estate trusts, make up the 
publicly traded Santa Anita Cos. The companies own the racetrack, half of 
Arcadia's Santa Anita Fashion Park and a large medical office building. The 
three holdings provided $3.4 million in taxes to Arcadia last year.

COMMUNITY NEWS; 4 CITIES, RESIDENTS SUE TO BLOCK CASINO; GAMING: OFFICIALS AND 
A CITIZENS GROUP SAY POMONA MUST CONDUCT AN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY AND PUT THE 
MATTER BEFORE VOTERS.

 Citing fears that two proposed card clubs in Pomona could increase noise, 
crime and traffic in the surrounding areas, four neighboring cities and a local 
citizens group have filed a lawsuit to force Pomona to conduct a full 
environmental impact report and allow residents to vote on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of La Verne, Claremont, Chino and Chino Hills joined the Committee 
Against Card Club Casinos in Pomona in filing the suit in Superior Court last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Pomona violated the Gaming Registration Act and the 
California Environmental Quality Act by approving a business license ordinance 
and zoning ordinance for the casinos without conducting an environmental impact 
report and a public vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lomeli, city manager of La Verne, said the group was driven to file the 
lawsuit after Pomona ignored at least a dozen letters the cities sent regarding 
the issues. And members of the citizens group said they protested the casino 
proposal in writing and at City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, Pomona has dared the other cities and the citizens to sue them," 
Lomeli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary plans for a card club named Champs proposed 100 gaming tables in a 
68,000-square-foot facility along the Pomona (60) Freeway, Pomona City Atty. 
Arnold Alvarez-Glasman said. Tradewinds, the other proposed casino, would 
feature 50 tables, plus live music, food, video games and pool, in a 
60,000-square-foot complex on the southwest corner of the Los Angeles County 
Fairgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, the city approved a business license ordinance that Alvarez-Glasman 
said updated a 1964 gaming law, and a zoning ordinance that allows card clubs 
in areas zoned for light industry and at the fairgrounds. The council took no 
action on the specific card club proposals, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Alvarez-Glasman said, the approval process is on hold while the city 
considers various reports on the proposals. Opponents of the card clubs say 
Pomona was out of line in approving the new ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaming Registration Act requires cities seeking casinos that did not have 
ordinances before 1984 allowing gaming clubs to put the issue on the ballot. 
And there lies the bone of contention. Pomona says it has laws dating to 1964 
that allow casino gambling. Card club opponents, however, say it does not, and 
that it in fact passed an ordinance that year banning all card games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court's interpretation of that law will decide whether Pomona 
must put the issue before the public. Last month the city considered putting 
card clubs on the ballot, but on June 29, the council voted not to. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also says the California Environmental Quality Act requires Pomona to 
conduct an environmental impact report. Pomona did issue a "negative 
declaration" -- a shorter, less comprehensive investigation of the casinos' 
possible effects on surrounding areas. And Alvarez-Glasman said the city has 
not ruled out the possibility of conducting a full environmental impact report, 
which would involve extensive study and public comment. Although the suit 
contends that Pomona has overlooked some legal obligations in approving the 
card club proposal, some neighboring officials say they don't want card clubs 
with or without an environmental report and an election.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think card clubs do bring in organized crime," Councilman Ed Graham of 
Chino Hills said. "Nothing positive can come out of card clubs besides cash 
flowing into a city, but at what cost?"

COMMUNITY NEWS: HEARING ON TOXIC WASTE CLEANUP AT CARSON SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State environmental officials will discuss plans to clean up toxic waste at 
the Golden Eagle Refinery site during a public meeting Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Toxic substances at the site include lead, hydrocarbons and petroleum products 
left over from the production of gasoline and other fuels on the property. 
About 10 acres on the northeastern corner of the property was used as a 
landfill for commercial and residential waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is at 21000 S. Figueroa St., just east of the Harbor Freeway and 
about one mile south of the intersection of the Harbor and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson Town Center Inc. owns the site, but Lasmo Oil and Gas Inc., parent 
company of Golden Eagle/Ultramar, is in charge of cleaning up the facility, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, property owners have excavated 1.3 million cubic yards of 
contaminated soil, which was either treated or disposed of in other landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Several methods to handle hazardous materials on the site are already in 
place. Layers of clay and asphalt now cover the landfill, and the methane gas 
that collects under the cap is vented and burned off. Officials from the 
California Department of Toxic Substance Control expect that the gas will 
continue to be flared off even after the site is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravel-filled trenches on the property collect water contaminated with 
petroleum products so it can be cleaned.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect cleanup of the ground water to take at least seven years, 
said department spokesman Rich Varenchik.  
</P>
<P>
 At the public meeting next week, DTSC officials will discuss plans for further 
cleanup of the area and take public comment on the proposals. In about 60 days, 
the DTSC will respond in writing to the comments and the remedial action plan 
will be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Carson Community Center, 3 Civic 
Plaza.

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; LANDFILL FIRM'S EXPANSION PLANS DRAW CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the city of West Covina attempts to close BKK Landfill, the company has 
announced plans to put trash on 24 more acres of its site, drawing criticism 
from city officials and neighboring residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24 acres, now empty, lie to the north of the main 170-acre landfill 
site.Although that land is within BKK's boundaries, the plan must be approved 
by the Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to open more acres comes in the midst of a lawsuit by the city 
demanding that BKK terminate all its landfill operations by November, 1995. The 
suit alleges that the company agreed to do so in a 1985 memorandum of 
understanding with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe Ponek, a geologist for the Water Quality Control Board, said the suit 
will not affect the approval process for the proposed expansion. But approval 
of the expansion would be no guarantee of the landfill's future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If BKK (officials) develop the area and lose the lawsuit to West Covina, 
they've basically done all that work at their own peril," Ponek said.  
</P>
<P>
 BKK contends that it is not obligated to close next year.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; CITY SETTLES CLAIMS OF LOSS BY 10 VENDORS AT SOCCER EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The city of Pasadena has reached settlements with 10 vendors who complained 
that they lost thousands of dollars after setting up booths in the poorly 
attended Soccer Carnaval, a monthlong festival organized around the recent 
World Cup games at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials would not release details of the settlements because 
disclosure could influence negotiations on outstanding claims of about a dozen 
more vendors, said city spokeswoman Ann Erdman. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the vendors who settled was Joseph P. Gonzalez, who flew from 
Davenport, N.Y., to sell security systems at Soccer Carnaval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's satisfactory," said Gonzalez, who agreed to keep details confidential 
until negotiations on the other claims are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez estimates that he lost about $14,000 in booth rental, travel and 
other expenses related to Soccer Carnaval. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the outstanding claims are from vendors who recently retained Los 
Angeles lawyer Jonathan M. Levitan. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitan said that last Friday he sent a letter requesting a settlement meeting 
to Pasadena City Manager Philip A. Hawkey, World Cup USA and Pasadena 
Productions Inc., which co-produced Soccer Carnaval with the city. The lawyer 
said Tuesday he was waiting for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena festival was to combine soccer clinics, crafts, musicians, 
international food, retailers and carnival rides to pull in $3.2 million, 
including $650,000 for the city, from admission fees, booth rentals and 
corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But by opening day, Soccer Carnaval had no major corporate sponsors and the 
idea of an admission fee had been scrapped. In addition, World Cup officials 
had forbidden the city to open the festival on game days.

 ALHAMBRA: Two Alhambra women were killed in a traffic accident July 21 in the 
1800 block of West Valley Boulevard. Eva Palacios, 73, and Hortensia Rodriguez, 
71, were traveling east in a white 1989 Mercury when it was broadsided by a 
white 1994 Acura Integra. The women were taken to Los Angeles County Medical 
Center, where they died a short time later. The driver of the Integra, Teo Van 
Pham, 24, of Rosemead was also taken to the medical center for treatment. He is 
being held at the jail ward of the medical center on suspicion of two counts of 
vehicular manslaughter. Police said that witnesses told them the Integra was 
traveling faster than 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 ALHAMBRA: An armed robber broke into a couple's home July 21, took the wife 
hostage and released her three hours later. The victims, a 70-year-old man and 
his 69-year-old wife whose names were not released, were in their home in the 
100 block of South Cordova Street when a man broke in just after midnight and 
robbed the couple at gunpoint. He then forced the woman into the family's car. 
The woman was released a mile away from her home, police said. The robber 
escaped with a small amount of cash and is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: A Bank of America branch was robbed the afternoon of July 21. The 
robber entered the bank in the 100 block of East Foothill Boulevard, pretended 
to have a weapon and demanded money from a teller. He escaped with about $430 
in cash in a silver Hyundai driven by another man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 AZUSA: An 18-month-old girl was killed Friday night when her parent's car was 
rear-ended by a suspected drunk driver. The child, whose name was not released, 
was in a child restraint seat in the back of the car, which was stopped at a 
red light at 1st Street and Cerritos Avenue. The baby suffered head injuries 
and was taken to Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, where she died the next 
day. Police arrested Jose Medrano, 25, of Rowland Heights on suspicion of 
vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: Police arrested three juveniles July 21 on suspicion of burglary 
and possession of stolen property. The names of the juveniles -- two males and 
a female -- were not released because of their ages. They were arrested at 11 
p.m. at the Peppertree Shopping Center at the intersection of Arrow Highway and 
Indian Hill Boulevard. The suspects had allegedly broken into six cars in the 
shopping center, stealing cassette tapes and other property. They were released 
to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: A 19-year-old Upland woman who was found unconscious and dehydrated 
in her car last week in a Claremont flood control channel has regained 
consciousness and is out of critical condition at USC University Hospital. 
Melissa Pillow, who recently completed her freshman year at Cal Poly Pomona, 
was driving home after midnight last week when her car left the road and 
dropped 40 feet into the channel. She was found more than 30 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 INDUSTRY: A 32-year-old Norwalk man was shot and killed Sunday night in the 
3200 block of Gilman Road after he apparently argued with another man. Jose 
Guerra was shot several times in the upper body at 5:50 p.m., sheriff's 
deputies said. The killer fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 INDUSTRY: A sheriff's substation will soon open at the Puente Hills Mall. The 
multipurpose station, which will also serve as a mall security office and 
community center, is scheduled to open July 29 and will be open seven days a 
week during regular mall hours. Mall security and sheriff's deputies will use 
the center for work with business owners on crime prevention, report 
preparation and Sheriff's Department training. The center will also be staffed 
by civilian volunteers trained by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 LA VERNE: A 16-year-old Altadena boy disguised in a false beard, mustache and 
theatrical makeup was arrested July 21 when he tried to buy alcohol at a 
supermarket by using fake identification and someone else's checkbook. The boy, 
whose name was not released, was arrested on suspicion of forgery and on 
suspicion of violating an obscure penal code section that makes it illegal to 
use a disguise in the commission of a crime, police said. The juvenile entered 
a Lucky supermarket in the 2300 block of Foothill Boulevard and tried to buy 
alcohol, paying for it by writing a $41 check. The clerk called the bank 
because the check was from out of town and discovered that the account had been 
closed. The youth was released to the custody of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: A dozen sheriff's deputies and Monrovia and Irwindale police 
dispersed about 50 suspected gang members who were hanging out and drinking 
beer in a county park Saturday night. Charles Bennet, 33, of Monrovia and 
Diamond Anderson, 20, of Fontana, were arrested on suspicion of inciting to

 SAN GABRIEL: A 17-year-old San Gabriel boy was killed Saturday night in a 
drive-by shooting. Police responded to a call of shots being fired in the 900 
block of East Broadway at about 9 p.m. They found the boy, a known gang member, 
lying on the sidewalk. He had been shot in the upper torso with a large-caliber 
revolver, police said. They did not release the victim's name because they had 
not yet been able to locate and notify his parents. Two males fled the scene in 
a dark Cadillac.

COMMUNITY NEWS: JAILED WOMAN RELEASED AS KIDNAPING INQUIRY CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena police have released a woman jailed in connection with the July 19 
kidnapping of a 26-year-old Pasadena man. 
</P>
<P>
 Walella Mayson, 32, of Norwalk, was released Tuesday night, pending further 
investigation of the kidnaping of Robert Gray, son of the float chairman for 
the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, Laura Melgar, 28, of Los Angeles, was released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the women after tracing calls made from their homes to the 
victim's father, Lawrence Gray. Gray Jr.'s captors demanded $800,000 in ransom 
money but failed to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Police now believe that the women did not participate in the actual kidnaping 
but had knowledge of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking to question two men: Mayson's boyfriend and Melgar's 
husband, an ex-employee of the Edmund A. Gray Co., a Los Angeles pipe 
manufacturing company where the victim worked as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Police wouldn't release details but said the two men are both believed to be 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gray was accosted at gunpoint just after 6 a.m. as he was leaving his 
Pasadena condominium to go to work. His abductors blindfolded and bound him, 
then drove him in his Toyota pickup to a spot where they switched to another 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray was found unharmed in an alley in South-Central Los Angeles about 16 
hours later.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ALTADENA; COURT RULING REVIVES ENVIRONMENTAL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Court of Appeal revived an environmental lawsuit that seeks to stop 
a massive housing development in the foothills of Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel on July 14 overturned a Superior Court judge's decision 
that had dismissed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit by the Friends of La Vina, an Altadena-based group, against the 
county and developers Southwest Diversified and Cantwell Anderson challenges 
the adequacy of an environmental impact report and the specific plan for the 
272-home project on 210 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going back to Superior Court and finally this case will be heard on its 
merits, but there should never have been a year's delay," said Adolfo Miralles, 
chairman of the group that takes it name from the area where the homes are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's members say the environmental study does an inadequate job of 
addressing fire safety issues, flooding, destruction of wildlife habitat and 
traffic escalation. The small village of homes approved by county supervisors 
in 1992 would be situated at the end of Lincoln Avenue on the edge of the 
Angeles National Forest.

PEOPLE: PASADENA LETTER WRITER GETS AWARD FOR BEING 'AGITATOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 84-year-old Pasadena woman who has wielded her antique manual typewriter on 
behalf of various crusades for almost 30 years has been honored for her 
activism by the national citizens lobby, Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Clara Link is one of five activists from throughout the nation recently 
presented a Service Achievement Award as "an indefatigable agitator for good 
government."Selected from more than 75 nominees this year, Link is the seventh 
Californian to be honored since the annual program began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Link helped start the California chapter of Common Cause in 1970 and has been 
active in Planned Parenthood, the League of Women Voters, California Republican 
League and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause officials cited Link for repeatedly making her voice heard and 
holding government accountable for its actions. Her most vociferous medium has 
been letters to the editors of various publications, along with reams of 
letters to local, state and federal representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clara's secret weapon is her typewriter," said Suzanne Greenfield, a Common 
Cause lobbyist who supervised selection of winners this year. "She personifies 
what citizens can and should do to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1965, Link has steadily pounded out her opinions on everything from the 
Equal Rights Amendment to campaign reform, educational opportunities, the 
environment and abortion. Link, who describes herself as "enthusiastic and 
noisy," said she is inspired whenever she sees "some unfair, hostile action" or 
reads about "outrageous accusations."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY; U.S. TO FUND JOB-TRAINING PROGRAM FOR YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Young people in three Mid-City areas will be the beneficiaries of a job 
training and apprenticeship program funded by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is one of 16 U.S. cities selected to participate in the Youth Fair 
Chance program to begin this fall.The city will receive $3 million over the 
next 18 months, plus an additional $1 million annually for three more years if 
the program is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's application was initiated by Councilman Mike Hernandez. The program 
targets residents 14 to 30 years old and living in portions of the Pico-Union, 
Westlake and Temple-Beaudry neighborhoods. The application cited high rates of 
crime, poverty, teen pregnancy and high school dropouts in the three 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt that on a national scale these communities are unique in 
many ways," Hernandez said. "The federal government recognized that and agreed 
that we needed this funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that people are just beginning to understand that if you focus 
resources where they are most needed, and then you change those needs, then you 
can change entire communities," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Community Development agency will begin compiling a waiting list of 
interested applicants this month. Those chosen will participate in job 
training, school-to-work transition programs and apprenticeship activities. 
Participants will also help rehabilitate housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Program organizers hope to serve about 1,000 youths over a four-year period, 
said Tony Perez, press deputy for Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating agencies include the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, RLA, 
Ketchum Downtown YMCA, the Carpenters Union and Belmont High School.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; A BROUHAHA ON TAP; DESPITE A LONG FIGHT BY 
MILLER BREWING CO., A $25-MILLION PROJECT TO RECLAIM WATER MOVES CLOSER TO 
REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TALLY GOLDSTEIN , Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Vitale expressed a common reaction to the thought of her favorite beer 
being made with treated sewage water. Cocking her head in disbelief, she said, 
"That's disgusting!" 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to advertising slogans, there's little doubt that "made with 
sewage that has undergone tertiary reclamation" doesn't have quite the same 
ring as "Rocky Mountain spring water" or "artesian wells." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, some claim, is why the Miller Brewing Co. has been holding up for a 
year a $25-million water reclamation project proposed by water district 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Miller officials respond, they simply think the process is potentially 
dangerous and requires further research before reclaimed water is allowed to 
flow through San Gabriel Valley taps, including the 860 million gallons of 
water that Miller draws each year to make 5 1/2 million gallons of beer at its 
Irwindale plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote last week, the board of directors for the Upper San 
Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District approved the environmental impact 
report for an underground pipeline to transport the reclaimed water from a 
sewage plant in Whittier to the Santa Fe spreading grounds in Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Miller has delayed the project for one year by inundating water 
district officials with questions they are required to answer about its impact 
on the environment and the public. But now that the environmental impact report 
has been approved, the brewer, by far the highest-profile opponent of the 
project, is left with little recourse but to sue or accept sewage. Company 
attorneys said they are considering court action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have scientists who say it's dangerous and they have scientists who say 
it's not. It comes to the point of dueling studies," said Michael Brophy, 
manager of corporate communications at Miller headquarters in Milwaukee, Wis. 
"We're erring on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the region is going to need that water one day, said Jim Goodrich, 
executive director of the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority, which 
oversees the cleanup of the basin's pollutants. "It's hogwash that this is a 
health issue," he said. "Reclaimed water is cleaner than storm water." 
</P>
<P>
 Treated water from the Whittier plant already is pumped into homes in 43 
cities, many of them in the southeastern part of the county, where residents 
have been drinking it for 32 years. The new project is basically just a 
pipeline to bring the water to consumers farther north. 
</P>
<P>
 The Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, which serves 1 million 
residents in 18 valley cities, imports 25% of its water from Northern 
California and the Colorado River. Valley water officials say that supply will 
be tougher to count on as authorities in both areas hold on to more water for 
environmental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a reliable option locally," said Bob Berlien, manager of the water 
district. "There's no danger now, but we can't depend on imported water in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, Goodrich contends, is emotional, not physical. "Miller is deathly 
afraid of their corporate image because no one likes the idea of drinking dirty 
water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brophy retorts that safety is the only issue; the brewery is not concerned, he 
said, with how customers might view its product if they knew it was made with 
reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
 So how would customers view it? 
</P>
<P>
 A few Miller drinkers at a bar in Pasadena raised their eyebrows at the 
thought, but no one said they would switch to another brand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think recycled water is a very good idea, but I don't want to be a guinea 
pig," said Rose Garcia, a 25-year-old Azusa resident, as she gazed at her glass 
of beer. "I'll support it if they're sure it won't come back to haunt me in 10 
years . . . But if this has a negative effect on Miller, they might leave the 
area. I'm worried about people losing their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Irwindale plant, one of seven the company operates nationwide, employs 850 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Forest Tennant, a physician who created the organization Citizens for 
Clean Water last fall to oppose the water reclamation project, said he worries 
that other area businesses also would leave in search of new water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennant also does not believe that the three-step purification process water 
officials endorse is foolproof against diseases. "They've got to include 
reverse osmosis before I'll support it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverse osmosis, which would cost twice as much as the process water officials 
propose, does not decontaminate water, according to Earle Hartling, water 
recycling coordinator at the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant. It 
dissolves salts. "The only reason Dr. Tennant supports (reverse osmosis) is 
because it's costly and people won't go for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the proposal has not created any storms of protest from other 
businesses, though at least a few share Miller's opposition to it. Although no 
one has put it in writing, about 20 of the 537 business owners in Irwindale 
have come forward to voice opposition to the project, said Joe DiShanni, 
executive director of Irwindale's Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, reclaimed water will attract businesses," Berlien said. Whereas 
the Upper San Gabriel Valley district annually imports water for $235 per acre 
foot, reclaimed water would cost $200 per acre foot. An acre-foot is an area of 
land about the size of a football field that extends 1 foot deep, and equals 
326,000 gallons of water, or nearly 3.5 million 12-ounce bottles of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "While our neighbors deal with increasing water costs, we'll have the stable, 
cheaper alternative of reclaimed water," Berlien said. The district will pass 
on the savings to the water retailers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed reclaimed water as safe for 
the public and environment, but Miller wants the opportunity to run its own 
tests on water samples from the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant in 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battle of conflicting memories, Dan Barthold, a Miller engineer, said 
district officials agreed to submit water samples to the brewery last summer, 
but then rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlien rebutted that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were more than happy to give them the samples," Berlien said. "All we 
asked was that they split them with us, so we could run the same tests on them 
that they wanted to run. But they refused to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," Barthold said. "We are always willing to split samples." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Miller has yet to test these samples, a situation that keeps 
government and brewery officials at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 The water project would be funded by the money generated from water bills and 
is expected to take two years to complete. It calls for a nine-mile undergound 
pipeline that would transport reclaimed water north from the Whittier plant, 
running along the 605 freeway to the Santa Fe spreading grounds at the 
intersection of the 210 freeway in Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the water is sent through the pipeline, it undergoes tertiary 
treatment, the highest level of sewage treatment. The San Jose Creek Water 
Reclamation Plant, which is one of 12 wastewater treatment plants run by the 
Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, purifies 30 million gallons of 
wastewater a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process is as close to guaranteeing 100% bacteria- and virus-free water 
as is humanly possible," said Hartling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartling dipped a test tube into the purified water, which cascaded over a 
curved wall into yet another tank, and gulped it down. "See, this is safe to 
drink even before it's percolated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once piped to the Santa Fe spreading grounds, the water would percolate, or 
seep, through 240 feet of earth, taking at least 30 days to reach the 
groundwater table. "This is another filtration system," Hartling explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 14 years, plant officials have tested monthly for viruses. In 
761 samples, which equals 760,000 liters of water, officials found one virus, 
Hartling said. "That would be about the same you would find in regular old 
rainwater and even less than what you might find in Colorado River water 
because of the tourists and other pollutants affecting it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials cite a study that found no adverse health effects for 
residents who have been drinking reclaimed water from the San Jose Creek plant. 
The 1984 study was conducted by UCLA's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the knowledge of the time, it was a first-class study," Tennant said. 
"But I don't know if it applies today. In 1984 we didn't know about Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome, Hepatitis C or AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said HIV, the virus that causes 
AIDS, cannot be contracted from reclaimed water. The virus is extremely fragile 
outside the human body and dies on contact with chlorine, which is used twice 
during the reclamation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennant also expressed concerns that mixing reclaimed water with the badly 
polluted basin water may create a new strain of health problems. The basin, 
which is listed by the federal government as one of the most polluted sites in 
the country, contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can cause cancer 
and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no legitimacy to the argument that mixing reclaimed water 
with VOCs would create something dangerous," said Goodrich of the Water Quality 
Authority. "Do you know what was in the basin when UCLA conducted their tests 
on reclaimed water? VOCs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Dixon, executive director of El Monte and South El Monte's Chamber of 
Commerce, took a tour of the San Jose Creek plant after hearing the conflicting 
arguments about the process. "When you're on my side of the fence, you can't 
help but be a little skeptical. I worry about anything that is 'catch-free,' " 
she said. "But I didn't realize there were so many safety features and quality 
tests. Now I support reclaimed water." 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials have conducted several tours of the reclamation plant for 
students and residents, elected officials and members of Citizens for Clean 
Water. Anyone can call for a tour, but Brophy said his engineers were waiting 
for a personal invitation. "We have not been told that our engineers can tour 
the facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Upper San Gabriel Valley water district customers have 
financed the $2 million in research and legal fees for the project through a 
special fee. Preliminary designs have already been completed and, with the 
approved enviromental impact report, final designs will be finished within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 While water district officials hailed the board's recent decision, calling it 
a historical moment for the community, they know their battle with the Miller 
Brewing Co. has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't endorse a plan we have concerns about, and we're not confident in 
the technology or the testing being conducted," Brophy said. "That's the bottom 
line." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Communities served by the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, 
which proposes to build the pipeline for treated water, are: Arcadia, Azusa, 
Baldwin Park, Bradbury, Covina, Duarte, El Monte, Glendora, City of Industry, 
Irwindale, La Puente, Monrovia, Rosemead, San Gabriel, South El Monte, South 
Pasadena, Temple City, West Covina, and parts of Bassett, Hacienda Heights and

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; MATTRESS DONATION HELPS OUT HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to make life a little easier for the area's homeless population, 
a Gardena-based mattress manufacturer is donating up to 200 mattress sets to 
shelters and social service agencies throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortho Mattress Inc. teamed up with Shelter Partnership, a homeless aid 
organization, to allocate more than $60,000 worth of new beds to needy 
facilities. The first 50 mattresses went to the House of Mercy, a transitional 
housing center slated to open in Bell next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy is, if you don't get a good night's sleep, you won't be 
successful the next day," said Howard Roeder, Ortho chief executive officer. 
"Homeless people go long stretches of time without sleep. . . . If we can help 
them get up in the morning feeling refreshed, we'll do that. It may be a small 
thing, but we want to do our part." 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old mattress manufacturer donated excess goods to shelters until a 
fiscal crisis forced it to stop the practice in 1992. After filing Chapter 11 
bankruptcy, Ortho emerged financially solvent last April and began a new fiscal 
year with a renewed commitment to giving away beds every quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Schwartz, director of Shelter Partnership, said that nearly all of the 
200 agencies she distributes goods to need bedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get a lot of mattresses," she said. "Most small agencies and 
shelters don't have money for mattress sets. They have to make tough choices 
about paying for a job counselor or more beds. . . . People are excited to get 
them. It means the clients don't have to sleep on the floor." Schwartz added 
that many clients take the beds with them when they move from transitional to 
permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said with the next donation, he will try to add a key ingredient 
missing from the giveaway program: pillows. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON TO LAUNCH NEW, IMPROVED BUS SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After almost two years of planning, the city of Carson will soon launch a new 
municipal bus system that will mean shorter waits, longer hours of service and 
more comfortable rides for commuters, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will also give residents wider access to the city, carrying people 
from one neighborhood to almost any other.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons for the improved access is the system's longer routes, 
which will provide greater access to residential and industrial neighborhoods 
not previously served. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will contract with Parking Concepts Inc. to run the $1.3 
million-a-year system, which includes 10 new buses. Parking Concepts will take 
over the routes from the current contractor during the first week in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The city raised the fare from 40 to 50 cents, with a free intersystem 
transfer. To transfer to other bus systems, the fee will be 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The old system ran along similar routes, but they were shorter and less 
related to school boundaries, officials say. Rather than using a traditional 
grid, the bus routes radiate from the center of the city like petals on a 
flower. All of the routes converge at the South Bay Pavilion at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 The old schedule was also more than two hours shorter each day. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant's research showed that 33% of the city's residents left for work 
before 7 a.m. The new system will run from 5:20 a.m. to 6:40 p.m. weekdays, and 
serve almost half of the city's major employers. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, the system will run from 10:40 a.m. to 5:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultant Ned B. Einstein said his study showed demand for bus service spread 
evenly throughout the city, so buses had to cover a broad area. Einstein also 
designed the city's original bus system 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein said he drove the city's streets day after day, timing trips from one 
area to another to figure out the most efficient routes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his concerns was schoolchildren, Einstein said. Since the Los Angeles 
Unified School District does not offer bus service for most students, Einstein 
created direct service to all elementary schools, with most buses stopping on 
the school side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses will have a video camera for safety, better suspension, fire-retardant 
seat materials and air conditioning. New Carson Bus Routes 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to provide better bus service for a wider area of the city, the 
Carson City Council approved new buses and revised routes for the city 
transportation system. Starting Sept. 1, buses will use the new routes, which 
serve all of the elementary schools and more than half of the major employers 
in the city. MARY GUTHRIE

MARY LAINE YARBER: FOR PARENTS; HELPING KIDS GET THE MOST MILEAGE FROM A 
VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School.

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're going away on vacation with your child this summer, there are some 
easy things you can do to make the experience an educational one. 
</P>
<P>
 First, tell the child what you know about the destination and your reasons for 
going. Describe the sights and activities you're looking forward to, and then 
ask what the child would like to see or do. 
</P>
<P>
 Books can help children learn even more about the geography, history, arts and 
culture of your destination. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend the "Kidding Around" series for grade-school kids. It includes 
books and other materials covering many popular cities such as Chicago, 
Atlanta, Paris and London. Each "Kidding Around" paperback is illustrated and 
costs about $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good series, the "Insight Guides," is aimed at a teen-age audience. 
Each of its approximately 100 books, all with abundant color photos, offers an 
overview of the history and culture of a city or country. The series emphasizes 
European cities, but also features other places such as Crete, Bangkok, 
Pakistan, Leningrad and Yemen. Each paperback volume costs $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 For a bigger perspective on travel and the world, try a children's atlas. The 
"Rand McNally Children's World Atlas" has excellent maps, drawings, photos and 
a thorough index. It costs $14.95 in hardcover. 
</P>
<P>
 If possible, share with your son or daughter some of the area's culture -- 
such as music, art, dress and food -- before you go. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are usually fascinated with flags, so show the city's or country's 
flag, then explain the history behind its colors or symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Spend some time going over maps with your child. Start with the big picture, 
pointing out where you live, then your destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask some questions. For example, is the place east or west of home? How far is 
it? What other cities or nations will you fly over or pass through on the way? 
Will you cross a time zone?  
</P>
<P>
 Then trace the travel route on the map or globe, explaining how long you will 
stay and what you will do at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
 During the actual trip, a travel journal is a fine learning tool. You can buy 
a blank journal in a bookstore, but I suggest making one so you can tailor it 
to your trip and your child. 
</P>
<P>
 Just buy an inexpensive spiral notebook and tie a pen to it. Then and write a 
different topic at the top of each page each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some possible topics: What's the hardest part of traveling? List some 
similarities and differences between this culture and your own. What's your 
favorite thing about this place or culture? Describe some interesting people 
you have seen or met.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides writing, ask the child to draw pictures of places or people, and to 
record his or her expenditures, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've returned home, post a map on the wall and let your child retrace 
your route. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember that children seem to quickly forget where they have been or what 
they have done. So in the next year, go over the travel journal now and then 
with your child. This will help make the learning and memories more permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite place for maps, travel books and other related learning materials 
is the California Map and Travel Center in Santa Monica or the Automobile Club 
of Southern California.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A GASTRONOMIC ADVENTURE AT WALTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing you see upon stepping inside Walter's Restaurant in Claremont 
is a knee-buckling array of homemade baked goods: fresh plum tarts, Indian naan 
bread and Swedish limpa.  
</P>
<P>
 As classical music washes over you, a friendly waitress leads you to an open 
table, past Pomona College students engrossed in Willa Cather and Pitzer 
College professors making precise red marks on term papers. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's warm, you may want to sit outside. But bear in mind that the leafy 
patio fills up quickly around lunchtime, and groups tend to dawdle around the 
tile tables, unwilling to break the spell and accept the inevitability of 
returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
 At this homey restaurant run by two Afghani emigres, Nangy and Fahima 
Ghafarshad, there are dishes to warm the cockles of almost anybody's heart, 
from great-aunt Dot to your punk cousin Slash. 
</P>
<P>
 "For your peace of mind, we would like you to know that . . . we absolutely do 
not use any type of animal lards; we bake and cut our own meats and trim as 
much fat from them as is possible," reassures the frontispiece of the 
elaborate, seven-page menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything served at Walter's is fresh picked or caught, or so the menu says, 
whether you choose a $7.25 salmon salad (fresh salmon poached in white wine on 
a bed of baby greens with dill sauce and a brioche) or the ahi tuna for $11.95 
(grilled with scallions, fresh ginger and soy sauce and served with basmati 
rice). 
</P>
<P>
 Portions are hearty here. A turkey club sandwich comes with honey-cured bacon 
and roast turkey breast, not the pressed stuff you find at some delis. The 
waitress will substitute french fries for fresh fruit, bringing a mix of plums, 
bananas, strawberries, apricots, watermelon, honeydew melon and ruby 
grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Woven like a Kabul kilim through the menu of pastas, calzones , salads, 
grilled meats and appetizers is a scattering of Afghan-inspired dishes, 
including six types of kebabs, various pilafs and vegetable dishes. The Afghan 
menu expands dramatically Thursday through Saturday, when the Ghafarshads add a 
handful of Afghani specials that change from week to week. 
</P>
<P>
 On any day, however, the gastronomically adventurous can sample from about a 
dozen Afghan dishes, including qabuli pilaf for $10.50 (a rice pilaf topped 
with carrots, raisins and chunks of lamb). Vegetarians can try badenjan borani 
for $8.95 (eggplant and tomatoes topped with yogurt sauce). There are also 
Afghan appetizers such as bulani for $5.50 -- meat, potatoes and onions stuffed 
in a thin dough and deep-fried, served with yogurt sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the traditional omelets found at most breakfast joints, 
Walter's bows to its heritage with a feta cheese omelet ($6.75) that includes 
eggplant or lamb and is topped with yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nangy and Fahima Ghafarshad and their extended family who run Walter's have 
the restaurant business down pretty smooth after 21 years at one location, 
drawing patrons from as far as Pasadena and Orange County. A 25-year-old 
daughter who graduated from Pitzer is the night manager. Their son, 18, also 
helps out. So do four in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a far cry from Nangy Ghafarshad's childhood in Kabul, where he dreamed of 
flying fast planes, not roasting whole chickens on a spit. Nangy Ghafarshad 
arrived in the United States in 1960 and went to pilot training school, then 
flew in the U.S. Air Force as an exchange officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he did a stint as a corporate pilot, then moved to La Verne, where he 
taught flying at Brackett Airport in 1971. He quickly decided there was more 
money in restaurants than airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple struggled for the first two years, until Nangy Ghafarshad sent his 
wife to France, where she enrolled in a culinary institute to hone her cooking 
and pastry-making skills. Today, Fahima Ghafarshad makes all the desserts and 
Nangy makes the breads. 
</P>
<P>
 From an original 50, Walter's now seats 300. The patio, added in 1978, was an 
immediate success in the long months of summer. There is no shortage of 
business, what with the six Claremont Colleges nearby and lots of official 
functions that need to be catered. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how things change: When they first opened Walter's in 1973, the 
Ghafarshads had to coax clients into trying Afghan food, which was considered 
odd and exotic for the Pomona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 To whet people's appetite, "We used to give it away for free," Nangy 
Ghafarshad recalls. "One customer came in and he asked, 'What kind of hound are 
you cooking tonight?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But people open up to you after a while. And after they taste the food they 
really like it."

SPORTS; GETTING HIS KICKS INDOORS; FORMER GAREY HIGH, CAL STATE L.A. STANDOUT 
SANCHEZ EARNS JOB WITH SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Juan Carlos Sanchez couldn't have asked for a better summer job. Or a career. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now the 22-year-old former Cal State Los Angeles and Garey High 
athlete is content to spend the summer as a member of the Anaheim Splash. 
Sanchez was chosen from nearly 100 players from a two-day open tryout for the 
Continental Indoor Soccer League team in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many people. I really didn't take it all that serious," Sanchez 
said. "I went out there to see what would happen. I really didn't go out there 
and say, 'I'm going to make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who graduated from Cal State L.A. with a degree in physical education 
in June, had planned to try to play in Mexico this summer. His father, Aurelio, 
played professional soccer there for three years before returning to school in 
September to pursue a career as a physical therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Sanchez's plans have been put on hold, at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to give it my last shot at professional soccer this summer, but 
this opportunity popped up," said Sanchez, who has renewed aspirations of 
playing in the American Professional Soccer League in the fall. "My goal is to 
play outdoors. But if there is a future here for me indoors, I'm willing to 
take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona resident seized his opportunity in training camp. He had five goals 
and four assists in three preseason games, prompting the Splash to offer the 
5-foot-9, 161-pound forward a two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the majority of the players we wanted, but we had an open invitation 
to see what kind of talent was out there in case we did find a diamond in the 
rough. And we found Juan," Splash Coach George Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, though, was far from an unknown commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, he was named to the NCAA Division II Western Region team and earned 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. first-team honors for the second year 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Garey High in 1989, Sanchez was the Hacienda League most 
valuable player and selected to the All-Southern Section 3-A Division first 
team after helping the Vikings go undefeated in league play for the fourth 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 The CISL, formed in 1993, is the largest professional soccer league in the 
United States with 14 franchises. The Splash was formerly the L.A. United, one 
of the league's seven charter teams. Ogden Facility Management, the company 
which operates the Anaheim Arena, purchased the L.A. United from Laker owner 
Jerry Buss and moved the team to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 CISL games are played on a field similar to the dimensions of an ice hockey 
rink, 200 feet long and 85 feet wide, and surrounded by dasher boards topped 
with plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike outdoor soccer with 11 players on a side, teams are allowed five field 
players and a goalkeeper. The game consists of four 15-minute quarters and the 
season runs from June through September with 28 regular-season matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's faster than playing outdoors and you have less space, so everything 
seems 100 miles per hour," Sanchez said. "Here, everything you have to do at 
full speed. We have two-minute shifts and you're in and you're out. And I 
guarantee that's all it takes to get you tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez has been used as the third forward behind eight-year veteran Dale 
Ervine and Rod Castro, a player with seven years of experience. Sanchez filled 
in for Castro last week to help the Splash to a 6-3 victory over the Washington 
Warhogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a knack for scoring goals, and you can always use a goal scorer," 
Fernandez said. "We have two of the top target guys in the league, so it's kind 
of hard to find him some time. But there's no doubt we have a big future for 
him and he's in our plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Sanchez will be in the lineup when the Splash (11-5) play the 
San Diego Sockers (11-3) in a battle for the Western Division lead at the 
Anaheim Arena Saturday night won't be determined until game time. It's a 
scenario that has become a familiar and agonizing routine for Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating and demoralizing," Sanchez said. "That's the situation I'm 
in. Everybody here is fighting for a position and anybody on this team is a 
potential starter. But play or not play, I'm getting paid and the money I'm 
making is just like a summer job."

 BEST VEST: At a Rams game a few years ago, Shirl Rapport of Anaheim noticed 
the quarterback always seemed to bounce back from a defensive pounding. Her 
husband, Bory, suggested she see what the team could do for her. Turns out team 
equipment manager Don Hewitt had just the thing for Rapport: An old Joe Namath 
flak vest. . . . Rapport suffers from epilepsy, and the flak vest protects her 
during seizures. Rapport, 59, tells her poignant story of the struggles she's 
faced with epilepsy in a "My Turn" column in Newsweek magazine this week.

 TREE SHOPPING? When are trees just in the way? When they keep shoppers from 
seeing your stores, say some business owners along Harbor Boulevard in 
Fullerton. . . . City officials are studying their request to cut some of them 
down. But the Tree Society of Orange County is raising strenuous objections. It 
warns in its latest newsletter that "a treeless street would turn many off to 
downtown shopping." No decision has been made.

 SENIOR PUSH-UPS: He might not be the TV fitness king he was in the 1980s, but 
Richard Simmons is still popular with senior citizens. Simmons has geared his 
exercise programs toward keeping the elderly fit. . . . And more than 1,000 of 
them are expected to exercise with him Friday at the Sequoia Athletic 
Conference Center in Buena Park. Simmons is the featured guest at Secure 
Horizons' "Wellness Festival." Says a spokeswoman: "He's an inspiration to 
seniors; they love him."

 KEEPING THE FEVER: With the World Cup gone, South Coast Plaza has taken down 
its 100 red and blue soccer banners -- one large enough to cover half a dozen 
elephants. It's donated them to the American Youth Soccer Organization, which 
will distribute them to leagues throughout Orange County. . . . "We're 
overjoyed," says AYSO spokesperson Lolly Keyes. "This prolongs the life of 
something that was very important to youth soccer: the World Cup."

 SAYONARA: The predicted attrition continues at 20th Century Insurance in the 
wake of its decision to stop offering new earthquake policies. . . . About 
3,000 policyholders failed to renew in June, double the usual rate, said Rick 
Dinon, senior vice president of the Woodland Hills insurer. The company made

 BENCH PRESS: The bus stops here in the battle against AIDS. Starting Aug. 5,

left fielder Garret Anderson, who attended Kennedy High in Granada Hills. The

 DEMOCRATIC DEAVER: The Democrats liked to portray him as media manipulator 
when he managed President Ronald Reagan's public image, but the Clinton White 
House now is looking for someone in the mold of Michael K. Deaver to bring 
order to its chaotic and sometimes-contradictory communications. In a summer of 
mixed signals on foreign policy and sometimes even the Clinton health strategy, 
Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta has made it a top priority to hire or assign 
someone to make sure that the presidential message is delivered in the proper 
setting and consistency. "Somebody did this for Ronald Reagan, for Richard 
Nixon, for John Kennedy," said one adviser. "But nobody's been paying attention 
to it" for this Administration. The catch, of course, is that instituting 
Central Message Control entails some loss of autonomy for top-ranked aides, 
Cabinet officials -- and for a President with a legendary fondness for 
free-form think-aloud sessions.

 SWITCHING TO COLOR: The distinguished Alabama senator felt a tickle in his 
nose and reached to his pocket for a handkerchief. Everyone at the lunch table 
that day last week, with the exception of the distinguished Alabama senator, 
noted that the handkerchief wasn't a handkerchief at all, but a pair of white 
panties. He blew his nose and returned them to his pocket. A short time later, 
Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin pulled them out once more -- only this time he 
recognized the garment. Just one thing could make matters worse. The lunch 
table was filled with reporters. By the next morning, all of Washington was 
atwitter. That afternoon, the jowly senator issued a statement headed: 
"Handkerchief." Under it were two sentences: "I mistakenly picked up a pair of 
my wife's white panties and put them in my pocket while I was rushing out the 
door to go to work. Rather than take a chance on being embarrassed again, I'm 
going to start buying colored handkerchiefs." He was seen the next day sporting 
a maroon one.

 SCALLOP GALLOP: The Clinton Administration has often been accused of muddy 
policy on international issues, but on one question the State Department is as 
clear as a mountain stream: mollusks. State Department spokesman Michael D. 
McCurry was asked Wednesday about Canada's seizure of an American fishing 
vessel that was taking Icelandic scallops off Newfoundland. "The issue arises, 
is this a sedentary species or a mobile species?" McCurry said solemnly. "And 
being that these are mollusks, we sort of believe that, as you probably know, 
mollusks can swim. They swim by rapidly clapping their fluted bivalve shells 
together as they propel themselves through the water. And for that reason, they 
are not, in our view, sedentary." The point, he added, is that since scallops 
swim, they are fair game for U.S. fishermen. Canada, of course, says that 
scallops don't swim -- at least, not enough to make them fair game under the 
Law of the Sea.

 SAY WHAT YOU MEAN: Colorful Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) gave his

Congress, according to the senator, is "how to get these creeps, these slobs, 
off the street."

EMBASSY WARNS OF THREAT TO AMERICANS IN ALGERIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Department warned Wednesday that an attack or kidnaping of Americans 
in Algeria may be planned and urged U.S. citizens there to exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
 A security advisory issued by the U.S. Embassy in Algiers said, "We are not in 
a position to determine the veracity of the information but believe that all 
such threats should be taken seriously. . . . We also remind all Americans that 
the State Department's travel warning for Algeria recommends that Americans 
whose circumstances do not afford them effective protection depart Algeria." 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 people, mainly security forces personnel and militants, have been 
killed in Algeria's civil strife -- triggered by the scrapping of a general 
election in January, 1992, which the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was 
poised to win.

HELEN CORDERO; PUEBLO POTTER CREATED STORYTELLER FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen Cordero, 79, a Cochiti Pueblo potter who created the well-known ceramic 
storyteller figure -- an open-mouthed statue with small ceramic children 
perched on its body. Miss Cordero's figures spawned a virtual industry among 
Pueblo Indian potters, who quickly adopted the storyteller idea and developed 
variations.The figures were inspired by Miss Cordero's memories of her 
grandfather, Santiago Quintana, who was respected for his storytelling 
abilities. Her works are displayed at the Smithsonian Institution, the Heard 
Museum in Phoenix, the Institute of American Indian Arts Museum and all of the 
museums in the Museum of New Mexico system. She received the New Mexico 
Governor's Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts in 1982 and a 
National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1986.

 W. Dorr Legg, 89, founder of ONE, Inc., among the oldest gay and lesbian 
support organizations in the country. The group, with headquarters on Country 
Club Drive in West Los Angeles, offers therapy, counseling and referrals to the 
gay community.It also provides educational and job placement programs, one of a 
very few umbrella organizations for gays when it first started in the early 
1950s. When Legg and others wanted to publicize ONE by starting a national

refused to handle it because of content. Legg was a landscape architect and 
musician who had never been politically active until he founded ONE. In Los

CLIPPERS CALL ON FITCH TO REBUILD; PRO BASKETBALL: VETERAN COACH WITH 
REPUTATION OF HELPING MEDIOCRE CLUBS WILL RETURN TO NBA AFTER TWO-YEAR BREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Fitch, the fifth-winningest coach in NBA history, will be introduced as 
coach of the Clippers at a news conference today, a source close to Fitch said 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who guided the Boston Celtics to the 1981 NBA title and led the Houston 
Rockets to the 1986 NBA finals, signed a multiyear contract with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch did not return several phone calls to his Houston-area home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Safety, Clipper spokesman, declined to confirm or deny the report, saying, 
"Our objective remains the same; we will hire an experienced, well-suited and 
highly motivated coach." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking 61 days to replace Larry Brown with Bob Weiss last year, the 
Clippers took 73 days to replace Weiss, who was fired on May 16. Weiss, who had 
two years left on a three-year deal that reportedly paid him $600,000 per year, 
is no longer being paid but the dispute is expected to be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were published reports that former Laker coach Randy Pfund was 
offered the job and turned it down, the Clippers maintain negotiations with 
Pfund were never serious.  
</P>
<P>
 "I examined it carefully and at this point I feel it's not quite the right 
situation for me," Pfund said. "I had some interesting, good talks with 
(Clipper General Manager) Elgin (Baylor). He's very aware of the situation 
they're in and the challenges ahead. The discussions I had with him and how I 
felt about him was probably the main reason we had as many discussions as we 
did. He's on top of the situation, but when it came down to it, I just didn't 
feel it was right for me." 
</P>
<P>
 There also were reports the Clippers were interested in George Karl, coach of 
the Seattle SuperSonics, who reportedly considered leaving after SuperSonic 
President Bob Whitsitt was forced out. However, Karl recently signed a new 
contract in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reports said the Clippers tried to lure Brown, who guided the team to 
playoff berths in 1992 and 1993, away from the Indiana Pacers. But Brown, who 
led the Pacers to the NBA Eastern Conference finals, said the Clippers never 
contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers also denied a CBS report that they offered New York Knick Coach 
Pat Riley a lucrative deal that would have included part ownership of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who hasn't coached since he was fired by the New Jersey Nets at the 
conclusion of the 1992 season, faces a big challenge in rebuilding the 
Clippers, who finished with the NBA's seventh worst record (27-55) last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch must rejuvenate a team that lost All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins, who 
signed a three-year contract with the Boston Celtics last week. The Clippers, 
who had decided Wilkins was expendable, could also lose guard Ron Harper, who 
became an unrestricted free agent July 1. However, Harper's agent, Mark 
Termini, said Harper hasn't ruled out the possibility of signing with the 
Clippers, who also are seeking a big-name free agent such as forward Horace 
Grant of the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who has been named the NBA coach of the year twice, has experience in 
rebuilding mediocre teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always interested in a challenge. . . . That's how I've made my living 
(rebuilding teams)," Fitch said recently. "It's hard work. You've got to have a 
plan and you've got to follow it. If they do that nothing's impossible. I've 
seen too many teams rise from the ashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hired as Cleveland's first coach in 1970, Fitch led the Cavaliers to a 
division title and a playoff berth in his sixth season. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston had won a total of 61 games in the previous two seasons before hiring 
Fitch to coach rookie forward Larry Bird and the Celtics in 1979. Fitch guided 
them to a 61-21 record in his first season and they went 62-20 and won the NBA 
title in 1981. They won 63 games in Fitch's final season in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets won only 14 games before hiring Fitch in 1983. However 
they reached the NBA finals in Fitch's third season. In 1992, Fitch led the New 
Jersey Nets to their first playoff appearance in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who said that he rejected overtures from several NBA teams in the last 
two years, has spent much of his time playing golf, but he said he was eager to 
coach again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had other (teams) talk to me and up until now I said I wasn't going 
back," Fitch said last week. "But I'm done playing golf. You can only do that 
so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch's work ethic and his experience impressed Clipper executives, who sought 
to hire a motivated coach who could teach young players such as rookie forwards 
Lamond Murray and Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, 60, who has coached more games (1,722) than any NBA coach, has compiled 
a career record of 845-877 in 21 years. He becomes the ninth coach the Clippers 
have had since moving to Los Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear if Clipper assistants Johnny Davis and Dave Wohl, hired by former 
coach Bob Weiss, will be retained by Bill Fitch. The Portland Trail Blazers 
have reportedly offered Davis a job as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Laker coach Randy Pfund said he received several feelers from NBA 
teams.

DISORDER CONSUMED HER LIFE; GYMNASTICS: FORMER ELITE ATHLETE CHRISTY HENRICH 
GAVE IN TO FATAL DISEASE THAT DESTROYED HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During one hospital stay, therapists confined Christy Henrich to a wheelchair 
to prevent her from compulsive exercise -- she would run everywhere instead of 
walk because she wanted to burn calories. Another time, doctors confiscated 
laxatives found hidden in the lining of her suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, no one could save Henrich because the former member of the 
U.S. national gymnastics team could not save herself. For years, Henrich 
suffered from anorexia nervosa and bulimia, eating disorders in which victims 
are obsessed with losing weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich, 22, died Tuesday afternoon at Research Medical Center in Kansas City, 
Mo., after suffering a multiple organ system failure, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 She weighed less than 60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after Henrich's death, the gymnastics community once again was trying to 
come to grips with a disease some think has become an epidemic in a sport where 
the average size of an elite female competitor is 4 feet 10 and 85 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympian Cathy Rigby has spoken out about the problem for the last 12 years. 
Rigby was hospitalized twice during her battle with eating disorders while she 
was a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so frustrating is, no matter how much you talk about it, you see it 
still happening and you want it to be fixed . . . and it's not," Rigby said. 
"You don't want to believe something like that can still happen with all the 
knowledge that we have and with all the awareness that is out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich's family in Independence, Mo., did not answer phone calls Wednesday, 
but others who knew Henrich said they also were searching for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember her as being very fun-loving," said Susan Polakoff-Shaw, former 
public relations director for USA Gymnastics. "She was intense in competition, 
but as soon as she came off, she was the one joking around with the other 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich, who began gymnastics at 4, missed making the 1988 Olympic team by 
0.0188 points. She placed fourth on the uneven parallel bars in the 1989 World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich, 4-10 and 93 pounds at the peak of her career, became obsessed with 
her weight after a judge at a 1988 international competition in Hungary said 
she was too fat. 
</P>
<P>
 She dragged her coach, Al Fong, into her room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I fat?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong tried to persuade Henrich she had misunderstood the judge, but the young 
athlete wouldn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are fine," Fong told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich was seemingly never the same after that incident, said those who knew 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think from that point on she started her bingeing," Fong said, referring to 
the tendency consume mass quantities of food, only to purge it from the body 
immediately after eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong also has been blamed for fostering Henrich's eating disorder by 
reportedly telling her to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would call me the 'Pillsbury Dough Boy,' " Henrich told a reporter in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong denies making such statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong began to notice something wrong after the 1989 World Championships in 
Stuttgart, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich had difficulty recovering from a stress-fracture and her strength 
decreased. She could not complete routines that once were easy for her. She 
began to show signs of frustration, crying almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would go into a tantrum over her disgust at not being able to do 
something," Fong said. "(This was) totally uncharacteristic of Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong finally confronted Henrich and she acknowledged her problem. Fong called 
USA Gymnastics, which helped Henrich find counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, Henrich had become addicted to losing weight. According to Fong, 
Henrich refused to attend the counseling meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong realized Henrich's career was nearing an end at a 1990 exhibition in 
Oregon of the U.S. and Soviet national teams. Henrich could complete only about 
half the maneuvers in her uneven bar routine. Fong pulled her from a 
competition in Los Angeles the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich made several attempts to resume training, but it was futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Christy, we can't do this,' " Fong said. 'You are not eating. I love 
you, but I can't let you train.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So, Fong kicked her out of the gym. A week later, Henrich returned to say she 
was retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The next three years Henrich was in and out of hospitals. Her medical bills 
reportedly grew to more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The gymnastics community rallied to Henrich's support in August 1993, 
organizing a luncheon at the Kansas City Club that raised nearly $35,000 to 
help defray the cost of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most wonderful outpouring of affection for Christy that I could 
ever imagine," said Carol Zyanka of Lee's Summit, Mo., one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Dr. Gail Vaughn, a licensed professional counselor from 
Liberty, Mo., saw Henrich on a TV news show. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrich was talking about battling her disease and said, "I really want to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaughn didn't believe her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell that she really didn't," Vaughn said. "I don't even know that 
she knew she was lying, but I could tell that she had never made a strong, core 
choice to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn called and offered her services free to Henrich. They worked together 
for four months before Henrich quit and turned to alternative treatments, such 
as hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vaughn, Henrich was a typical eating disorder victim. Refusal to 
eat often is a form of protest, she said. In Henrich's case, Vaughn believes 
the protest was over a lost childhood although no one an really say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though she chose gymnastics, this girl worked all the time when other 
kids were playing," Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Henrich worked more than most -- "Her work ethic was legendary," Fong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Henrich suffered a broken vertebra during a dismount off the balance 
beam but returned only three months later to place second in the all-around at 
the U.S. Championships at Minneapolis, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't going to stop me," Henrich told reporters at the time. "You're 
going to get hurt no matter what you do in life." 
</P>
<P>
 But her desire to achieve in gymnastics -- her lifelong goal was making the 
Olympic team -- was double-edged. She fought too hard to attain a body size 
that would help her succeed in the sport. Ultimately, it was an impossible 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anorexia is also the statement of, 'I don't want to grow up,' " Vaughn said. 
"She looked like a 10-12 year-old girl even though she was 21 when I worked 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one reason Henrich's death shocked those around her was because she had 
appeared to be recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We threw the scale away," Henrich told a reporter in December. "It's not an 
issue anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was for Henrich because the scale was everything.

THE DAYS OF GLORY; EVEN 10 YEARS LATER, MANY SEE 1984 OLYMPICS AS A CROWNING 
MOMENT IN LOS ANGELES HISTORY THAT GAVE SPORTS A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago today, a spirit of joyous expectancy pervaded Los Angeles as the 
1984 Olympic Games got under way. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time the torch relay had arrived the week before, it was evident 
enthusiasm about the Games was high and that many of the fears so widely 
expressed during seven years of preparation were fading. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in charge of that effort, Peter Ueberroth, said Wednesday that he 
felt, on balance, relaxed 10 years ago this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something could go wrong, but it was working," he said. "The thousands of 
volunteers were in uniform. They did show up on time. They did care. They were 
patriotic. And the citizens of Los Angeles were complying with our traffic 
plan. It was working, and the doomsayers were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out in the next 16 days, the events were tremendously successful. 
The crowds were an Olympic record. Despite the Soviet boycott, 140 countries 
sent teams, another record. There was no terrorism and little overcrowding. Los 
Angeles proved it could do it right. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the opening ceremony at the Coliseum, Times columnist Jim 
Murray sounded a note of triumph: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympic Games they said would never take place are taking place. The 
Olympics they said would drown in politics, strangle in traffic, are floating 
and breathing. The Olympics they said would tap the taxpayers out of billions 
are paying their way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, with ever more cities applying to hold the Games, both winter 
and summer, the Olympic leaders here, and the president of the International 
Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, express the conviction that Los 
Angeles put the Olympic movement back on the right path. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaranch said the financial success in Los Angeles -- an unexpected surplus 
of more than $220 million -- cleared up worldwide doubts created by the 
$1-billion debacle of the 1976 Montreal Olympics that the Games could be 
efficiently staged. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Olympic movement has not had to face the problem that arose in 
1978 when Los Angeles was the only bidder for the 1984 Summer Olympics and the 
IOC, after months of fractious contract negotiations, eventually had to award 
the Games on the bidders' terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland's Lord Killanin, then president of the IOC, was so humiliated that he 
could never bring himself to acknowledge that the terms left the city 
government free of liability if the event ran into debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no debts. The chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Games, 
the late Paul Ziffren, had remarked one morning to incredulous Southland media 
that the 1984 Olympics would net $100 million. It was a matter of pride with 
him for many years thereafter that he understated the eventual figure by more 
than half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics, with all their glamour, international travel, A-list parties and 
athletic heroes, have long drawn local politicians like moths to a flame. Some 
have been burned when things did not go well. 
</P>
<P>
 Television producer David Wolper, who directed the opening ceremony 10 years 
ago today, once said: "The City Council members like this so much, because it 
gives them something to talk about besides how to collect the garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 But for then-Mayor Tom Bradley, the fascination clearly went beyond that, and 
it has continued. He is still basking in the glow of the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 Olympics "was the event which is the No. 1 highlight of my life," 
Bradley said Wednesday. "The fact that Los Angeles received worldwide 
attention, and those Games were so remembered around the world, is a source of 
great pride and satisfaction to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed that the Games could be put on in a different fashion and not 
bankrupt the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some one-time skeptics mellowed their views. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who insisted on tough negotiations with the 
IOC to ensure that the Los Angeles Olympics would be privately -- not publicly 
-- financed, said Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Games marked, I think, the apex of the city's pride in itself, and they 
marked a high point (in) the world's view of Los Angeles. Both for me 
personally and for the public at large, when we look back at the Olympics, it 
was one of the great moments in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as deep as our pride runs, we have to recognize that sports events have a 
superficiality about them. This city, and the 1984 Winter Olympic city, 
Sarajevo, have had nothing but problems since. With all the positive aspect of 
the Olympics, with all they represent for the world, the world still has a lot 
of problems. The Games put Los Angeles at its most positive point on the world 
stage, but they were still only Games." 
</P>
<P>
 In a business sense, pride in the 1984 Olympics comes easily. The Games were 
not only extremely profitable, they also set certain specific standards that 
pointed a successful way for future Olympic organizing committees: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The $225-million American television contract the organizing committee 
signed with ABC was three times higher than any network had paid for the 
Olympics before and helped to generate even higher prices thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In corporate sponsorships, Ueberroth and his top deputy, Harry Usher, did 
far better than any previous organizing committee. Since they proved it could 
be done, corporate sponsorships for many events have risen in value, and the 
IOC took a cue, establishing its own marketing program. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ueberroth and ticket boss Ed Smith led the way toward spectacular listed 
ticket prices for big events. The $200 top ticket price they decided to charge 
for the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony were at first regarded by 
some as outlandish. However, they not only found plenty of takers but showed it 
would not merely be scalpers that made a fortune from marketing events. 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth was a hard-nosed businessman, and his methods had their critics, but 
for better or worse, the rest of the sports world has followed the commercial 
examples he set. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1984 Games will also be remembered, of course, for Mary Decker Slaney's 
spill, the victories of Carl Lewis, Sebastian Coe, Mary Lou Retton, Daley 
Thompson and Valerie Brisco-Hooks, and the gallant efforts of so many other 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 But another notable aspect of the Games was they marked the last of the great 
boycotts that disrupted three consecutive Olympics. Much of the stories about 
Montreal, Moscow (in 1980) and Los Angeles revolved around those boycotts, and 
the general politicization of the Games. If one includes the murder of Israeli 
athletes by terrorists during the 1972 Munich Games, disastrous politicization 
indeed extended through four Olympiads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Summer Games since Los Angeles, at Seoul and Barcelona, passed without 
boycotts or terrorism, and there have been few fears expressed about these 
possibilities in Atlanta two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth said Wednesday: "I think the Olympics have passed through their low 
point. I believe nearly everyone now realizes that what we were saying was 
true, that boycotts only served to hurt athletes and that all boycotts and 
terrorism did was to isolate nations." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he still remembers with gratitude the decisions of China and Romania 
to come to Los Angeles in defiance of the Soviet boycott. "This played a very 
little part in the wall eventually coming down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And 10 years is a long time, Ueberroth noted. Ten years ago, he said, Manfred 
Ewald, East Germany's sports minister, was one of the most influential persons 
in world sports. Now, Ewald's country is gone and he is unemployed, trying to 
sell his awards and trophies to support himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles does an extensive job of commemorating negatives and almost a 
non-job or non-effort in commemorating the positives," Uebberroth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can be sure there will be stories commemorating X years after the riots, 
the earthquakes. But I would say that my overwhelming thought today is the 
pride in the effort by all the people involved in the 1984 Games and pride in 
the quality of our community."

JIM MURRAY: THEY SIGN ON A LINE THAT BLURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Someday, someone is going to have to explain to me why an oral commitment in 
the film industry (see Kim Basinger for details) is more binding than a signed 
contract in the sports industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can you take to court, and get compensation for, a head nod in one 
business while the other gets a signed and sealed and notarized document thrown 
out as not binding? One racket says: "Wait a minute! You shook your head yes! I 
saw you!" While the other winks and says: "Oh, well, boys will be boys! He 
didn't know what he was signing. He didn't mean it." 
</P>
<P>
 I give you the case of the New York Rangers' former hockey coach, Mike Keenan. 
As I get it, Mike had a perfectly valid document, signed and sworn, in which he 
agreed to coach the Rangers for five years. Then, he won the Stanley Cup -- or 
rather they won the Stanley Cup -- for the first time in 54 years, and suddenly 
Keenan felt he was underpaid and underappreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 To the best of everyone's knowledge, he began opening up negotiations with 
other clubs. He took the position that his bonus check for winning was 24 hours 
late and thus abrogated his contract. His bonus check, by the way, was for 
$608,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan wanted out. Keenan always wants out. He makes Larry Brown look like a 
stay-at-home. Keenan had wanted out at Philadelphia and Chicago before coming 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 New York had lent him $975,000 to buy a home there. After all, he had signed a 
five-year contract. He would be there till the year 2000 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if you or I sign a five-year contract, we expect to honor it, right? 
</P>
<P>
 We're in the wrong business. They get out of contracts all the time in the 
sports business. Maybe you're too young to remember the basketball wars between 
the ABA (American Basketball Assn.) and the NBA (National Basketball Assn.). A 
federal judge in one state, Virginia, given the same set of facts, would rule 
oppositely from a federal judge in Washington, if the two jurisdictions were 
fighting for the same jump-shooter. It was laughable. It ate away at your 
respect for the legal profession -- if you had any to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers apparently have very little faith in the law. They're not going to 
contest Keenan's departure. Probably, they're afraid the courts will award him 
the Stanley Cup to take with him. Ownership rights are not politically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike baseball, hockey has a commissioner. His name is Gary Bettman, and he 
did what commissioners always do: equivocated. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, he announced that there was "no room in this league for 
personnel under contract to make unilateral determinations of their contractual 
status." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he showed there was lots of room for it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Bettman fined Keenan $100,000 and suspended him for 60 days. Because 
the suspension takes effect immediately, it is meaningless. It will be over on 
Sept. 24, well in time for the opening of hockey season. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Bettman fined the St. Louis Blues $250,000 for tampering, i.e. talking 
to Keenan while he was still the property of a competitor. Since they had doled 
out $5 million to hire Keenan, what's another couple hundred grand? Chump 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Bettman fined Detroit's Red Wings $25,000. For nothing. Oh, they 
solicited Keenan but he ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Bettman ruled Keenan also had to return $400,000 of his bonus money from 
the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here the deal got complicated. Presumably as compensation for the fact 
they got snookered in the Keenan transaction, the Rangers were permitted to 
trade for a promising center from St. Louis, Petr Nedved. They gave up two 
journeymen skaters, Esa Tikkanen and Doug Lidster, for him. On the surface, it 
was a trade. Under the surface, it was a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the commissioner fined the Rangers $25,000. You heard me. The Rangers! 
For going to court in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. Tell me hockey doesn't belong in Alice's Wonderland? The sentence 
first, the verdict afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Keenan gets to play the Mad Hatter. First, he hails the Bettman decision 
as Solomonesque. "Mr. Bettman did a fabulous job bringing the parties 
together," he announces. "I have a great deal of respect for him and what he 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, a radio station and several newspapers report the whole thing 
has been a conspiracy between Keenan and the Rangers. The late payment was a 
rigged-up story to pull the wool over the eyes of the hockey establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me Lewis Carroll wouldn't have loved Mike Keenan. Maybe that's why 
contracts are never enforced in sports. They don't want us to know what nut 
cases we're dealing with. Sports don't need commissioners. They need keepers.

NEGOTIATIONS DISSOLVE INTO ANGER; BASEBALL: OWNERS REJECT PLAYERS' OFFER. 
STRIKE DATE EXPECTED TO BE SET TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A three-hour meeting between negotiators for baseball's owners and players 
dissolved into hotter rhetoric and harder stances Wednesday, and the union is 
almost certain to set a strike deadline today when Executive Director Don Fehr 
confers with the 28 player representatives by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has changed our opinion that the owners are on a timetable, and there 
is nothing we can do or say that will make a difference," Fehr said after the 
owners rejected a union proposal that would basically maintain the current 
compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The union proposal would increase the minimum salary from $109,000 to more 
than $175,000, lower the eligibility requirement for arbitration from three 
years of major league service to two (some two-year players already qualify) 
and increase termination pay, pensions and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said the four-year proposal 
would cost the clubs $700 million more than they are now paying and would 
exacerbate the small-market problems. He said the 58% of revenue now going to 
salaries would increase to 74% by 1998. Ravitch distributed a response to the 
union proposal at a New York news conference and headlined it: "Union Wants 
Just One More Thing: More." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr questioned those calculations and wondered how the owners could have 
arrived at them so quickly "when it took them 18 months to make their own 
proposal and it generally takes them several weeks or months to come up with 
answers for even our most basic questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said the calculations were based on the same percentages that the 
union used in successfully arguing its collusion case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made it abundantly clear to the union that the world is different, the 
game has changed, but the union has refused to respond to the problems," 
Ravitch said. "The fact is, we're quite far apart, and I'm disappointed that 
the players have failed to recognize the clubs' need to control costs and to be 
able to predict costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, fearing that the owners will ultimately declare an impasse and 
unilaterally implement the salary-cap proposal that the union rejected on July 
18, is expected to set a mid-August strike date today, threatening the owners' 
postseason revenue, which Ravitch estimated Wednesday at $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fighting for dollars," Ravitch said of the difference in the two 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr called that a moral victory. "The owners have been talking about 
competitive balance and a lot of other things, but this has always been about 
money," Fehr said. "Now Ravitch has admitted it. I mean, it's been clear from 
the start that the only way the clubs will help themselves is if the players 
pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr referred to the fact that the clubs have agreed to broader revenue 
sharing among themselves, but only if the players approve a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has received almost unanimous strike authorization. Only six players 
voted against a strike.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; HOUGH KNUCKLED UNDER BY HIP INJURY

 Charlie Hough, baseball's oldest player at 46, was put on the disabled list 
Wednesday, and he doesn't expect to pitch again. He has been bothered by a hip 
ailment that will require replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't feel there's any chance for him to pitch any more with his hip the 
way it is," Marlin General Manager Dave Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a shrug, a smile and a cigarette, Hough accepted the end of a major 
league career that began in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty simple with stuff like that," he said. "When I came out of high 
school, I didn't picture myself throwing a baseball for 28 years. It's been 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Hough started and won the first game in Marlin history last year, and he was 
the team's opening-day starter again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Hough became the second-oldest player to throw a shutout, beating 
St. Louis, 7-0. That was his last victory. In seven starts since, Hough had an 
ERA of 9.47. 
</P>
<P>
 Hough lost his final five decisions to wind up with a career record of 
216-216. This year he was 5-9 with an ERA of 5.15.

 Cincinnati Red reliever Rob Dibble, in his first appearance since shoulder 
surgery in April, started for triple-A Indianapolis against New Orleans and 
allowed one run in one inning. Dibble threw 16 pitches, including a wild pitch 
that allowed a run to score, and had one strikeout and one walk.

KRUK'S MEDICAL PROBLEM 'MINOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An upbeat John Kruk left a Philadelphia hospital Wednesday night after 
learning lumps on his body are apparently not connected to his testicular 
cancer earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't cancer," the Philadelphia Phillie star said as he walked between 
buildings at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carl Mansfield, chairman of the department of radiation oncology and 
nuclear medicine, said there was a "99 to 100% likelihood that John does not 
have a recurrence of cancer." Mansfield said Kruk apparently has a "minor 
medical problem unrelated to his cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Kruk said he would have doctors examine two lumps he discovered 
recently on his body. He left the game against Florida in the seventh inning 
with what the Phillies called abdominal pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A specialist on testicular tumors, Dr. Ray Stutzman of Johns Hopkins Hospital 
said there was a "very, very slim chance" they would be related to Kruk's 
recent seminoma.

 "I think his personality suits the role well," Lachemann said."He's the type

 The Seattle Mariners said they expect a final decision today on their bid to 
play their Aug. 2-10 home stand against the Angels, Kansas City and Texas at 
Tacoma's Cheney Stadium because the Kingdome is closed while loose ceiling

POSTCARD: ST. PETERSBURG; BELLS SOUND REBIRTH OF LUTHERAN CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a walk down this city's million-ruble mile, Nevsky Prospect, one cannot 
help but notice, just behind the Koff beer garden, a magnificent early 
19th-Century Lutheran church with two bell towers and a cross that dates back 
to, oh, about June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 From this church once emanated some of the world's most inspiring music, 
played on a famous organ that since has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound one hears now is of jackhammers. 
</P>
<P>
 A look inside reveals an Olympic-sized swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 One also sees a lot of dust as construction workers labor to remove the pool 
and convert the main floor back into a chapel.  
</P>
<P>
 This is being financed by the World Council of Lutheran Churches, which, in 
its pleas for donations, calls the project the "Reconstruction of the Swimming 
Pool Church." The original name, St. Peter's Lutheran, might have been more 
reverent, but let's face it, it does not get your attention like Swimming Pool 
Church.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the church's youth pastor, Markus Eisele, German laborers who 
were recruited to help Peter the Great build this city in 1704 established the 
first Lutheran church in St. Petersburg. St. Peter's was built in 1838 and at 
one time had 17,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 But religion was discouraged after the 1917 revolution. In 1938, St. Peter's 
pastor, the last of the Lutheran faith in St. Petersburg, was deported, and his 
church became a warehouse for fruits and vegetables from nearby collective 
farms. Twelve years later, it was converted into a swimming pool that, over the 
next three decades, served as the site for numerous national and international 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool, however, eventually fell into disrepair, and in 1991, with the fall 
of Communism, the building was returned to the Lutherans. Eisele, of 
Heidelberg, Germany, said they found a few faithful in the city as the religion 
was surreptitiously kept alive by their parents and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 They also found that the four bells in the towers sounded as joyful as ever, 
perhaps more. They were the only ones in the city that were not melted down for 
munitions during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think it was because of the Grace of God," said Mike Byerley of 
Houston, one of 93 Lutherans here from Texas to assist with the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 29, when the church was reopened for daily prayer services in a small 
room off the foyer and the new cross was erected, the bells were heard 
throughout the city for the first time in seven decades. RANDY HARVEY

 The Angels haven't had much need for one the last two days, but they still are 
trying to work a trade for an established closer. Meanwhile, Manager Marcel 
Lachemann has indicated that Mark Leiter probably will get a chance to fill the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his personality suits the role well," Lachemann said. "He's the type 
of pitcher who responds to the urgency of the situation."

 Leiter, who has made seven starts this season, has a 1.59 earned-run average 
in his last six relief appearances. Is he looking forward to the opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but we better hurry and get me some chances before we trade for one of 
those guys I've been reading about," he said, smiling. "Let's hope we get in a 
lot of one-run games between now and (the trading deadline) Sunday so I can 
change their minds."

 Outfielder Garret Anderson arrived Wednesday from Vancouver, took batting 
practice and then went into the training room for treatment on his sore left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing, just a little soreness," he said. "I'm sure it's nothing 
serious. It's just fatigued from throwing." 
</P>
<P>
 The shoulder seemed fine when he got to the plate in Wednesday's game. 
Anderson, who was batting .346 with 10 homers and 82 runs batted in at triple-A 
Vancouver, was in the No. 3 spot in the lineup. He lined out to right in his 
major league debut in the first inning, but singled to right in the third and 
fifth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two hits I got weren't hit that hard," Anderson said, "but I'm happy with 
what I got. It's nice to get it out of way."

FORMER RAM IRVIN JAILED FOR SPOUSAL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LeRoy Irvin, a punt returner and defensive back for the Rams in the 1980s, was 
jailed Wednesday on criminal charges of spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin was charged with spousal abuse, vandalizing the home of his estranged 
wife and threatening to kill her in telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin was remanded into custody at the Los Angeles County Jail after failing 
to appear at a prior hearing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Irvin's estranged wife doesn't want to pursue criminal charges, the 
district attorney's office intends to try the case and opposed a reduction in 
Irvin's $10,000 bail, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephanie Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an ongoing problem between Mr. Irvin and his wife," Milton 
Grimes, Irvin's attorney, told KNBC-TV.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; DALLAS' SMITH COOL TO BETTIS' CHALLENGE

 Earlier this week, Ram running back Jerome Bettis said that if Dallas' Emmitt 
Smith hopes to repeat as NFL rushing leader, Smith will have to gain more than 
2,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's response in Dallas: "If he's not obsessed with me, then there's 
something wrong with him."

 Quarterback Chris Miller's surgically repaired left knee is fine, but his 
right knee has been sore, and as a result of favoring it, he has injured an 
abdominal muscle, missing some practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's champing at the bit," quarterback coach Mike Martz said. "It's just the 
risk -- you don't want him to really hurt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has been impressive since leaving the Atlanta Falcons to join the 
Rams, has shown no ill effects from the two operations on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the knee where they took the tendon out to repair the other knee," 
Miller said. "I plant on my right leg and I must have been coming across my 
body in a different way because it was tender. As a result, I did something to 
my abdominal muscle and it's just a little sore." 
</P>

<P>
 Defensive tackle Marc Boutte injured a knee in practice, but Coach Chuck Knox 
said it was not serious. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In what many consider an unprecedented move, Knox invited a reporter who 
regularly covers the Rams to speak to the team this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was good -- it's a step in the right direction," Knox said. "The 
media is a very large and important part of pro football." T.J. SIMERS

THE WEIGHT'S OVER FOR RAMS' DRAYTON; PRO FOOTBALL: HE SAYS EXTRA POUNDS, NOW 
GONE, WERE PART OF A PLAN AND HE'S READY FOR BIG SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scowl on Troy Drayton's face reflected how the Ram tight end felt about 
being likened recently to William (Refrigerator) Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply a joke, Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not funny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A while back, the planet had tipped in Drayton's direction, but as he was 
quick to point out, he is now only three pounds over last season's playing 
weight of 257. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a plan," Drayton said, "to come in as strong as I could, and to get 
strong I had to put on a little weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton's plan, however, initially had Ram coaches concerned. Starting tight 
end Pat Carter had already signed with Houston, and at the opening of 
mini-camp, Drayton was looking like a wanna-be Sumo wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches panicked," Drayton said. "I told them not to worry, I go through 
this every year, but they checked up on me so much that it upset me. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can move when I'm 10 pounds overweight, I know I'm going to be quicker 
when I start cutting the weight. I do it every off-season. I was adding muscle 
and I was getting bigger. I grew an inch too. I'm 6 feet 3 1/2 now." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton took two weeks off after last season, then began working out six days 
a week, four hours a day in Malibu with a personal trainer. No breaks, no 
vacation, no eating binges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever want to be a person where they say, 'Troy had the potential to 
be this or that but never got it done.' I know I have to seize my opportunity, 
and my opportunity is now." 
</P>
<P>
 During practice, Drayton spends time with the offensive tackles learning what 
they know. He can tell you what Jackie Slater is doing almost any time because 
Slater knows what Drayton needs to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never told him, but I just watch him," Drayton said. "I mean I watch him 
when he's not in and he's back there practicing and going through it mentally. 
I see that and I'm thinking maybe I should do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton, who drew praise from former Charger tight end Kellen Winslow last 
season, will be asked to block and catch this season. The extra muscle gained 
during the off-season will be used to pave the way for Jerome Bettis, as Carter 
did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carter is a big loss, but it's not a void we can't fill," Drayton said. "He 
taught me so much and he's with me every day because I have film of him to 
watch whenever I need it. I kind of wish I had another year under Pat, but now 
I want to show the Rams what he taught me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams say they will utilize Drayton's best skills, which include receiving. 
In early workouts, he has been one of quarterback Chris Miller's most reliable 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be a Pro Bowl player this year," Drayton said. "I want to catch 
60 passes and score maybe 10 touchdowns. With most of my goals, if I don't make 
them, I come pretty close." 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, he also might be considered for comeback-player-of-the-year 
honors. After selecting him from Penn State in the second round of last year's 
draft, the Rams reacted as if he were academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you went to China, would you be able to speak Chinese right away?" 
offensive coordinator Chick Harris asked. "There are so many things to learn 
when you're just coming out of college and being asked to play at another 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 So Drayton didn't catch on immediately, and the Rams had little patience for 
his wayward pass-running routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a lost soul at times, and running around like a chicken with its head 
cut off," he said. "And I honestly felt people didn't think I was bright enough 
to pick all that up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I came out of Penn State with its basic offense to Ernie Zampese's 
complex offense and was asked to learn three positions. I was trying. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how much you study, though, you're not always sure in the 
beginning, and that makes you hesitant. But then things started to click in the 
middle of the season, and I think I showed what I can do in the latter part." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton caught 27 passes last season -- 14 in the team's last five games. In 
the Rams' new passing attack, which has a 49er look to it, the tight end will 
have the chance to become a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy can be a force," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Rams had a play for Drayton: The offensive linemen fell down 
at the line of scrimmage, the quarterback faked a pitch to Bettis -- and 
Drayton ran free to the left to catch a screen pass. The play resulted in two 
touchdowns and nearly a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the ball in my hands as much as possible," Drayton said. "If I catch 
the ball, I know one of two things is going to happen: I'm going to score or 
it's going to be a big play."

 Former hockey official Alan Eagleson is wanted in the United States to face 
fraud, racketeering and embezzlement charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kelly, U.S. district attorney, said a request to extradite the former 
executive director of the NHL Players Assn. and Hockey Canada's international 
negotiator from Toronto will be filed within 60 days. Additional charges also 
may be added to the 32-count indictment handed up by a grand jury on March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for the delay has been to do with the fact that we've encountered 
other indications of wrongdoing and we want to make sure we thoroughly pursue 
them," Kelly said. "It has nothing to do with tightening up the case. What's 
being investigated is something entirely new." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleson's lawyers said their client will fight the charges but is not willing 
to surrender to U.S. authorities until details of the indictment are released 
and his defense can be properly prepared.

 Jerry Tarkanian will drop his lawsuits against Nevada Las Vegas and the 
university will pay the former UNLV basketball coach's legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV President Kenny Guinn said Tarkanian and his wife, Lois, agreed to drop 
their lawsuit so the financially troubled school could spend as much money as 
possible on students, rather than continued legal fees and possible damages. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV agreed not to appeal a district court order that it pay Tarkanian 
$250,000 in legal fees for 13 years of battles with the NCAA. UNLV also agreed 
to pay Tarkanian at least $38,000 in sick pay and vacation pay and to cover 
$60,000 to $75,000 in legal fees the coach and his wife accumulated after 
filing a second lawsuit against three university officials in September.

KNOCK ON WOOD; FORMER TITAN STAR FEELS FORTUNATE TO PLAY PROFESSIONAL 
BASKETBALL ON HIS TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leon Wood still enjoys coming back to the Summer Pro League each year to play 
basketball with the latest crop of hot-shooting players emerging from the 
college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hear them talking on the bench and on the court about me being 'The 
Man,' the one they want to stop," Wood said, smiling. "I can hear them say 
things like, 'I want Leon, let me have him.' They're body-checking me and 
pressuring me on every play. And I can hear the coaches talking and saying, 
'You'd better get on him or you're in trouble.' It sort of makes me chuckle 
sometimes, just to hear them talk that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, 32, played six years in the NBA and was a member of the 1984 Olympic 
gold medal team with Michael Jordan. The new kids on the block haven't 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood refers to the NBA as " the league," as if there is only the one true 
league. But the others in far-flung places also have provided him a good 
living, along with an opportunity to continue playing. Last season, he played 
in the Continental Basketball Assn. with Fargo, N.D., until the All-Star break, 
then moved on to Europe to play in the Italian pro league. It was his fourth 
year overseas after playing in Germany and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood also has been on Magic Johnson's touring all-star team this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Summer Pro League is mostly for fun, to keep in shape and for him to 
see how he stacks up against the young pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I consider it a challenge for me, too," he said. "Those young guys are 
always trying to get the best out of me. I know I can't out-run some of the 
young, quick point guards now. But I feel I'm still in good shape. I work out 
every day and do lifting. I'm a little heavier at 210 pounds, but I feel good 
at that weight. . . . What I'm using to my advantage is the experience and the 
smarts, and that's worth something, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood says he's not reluctant to offer some tips to the young players. "I try 
to help them if I can because I can remember when I was in the same situation 
that they are now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 10 years ago. Wood was a first-round pick by Philadelphia after his 
final season at Cal State Fullerton, where he averaged 20.6 points in 91 games 
and still holds the school record for season and career scoring. He also led 
the nation in assists in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the 10th player picked in 1984 and signed a contract with the 76ers for 
$1.1 million for four years. But Wood never did as well as he hoped in the NBA. 
He was with Philadelphia for a season and a half, then went to Washington, New 
Jersey, San Antonio, Atlanta and finally to Sacramento for his final NBA 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, he had foot surgery and spent the winter as a part-time 
assistant coach at Cal State Fullerton. "I thought I might be finished playing 
then, but the foot healed better than I thought it would, and I got a chance to 
play in the pro league in Germany, so I took it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood appreciated the opportunity to extend his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've enjoyed playing in Europe, and there's money there," he said. "A guard 
like myself can get around $150,000 to $200,000 for a season, although the big 
men make the most money over there. The fans are good, too, but you have to 
perform there. You can't have any off games, because you're only playing once a 
week, and they expect a lot out of the American players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I averaged about 20 points a game last season, and I felt good about that. 
But you have to make some adjustments for the differences in the game there. 
They play a lot of zone defense, and that can crowd your skills. The Italian 
players on my team were mostly young, 19 and 20 years old, and it didn't take 
long before the other teams started putting a lot of pressure on me. In the 
playoffs, I saw a lot of box-and-one defenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood still loves playing, but he's at the point where he's considering other 
career possibilities. "A lot of guys I know are really afraid to let go of 
basketball, but I think I can do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's weighing two options, however, that would still keep him close to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking about getting into officiating, or maybe even coaching," Wood 
said. "I've been thinking about officiating for the last couple of years. I 
think I'd be good at it. I know the rules and the game, and I feel I have good 
instincts that would help me in officiating. I go to a lot of the Summer League 
games when I'm not playing and watch the referees work, and I've been talking 
quite a bit with the head referee there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he also may explore coaching possibilities in the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now the only way I'll go back to the CBA is as a coach," he said. "I 
know the X's and O's from playing the game. And I don't think I'd have trouble 
with the coach-player relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who graduated from Fullerton with a degree in physical education, says 
he's also considering a career in law enforcement when he retires. "I have one 
friend who works for the Secret Service and another who works for the Los 
Angeles Police Department, and I've talked with both of them about that 
possibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Tia, have two children, and he says they are eager to 
establish a permanent home after the unsettled life of a pro basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he plans to continue playing for Johnson's all-star team. 
"That's been nice, because we have several games in a stretch, and then we're 
off for a month or so, and I can get back home to be with my family," he said. 
"It's just a question now of whether we'll be playing enough games in a season 
for me to just do that, since we get paid by the game. It all depends on what 
Magic wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 If he does walk away, Wood says he will be able to do it with no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had six years in the NBA," he said. "I wish I could have established myself 
with one team, but a lot of that I had no control over. And that's what I tell 
some of the young players in the Summer League. It's a matter of being in the 
right place at the right time, too."

SIX YEARS LATER, CLOSE STILL COUNTS FOR EX-ANTEATER HESS; BASKETBALL: FORMER 
CORONA DEL MAR STANDOUT KNOWS ANGUISH LATEST UCI TEAM FELT WHEN IT BARELY 
MISSED AN NCAA BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mike Hess knows all about the heartbreak that point guard Lloyd Mumford has 
endured. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Mumford and the UC Irvine basketball team almost clinched the 
school's first berth in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters -- seeded 10th for the Big West Conference tournament -- 
finished the regular season with a 7-19 record, but three consecutive upsets 
put the team in the championship game against New Mexico State. A victory in 
the final and Irvine would have earned the conference's automatic bid into the 
NCAAs. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2 1/2 minutes remaining, Irvine was tied with the Aggies, 62-62. But New 
Mexico State made eight free throws down the stretch and pulled away for a 
70-64 victory at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess watched the Anteaters' demise on TV, but it was no deja view. He lived 
Mumford's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Hess, a graduate of Corona del Mar High, was the point guard 
who helped the Anteaters on another improbable run to the conference tournament 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Hess and fellow senior Wayne Engelstad led UCI to upsets of Long 
Beach State and Nevada Las Vegas -- then ranked seventh in the nation -- to 
reach the final. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine ran out of gas. After leading Utah State by seven points at 
halftime, UCI lost, 86-79. Irvine is the only school in the conference that has 
never appeared in the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an athlete, that's the type of event in your life that you won't ever 
forget or get over," Hess said. "But it isn't something that keeps me up at 
night. I followed this year's team and they got close just like us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's a curse, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford cursed the loss in last season's final; saddened, like Hess, about the 
missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," Mumford said in March. "A couple of missed foul shots and 10 or 15 
more seconds and we could have been going to the big dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hess was disappointed the Anteaters couldn't win the big game last season or 
six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year when the NCAAs roll around I think about how I could have been in 
that event," Hess said. "Only 64 teams in the country get to go, and we came 
within 20 minutes of getting there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Engelstad, who averaged 29 points in three games, was named the most 
valuable player of the 1988 Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. tournament, Hess was 
just as instrumental to the Anteaters' late-season success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Mike Hess, we wouldn't have gotten the ball up court to get it to 
Wayne," said Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky, then an assistant at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But putting Hess at the point was a new revelation for UCI late in that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley Coach Bill Mulligan, then at UCI, wanted to take advantage of 
Hess's shooting touch. Hess, who shot 53% from the field as a junior, started 
at off-guard as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he could be a shooting guard," Bokosky said. "But we finally wised 
up and put him back at his position." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hess: "I had always been a point guard. Coach Jack Errion, from Day 1, 
put me there at Corona del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
 At Corona del Mar, Hess was a two-time All-Southern Section selection and Sea 
View League MVP after averaging 11 points his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of big schools were after him, but he chose Texas over others including 
Stanford," Bokosky said. "The Southwest Conference was the premier conference 
at the time, with the Phi Slamma Jamma guys like Hakeem Olajuwon at Houston." 
</P>
<P>
 But after playing in only five games with one start in his freshman year at 
Texas, Hess was ready to transfer to a school closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 After redshirting in his first season at Irvine, he helped the Anteaters reach 
the National Invitation Tournament in 1986. That season, the Anteaters defeated 
Nevada Las Vegas twice and beat UCLA in the first round of the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
 After a mediocre season in 1986-87, Hess endured the roller-coaster ride as a 
senior when the Anteaters finished the regular season, 14-13 and 9-9 in 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess, whom Mulligan called "the all-time overachiever," moved to the point 
three games before the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. tournament, and the switch 
invigorated the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when the coaches were trying to figure out how to break Long Beach 
State's press," Hess said. "Assistant Coach Tim Murphy said, 'Well, you've got 
a point guard you're not even using. Just have Hess come back and get the ball 
and bring it up.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Mulligan made the change and we ended up losing by only (eight points) at 
Long Beach State. We lost by 20 to Long Beach at home the first time we played 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters apparently stumbled into the tournament with another loss to UC 
Santa Barbara, but they were prepared for Long Beach State in the first round 
of the PCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Morlon Wiley, who was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, and the 49ers 
beat Irvine twice in the regular season, the Anteaters won the game that 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always good to know if someone like Morlon kicks your butt like that, at 
least they're good enough to make the NBA," said Hess, who averaged seven 
points and 3.2 assists in three seasons at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it was trying to chase (Houston Rockets and former Irvine guard) 
Scott Brooks around for three years in practice or defending Wiley, now you 
realize that hey, they really are that good. You don't feel so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hess' final collegiate game left a bad taste in his mouth, he stayed 
at Irvine as a graduate assistant for two seasons from 1988-90. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a degree in social ecology and a Master's in business adminstration 
from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess last played competitively for one season in Dusseldorf, Germany, 
averaging 25 points during the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most I've ever scored in my life," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most competitive basketball Hess plays now is in the annual Corona del Mar 
Alumni basketball tournament. The sixth annual one-day tournament, which also 
will feature former Loyola Marymount standout Jeff Fryer, begins Saturday at 
the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 players will participate in the tournament, featuring teams from 
graduating classes of the mid-1970s to the Class of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds of the tournament will benefit the Corona del Mar basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has seen former teammates, like Brooks, Engelstad, Tod Murphy, and 
Johnny Rogers make a living playing basketball professionally, he is perfectly 
happy leaving his basketball career behind. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned home from traveling in Europe after his one season in 
Germany, Hess was ready to move on to other things. 
</P>
<P>
 He has put his MBA to good use and now works out of his home office in Newport 
Beach as a sales representative for Proctor & Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to challenge myself in another way," Hess said. "Here, my background 
in athletics means nothing. It's a brand new playing field with completely 
different rules, but it's still a lot like sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to win over prospective clients in a different way." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Hess -- 1983's best high school point guard prospect in Orange 
County -- tell people who ask where his career has taken him? 
</P>
<P>
 Hess said smiling: "I sell diapers now."

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; BOOTH ENJOYS THE OPEN DESPITE PROBLEMS 
</P>

<P>
 Kellee Booth tried to block out the thoughts. Sure, it was her first U.S. 
Women's Open, but it wasn't the first time she would be playing against the 
world's best golfers. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Booth, 18, from Coto de Caza, played in the Dinah Shore, one the 
LPGA's major tournaments, and missed the cut by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 So while teeing off last Thursday at Indianwood Golf and Country Club in Lake 
Orion, Mich., Booth was telling herself this was just another tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried not to think about it," she said. "But it probably was in the back of 
my mind that this is The Open ." 
</P>
<P>
 From a competitive standpoint, the Open was over quickly for Booth, whose 
putting deserted her early. 
</P>
<P>
 Three putts on the second hole gave her a double-bogey 6 and three putts on 
the third for a bogey 4. After four-putting No. 6 for a triple bogey, Booth was 
seven over par. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those days," Booth said. "In the past when I have played badly 
I would putt decently to salvage my round. Well, on that day both of those 
things went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 She finished with an 11-over 82, which was among the 11 worst scores of the 
day. The poor first round wasn't without precedent for Booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in her final junior tournament earlier this month, the Rolex 
Tournament of Champions in Oklahoma, she shot 80 on the first day before 
recovering to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year my game has been extremely good or extremely bad," Booth said. "I 
don't know, it's been kind of weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, who will attend Arizona State on a scholarship, rallied on the second 
day at the Open. She shot one-over 72 and her 154 total tied her for the 
eighth-best score among the 21 amateurs entered. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the performance that Booth had hoped for, but she still had fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely wanted to have a good time, which I did," she said. "I met a lot 
of really nice people. The people there were extremely nice and really 
supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Booth is the U.S. Women's Amateur, Aug. 8-13 in Hot Springs, Va. 
It will be the first U.S. Amateur for Booth, who won the U.S. Girls' Junior 
Championship last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 She qualified by shooting five-over 77 at Old Ranch Country Club in Seal Beach 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mr. 57: Jason Chapple, a junior player from Irvine, says he posted a 13-under 
57 in a practice round at the Alhambra Municipal course July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapple was getting accustomed to the 5,100-yard layout a few days before a 
qualifying tournament for the California Junior Amateur, and his game was 
clicking from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 He birdied the first hole, made eagle on the par-5 second and shot six-under 
30 on the front nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he made 3s on each of the final nine holes -- two eagles, three birdies 
and four pars -- for a 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapple said his round was witnessed by a man from Maine who signed his 
scorecard and told him to report his round to the pro shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapple said he did just that, but the man he showed his card to apparently 
wasn't an employee of the course, because no one at the course remembers 
talking to Chapple that day, said Gerald Wisz, the head professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like the guys in the pro shop don't believe me but I didn't know 
what to do," said Chapple, who will be a senior at Woodbridge High. "I was 
actually shaking after the round. It was just a really weird moment. On the way 
home I started thinking that I should have had someone in the pro shop sign my 
scorecard." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisz holds the course record of 59, and Chapple's round came when the course 
was set up to less-than tournament specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapple's game came back to earth in the qualifying tournament -- he hit his 
first tee shot behind a tree and sprained his wrist when his club hit a tree 
root on the next shot. 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching six-over after 16 holes, he finished strongly -- a birdie and 
an eagle gave him a 73, good enough to make a playoff for the final spot. He 
lost the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprained wrist kept him away from golf for about a week, but didn't 
diminish his enthusiasm for his play this summer. On July 11 he won his first 
local junior tournament at El Niguel Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summer, I've just been ripping it up," he said.

OP PRO SURFING CHAMPIONSHIPS; CURREN BOWS OUT FOR MOM'S NUPTIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some guys will go through anything just to get to the Op Pro, and other guys, 
well, they could take it or leave it. 
</P>
<P>
 Richie Lovett survived snow and ice and two days of missed flights and running 
through airports to surf in Round 3. Tom Curren, who received a wild-card bid 
that allowed him to skip all five trial rounds and the first round of the main 
event, decided at the last minute he didn't have time to compete in the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Curren was signing autographs on the Huntington Beach boardwalk when Op 
contest organizer Allen Seymour spoke to him. Curren said that because his 
mother was getting married Saturday night, he wouldn't be able to stay and surf 
the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed because I personally was looking forward to seeing him 
surf," contest director Ian Cairns said. "And I feel that all of us who have 
competed successfully have a big debt to repay to a sport that's been really 
good to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Curren won the Op Pro three times and was crowned world champion surfer in 
1985, 1986 and 1990. He now lives in France but travels eight months of the 
year filming promotional videos for his sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's able to live at the level he does because of competition," Cairns said. 
"I feel he owes this contest and surfing in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing is that spot opened up for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Cairns selected four surfers seeded in lower rounds who compete regularly on 
the Bud Surf Tour. He put the names in a hat and drew Nate Acker of Santa Cruz. 
Acker was originally seeded in Round 4 so Curren's withdrawal moves him up 
three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But as indifferent as Curren is, the majority of surfers would sacrifice more 
than their weekend to surf the Op Pro. Lovett, 21, from Manly, Australia, may 
be the extreme. His dedication to the sport remains even in the face of sharks 
and tidal waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a shark bumped Lovett and circled his board twice before a wave 
from nowhere lifted him to safety. Then two months ago, a tidal wave, which hit 
a remote surfing village in Java, where Lovett was on a promotional photo trip 
two months ago, killed 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 After a month's recovery from the leg injuries sustained in the tidal wave, 
Lovett returned to competition in the July 13 Gunston 500 in Durban and the 
Jeffries Bay Billabong Classic the next week in Jeffries Bay, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovett started his journey to the Op when he boarded a plane in Jeffries Bay, 
South Africa, on Monday. He needed to catch a flight to Johannesburg, before 
flying on to London and finally to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really, really cold in Johannesburg and the plane started to ice 
over," Lovett said. "It was six hours before they told us the flight was 
canceled. Then we had to go through the whole commotion of getting our luggage 
and checking into a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovett, Richard Marsh, Simon Law and several others finally caught a plane the 
next morning at 11. In London, they learned they had missed their flight and 
again checked into a hotel and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 A late flight out of London made the situation appear worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the air over Las Vegas, Lovett slid his credit card through the airphone 
and dialed Al Hunt, tour representative for the Assn. of Surfing Professionals. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "He said 'I'm coming, I'm coming. Can you hold my heat?' " Hunt said. 'I said, 
'I'll see what I can do.' When I told Ian (Cairns) he postponed the heat.' 
</P>
<P>
 When Lovett's plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport, his buddies, 
who were seeded in later rounds, ran interference as Lovett sprinted through 
customs and the rest of the sprawling airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got to the beach five minutes before my original heat but luckily 
it was postponed," Lovett said. "I got a chance to surf the other side of the 
pier and warm up, which was great because it's so different here. I was coming 
from a place with perfect right-hand waves." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lovett finally got into the water to compete just before 5 p.m. he found 
five useful waves in rather weak conditions and scored high enough to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty good once I got out there," he said. "I hadn't surfed in three 
days and I usually surf three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had so much bad luck. I can tell stories until I'm 80." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes

IS IT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?; SARATOGA: MEETING FOR THE NEW YORK TRACK 
STARTS EARLIER THAN EVER, BUT ATTENDANCE HASN'T RUN TO FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the New York Racing Assn. could use a little horse sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, riding Saratoga's popularity all the way to the bank, the 
NYRA broke with tradition and expanded the thoroughbred racing meet from 24 
days to 30. And the fans came in droves -- more than 100,000 for the first time 
in its storied history -- and bet an extra $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, after two more record-setting meets, another four days were tacked 
on, giving the venerable track its earliest starting date ever. The fans have 
come, but there's been plenty of room to roam. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 21,000 turned out for opening day last Friday, not far off last year's 
record. But on Saturday only 15,237 showed up -- the lowest Saturday figure in 
more than a decade. Track legend Fourstardave ran on Sunday and won here for 
the eighth straight year, and NYRA threw its biggest promotion ever -- nine 
brand new cars were given away. But attendance was a disappointing 23,065. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the bottom dropped out -- 9,659. 
</P>
<P>
 NYRA officials say they're not wearing blinkers -- they knew the turnout would 
be disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These four days do not sell well," NYRA President Gerard McKeon said. "It's 
new, and the season ticket-holders had already committed to what they thought 
was a five-week season. We did not expect any kind of support from the people 
outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we would lose a good part of the downstate constituency for this 
part of the meet, and because of that it would be more enjoyable for the local 
people, who would have a crack at some of the amenities that are denied to them 
during the meet. We really didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 That four-figure total Monday was the lowest in recent memory. NYRA media 
director Glen Mathes estimates the last time less than 10,000 showed up 
probably occurred during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is at the bottom of NYRA's ever-expanding meet in Saratoga. NYRA needs 
it. The state Legislature didn't include NYRA's request for a $25 million 
package in the state budget, and the severe winter forced the cancellation of 
more than a dozen racing cards, costing the NYRA $13 million. McKeon expects 
the NYRA to finish the year $15 million in the red despite a nice profit here 
of more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temptation is always here to expand, expand, expand, because it's so 
profitable," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer, NYRA shuts down its two New York City tracks, Belmont and 
Aqueduct, and moves its operations 175 miles to the north to Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long can you present what makes Saratoga successful without ruining it?" 
McKeon asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go toward your success and try to squeeze as much out of it as you can," 
he said. "I think that's an error that will probably be made sometime in the 
future. I don't know when that will happen. It hasn't happened so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are limits in terms of dollars, in terms of enthusiasm, and in terms of 
stars to run. And we keep on pushing those limits to see if we can get away 
with it. This place has been here for 126 years, and I hope that another 
century goes by and people will be saying the same thing: When are you going to 
expand the meeting from three months to four?"

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; DALLAS' SMITH COOL TO BETTIS' CHALLENGE

 This week, Ram running back Jerome Bettis challenged Dallas' Emmitt Smith, who 
was the NFL's top rusher last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis said Smith will have to gain more than 2,000 yards if he hopes to 
retain his title. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's response: "If he's not obsessed with me, then there's something wrong 
with him." 
</P>

<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller's surgically repaired left knee is just fine, but his 
right knee has been sore. Because Miller has been favoring it, he has hurt an 
abdominal muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was held out of much of practice and Wednesday he was not allowed to 
participate in 11-on-11 drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's chomping at the bit," said Mike Martz, quarterbacks coach. "It's just 
the risk -- you don't want him to really hurt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has been impressive since leaving the Falcons to join the Rams, 
has shown no ill effects from two surgical procedures on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the knee where they took the tendon out to repair the other knee," 
Miller said. "I plant on my right leg and I must have been coming across my 
body in a different way because it was tender. As a result, I did something to 
my abdominal muscle and it's just a little sore." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Marc Boutte injured his knee in practice, but Coach Chuck 
Knox said it was not serious. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Sean Landeta, who finished strongly with a 43.5-yard punting average last 
season, is trying to keep free agent Matt Turk from taking his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Turk, a brother of Raider center Dan Turk, failed to make the Packers' roster 
last season after averaging 36.3 yards a kick for Wisconsin Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sean is in a battle with one of the finest young prospects I've seen in many 
a year," said Wayne Sevier, special teams coach. "Both are in midseason form, 
and I'm anxious to see how this plays out in the games." T.J. SIMERS

RAMS ADJUST TO LATEST RULE CHANGES; FOOTBALL: SPECIAL TEAMS COACH FINE-TUNES 
HIS GAME PLAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Notice to NFL fans: No more dawdling come game time; no more bathroom breaks 
until after the not-so-automatic attempt for the extra point; no more fantasy 
football leagues decided by long-range field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule changes we have this year are the most dramatic since I came into 
the game," said Wayne Sevier, 53, who coaches the Ram special teams. "We're 
talking four major changes with the most drastic being the two-point 
conversion." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule change No. 1: The opening kickoff now becomes mandatory viewing. Instead 
of kicking off from the 35-yard line, the ball will be booted from the 30. 
Instead of the ball being downed in the end zone and brought out to the 20, now 
it will most likely be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a kicker put 20% of his kicks in the end zone last year and they weren't 
returned, that was considered a great job," Sevier said. "You won't see anybody 
come close to that this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule change No. 2: New equipment will further handicap the kickers and ensure 
more returns. Instead of using three-inch tees, which allow for more hang time, 
all kickers must use a one-inch tee. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a three-inch tee you were looking at a good hang time of 4.3 seconds," 
said Tony Zendejas, Ram kicker. "Now if you get anywhere around four seconds it 
will be a good kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule change No. 3: Teams will, in effect, be penalized seven to eight yards 
for attempting and missing a field goal. A year ago there were 120 attempts 
from 50 yards or beyond, but now with the ball being spotted at the point of 
the attempt rather than the line of scrimmage, coaches might not be so quick to 
call on the kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see fewer long field goals," Sevier said. "The better 
pooch punters become more valuable to their teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule change No. 4: Teams will have the option to kick for one point following 
a touchdown or go for two via run or pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you're going to see many people go for it," Sevier said, "but 
the minute somebody gets you with the two-point conversion you're going to look 
like an idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the Rams hired perhaps the smartest special teams coach in 
the NFL. The signing of Chris Miller drew the headlines and the addition of 
Jimmie Jones, Wayne Gandy and Joe Kelly might excite the fans, but Sevier 
brings the Rams immediate respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call him the czar of special teams," said Joe Bugel, former Cardinal head 
coach and an assistant previously with Sevier in Washington. "Without a doubt 
he's one of the better ones, if not the best. What a tremendous motivator. He 
can take a good football player and make him a really great special teams 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 In between successful tours of duty in Washington, Sevier resurrected the 
Chargers' miserable special teams and made them tops in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it from Day 1," Zendejas said. "He demanded everyone's attention and 
didn't care if you were a star player or not. It's unbelievable how attentive 
he is to every detail. Every individual knows exactly what he must do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle, the football teams coached by Chuck Knox set a standard for 
top-of-the-line special teams play. This past off-season Knox pursued Sevier, 
who had plans to join former Washington Coach Joe Gibbs, if as expected, he is 
offered the opportunity to coach in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bumped heads when he was in San Diego," Knox said. "He was the guy I 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 How important are special teams to Knox? Most people here believe the firing 
of running back Russell White on the opening day of training camp was Knox's 
message to the troops: You don't play special teams, then we don't need you. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was something Chuck mentioned at that time," Sevier said. "I'll put it 
this way: It was a definite message to me that Chuck Knox is totally committed 
to special teams. The talks he has had with our team reinforce that: He wants 
great special teams." 
</P>
<P>
 That is Sevier's charge, and now he must be prepared to handle the game as it 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams will need more speed on their kickoff coverage teams to keep opponents 
from gaining a decisive field-position advantage. Speedy kick returners could 
become household names. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the teams that will come out of this the best in the return game will 
be the teams with the least amount of penalties," Sevier said. "You will get 
some good field position on the kickoff return, but what will kill it will be 
the penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams will be looking for kickers, however, with big legs to kick the ball in 
the end zone and avoid the long return. Zendejas kicked off 58 times last 
season, put the ball in the end zone 16 times and put it in the end zone deep 
enough to keep opponents from returning it nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid's a real professional," Sevier said. "He's worked as hard toward 
this season as any kicker I've been around and I've been around some great ones 
(Mark Moseley, Rolf Benirschke, Jim Bakken, Chip Lohmiller). 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm going to ask him to do is not place it, but get the best possible 
kick for us and then we'll cover that kick. We're just looking for the best 
combination of depth and hang time." 
</P>
<P>
 The rule changes also will force coaches to make tougher game-deciding 
decisions. Do they risk going for the 50-yard line and turning the ball over to 
their opponent at the 40 if the kicker misses? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told Tony if you want to kick the 50-yarder," Sevier said, "just make 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Head coaches will have a two-point conversion in their playbook, but do they 
use it? In college, if a team misses the extra point early on, it usually goes 
for two following its next score. Will the pros? If a team trails by one point 
on the road with 12 seconds remaining, does the coach go for the tie or the 
victory? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of decisions to be made and you need someone there to give 
you the best chance to make the right decision," Knox said. "Wayne Sevier 
brings something to the table other than the fact he's just a good coach. He's 
been in the game a long time, and he knows the things we have to work on to get 
better."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: RIGHT TOOLS CAN HELP DEFEAT DECOR DEMONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Redecorating can be a lot like a military campaign; there are armies of 
painters, wallpapering specialists, contractors, electricians and plumbers to 
mobilize. And that's after you have figured out the plan of attack. 
</P>
<P>
 What color scheme do you want? Do you tear out the wall? Will you need to 
re-plumb? Do you need an architect? An interior designer? Should you really 
have bought the couch with the sliced watermelon print? Will friends laugh if 
you put up the matching wallpaper? 
</P>
<P>
 Could Gen. MacArthur have faced anything more complicated? 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Weldon Tone, who wrote this week's Centerpiece story on redecorating 
with paint, thinks not. She has had her own living room skirmishes to contend 
with; she has faced her enemy and it is purple. 
</P>
<P>
 It's become the Battle of the Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I did the typically stupid thing of buying couches before we 
did any other remodeling," Tone said. "They, it turns out, are a very odd 
color, somewhere between a burgundy and a plum. I have never seen this color 
anywhere other than on these couches." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how she found herself in the position of staring at a blank wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have these 18-foot-high ceilings and they are all still the same color they 
were when we moved in nine years ago," Tone said. "That's because I haven't 
been able to figure out how to get them to go with the couches. I have brought 
home wallpapers and fabrics thinking they would match the couches, but they 
never have." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a while back, she picked up her daughter from ballet class and 
discovered a good cover story as well as a way to finally conquer her 
reddish-purple blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in to get my daughter and saw this graphic that a local woman artist 
had painted on the walls of the dance school," Tone said. "When I saw it, I 
thought, 'That's really interesting. Maybe I should do something like that in 
my living room, maybe a mural.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was a year ago. Which means that by now, Tone should have vanquished the 
plum tyrants, and color-washed, sponged, muraled or splattered her way to a 
decorative victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I still haven't done a thing yet," she said. "But at least now I 
know that I can find someone who will be able to match my walls to my couches." 
</P>
<P>

ready to make a big statement with a small household appliance, check out this 
week's Fashion column. Kathleen Williams will tell you what is au courant in

 Meanwhile, Shop Talk columnist Julie Sawyer checks out designer goods at the 
Oxnard Factory Outlet, while Structures columnist Josef Woodard gives his views 
on the complex's good (or bad) design.

THEATER REVIEW / 'QUILTERS'; TALE OF WOMEN IN OLD WEST IS RICH TAPESTRY; THE 
PLAY PROVIDES A PATTERN OF CHARACTER STUDIES AND REMINISCENCES OF HARSH 
FRONTIER LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tough life for women on the expanding American frontier: They kept 
house, tended to the barnyard animals, gave birth to and raised the children, 
tended the sick and buried the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't enough, frontier women made quilts: large quilts, tiny quilts, 
and all sorts of quilts in between, in numerous permutations of color and 
pattern. In fact, if what's portrayed in "Quilters" -- a play with music -- is 
to be believed, it's amazing that frontier women found time for anything other 
than quilting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quilters" was originally developed and produced at the Denver Center Theater 
Company. The Santa Paula Theater Center is currently producing a version of 
play, this one based on an edition mounted last summer in Simi Valley, which 
was directed by Dani Brown and Roy Spicer III, who are also directing this 
production. At last week's opening, the fine collective performance drew as 
many audience ovations as a Wayne Newton concert. The show certainly deserves 
your attention. 
</P>
<P>
 A septet of talented women are featured, most of them relative newcomers to 
the Ventura County theatrical scene. Their characters reminisce about the days 
when they helped settle the West. In front of a minimal set and with few props, 
they act out various aspects of frontier life, from birth to a full-immersion 
baptism, to first encounters with "the curse," marriage, child-rearing and, 
ultimately, death. 
</P>
<P>
 It's often funny, occasionally tragic, and gives an unusual, if somewhat 
skewed, view of life on the plains during the 1800s. (Authors Molly Newman and 
Barbara Damashek based their script on several histories; Damashek's original 
songs are often reminiscent of traditional melodies.) 
</P>
<P>
 The cast consists of Brandy Ball, Kathryn Dippong, Mary A. Hill, Natalie 
Holcomb, Anne Howard, Lorraine MacDonald and Christine Zerbel. Each is featured 
at one time or another; several play a variety of roles, some doubling as men 
(there's one very funny scene involving a laconic cowboy), and all are called 
upon to sing. Musical accompaniment is provided by co-director Spicer on piano 
and guitarist Dave Winstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-director Brown is also credited as choreographer, with Spicer as musical 
director. Whoever is responsible, the onstage movement (even when characters 
are not dancing) is fluid and well-paced. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Quilters." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Thursday through Saturday evenings at 8 and Sundays at 2:30, through 
Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Santa Paula Theater Center, 125 S. 7th St., Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Thursday and Friday evenings and Sunday afternoon: $12.50 general 
admission, $10 students and seniors. Saturday evening: $15 general admission, 
$12.50 for students and seniors.

NIGHT LIFE: YOUNG DUBLINERS TAKIN' ROCKY ROAD TO VENTURA; POPULARITY OF THE 
PARTLY IRISH BAND, BASED AT FAIR CITY PUB IN SANTA MONICA, KEEPS DRAWING PACKED 
HOUSES HERE AND ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So you finally have a band, but you can't get a gig. You are tired of playing 
the garage and the neighbors are relieved. And you can't find anyone who will 
pay you to play. Now what? A day job? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's always Plan B: Buy your own bar. The Young Dubliners, or more 
precisely front man Keith Roberts, bought Fair City, an Irish pub in Santa 
Monica. That's one way to get gigs -- and free beer, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals can save themselves a drive when the band plays in Ventura on Friday 
night. Local rockers, Raging Arb & the Redheads are scheduled to open for the 
Dubliners, who will make their second appearance at Nicholby's. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-piece outfit recently released a six-song recording entitled "Rocky 
Road." It's on Scotti Brothers, a label conveniently situated just around the 
corner from the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Because bands and bar owners are natural antagonists, Roberts may be on that 
rocky road to schizophrenia. But before he arrives, he discussed his favorite 
band by phone from Fair City. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, who's young and who's from Dublin? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, well, first of all myself, Paul O'Toole and Bren Holmes are from Dublin. 
Our violin player Lovely Previn -- she's Andre Previn's daughter -- was born 
here, but she lived over there a lot. The original Dubliners were like the 
biggest band ever from Ireland. We used to hang out with them and go over to 
their houses and stuff. When we started playing over here as a duo, myself and 
Paul, people called us "the young guys from Dublin," which became the Young 
Dubliners. Of the original Dubliners, two are dead and two are in their late 
70s, so we're a hell of a lot younger than they are. Anyway, everyone in the 
band isn't Irish, but who (cares)? Everyone has to come from somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 So "Rocky Road" is doing OK? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. We're massive in Czechoslovakia -- can't hardly walk down the street in 
Prague. In America, we're working on it. Much like the Gulf War, when there's 
air support, it works. But one time we played a show in Portland, Maine, for 
about 12 people and it was one of our best. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. showcase scene -- does it work? 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. showcasing in the big clubs is a waste of time and money. The A&R guys 
won't even show up most of the time. You need a definite contact to show up. We 
never really blanketed this town, and we didn't send out demos. But when we 
play the Roxy or the Lingerie, we sell out; and of course, we sell out Fair 
City every Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So you guys didn't get signed by showcasing? 
</P>
<P>
 No. It was funny. We knew this girl who had a radio show, but she also worked 
for Scotti Brothers. She got us on this "Straight Out Of Ireland" compilation 
album, and our song was the one that got all the airplay. We knew we wouldn't 
get signed by some single that's getting airplay, but we have a gang of people 
that follow us around. We sold out the House of Blues -- 1,100 people -- now 
we're on their main rotation. The people just won't stop coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Did getting signed change you guys? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, absolutely. Now we're way more broke than we were before. Now we have to 
exist on the road on ten bucks a day per diem. And we see each other a lot 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a natural antagonism between the band and the club, but now you're a 
club owner. What's up? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course now I make the same mistakes they did. I started this place to get 
away from all that pay-to-play (bleep). I book all the bands, but the bar tends 
to suffer when we're out of town. See, the way I do it, everyone gets to play 
here unless they're atrocious. I don't judge by demos, I talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do you do when a band is late or cancels? 
</P>
<P>
 I draw the line on not showing up. We've never no-showed for a gig no matter 
if I was sick or even if we were missing a band member. I go out on a limb for 
your band, so you better show up. I pay the whole door to the band, and I get 
the bar, no guarantees, no percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get the Nicholby's gig? 
</P>
<P>
 I think my agent knew of Nick at Nicholby's. I like that place, but I don't 
like pool tables in the room. I mean, I'm up there pouring out my life's work, 
and some guy's shooting pool? But everyone up there is nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Describe a typical Saturday night at Fair City. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's a big party we throw and everybody just hangs out. At first I 
didn't understand it, but people don't always dance together in America. I 
mean, if nobody likes you, you're stuck at the bar all night. They do the Irish 
jig when we play, and it's mad hysterical dancing and everyone is just being 
ridiculous. Also, the ratio of women to men is astounding. We're the score for 
Guinness. Details

 It's becoming a cliche. World renowned guru plays role of holy teacher while 
indulging in all the follies he condemns. Greed, love affairs and extravagant 
living is how Radha Rajagopal Sloss describes the lifestyle of Jiddu 
Krishnamurti in her book "Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti." She writes 
that her American mother, who was married to Krishnamurti's best friend and 
business manager, carried on an affair with the spiritual leader for 20 years. 
The charismatic Krishna, who died in 1986, attracted devout, often well-heeled, 
followers all over the world, and many of them were enraged when Sloss' book 
exposed his dissembling, hypocrisy and manipulation. The author, a Montecito 
resident, will talk about the years she lived in Ojai with Krishna and her 
parents at 7 p.m. Friday in the Ventura Bookstore, 522 East Main St.

 Anyone interested in meeting and talking with Harry Ashmore, a man who for 50 
years was part of the civil rights movement and wrote about its political 
history, can do so at 7 p.m. Friday at the Earthling Bookshop, 1137 State St., 
Santa Barbara. Ashmore's 14th book, "Civil Rights and Wrongs," is his personal 
account of the racial politics of America from 1944 to 1994. As editor of the 
Arkansas Gazette, Ashmore won a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished public service 
in the Little Rock school integration crisis. He came to Santa Barbara to 
participate in the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions; served as 
editor-in-chief of Encyclopedia Britannica; and currently sits on the executive 
board of the Committee for an Effective Congress.

 "Combat He Wrote," written by former Oxnard resident Lt. Col. Charles Hudson 
and Venturan Ross Olney, tells the story of Hudson's exploits as a World War II 
bomber pilot and his adventurous life after the war. In his dedication, the old 
warrior writes, "To my wife Mary, who endured all my reckless energy, never 
making a single complaint in our 49 years of marriage. Her patience and 
understanding allowed me a lot more freedom than I deserved. She spent most of 
her life raising our two fine sons. Her dedication humbles me, and now I am 
aware that I should have tried harder." Author acknowledgments are often worth 
studying. The book is available at Ventura Bookstore or by calling (800) 
458-8531.

CENTERPIECE: COLOR YOUR WORLD; WHEN IT COMES TO REMODELING, THERE IS A PAINTING

 The wallpaper ripped during the earthquake and you have just discovered that 
the pattern has been discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 You're expecting your first child and have started to decorate the nursery. 
Somehow, though, you're just not bunny/bear/ducky people. 
</P>
<P>
 You bought an expensive sofa only to discover that no wallpaper book in a 
20-store search has anything that matches. 
</P>
<P>
 You just leased space for your new business and want to give it an unusual, 
personalized touch. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? Think paint. Think mural. Think graphics. Think rag, faux, sponge. 
Decorating with paint has moved light years beyond Navajo white or even Santa 
Fe peach. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of paint for decorating is growing steadily and it seems the only 
limits are the imagination. There is a paint decorating technique to fit 
virtually everyone's taste, style and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 There are definite advantages in using paint to decorate your home or 
business. You can select your own colors. Paint can be mixed to match any color 
scheme, any fabric pattern, any mood. You can select patterns, textures, 
murals, graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Paint doesn't rip. It doesn't have seams. It is never discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you're tired of it, just paint it out. No machinery. No mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Before running for the yellow pages, however, you may want to know what the 
local artists/painters have to say about decorating with paint. And, of course, 
there is that all important question that anyone planning a remodel is going to 
ask: What's this going to cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Read on. EXPERT ADVICE 
</P>
<P>
 There are as many approaches to decorative painting as there are artists and 
clients, but there are some basic decisions that must be made in each case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to liquid paper specialist Charlotte Bishelli, of Custom Painting 
Plus in Camarillo, color is the most difficult decision most people have. "With 
wallpaper," she says, "the colors are already there. But with paint, you can 
choose literally anything and that can be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Color is one of the most important considerations in decorating. Color can 
change the shape of a room, the size of a room and most certainly, the mood of 
a room. The psychology of color has been widely studied and is used frequently 
in business design. Studies have shown that color has more impact in our 
day-to-day lives than most of us realize. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food restaurants often use brighter colors that dissuade you from 
lingering over a meal. Conversely, restaurants that want to invite an unhurried 
dining experience will use muted colors, creating an atmosphere of relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been found that decorating, inside or out, with blue, can make your 
home more difficult to sell, and that color preference often varies with income 
and education levels. Hunter green, for example, is liked most by those with 
college educations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important that you carefully choose your color scheme. "Blue next to 
food can make (the food) look gray," says Elizabeth Castrejon of Westlake, who 
has designed a number of restaurant interiors. "So you have to be careful in 
selecting colors for each area of the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishelli, who has attended several color seminars, strongly suggests that a 
sample be done before final decisions are made. "If a customer doesn't like the 
color," she said, "the design doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherand Palmer, owner of Simi Valley's Murals by Sherand, recommends that 
final color mixing be done at the site where it will be applied. "You have to 
see it with the lighting where it will be used," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're unsure about colors, the experts suggest looking around for the 
predominant colors in your house. "I often look at their towels. That's 
frequently a good indicator of the colors people like," said Bishelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting a design is the next most difficult thing, according to artists. 
Some people have an exact idea of what they want, others have a vague idea, and 
some have no idea at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Bocash, of Wall Fantasies in Camarillo and a specialist in children's 
murals, says most of her clients have some idea of what they want. "For 
newborns, a lot of people buy their nursery bedding first, so I often match the 
colors and designs they select," she said. For toddlers and older children, 
Bocash likes to involve the children by finding out their interests. "A lot of 
the fun for me is seeing the kids get excited as the mural takes shape," Bocash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphic artist Sheila Webber of Simi Valley, whose specialty is business and 
residential graphics, spends her first session with a client coming up with a 
concept. "They rely on me to graphically interpret their themes and feelings, 
so I try to get a good understanding of their business or personality," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most artists agree that it is helpful if the client has a general idea of what 
he or she wants. Castrejon advises her clients to keep an "idea folder" with 
pictures of design- and color-schemes they like. "This is so personalized," 
said Castrejon, who specializes in trompe l'oeil, "that I find it helps to get 
a feel for the person, their likes and dislikes, before I start a project." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have no idea, and are brave and trusting, there are options. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few people feel comfortable enough to just turn us loose to create," said 
Gerry Massey, who with brother Doug owns Massey Painting in Ventura. That is a 
favorite, though infrequent, assignment for the brothers. "It takes a really 
good sport," said Gerry, "because at any given stage, it may not have the 
balance it will have at the end. It takes a trusting client, but we've never 
had to paint anything out or do it over." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the approach, all artists agree that clients should be very 
honest in their response to the project. "After all, they are the ones who will 
have to live with it," said Palmer. COST 
</P>
<P>
 So, OK -- the Beverly Hills and Lake Sherwood types have unlimited funds for 
continual redecorating, but what about the rest of us? Surprisingly, the 
customized touch is not as expensive as you might think. It is custom work, of 
course, so it will be more expensive than the roller-to-wall job. 
</P>
<P>
 All decorative painting must be estimated on an individual basis, but there 
are known factors that affect the cost of a job, most of them quite obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Size is, of course, a major determinant of cost. Two rooms cost more than one, 
a one-wall mural less than a four-wall mural. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of colors used is another big factor, particularly in textured 
finishes. Sponging a wall three times clearly takes longer than two times. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of the decorative paint is another big consideration for the 
artist. Intricate trompe l'oeil, detailed cartoon characters and delicate 
marbling are more time-consuming than a two-layer splatter paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, not-so-obvious, factor is the trim: A room with lots of intricate 
corners, edges and molding will be more expensive than a flat wall with no 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists mentioned in this article have done decorative work for as little 
as $125 (small bathroom) to as much as $20,000 (very large house). An "average" 
mural might be about $600; a 360-degree mural might be several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 The important thing is to be clear about costs and estimates early in the 
discussion. Neither you nor the artist needs to spend a lot of time discussing 
options that are out of your budget range. MIXING IT UP 
</P>
<P>
 SPECIAL FINISHES 
</P>
<P>
 In the general category of special paint finishes, there is fresco, faux 
fresco, color washing, dragging, stippling, ragging, sponging or combing, to 
name a few. Simply stated, each of these techniques is a way to apply color in 
an uneven manner, without the use of the standard paint roller. These methods 
are generally used for subtle, rather than bold coloring, although there are no 
hard and fast rules in the world of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these techniques involve applying the color unevenly over the 
background paint, others involve applying and then removing color from the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 FRESCO, the application of tinted plaster, is not commonly done because it 
requires serious physical labor to trowel on plaster and it is difficult to 
create the right conditions for bonding between old and new plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 FAUX FRESCO, a much less taxing and less expensive alternative to fresco is 
the application of a "skim" coat of plaster-like materials, such as spackle, to 
create a surface that absorbs color like a blotter. After the skim coat dries, 
color is applied. Applications are repeated until the desired color is 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative is to tint the skim compound before application, though control 
of the color is more difficult with this technique. 
</P>
<P>
 COLOR WASHING gives a watery coloring to the wall. Special paint is liberally 
thinned and dries to a soft finish without hard edges or streaking. Color 
washing is done by applying color with a brush irregularly in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 DRAGGING is the use of controlled brush marks, usually done vertically to 
create a subtle, silky appearance. A firm brush is dragged through a tinted 
glaze. This is a difficult finish to achieve, because it requires a straight 
brush stroke down an entire wall. Then comes the task of avoiding paint 
build-up at the start and finish of each stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 SPONGING is one of the more popular of the textured finishes and can create a 
wide variety of effects, depending on the type of sponge, the way it is used, 
and the number of colors used. Color washes or glazes can be sponged on or 
sponged off. A sea sponge is most commonly used. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-color sponging is often used to get a marbled effect. 
</P>
<P>
 RAGGING AND RAG-ROLLING have gained popularity for their softly variegated 
texture and are most often used with softer colors. Both techniques can be done 
with rag, towel, cheesecloth or chamois. For ragging, the bunched cloth is 
pressed onto the wet glaze to remove the color. For rag-rolling, the cloth 
itself is first rolled up, and then rolled up or down the wall. Twisting the 
cloth before rolling gives a more dramatic appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 COMBING may be used to create a textured effect on a glazed wall. A comb, 
steel wool, or any of many other implements is used to create textured 
patterns. According to Gerry Massey, of Massey Painting in Ventura, practically 
anything can be used to create this sort of effect. "You can go outside, get a 
tree branch and use that if you wish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 SPLATTER PAINTING also adds texture to a wall. Splattering is just what it 
sounds like. Paint colors are splattered from a brush onto the chosen 
background, creating a festive treatment that can complement any decor. 
</P>
<P>
 FAUX FINISHES are special painting techniques that mimic another material, 
such as marble or wood. Faux marbling is done in two categories. The first is a 
highly skilled technique that closely imitates the appearance of real marble. 
</P>
<P>
 Faux marbling has been done for hundreds of years. Many European cathedrals 
used faux marble for everything above eye level. Because there are nine 
different kinds of marble and numerous subsections, this method is generally 
reserved for a specialized faux artist. 
</P>
<P>
 A second option is "fantasy marbling," which attempts to merely suggest the 
varied patterns and rich color of marble. This is a much less difficult 
technique. Marbling is done in several steps. It starts with the chosen 
background color and proceeds through "veining" with a special brush or 
feather, sponging the veins, softening the vein lines, finishing with varnish 
and polishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood-grain texturing also takes several steps and requires skill and practice. 
A dry brush is dragged through wet glaze and the lines are then blurred with a 
soft brush. Any of a variety of tools are then used to create the lines and 
knots of a wood surface. 
</P>
<P>
 DECORATIVE PAINTING 
</P>
<P>
 Decorative painting offers the most customized look for your home or business. 
Decorative paint may take the form of murals, stencils, graphics, or trompe 
l'oeil, a French term meaning "to fool the eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Most decorative painting is done by the more artistic members of the painting 
profession. Murals, graphics and trompe l'oeil are individual creations and 
works of art, so asking your contractor brother-in-law to create a mural may 
result in serious disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAPHICS and MURALS are an increasingly popular way to decorate the business 
and home. In earthquake country, many parents are opting to decorate children's 
rooms with murals, rather than with objects that can fall off the wall during 
one of our many aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 A mural can range from a 360-degree Tom Sawyer scene to simple branches of ivy 
climbing up from the floor or down from the ceiling. According to 
artist/painter Elizabeth Castrejon of Westlake, one of the newer trends is the 
use of phrases -- perhaps a simple grace for the dining room, some Shakespeare 
or Keats for the library, a bit of Beatrix Potter for the nursery. The customer 
not only selects the saying but also chooses the style of script the artist 
will use. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphic artists can create or duplicate a logo for your business and add a 
related mural for a unifying touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Murals and graphics offer an opportunity to creatively express personality, 
interests and business pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 STENCILING is a relatively simple, but versatile way to add interest to a home 
or business. Virtually any pattern can be found or created and any part of the 
wall or ceiling can be stenciled. Stenciling may be used alone or to enhance 
other decorative techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 TROMPE L'OEIL, one of the most interesting of the decorative techniques, 
requires the skill of an artist capable of creating the appearance of three 
dimensions where there are two. Trompe l'oeil creates the illusion of width and 
depth where none exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Often used to solve architectural or decorative problems, trompe l'oeil can be 
used to balance an architectural asymmetry, to create windows, cornices, 
molding or virtually anything your imagination can conjure. 
</P>
<P>
 LIQUID WALLPAPER is a decorative technique that calls for its own 
classification because it falls somewhere between faux finishes, stenciling and 
stamping. Liquid wallpaper requires use of special decorative rollers. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a roller equipped with reservoirs for up to three colors of paint, the 
pattern is rolled onto the wall and, unless you are inches from the wall, it is 
indistinguishable from wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquid wallpaper can be used on any surface from walls to concrete, to block 
walls. In fact, this technique has become the rage for driveways in parts of 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterns vary from cartoons to geometrics to floral, to name a few of the 
hundreds available.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: TWILIGHT CONCERTS ADD CHARM TO SIZZLING SUMMER WEEKENDS; TWO 
FREE EVENINGS OF MUSIC OFFER THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO RELAX AND HAVE A 
PICNIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If I were still a kid living in the Midwest, chances are I'd spend these warm 
weekend evenings in some park with my cousins, swatting mosquitoes and chasing 
fireflies under the watchful eye of grown-ups too gorged on s'mores to help us. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the Ventura County climate, I can't help you in the lightning bug 
department, but I can steer you to two outdoor twilight concerts perfect for a 
relaxing country time. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday from 6 to 8 p.m., Sweet Country will play its brand of traditional 
and new country music for Oxnard's Heritage Square Summer Concert Series. There 
will be plenty of free lawn seating for the whole family, so don't forget 
picnics, blankets or lawn chairs. If you'd rather travel light, chairs are 
available in plaza seating for $1 per person on a first-come, first-serve 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sunday from 6 to 8 p.m., the Cache Valley Drifters, a Central 
Coast-based band, will serenade folks with traditional and contemporary 
bluegrass music. The concert will be in Arroyo Vista Community Park, behind 
Moorpark High School. The entertainment is free. All you need are some low-back 
chairs and a picnic to round out the evening. And if you don't feel like 
packing a meal, refreshments will be sold at the site. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you can't stay up for K-HAY radio's request show, Santa Fe Cafe, which airs 
weeknights from 10 p.m. to midnight, you might try the All Request Lunch Bunch 
-- Mark James' weekday noon request and dedications show. James starts taking 
calls at 11:55 a.m. (650-5429 or 656-5429). 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want to hear the station's call letters in Bryan Austin's current 
hit, "Radio Active" or Ronnie Milsap's song, "True Believer," you'll have to 
request the airplay cuts. You won't find K-HAY mentioned on store versions of 
these records. That's because the K-HAY part was digitally "punched in." 
</P>
<P>
 "The station is the largest in its market size so they send us special 
copies," said James, who is also K-HAY program director. The record companies, 
he said, only customize the first verse and then the station expands it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE THE DATES: If you'd like to see new country artist Bryan Austin perform 
"Radio Active" in person, he'll do two evening shows at the Crazy Bull in 
Camarillo on Aug. 22. Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers will open the show. 
The price hasn't been set yet. 
</P>
<P>
 And to take the hassle out of attending the California Mid-State Fair in Paso 
Robles, catch the K-HAY bus Aug. 6. Arrive by 12:45 p.m. to leave by 1, with 
deejay escorts Mark James, Matt Michaels and Dave Lawrence. Judging from a 
previous fair trip with Lawrence on board, I'm willing to bet you'll be well 
entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 The $60-per-person price includes transportation, admission to the fair, the 
Alan Jackson concert and some back-stage meetin' and greetin.' Tickets are 
available between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays at the station, 3897 Market St. in 
Ventura. For details, call 642-8595.

 CLUB SCENE: Rumors have been circulating about changes at the Borderline in 
Thousand Oaks. When I called, I discovered that the club changed managers and 
that the Monday night live band format has been put on hold for awhile. But 
everything else is business as usual so you can still enjoy the Saturday 
afternoon two-step and waltz workshops and Sunday swing jams. Dance fans will 
be delighted to know remodeling is in the works to expand the dance floor and 
add a patio. But the doors will remain open during construction. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fans of the defunct band, Caught Red Handed, which featured Troy Robinson as 
lead vocalist, are probably confused when they read that the band is playing 
gigs again. But the players are really the current lineup of Sky King, with 
Robinson sharing the vocal spotlight with Rob Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 During an identity crisis at the Frontier Club a few months ago, one of the 
fellas said, "Just call us 'Sky-Caught Red Handed-King with Troy Robinson.' " 
Club owners, it seems, like cashing in on the following of Caught Red Handed.

FOLLOWING A DROP OF WATER THROUGH ITS RECLAMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TALLY GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reclaimed water that could flow through the taps of 1 million customers in 
the upper San Gabriel Valley would go through the following process: 
</P>
<P>
 * Raw sewage flows to the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant in Whittier. 
For the first two hours there, the sewage sits in primary settling tanks, where 
a non-chemical process allows heavy solids to sink and light solids to float. 
</P>
<P>
 The tanks are covered with metal, keeping escaping odors to a minimum. About 
two-thirds of all solids are removed during this time. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sewage is then funneled into aeration tanks filled with swirling 
bacteria that break down the organic material in the water. In a second set of 
settling tanks, the bacteria drop to the tanks' bottoms and are scraped away. 
</P>
<P>
 * The water is chlorinated before and after it is sent through thousands of 
small, packed coals that act as a filter for viruses. After its second 
chlorination, the water is dechlorinated, crystal-clear and odorless. 
</P>
<P>
 * The water would be pumped through a nine-mile-long underground pipeline to 
the Santa Fe spreading grounds, near the intersection of the San Gabriel River 
(605) and Foothill (210) freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the water would seep through 240 feet of earth to the ground water 
table. TALLY GOLDSTEIN

STRUCTURES; OXNARD OUTLET DESIGN SENDS MIXED MESSAGES; IT'S HARD TO TELL IF THE 
DISCOUNT COMPLEX IS A NOD TO SIMPLER TIMES OR A CASE OF THEME PARK MEETS 
SHOPPING MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when a looming water tower stood tall as a proud emblem of 
Everytown, U.S.A. These towers, at once useful and metaphorical, are visible 
for miles and function as containers of precious, life-giving fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Southern Californians see a water tower go up, such as the one 
prominently erected alongside the Ventura Freeway near Rice Avenue in Oxnard, 
eyebrows arch and suspicions are aroused. Is a big budget film project under 
way, or has a theme park perhaps come to roost in our back yard? 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the answer is none of the above. Welcome to the surreal shopping 
experience known as Oxnard Factory Outlet, a.k.a. Outletville, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Agricultural motifs are writ large on this property, teeming with huge, simple 
barn-like structures, a working windmill, corrugated metal roofs and awnings, 
and other touches of almost too-basic rural Americana. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, questions nag about this new development, which so vies for our 
attention. Is this shopping mall as theme park? Is it an insultingly cheeky 
eyesore or a welcome departure from the bland aesthetics of the strip mall in 
California? It may be a bit of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 The development has landed right here in the town that the Oxnard brothers 
founded almost a century ago as a sugar beet center. Since then, Oxnard's 
agricultural heritage has gradually been threatened with the inevitable 
encroachment of developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, in recent years, remaining Oxnard farmlands -- especially those which 
are near the freeway -- have been sold off to housing and commercial 
developments at an alarming rate. Adjacent to the very property here are lonely 
produce-yielding fields. But, no doubt, they'll fall prey to the bulldozer in 
our lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend can be mighty discouraging for sentimentalists who like to think of 
Ventura County as a last bastion of ex-urban culture, where farming is still a 
viable enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Enterprise of another sort is the only produce to come out of the factory 
outlet mall, of course. There is something vaguely eerie about the place, which 
seems to seek atonement for its sin of supplanting the genuine article by 
mimicking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere you look at Oxnard Factory Outlet, there are paradoxes to consider. 
In a sense, it is comforting that we wander through a farmers' market -- but 
it's also a disturbingly phony artifice, a cheap date. 
</P>
<P>
 The development makes the most of simplicity, either out of a sense of 
heartland minimalism, or cost-cutting, or both. These bargain barns, in pale 
yellow or rust color, come in slightly erratic shapes, like a barn built from a 
Sears catalogue blueprint read by someone who's been into the moonshine. 
</P>
<P>
 A central open-air courtyard is covered by a labyrinth of vivid yellow 
I-beams, topped with a corrugated metal roof. Interiors proudly boast their 
exposed, un-gentrified beams and ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 An architectural curiosity, the Oxnard Factory Outlet goes out of its way to 
try to accommodate -- or even apologize to -- its site, right down to the fruit 
crate labels plastered on the walls. We find labels from Ventura County-based 
companies such as the 100-year-old Limoneira, Pacific Maid and Ventura Maid -- 
the latter two featuring bedroom-eyed women with an unnatural fondness for 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reproductions of these labels are grainy and look much better from a 
distance. Ditto the entire operation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, Outletville has a certain built-in enchantment based on 
kitsch. Compared to the lifeless edifices -- the discount palaces -- across the 
freeway, for example, there is something to look at, to think about here. 
</P>
<P>
 But, really, does this agri-kitsch playground pay homage to the former use of 
the land, or is it paying last respects? That's the darker and potentially 
disturbing side of the style equation. 
</P>
<P>
 However clever the illusion of an agrarian setting, while shopping at Oxnard 
Factory Outlet you always know you're not in Kansas. The fledgling palm trees 
and the incessant din of 101 traffic assure us that we're freeway close to the 
peculiar place we call home.

SHOP TALK; BARGAINS ARE IN THE BAG AT NEWLY OPENED DISCOUNT MALL; THE 40 STORES 
THAT MAKE UP THIS COMPLEX ARE DIVERSE ENOUGH TO SATISFY EVEN THOSE KNOWN TO 
SHOP UNTIL THEY DROP.

 Forget about all that negative stuff you've heard about outlet shopping -- 
that the merchandise is last season's and the prices not low enough for savvy 
sale shoppers. We left the Oxnard Factory Outlet with a Cheshire cat's grin and 
a trunk full of shopping bags. (So many bags, in fact, we considered leaving 
them in the trunk until Mr. Shoptalk leaves for work.) But hey, we got deals! 
</P>
<P>
 The new Oxnard Factory Outlet has 40 outlet stores with many more, including a 
Gap Outlet, on the way. Shopping here is as cool and easy as the ocean breeze 
blowing through the parking lot, and the stores seem to be staffed mostly with 
helpful students from the nearby Cal Lutheran grad center. What a pleasant 
change from some of the cranky clerks we're used to. 
</P>
<P>
 One word of caution: Be sure to eat before you arrive. The food court is not 
yet open so we were forced to sustain ourselves with caramel covered candy 
apples from the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory ($2.25 each with peanuts). 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sample of some of the most exciting stores: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leon Max Outlet 
</P>
<P>
 Did we say outlet? This store looks just like one of the Leon Max ritzy retail 
shops found in upscale malls. The clothes are elegant contemporary separates, 
at mostly 30% off retail. The jewelry selection was pretty thrilling. Beaded 
necklaces, silver charms and earrings we haven't seen anywhere else in the 
county, and 50% off the regular prices. Don't miss the cotton and linen 
indigo-dyed sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benetton Outlet 
</P>
<P>
 Now this looks like the outlet stores we're used to. A bit of a mess, but the 
current 50% off the lowest ticketed price makes the picking through very 
rewarding. Although Benetton runs a controversial ad campaign, the clothes are 
anything but. Strictly Euro-prep, these Italian clothes are of high quality 
material and workmanship. We went straight to the back of the store to the 
children's department, loading up on exceptionally beautiful T-shirts (retail 
$29; now $7) and cotton sweaters (retail $49; now $12.50). 
</P>
<P>
 * Nine West Outlet 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another bright and well organized store with plenty of bargains. Our 
favorites were the au courant espadrilles (retail $40 and now $19.97) and the 
woven leather clogs (retail $48; now $14.97). 
</P>
<P>
 * The Kitchen Collection 
</P>
<P>
 We counted at least three kitchen shops, each one filled with delightful 
gadgets, gizmos and graters. The Kitchen Collection will special order 
accessories they don't carry and still deliver a discount. We brought home a 
cookie sheet that promises not to burn the cookies (and it was half price)! 
</P>
<P>
 * Francine Browner 
</P>
<P>
 At the back of this outlet store is a great selection of clothes by 
"Parallel." This is a line we usually drool over at Bullock's. We especially 
loved the gray linen apron dress (retail $189; now $65). The pleated rayon 
short skirt (retail $100; $35.99) is great for teen-age girls who want a killer 
back-to-school wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welcome Home 
</P>
<P>
 This store is the gift shop no mall is ever without. July Christmas Shoppers 
take note. Buy one cotton afghan, the second is half price. And they are 
already a bargain at $19.99 to $39.99. Cotton napkins and place mats are good 
buys at 99 cents and $1.97. 
</P>
<P>
 * Designer Labels For Less 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the bigger stores and it is filled with surprises. Carole 
Little is offered here, in fact, every line she produces from large to petite, 
to her new and hipper label, "Streetwear." Look for a rack of clothes by 
"Flax." These cotton and linen separates are a personal favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 We were really impressed with lingerie here. A large selection of perfectly 
organized bras and panties by Christian Dior and Lily of France are all 50% off 
retail. 
</P>
<P>
 * A&Y Leather and Accessories 
</P>
<P>
 This leather goods store has a very convincing selection of Coach knock-offs. 
A beautiful leather backpack by the Canadian "Sacha" was $89.99 from $189.99. 
There are leather organizers by DayRunner and Kenneth Cole for 30% to 40% off 
retail as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We could go on and on and on. This outlet mall is simply a blast. From 
large-size fashions to upscale audio equipment, this place has it all. We 
suggest quickly walking though each store, you never know what treats are 
hiding in the back. And be sure to choose carefully: Most stores have a 
no-return policy!

 A remake of "Little Rascals" comes to theaters early next month with the Darla 
redux provided by Brittany Ashton Holmes of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The remake will remain true to Hal Roach's original premise of a multiethnic 
group of pranksters.Brittany plays Alfalfa's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The new film was produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and 
directed by Penelope Spheeris of "Wayne's World" and "The Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
 Brittany is scheduled to promote the movie this evening on "The Tonight Show" 
with Jay Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach produced 122 episodes of the comedy shorts originally titled "Our Gang." 
They got the title "Little Rascals" when they were repackaged for television in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cinematographer for the movie "Free Willie" is going to present a benefit 
screening of his project "Dolphins and Orca," Wednesday at Eric Ericsson's 
restaurant in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The program of music and videos will benefit the Blue Dolphin Co., a local 
environmental education group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The animal trainers for "Free Willie" are both from the Ventura-based Active 
Environments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "We trained all the live animal work," said Tim Desmond. "All the interaction 
between the boy and the whale was under our supervision. All the shots in the 
tank were done by us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of a captive killer whale and a young boy's attempts to win his 
release did well at the box office, but benefits have not been as forthcoming 
for the film's star, an orca whale named Keiko. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,000-pound orca lives in the Reina Avenpura aquatic park in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the "Dolphins and Orca" video are $5 in advance, $7.50 at the 
door. For more information call 643-1862.

AT THE MARKET: PEACHES, ABUNDANT AND CHEAP, CAN OFTEN FALL SHORT ON FLAVOR; 
GROCERY STORE FRUIT USUALLY HAS BEEN PICKED TOO EARLY. TO ENSURE SWEETNESS, 
LOOK FOR TREE-RIPENED VARIETIES AT FARMERS' MARKETS AND ROADSIDE STANDS.

<P>
 An abundant harvest of California peaches has area markets erecting 
Goliath-sized mounds of this summertime favorite, while prices are hovering 
just above the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Peak supplies and favorable prices -- about $.89 a pound in grocery stores -- 
are expected to last through August, according to Barbara Buck, executive vice 
president of the Fresh Produce and Floral Council, an L.A.-based industry trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, fine, so the market is replete with the fuzzy fruit and the price is 
right, but things are not entirely peachy keen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has experienced the pleasure of biting into a tree-ripened, 
perfuming peach -- its juice streaming down the forearm -- knows that the key 
variable, more than quantity and price, is flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Like much of the mass-produced vine- and tree-grown fruits and veggies, flavor 
has taken a back seat to high production. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the tolls from hurried picking, loading, unloading and long-distance 
transportation. The need for durability necessitates that the fruit be firm. 
And that means harvest-time must come at a green, unripe stage. 
</P>
<P>
 A preemie peach will "ripen" on the kitchen counter, of course, but it isn't 
the same experience as eating one that has ripened on the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough lamenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County residents in search of the perfect peach do have a few 
alternatives beyond the store-bought versions. There are the farmers' markets 
-- always a good bet to find fruits at their sweetest. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are a few area growers such as Dorothy Holmes, who raises a few 
different varieties on an acre of land near the Los Padres National Forest. 
Bonita and Elberta peaches are available at her roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said that over the years she has built a reliable clientele, some of 
whom make the trek from deep within Los Angeles County to purchase by the 
boxful her sweet bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I leave the peaches on the tree as long as I possibly can," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatile Bonita, she said, is a large freestone variety, suitable for 
canning because of its firm flesh, "but it's also good for any use." 
</P>
<P>
 The near teardrop-shaped Elberta peaches she raises are becoming more and more 
valuable. Once an ubiquitous industry staple, the Elberta -- a juicy, sugar 
factory of a peach -- has lost its appeal with commercial growers who are now 
growing more durable and larger varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't find the Elberta anymore," Holmes said. "But that doesn't say 
anything about its flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 The popular peach varieties saturating today's market are those that feature a 
deep ruby-hued skin -- a factor that consumers have come to expect, according 
to the California Cling and Freestone Peach Advisory Board. But don't let the 
redness fool you. It is no indication of ripeness or flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the best peaches go, I think the white peach is the best," said 
grower Mike Harvey of the family-operated Harvey Farms above Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Peaches of the white variety -- normally with a pale cream-colored flesh -- 
are becoming a familiar site at grocery stores, although they are still 
considered a specialty item, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted for their superior sugar and juice content, white peaches in general are 
more fragile than their yellow-fleshed cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Farms raise a white version they call the "Champagne" -- a large peach 
with a creamy pink-blushed flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a lot of growers can handle the Champagne variety. It is so delicate and 
it bruises easy," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular attendees of the Thousand Oaks farmers' market may recognize the 
Harvey Farms name. The family has spent a lot of time there, offering an 
impressive array of specialty tree-grown fruit, including Asian pears, plums, 
apples, nectarines and peaches. Transportation problems prevent them from 
making the trip down from Delano, but Harvey said they hope to be back very 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the white peach -- supermarket-priced at about $1.50 a pound -- we can 
expect to see a lot more of those in the future, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think white peaches will become more predominant. New varieties are coming 
out that are a little less delicate than the Champagne." 
</P>
<P>
 And they have the added advantage that they can be eaten while still firm, 
Harvey said, and need not soften up like their yellow counterparts. "That's 
critical. Most people don't know that." When purchasing any kind of peach, 
avoid those with a greenish undertone or with dark soft spots and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, dark reddish skin is no indication of flavor. A peach should 
yield to gentle pressure before devouring. Unripe fruit can be quickly ripened 
by placing in a closed paper bag. Details

ON THE ROAD: CLUSTERS OF PUBLIC ART MIGHT AGAIN STAND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The southward ride from Oxnard to the Pacific Coast Highway at Point Mugu is 
one of urban deliverance: from clanking muffler shops, used auto yards and 
seedy strip joints to vast verdant vegetable fields to muscular mountains that 
vault from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The liberating gray-to-blue progression is broken only by the poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The poles: Nine of them, clustered together, each a foot wide and deep but a 
towering 80 feet tall. You've seen them, possibly. 
</P>
<P>
 They stand at the junction of Rose Avenue at Oxnard Boulevard, on the 
northwest corner just down a piece from Marie Callender's. They're painted 
black. Each has a series of silver bands, spaced tightly at the top and loosely 
in the middle and then far apart at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 For the literal-minded among us, the poles might appear as radar or some 
stealth navigation device -- Point Mugu Naval Air Station is nearby, after all. 
For others whose viewpoint slides more easily into the surreal, the poles might 
stand as a mutant shock of horsetail from some space giant's garden. However 
these steel columns appear, though, they do not look like what they are: art. 
</P>
<P>
 But they started out as art, and more plainly so. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988 the Told Corp., a builder of industrial parks, agreed to the city of 
Oxnard's request that its proposed development include public art -- that is, 
art that Told would pay for and place on its private property, but that would 
be designed on such a monumental scale as to transcend property lines and 
become art in the public domain. The poles do that, at least the get-noticed 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 Told hired Sonoma artist Robert Behrens to do the job. Behrens is a national 
player in the public art world. Massive sculptures by Behrens connect the New 
Orleans Super Dome to the Mississippi River, form a civic gateway across the 
main highway leading into Fairbanks, Alaska, and lend energy and changing light 
to the railroad station in Davis. Indeed, Behrens' Davis piece is so prominent 
and familiar there that it must now be taken into account as a governing design 
consideration in development that goes up around the railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
 Behrens was struck by Told's decision to develop an industrial campus without 
traditional copper phone wiring and instead install fiber optics -- a 
telecommunications medium of the future. He also was struck by Oxnard's desire 
to transcend the look of rusting South Oxnard Boulevard by giving northward 
travelers a gateway into a high-tech, forward-looking city. "It needed to be a 
powerful enough statement amid all the mundane, amid the muffler shops, to say 
something about the future," says Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
 So Behrens conceived of the poles. The towering cluster is joined by three 
other pole groupings, though you might not have noticed them: 11 in one long 
line, and nine more in a cluster, at the junction of Statham and Oxnard 
boulevards, at the west end of the property, and a cluster of nine, perhaps 30 
feet tall, at the corner of Rose and Wooley avenues, at the far northeast end 
of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver bands on the poles are a special formulation of Mylar, which 
refracts daylight every which way. Behrens positioned the Mylar on the poles so 
that at sunrise or sunset, especially, passersby would suddenly see changing 
bright colors, as if green-blue-golden rainbows within each group magically 
connected all the poles. Placement of the poles became critical: They needed 
enough light and enough space around them to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Behrens named his serial installation "Connections," and "Connections" would, 
fired up by Nature, become a bright post-Industrial metaphor "linking light, 
time, space and people," to quote a mud-caked plaque at the base of the poles 
at Wooley and Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while it worked. The Mylar seemed electrified. The poles stood out on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But Told's once-singular industrial park got sold off in pieces, and its open 
spaces filled up. All manner of buildings went up near and around the poles, 
occluding some from view and stuffing visual clutter behind others. Marie 
Callender's was boldest of all. The entire front of its building at Statham and 
South Oxnard Boulevard noses within five feet of the 11-pole array -- a true 
astonishment of modern-day non-planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, by 1992, the Mylar gave out. Behrens had underestimated the rapacity of 
ocean air: once-refractive material turned dull, lightless, hopeless: a 
conductor of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Connections" started coming apart, started its descent into disconnection. It 
became poles, not art. A $250,000 set of very odd poles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it carries the original desires of the artist," says a 
diplomatic Andrew Voth, director of the Carnegie Museum and member of the 
city's Art in Public Places Committee. "It's totally lost. I don't blame the 
artist. It just did not quite come off." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll see. "Connections" now fights for an improbable comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Mylar replacement is under way, and the poles near Callender's are firing off 
colors that change with the slightest movement by the viewer -- that is, for 
the viewer who manages to block out the view of the restaurant. Other pole 
clusters, such as the 80-foot mega-tower at Rose and South Oxnard Boulevard, 
await new Mylar -- though that cluster at times gets lost in a row of telephone 
poles behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Behrens, Oxnard provides a sobering civic jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea that Marie Callender's or any other buildings would be up that 
close," he says. "Now the piece is distracted from by simple disregard. No one 
ever called me -- not once -- to discuss what appropriate designs on 
surrounding property would be. Public art, you know, is no different than 
anything else: It is modified by what is placed next to it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a statement that lends "Connections," at least as far as land-use 
planning goes, a whole new meaning.

JAUNTS; TALES SURFACE ABOUT SHIPWRECKS AT ISLANDS; THE SAGA BEGINS WITH A 
GOLD-LADEN VESSEL IN THE 1850S. STORIES ARE TOLD AT THE NATIONAL PARK'S VISITOR 
CENTER.

 It was the winter of 1853 and the Winfield Scott , a paddle wheel steamer, was 
speeding from San Francisco to Panama, loaded with several hundred passengers, 
about $800,000 in gold, and tons of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dense fog set in as the steamer approached the Channel Islands on the evening 
of Dec. 2, and the vessel rammed full speed into Anacapa Island. Miraculously, 
everyone was rescued, but the vessel was doomed to the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winfield Scott , and a handful of other historic shipwrecks in the Channel 
Islands, are the focus of a free presentation at 3 p.m. Sunday at the Channel 
Islands National Park Visitor Center at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Sue Goodglick will talk about seven of the most prominent wrecks, the 
most famous being the Winfield Scott , which is a popular site for divers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage people to dive wrecks," Goodglick said. But the shipwrecks are 
considered protected resources and divers can neither retrieve items nor 
disturb them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winfield Scott shipwreck is on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The steamer was a gold-rush era vessel, which carried gold seekers from Panama 
north to San Francisco, often returning with those who had made their fortunes 
and those who hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ill-fated voyage, the ship was under the command of Capt. Simon F. 
Blunt who hoped to cut time from the voyage by steering a course between the 
Channel Islands, rather than skirting them on the seaward side, according to 
historical accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 That might have worked, except for the fog. After the vessel rammed into the 
rocks, panicked passengers were ferried in the dark to a small rock about 200 
yards off the island. Once on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much remains of the old paddle wheel steamer. The wreck was salvaged once 
in 1894 and again during the 1940s, according to National Park Service 
archeologist Don Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Divers can see part of the hull, engine fragments, parts of the paddle wheels, 
and a big hub from one of the wheels, said Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 He said all the gold bullion the steamer was carrying was removed from the 
ship, but divers have subsequently found a few gold coins. These probably were 
loose change carried by the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another old-time ship that met its fate in the Santa Barbara Channel was the 
Goldenhorn , a four-masted cargo carrier that went aground off Santa Rosa 
Island in 1892. It got too close to the island, and when the wind failed it 
drifted to shore, according to Goodglick. The remains of the Aggi also rest off 
Santa Rosa Island. Carrying a cargo of grain, it struck a reef in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains of the Jane L. Stanford lie near Santa Rosa Island as well. The 
four-masted lumber schooner was converted to a fishing barge before it was 
rammed by a mail steamer in 1929. The wrecked wooden vessel was blown up by the 
Coast Guard, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comet was a three-masted lumber schooner that rammed Wilson Rock off San 
Miguel Island in 1911 while sailing eight miles off course. One crew member 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuba also was a victim of San Miguel Island. In 1923, the mail steamer's 
radio went out for three days as it traveled from Panama to San Francisco, 
Goodglick said. It hit the island in heavy fog. All 122 passengers were 
rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 The most conspicuous shipwreck is the Chickasaw, a freighter that rammed the 
shore of Santa Rosa Island in dense fog in 1962. The hull is still visible. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's neat about these (shipwrecks) is that they are like time capsules," 
Goodglick said, and show how people lived and how ships were built. That's why 
they should be preserved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her talk, called "Sunk but Not Junk," she will show slides and videos and 
pass around pictures of the shipwrecks. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Sunk but Not Junk," a talk on shipwrecks around the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Sunday, 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center, the end of Spinnaker 
Drive, Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: 658-5730.

 Long ago, before Americans had reached their full potential as consumers, 
every household had an identical telephone. That's as hard to imagine now as 
everyone drinking tap water, or writing their checks on plain paper stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephones, like everything else in our culture, are now a ready means of 
self-expression -- which need to be updated as one evolves. So why delay an 
upgrade of your hopelessly mundane telephone equipment, or fail to add one to 
the downstairs closet? 
</P>
<P>
 That's an exaggeration. The average home has but 2.6 telephones, which is 
almost exactly one phone to a person, according to the census count. But . . . 
are they the right phones? 
</P>
<P>
 Even as we write, new telephones are slithering off the drawing board ready to 
tempt you with their diversity. AT & T reports that new models evolve so 
quickly, they no longer print a brochure of them because it would be obsolete 
by the time the printer could deliver it. So, you can imagine your phone will 
be outdated in the time it takes to program your instant recall numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, incidentally, phones that can speed-dial up to 200 numbers, should 
you have that many friends -- or should you wish to impress a smaller number of 
friends with the notion that you have more. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, merchants say this year that most buyers want cordless 
phones, since newly approved frequencies have dramatically improved their 
reception. Several retailers said they're outselling wired phones 10 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Both types of phones tend to have a lot of complex features, which no doubt we 
will soon find we need. For instance, many have hands-free operation for use 
while whipping up breakfast, and mute capability to put a caller off-line while 
warning the children to stop egging each other's hair. There are also light-up 
dials for calling in the dark -- in case of power outages or perhaps to save on 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most new phones are designed not only to perform high-tech functions, but to 
look high-tech while doing it. With their rows of buttons and no-nonsense gray 
or black matte finish, they would fit the decor of a Stealth bomber cockpit -- 
and, indeed, they appear to have been sculpted for high speeds. This, of 
course, has long been a popular look in many household gadgets -- even the 
average coffee maker appears to be about to launch into space. But more about 
those in another column. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who resist the streamline model, there are alternatives. In fact, 
technology has put a lot of effort into creating phones that appear not to be 
telephones at all, but are disguised as Mallard ducks or Big Macs. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe there isn't actually a Big Mac phone, but someone is probably 
working on it -- just wait. Instead of ringing, this phone could exclaim, "You 
deserve a break today" and a portion of the price could be diverted to a 
McDonalds charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The quacking Mallard phone does, in fact, exist, and is a dead ringer for an 
actual decoy, except for the handset carved out of the bird's back, which is 
fairly awkward to lift and replace. The quack announcing incoming calls might 
add zest to a stuffy office milieu. 
</P>
<P>
 At Radio Shack, there's a phone about the size of the palm of a hand that, 
closed, appears to be a clam. It is called the Seashell Fashion Phone. There is 
also a model that looks like a crimson Frisbee with a handset, which for some 
unfathomable reason is called the Tudor Fashion Phone. 
</P>
<P>
 But our vote for best designer phones goes to AT & T, which has produced the 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle model ("Vroom, vroom!") and the locomotive (chug, 
chug, chug, whooooo-oooo!"). Each of these takes up a lot of desk space and has 
inconvenient handsets -- but, they're worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 AT has long licensed a Mickey Mouse phone, which thankfully doesn't say 
anything in Mickey's voice when a call comes in. It just lights up and looks 
kitschy a trait that has kept this rodent in the spotlight for half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Another manufacturer, Recyco Inc., has come up with a Flintstone phone, 
probably an inevitable event, since Flintstone items have become about as hard 
to avoid as lawyer jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fred Flintstone Softphone looks as much as anything like the sole of a 
flip flop, and it is hard to say what decor it would match. There are other 
Softphones available as well, all startling, including one with a whimsical ear 
at the earpiece and a large red mouth at the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 While checking these offerings at Target in Ventura, we met Judy Young of 
Thousand Oaks, who was looking for a cordless phone. Her home, which houses two 
people, already has four or five phones -- she had lost track. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most phone buyers this season, Young was shopping out of concern for 
technology, not aesthetics. She chose her first cordless model, one that looked 
ready for takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchase in hand, she made a comment that helps to explain why telephone sales 
figures stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need it for the family room," she said, "because I can't get one with a 
cord long enough to go to my couch."

FOR THE KIDS; YOUTH THEATER TO PRESENT GRITTY LOOK AT LIFE; THE SERIOUS MUSICAL 
ABOUT TEEN-AGERS WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS IS BEING PRESENTED BY A SANTA PAULA 
DRAMA GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a cold, nasty world out there. Just ask any teen-ager who has run away 
from home and managed to survive on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what playwright Elizabeth Swados did in 1978 when she wrote 
"Runaways," a gritty, musical tribute to the pain and suffering these kids 
somehow endure. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first production for teen-agers, Hundred Hats Youth Theater in Santa 
Paula is taking on this tough, streetwise play. Not only that, the theater 
group is doing the show in a bilingual mixture of English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not your usual 'aren't we cheerful' " show, said Terry 
Brenner-Farrell, who co-directs the musical with Julie Billingsly. "It's tough 
subject matter, but teens need a chance to see both the dark and the bright." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brenner-Farrell had to do some editing of Swados' play to eliminate 
some of the rough language. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater group is looking for kids 13 years and older to participate in a 
monthlong workshop during August to prepare for the production. Beginning 
Monday, the teen-agers will meet Monday through Wednesday from 2 to 5 p.m. The 
workshop costs $120 and covers acting, voice, movement, makeup and stage 
crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 The play will be presented Sept. 15, 17, 18, 22, 24 and 25 in the Santa Paula 
Theater Center. Tickets are $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Runaways" takes place on the street. The set is simple and stark: a trash 
can, graffiti, a chain link fence. The story is actually a series of stories 
told by the runaways. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a prostitute, another is a boy who ran away to prove to his parents he 
exists, another is an emotional basket case over his mother's death and another 
is deaf. Others have equally troubling pasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Swados' tapestry of broken, troubled lives examines not only survival on the 
street, but teen-age pregnancy, friendship, parent-child relationships and gets 
to the very basic question of what constitutes a home and family, according to 
Brenner-Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Billingsly hope to put together a multicultural cast. The deaf 
character will have an interpreter, and the Spanish dialogue will be 
understandable to non-Spanish speaking audience members through movement and 
action, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsly said they picked the play because they wanted a challenge for 
teen-agers, something that would generate discussion during the workshop. "When 
we do a show we try to have something for the kids to learn," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is actually a musical, and Brenner-Farrell is doing the choreography. 
"There is some comic relief," Billingsly said. "But it's still pretty serious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a much lighter vein, the Young Artists Ensemble is doing that perennial 
musical comedy, "Guys and Dolls," at Westlake High School auditorium today 
through Aug. 6. The cast of about 55 kids, ages 13 to 19, will be accompanied 
by a live orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Show time is 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings. Tickets 
are $7. This is the 14th annual summer musical the Thousand Oaks young acting 
group has offered. For information, call 499-4355.

<P>
 In Simi Valley, it's party time. Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District is 
throwing a Splash Party Friday night at the Rancho Simi Community Park pool. 
</P>
<P>
 It's billed as a family event, with swimming, games and dancing to oldies and 
top 40 tunes. It runs from 7 to 9:30 p.m. Cost is $3.50 per person, which 
includes snacks and soft drinks. This is the first of two Splash Parties the 
district is throwing this summer. The other one is Aug. 26. For information, 
call 584-4400.

 Ventura's recreation department has some nifty one- or two-day arts and crafts 
workshops for kids at Ventura's harbor this summer. The sessions at Ventura 
Harbor Village last one or two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can make shell jewelry and collages, board games, yarn paintings, 
origami, seashell barrettes, friendship bracelets and cord necklaces. The cost 
ranges from $8 to $15.

MUSIC; CONNICK'S 'FUNK TOUR' FEATURES ALL-STAR LINEUP; THE CROONER'S BAND HAILS 
FROM HIS HOMETOWN OF NEW ORLEANS. THEY'LL PERFORM AT THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY 
BOWL.

 Harry is a name that never dies, but never really catches on. It does continue 
to be the inspiration for bad jokes in the fourth grade, where cruelty has a 
surer foothold than mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I got the same thing when I was a kid, but my dad ended up being the D. 
A. and I ended up as a musician," said crooner Harry Connick Jr., who will be 
stopping by the tree-lined Santa Barbara County Bowl on Tuesday night. "It 
seems like Harrys end up in positions of power, sort of like Harry Truman, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the years growing up with the dreaded name, Harry Connick has 
managed to become the most famous Harry in New Orleans. Connick has clearly 
caught on. Does that mean that Connick, who was married earlier this year, will 
be passing the family moniker along someday? 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably won't be a Harry III," he said. "The III puts a lot of 
pressure on a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Connick, one of the most versatile artists since the late Harry Nilsson, must 
know a little something about pressure. Still twentysomething, he has 
accumulated three Grammys, five Gold and three Platinum albums. He has released 
instrumental albums, jazz albums, big band albums, traditional classics and 
original material. He even had a hit in 1993 with Christmas music. So what's 
next for Connick, a punk album? 
</P>
<P>
 "Could be," the singer said during a recent phone interview. "At this point, 
I'm going to start doing the kind of music I grew up with. Right now, we're 
just gonna do this tour and take it day by day." 
</P>
<P>
 Connick, who calls his gig "The Funk Tour," has assembled an all-star band of 
players from his hometown of New Orleans, a place that seems to be in little 
danger of running out of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I dunno, but I've been trying to figure that one out. Somewhere back in 
history, people started playing, and it just spread and spread to where there 
are countless people playing, and there's always new stuff coming along. 
Personally, I just want to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Connick and the band will, among other things, be planning cuts off his newest 
release, "She," which is unlike anything he's done. "She" features a variety of 
styles from rock to swing to soulful ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Connick wrote all the music, and Ramsey McLean is to blame for the clever 
lyrics. But this was hardly your Laurel and Hardy or Astaire and Rogers or 
frank 'n' beans sort of association. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's writing poetry all the time," Connick said. "When I was doing this 
album, I called him and told him to send me some lyrics. They came in the mail 
so we don't really even collaborate." 
</P>
<P>
 Connick seems to be one of those guys for whom blue skies and green lights are 
the norm; everything he tries seems to work. He is always working; he has lots 
of fans, a fan club and dedicated parents, both of whom are lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 While growing up, Connick was encouraged by his parents, who also co-owned a 
record store, to pursue a career in music. Young Harry was good enough (or had 
the connections) to play at his father's swearing-in ceremony when he was 6. He 
made his recording debut before he was 10, then studied music in New York City 
at Hunter College and the New York School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, I knew what I wanted to do since I was 3 years old. I always wanted 
to be a musician," Connick said. "You have to practice, and it helps to meet 
the right people -- there's a lot of luck involved. Get as good as you can on 
your instrument so you'll have the right ammunition when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
 He's been involved in a number of film projects, including singing classics on 
the soundtrack of "When Harry Met Sally." Connick has a single in the latest 
Jim Carrey vehicle, "Mask." He's also acted in a couple of movies, including 
"Little Man Tate" with Jodie Foster and a World War II tale, "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I relished the experience, and I'd love to do it again," he said, referring 
to the story about the B-17 pilots' final bombing raid over Germany. "It was a 
new dimension for me. We got to meet all the original guys that flew the 
mission on the set. All of them were there and they were all in their 70s. 
Could you imagine being 18 or 20 and dropping all those bombs, blowing people 
away?" Details

</P>

 * WHEN: Tuesday, 7 p.m.

GOINGS ON; FIESTA WILL CELEBRATE SANTA BARBARA'S ROOTS; SPANISH MARKETS AND LOS 
LOBOS CONCERT WILL BRING FESTIVE FLAVOR TO CITY EVENT.

<P>
 From a morning party to an evening concert, Santa Barbara on Wednesday will 
kick off one of the city's biggest and most popular events of the year, Old 
Spanish Days Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
 This annual celebration of the city's Spanish roots, running through Aug. 7, 
will feature parades, Spanish markets, crafts booths and plenty of festive 
music and dancing. But more on the latter part of the festival next week. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, let's concentrate on Wednesday. Here's the lineup: 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's Downtown Organization will host the 22nd Annual Fiesta 
Breakfast from 9 to 11 a.m. along the 1100 block of State Street. There will be 
Spanish dancing, costumed guests and complimentary breakfast provided by 
Acapulco Restaurant. Call 962-2098 for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 About the time the breakfast ends, the two Spanish markets will open -- one at 
De La Guerra Plaza, the other at Las Positas and State streets (McKenzie Park). 
</P>
<P>
 Then at 5 p.m., Santa Barbara City College will be the site of the official 
opening ceremonies and carnival. Admission is free. Call 682-4713 for more 
information. The college is at 721 Cliff Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, the Grammy-winning band Los Lobos, with opening act Dave Alvin 
(formerly of the Blasters and X), will perform at Santa Barbara's Arlington 
Theatre beginning at 8 p.m. General admission is $25.50 and $19.50. Golden 
Circle tickets, which include a post-concert party with the musicians, are 
available for $50. Call 963-4408 or (800) 800-4408. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local headless guys make good. Santa Barbara's difficult-to-classify (new 
music? jazz-rock? rockin' polka?) band Headless Household is hosting a party 
tonight at the Sea Cove Jazz Bar & Grill to celebrate the release of its second 
album, "Inside/Outside USA." The party will begin about 8:30 p.m. with 
Household taking the stage for a couple of sets at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The new CD includes guest performances by Glen Phillips of Toad the Wet 
Sprocket; Nate Birkey of the Avant Gardeners; classical musician Gilles Apap, 
who has performed with the Santa Barbara Symphony; Ellen Turner of the band 
Dudley; and Jeff Elliott, who plays with Les McCann. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Cove is located at 1014 State St. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three suggestions before you attend the Greek Festival at Santa Barbara's Oak 
Park this weekend: Arrive early (if you want to get good parking), be prepared 
for crowds (it will undoubtedly be elbow to elbow at times). And plan to eat a 
lot (it will be difficult not to, with all the aromas in the air). There will 
be dancing, music and merchandise booths. The festival will run from 11 a.m. to 
7 p.m. both days. Admission is free. The park is located off the Mission Street 
exit of U.S. 101. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. and the Zydeco Zippers will perform Sunday at Santa Barbara's Alameda 
Park. The group will be on the bandstand stage from 3 to 4:30 p.m. The park is 
located at Micheltorena and Anacapa streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Music-ed out yet? No? Good, because Harry Connick Jr. and Funka Dunka will 
perform in concert Tuesday at the Santa Barbara Bowl, beginning at 7 p.m. 
Tickets are $40.50, $35.50, $30.50, and $28. Call Ticketmaster at 583-8700 or 
the Bowl at 568-2695. The Bowl is located at 1122 N. Milpas St. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead: David Benoit's scheduled Aug. 27 concert at The Gainey Vineyard 
in Santa Ynez has been canceled due to a scheduling conflict. In his place, 
acclaimed jazz saxophonist Dave Koz will perform beginning at 7:30 p.m. Koz's 
debut album was on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Chart for 25 weeks, and his 
single "Castle of Dreams" was the No. 1 jazz piece for five weeks. Concert 
tickets are $25. Call 688-0558. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets go on sale Tuesday for the fourth annual "A Celebration of Harvest," 
the popular food- and wine-tasting party put on by the Santa Barbara Vintner's 
Assn. The Oct. 15 event, at Dunn School in Los Olivos, will showcase 30 county 
wineries and the work of local chefs. Cost is $50. Call (800) 218-0881 or 
688-0881.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; EMILIO'S PROVES THE NAYSAYERS WRONG; TASTY AND ORIGINAL 
DISHES MAKE THIS ITALIAN CUISINE SOME OF THE BEST IN TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several years ago, when Emilio's Trattoria first opened on Cabrillo Boulevard 
across from the Santa Barbara Harbor, local pasta lovers were somewhat cynical. 
Over several weeks I heard mutterings on the theme of: "Just what we need, 
another contemporary Italian restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Pane e Vino and Piatti in Montecito hadn't been open terribly long then, and 
several of the old standbys, such as the venerable Arnoldi's, Mom's on the 
lower East Side, and Pino's in Goleta, were still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these are still around, but today, there's a good argument to be made 
that Emilio's has become the best Italian restaurant in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio's has recently plugged up the wall where the look-into-the-kitchen 
counter used to be, and added a full bar toward the rear. The bar is small -- 
five seats -- but it is a lovely addition, pouring good drinks and lending a 
slightly different feeling to a place that had offered just beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Kim Walker and Michael de Paolo have wisely been able to keep executive 
chef Peter Clements behind the stove for most of the restaurant's lifetime. The 
menu changes several times a year, and there are always enough tasty and 
original dishes to silence those earlier voices decrying another Italian 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Critical Companion, who was not among those earlier cynics, and who 
considers herself especially authoritative on Italian cuisine (for reasons that 
are not entirely clear), goes wild when she gets to tuck into the panzanella 
appetizer ($5.50). "Heaven," she says. This particular heaven is a plate of 
roughly chopped tomatoes (especially good this time of year), cucumbers, mint, 
celery and red onions. The whole is doused with red wine and balsamic vinegar 
and served on garlic toast, but it may be the extra touches -- the olive oil, 
the pistachios and the Gorgonzola that make this dish really special. 
</P>
<P>
 I could easily pass on the insalata Cesare ($4.95). I love Caesar salads, but 
find this version heavy-handed -- too much Parmesan and anchovy flavor. 
Heavy-handed is a characteristic that can be applied to the other salads as 
well. We could use a touch of subtlety here. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't leave the appetizer list until the bruschetta di capra e rughetta 
($6) has arrived. That's the garlic toast with a fonduta, puree of fresh 
tomatoes with baked, herbed goat cheese and arugula salad on the side. The 
fonduta and the goat cheese are a stirring, mouth-watering combination. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, I think, about nine pasta dishes on the menu. They make their own 
pasta and, although all the dishes are good, three of them are true stars. The 
CC goes crazy over the papardelle de aragosta ($14.95). The homemade pasta is 
stirred into a lobster broth, and with it Clements has mixed shaved fennel, 
lots of garlic, oven-dried tomatoes, lots of herbs and chunks of lobster 
(although I hear that the half Maine lobster that goes into the dish is now 
being served in one piece). Clemens really knows his stuff with regard to using 
herbs and seasoning, and in this dish he proves it. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite dish is unlike anything I've eaten before in Santa Barbara. It is 
a tortelli ($10.95), a longish pasta noodle, stuffed with roasted butternut 
squash, which has been sauteed in brown butter with large chunks of walnuts and 
sage and, of all things, amaretto cookie crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the fettucelle alla salmona ($11.95), a wonderful dish of 
pasta, apple-wood smoked salmon, some cream, red onion, agrodolce (Italy's 
version of sweet and sour) and gremolata (a garnish made of minced parsley, 
lemon peel and garlic.) The ingredients are mixed until all the flavors and 
textures come together. The taste is just a little bit smoked, a little bit 
sweet and a little bit sour. 
</P>
<P>
 The pizzas at Emilio's make me think of all the "designer" ones we've seen 
over the past few years. If I want one of those, I'll go to a designer pizza 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to meat, I'd opt for the cotoletta de maiale ($15.95). They've 
taken a thick, boneless pork loin chop, carved a pocket, added a compote of 
summer fruits and added a sauce of sun-dried cherries. If it were not for the 
aged, tough string beans on the side (a foible that ended up on several other 
dishes), this would have been a perfect dish. 
</P>
<P>
 A word about service: most of the time, the service at Emilio's is excellent, 
professional and cordial. But, as the CC carefully calculates, about one-third 
of the time you get one particular waiter, and then the situation deteriorates 
to indifference. Details

HIT-AND-RUN DEATH OF BOY, 12, STUNS SEAL BEACH; ACCIDENT: FRIENDS AS WELL AS 
STRANGERS MOURN WHERE STEVEN SCHNEIDER WAS STRUCK AS HE WAITED TO CROSS THE 
STREET.

 A small shrine of flowers and candles marked the spot where 12-year-old 
Christopher Schneider died in an auto accident this week that left neighbors 
and strangers grief-stricken Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the accident was caused by a Seal Beach woman, who was driving 
with a suspended license and is believed to have been intoxicated. Cynthia Kaye 
Lietz, 28, is to be arraigned in Municipal Court in Westminster this morning on 
felony charges, including reckless driving and manslaughter. She is being held 
in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuesday afternoon accident has taken an emotional toll on the military 
personnel who live alongside the Schneider family at the Seal Beach Naval 
Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family is in shock," Navy Lt. Karl Johnson said. "They understand that 
this was an accident, but it was an accident that didn't have to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors spent Wednesday attempting to comfort Christopher's 
father, Petty Officer 1st Class Dean Schneider, and his younger brothers. A 
navy chaplain also visited the family, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to help them through this tragedy," he said. "Everyone is 
showing their support. This is the kind of thing that brings people together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach Police Officers' Assn. placed a flower wreath at the site of 
the accident, just outside the weapons station at Seal Beach Boulevard and 
Bolsa Avenue. Others came to the site Wednesday to pray, cry and place flowers 
and candles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really a great kid -- very enjoyable," said Roland Kim, co-owner of 
Casey's Baseball Cards in Seal Beach, where Christopher regularly purchased 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and his friends would come into the store and look around," Kim said. 
"They were a nice group. He wasn't a smart-aleck or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 His death was a topic of conversation Wednesday at the local swimming pool and 
at a birthday party attended by some of Christopher's friends and classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just saddened by the whole thing," said Marilyn Bruce Hastings, a 
Seal Beach council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher was standing on the sidewalk about to walk his bike across Seal 
Beach Boulevard when a Mercedes driven by Lietz suddenly swerved out of its 
northbound lane, causing a Mitsubishi to jump the curb and strike the boy, 
police Sgt. Dean Zanone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that Christopher was going from his home to McGaugh Elementary 
School, which is across Seal Beach Boulevard. Christopher pushed the pedestrian 
walk button moments before he was struck, Zanone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lietz fled the scene of the accident but was arrested by police a few minutes 
later on Westminster Avenue near Bolsa Chica Road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that Lietz was under the influence of either alcohol or 
drugs. Police administered a drug test, but the result will not be known for 
several weeks, Zanone said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Department of Motor Vehicles records, Lietz's driver's license 
has been suspended since June, 1990, when she was involved in an auto accident 
and did not have insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 She was sent a second suspension notice in March after failing to appear in 
court to take care of a speeding ticket, according to the DMV. She was involved 
in another accident in Arcadia in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Mitsubishi, who was critically injured in the Tuesday 
accident, was hospitalized in fair condition Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schneiders have lived at the base since April, 1993, Johnson said. 
Christopher's mother lives in San Diego.

RUSSIAN BOY IS MADE AT HOME; THANKS TO AN ATTORNEY COLLEAGUE OF HIS NEW MOTHER, 
ADOPTION BEGUN IN ST. PETERSBURG IS FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney Bonnie Hiler has been in Judge Tully H. Seymour's courtroom many 
times before to represent parents in adoption hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Hiler and her husband, Rodney, walked into the courtroom for 
a special appearance of their own, a hearing to make final the adoption of an 
8-year-old from St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two officials from Russia, including the director of the orphanage where the 
shy boy known as Yura Sisov once lived, were on hand for the brief hearing. 
They watched with pleasure as he became the Hiler's legal child, happy for his 
new life, for which he has chosen a new name: Christopher Rodney Hiler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy he is in a good family," said Eleonora Petrukhina, head of 
a St. Petersburg government education committee that helps process adoptions. 
"He's surrounded with love and care." 
</P>
<P>
 The adoption came through the efforts of Bonnie Hiler's colleague, attorney 
Ronald L. Stoddart, who has helped more than 35 families throughout the United 
States adopt children from St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hiler mentioned to Stoddart one day last year that she and her husband 
were thinking of adopting a boy, his response was immediate: "I've got just the 
one for you." The Yorba Linda couple adopted their two young daughters, Noelle 
and Melody, in the United States and had never dreamed of adopting from abroad. 
But once they saw pictures and a videotape of Christopher, they knew they had 
found their son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard for these older kids," Bonnie Hiler said. "The older they 
get, the more unadoptable they're going to become, in Russia or anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 While her husband stayed home with their two daughters, Bonnie Hiler traveled 
to St. Petersburg in late October to meet Christopher, finish the Russian part 
of the adoption and bring him to his new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the second-grader has been learning English and has spent the 
summer playing with his sisters and learning to swim, his dimpled cheeks tanned 
by the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Because only Bonnie Hiler went to Russia, it was necessary for the couple to 
go through a readoption process in California to secure Christopher's right to 
someday become a U.S. citizen. Under U.S. immigration law, both parents are 
required to be in the child's native land for the adoption process to eliminate 
the need for a readoption in the United States, Stoddart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrilled with the finish of the readoption process Wednesday, Christopher and 
his family and friends, including a girl from his orphanage who is being 
adopted by a Mission Viejo family, headed for Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just wonderful," Bonnie Hiler said. "The finalization of an adoption 
is always a special time." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher never knew his biological parents in Russia. He was born seven 
weeks prematurely and spent the first 10 months of his life in a hospital. He 
spent his early years in what is known in St. Petersburg as a "baby house," an 
orphanage for children under the age of 4. He later moved to an orphanage for 
older children, under the care of director Ludmila Baranova, known as "Mom" to 
most of the 70 children who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddart's law office has long specialized in domestic adoptions, but it 
wasn't until 1992 and the new open relations with the former Soviet Union that 
he became involved in international adoptions, specifically in St. Petersburg. 
He started his work in St. Petersburg at the request of International Christian 
Adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrukhina was the first official he met in St. Petersburg, and she has since 
helped complete one adoption in 1992, 20 in 1993 (including one child from 
Kazakhstan) and 15 so far this year, including four sisters now living in 
California and a brother and two sisters in Connecticut. The children range in 
age from 5 months to 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Families typically select children from photographs and videotape, with 
accompanying medical and social history, Stoddart said. The total cost of 
adopting a child from Russia is about $15,000 and the process usually takes six 
to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign adoptions, however, remain controversial, and many in Russia would 
rather see the children stay in their native country no matter what, according 
to Petrukhina and Baranova. 
</P>
<P>
 But Petrukhina and Baranova said their opportunity to witness the good lives 
being led by the adopted children in the United States should help ensure that 
such adoptions continue. The two women met with more than 20 children from St. 
Petersburg orphanages during a reunion last weekend in Rolling Hills, and have 
learned much about the American adoption system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids need to have a foundation and this foundation is built in the 
family," said Petrukhina, speaking through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddart said he believes many in Russia will become more open to 
international adoptions with time and trust. He has helped form a nonprofit 
group, the Night-light Foundation, to help foster relations with Russia and 
provide humanitarian and other assistance to orphanages and shelters for 
homeless children in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we're going to be long-term partners in this has helped a lot," 
Stoddart said. "It just takes time."

FAMALARO HAIR, BLOOD, SALIVA SAMPLES SOUGHT; INVESTIGATION: ARIZONA PROSECUTORS 
SAY SUCH EVIDENCE WOULD HELP CASE IF AN AUTOPSY FINDS THAT DENISE HUBER WAS 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yavapai County prosecutors Wednesday demanded blood, saliva and hair samples 
from murder suspect John J. Famalaro -- evidence that could prove critical if a 
pending autopsy determines that Denise Huber was sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in a flurry of legal motions filed here was a defense request 
for an emergency hearing to bar Yavapai County sheriff's deputies from 
destroying handwritten notes made during their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for blood, saliva and hair samples are routine in murder cases. But 
Yavapai County Sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie Berra said Wednesday that the 
evidence could also prove key if Huber was sexually abused by her assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not ruled out the possibility that she was sexually assaulted," Berra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The samples are also needed for comparisons with evidence collected at 
Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home -- where authorities found tools and 
women's clothing that appeared to be stained with blood, and also found pubic 
hair, said Yavapai Deputy County Counsel Thomas B. Lindberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, then a 23-year-old waitress who lived with her parents in Newport 
Beach, vanished the night of June 3, 1991, after attending a rock concert in 
Los Angeles County. Her abandoned automobile was discovered on the Corona del 
Mar Freeway with a flat tire the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Her distraught parents organized what became a nationwide search, but her 
whereabouts remained a mystery until a paint manufacturer who had dealings with 
Famalaro became suspicious of a rental truck in his driveway and passed along 
those suspicions to Arizona authorities, who discovered Huber's body in a 
freezer that was installed and kept running in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal demands were filed in court by Arizona prosecutors, even though 
there are increasing indications that Famalaro's murder trial could be 
transferred to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Thomas K. Kelly, who is not licensed to practice in 
California, said Wednesday that he has begun looking for an attorney who could 
represent Famalaro in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he would prefer that the case be moved to California, since there 
are more stringent requirements for proving a death penalty case. Arizona's 
death penalty guidelines pose fewer problems for prosecutors, and Orange County 
deputy district attorneys have acknowledged that they need additional evidence 
if they are to pursue the death penalty against Famalaro under California law. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on jurisdiction in the case could come as early as today, officials 
said. Authorities are awaiting the results of critical DNA testing of blood 
discovered in a Laguna Hills storage facility Famalaro once rented -- and lived 
in -- to help solve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona law presumes a murder took place where the body was discovered. But 
even Arizona officials have a "gut" feeling that Huber's fatal bludgeoning took 
place a short distance from the Orange County freeway where her car had a flat 
on June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurisdiction debate is holding up forensic testing in the case -- and the 
Hubers recently blamed the debate for complicating the family's funeral plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a lack of jurisdiction, Arizona officials last week refused to allow an 
Orange County forensic pathologist to view the body. But Orange County 
prosecutors want a chance to conduct their own autopsy and examine Huber's 
remains to help them prepare for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources say it is likely that the body will be released as 
early as today, paving the way for a possible examination by Orange County 
pathologist Richard Fukumoto before Huber is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Also awaiting testing are pieces of lumber believed to have been used in the 
Laguna Hills storage facility to enclose a second, upright refrigerator-freezer 
that authorities have also seized from Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent search of the Laguna Hills warehouse, Costa Mesa police found 
blood in the area where the refrigerator-freezer had been installed, but tests 
conducted by Arizona authorities found no traces of blood in the refrigerator, 
which Famalaro had moved into the kitchen of the Prescott County Club home 
where he was living until his arrest two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of those tests results, Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Berra said 
Wednesday that the refrigerator might not have been used to store Huber's body. 
But other law enforcement sources say the theory has not been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the uncertainty over jurisdiction, authorities are proceeding as if 
Famalaro's trial on charges of killing Huber will be held in Yavapai County, 
where her nude, handcuffed body was discovered in Famalaro's freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense also filed court records waiving Famalaro's personal appearance at 
his post-indictment arraignment -- scheduled for Monday -- and entered a 
written plea of not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder, and a second 
charge of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ryder rental truck that Famalaro rented to move his personal belongings -- 
and the freezer containing Huber's body -- from Orange County to Arizona was 
never returned, and the rental company reported it stolen. It was spotted in 
the driveway of Famalaro's home. An electrical cord had been run from the 
freezer, out the back of the truck, to an outlet at the home of Famalaro's 
mother, who lives in the house next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, defense attorneys informed county officials that a private 
medical examiner they hired had completed an independent examination of Denise 
Huber's remains at the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kelly declined to comment on the findings of Dr. H. H. 
Karnitschnig, the private medical examiner, saying that his report would be 
prepared in the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he wants access to the handwritten notes of the Yavapai sheriff's 
deputies, because he fears that officers might have been improperly influenced 
in preparing their formal reports by public comments made by Famalaro's former 
defense attorney, Lawrence W. Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz last week announced his intention to challenge repeated searches of 
Famalaro's home. Katz was later dismissed from the case in favor of Kelly, but 
not before Katz told reporters that he would fight to invalidate searches of 
his client's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that the (deputies) did anything wrong," Kelly said Wednesday. 
"But it is possible that they read articles about Katz's statements and 
considered those when preparing their reports."

STATE TO REVOKE MEDICAL LICENSE OF 'DR. DEATH'; EUTHANASIA: JACK KEVORKIAN 
GAINED WORLDWIDE NOTE FOR HELPING 20 PEOPLE, INCLUDING COSTA MESA MAN, END 
LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California medical license of Jack Kevorkian, who acquired an 
international reputation and the moniker "Dr. Death" for assisting in 20 
suicides, including that of a Costa Mesa man, will be permanently revoked as of 
midnight Friday, the state attorney general's office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California, which suspended Kevorkian's license in April, 
1993, issued its decision June 29, effective a month later. Details of the 
ruling were not made public until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday, Kevorkian has only "a tiny window of opportunity" to reclaim his 
license, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Thomas Lazar. If he wishes to appeal, he has 30 
days to file suit in Superior Court, but isn't expected to do so, and even if 
he does, his chances for reinstatement are poor, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's finished. The effect of the medical board's decision was essentially to 
kick Kevorkian out of the world of medicine," said the San Diego-based 
prosecutor who has argued the state's case at several hearings before an 
administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, whose medical license was suspended in his home state of Michigan 
in 1991, is appealing a ruling by a Michigan court that seeks to have the 
65-year-old former pathologist tried on murder charges. California was the only 
other state where he held a medical license. 
</P>
<P>
 Having obtained his California license in 1957, Kevorkian worked at two 
hospitals in Long Beach from 1979 to 1982. He lives in Troy, Mich., near where 
each of the assisted suicides has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian could not be reached for comment Wednesday, and his Michigan-based 
attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, declined to comment. But last year, after California 
suspended Kevorkian's license, Fieger said Kevorkian had no intention of 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Fieger said that Kevorkian "couldn't care less" about losing his 
California license and "will go on assisting people commit suicide. He dares 
(California) to come catch him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian is accused of playing a role in five additional suicides since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, state officials presented evidence showing that Kevorkian had 
assisted in the suicides of a San Diego County woman suffering from terminal 
cancer and a Costa Mesa man, whose best friend argued that he was merely 
depressed over the death of his mother and not seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathon Grenz of Costa Mesa incurred cancer in 1992, causing doctors to 
remove his voice box and tongue. But at the time he committed suicide with 
Kevorkian's help, he had recovered from the cancer and was grieving over the 
loss of his mother, according to the court testimony of Newport Beach real 
estate agent Linda Healy. 
</P>
<P>
 Grenz, 44, was "depressed from his surgery, overwhelmed with grief over the 
loss of his mother and was never given the opportunity to grieve over his 
losses," testified Healy, who had worked with Grenz at an Orange County real 
estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Ruwart, 40, of Cardiff by the Sea, whose duodenal cancer had invaded 
her small intestine and ovaries with numerous tumors, died in a Waterford, 
Mich., home in 1993 with Kevorkian by her side. It was Ruwart's death that 
prompted the Michigan Legislature to pass a law banning assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite what Lazar called the "compelling" nature of the two cases 
involving California residents, the state's strongest evidence in revoking the 
license involved five suicides that had no connection to California and which 
the board found to be particularly egregious breaches of medical ethics, Lazar 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care if they happened on the moon," he added. "We merely used them 
to show that he was unfit to practice medicine in California and won't ever 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 While a chapter may have closed in California, Kevorkian's troubles in 
Michigan may eventually place him behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned the state law designed to 
stop Kevorkian's practice of assisted suicide but ordered murder charges 
reinstated against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Kevorkian was licensed to practice medicine in only two states, he is 
"no longer Dr. Kevorkian," Lazar said. "He's Mr. Kevorkian. He's no different 
from an auto mechanic who can offer carbon-monoxide death by inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Friday, you won't have to worry about Jack Kevorkian in California ever 
again. What Michigan does is up to Michigan, but speaking only for California, 
he's done here . . . finished . . . forever."

PANEL BACKS HUNTINGTON MARINA LEASE; RECREATION: WHEN PACT WAS PROPOSED 3 YEARS 
AGO, CRITICISMS AROSE OVER MAINTENANCE, COMPANY'S TIES TO SUPERVISOR'S SON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The operator of the Sunset Marine Park in Huntington Harbour tentatively won a 
new 35-year lease extension Wednesday without competitive bidding and the 
controversy that occurred when the extension was proposed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Harbors, Beaches and Parks Commission voted 3 to 2 to offer the 
new contract to Goldrich and Kest Inc., the Culver City firm that has operated 
the marina since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 That offer still faces approval by the County Board of Supervisors, which is 
expected to vote in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, G & K's bid for a lease extension died when marina tenants 
organized to complain that maintenance there was abysmal. But the proposal this 
time has brought little objection. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we had problems with maintenance," Commissioner Ed Conway said 
Wednesday. "But I'm really glad to hear from the public that they're happier 
with them. We had a full house on this issue last time." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's meeting was sparsely attended, mostly by supporters of G & K. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat owner Sam Gladney said that G & K had done such a good job maintaining 
the marina that their boat owner meetings had become social events because 
there was nothing to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new contract, G & K must put up a $100,000 security deposit that 
would be tapped if the company's maintenance were found lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 But two of the commissioners still disapproved of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't trust them," Commissioner Sally White said. Outside the meeting, 
Commissioner Larry Luera expressed similar reservations, saying the company has 
"a history of poor maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the contract, which would replace the current lease set to 
expire in 1999, the county would spend $4.4 million on improvements to the 
marina, including an interpretive kiosk, landscaping and trails. It also would 
forgive $200,000 owed by the management company in back rent. In exchange, G & 
K would spend $5.5 million of its own money to, among other things, expand the 
number of boat slips from 276 to 341, increase dry boat storage from 97 to 241 
spaces and increase the number of parking spaces from 190 to 280. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new lease comes despite a county policy stating that, whenever 
feasible, such contracts should be allowed to expire and then be put out for 
competitive bids. Bob Fisher, director of the Harbors, Beaches and Parks 
Department, said Wednesday that several factors make this an acceptable 
exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he said, a larger slice of income to the county provided by the lease 
would more than double the annual revenue from the marina over the next several 
decades. The county will get a flat rent of $375,000 per year plus 25% to 35% 
of gross receipts, compared to 20% to 25% of gross receipts now received. 
</P>
<P>
 And second, he said, the early renegotiation of the lease will allow the 
county to take advantage of a low-interest state loan (4.3% to 4.5%) with which 
to pay for the needed improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck West, director of real estate for Orange County, said given the sizable 
investment byG & K, it was unlikely that many other companies would have bid 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not something where you'd have 100 bidding, even if you had opened 
up the bidding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when an attempt to extend G & K's lease was shelved, the 
objections involved two major issues. First, critics were angered by the fact 
that the son of County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, whose district includes 
the marina, had worked as a lobbyist for G & K. In addition, critics also said 
G & K's maintenance record was abysmal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fisher, those problems have now been solved. The supervisor's 
son, Lee E. Wieder, is no longer involved, he said. And routine maintenance of 
the boat facility has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've worked hard and feel that the problems have been solved," Fisher said 
before Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Fisher said, the commission received only two letters about the 
proposed lease extension, and both were supportive. In one, a boat owner said 
that G & K "has made a real commitment in the last six years to improve the 
Marina in every way. . . . The maintenance has improved steadily and the 
restrooms are spotless." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, however, has withdrawn their opposition to the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Blank, president of a Fountain Valley recreational vehicle association 
who has for many years lobbied for more public access to regional parks, 
described the proposed lease as a bad deal for everyone concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a giveaway," she said, adding that the county could get a better deal 
financially by putting the contract out to bid.

SIMPSON EXPERTS DECLINE DNA TEST; COURTS: DEFENSE ATTORNEY ROBERT L. SHAPIRO 
SAYS GUIDELINES ARE TOO RESTRICTIVE. PROCEDURE IS TO BEGIN THIS MORNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After an emergency court hearing Wednesday, O.J. Simpson's defense team 
reversed field and told a judge that their experts will not participate in DNA 
testing of blood sample evidence because the conditions being placed on them 
were too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guidelines are totally unmanageable," Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead 
lawyer, said as the hastily called hearing came to an end. "We will not be 
participating." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito abruptly scheduled the court 
session after he received a letter from Dr. Robin Cotton, director of the 
Cellmark Diagnostics laboratory in Germantown, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing is scheduled to begin at Cellmark at 9 a.m. EDT today on critical 
physical evidence in the murder case against the former football star, who is 
accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing, like all the others in the case, was televised live in 
Los Angeles, and Shapiro asserted that his client's due process rights would be 
violated unless his experts could play a bigger role in the testing process. 
</P>
<P>
 The gravity of the issue was reflected by the presence of nine lawyers in the 
courtroom -- six for the defense and three for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing ends one skirmish, but as the case progresses, the DNA war 
is expected to have many more battles, including the admissibility of test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Ito had ruled that defense expert Dr. Edward Blake would be allowed 
to "cut" 10% of blood samples found outside the Brentwood condominium where the 
killings occurred, as well as samples taken from Simpson's estate and Ford 
Bronco two miles away. Shapiro said at the time that cutting was a critical 
phase in the DNA analysis process, where errors often occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense wants to preserve 10% of the samples so that it can perform its 
own tests. Under California law, the defense is allowed to perform its own 
tests if the sample is large enough to be divided. It is not clear yet whether 
there will be a large enough sample for such a division, and on Monday Ito 
ordered that the 10% cuttings be set aside pending further rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor, had agreed Monday to 
allow Blake to perform the cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, Ito said that he had received a letter from Cotton 
objecting to his ruling. "Our laboratory policies for visitors and our 
evidence-handling procedures preclude anyone other than the appropriate 
Cellmark staff from doing any analysis or procedures in our laboratory," Cotton 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly prefer that Dr. Blake and/or Dr. (Henry) Lee observe the cutting 
as it is made by the Cellmark staff member who is handling the case. This 
procedure presents no break in our chain of custody, and avoids the necessity 
of a transfer of evidence custody and control to Dr. Blake and/or Dr. Lee." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said that after reading Cotton's letter, she realized that she had been 
unaware of all the Cellmark procedures and had overstepped her bounds. She said 
she could understand Cotton's concerns. She emphasized that Cellmark was an 
independent laboratory, not under the control of the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro retorted that it would be unfair to limit the defense experts to 
simply observing what the Cellmark personnel do. "I talked to Dr. Lee at length 
yesterday and he told me it would be an exercise in futility," the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Observing the tests might limit the defense's ability to later contest the 
accuracy of Cellmark's work when the case is before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro had maintained that all the defense wanted was to get a small piece of 
the blood samples for independent testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito pointed out Wednesday that Blake was still welcome to perform the cutting 
-- he just had to use Cellmark's equipment and personnel to assist him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro declined the judge's offer, insisting that Blake be allowed to do 
the cuttings using his own assistants and his own machinery rather than 
Cellmark's. "Although the (prosecution) has great faith in this lab, we have 
some questions about it," an apparent reference to testing errors made by 
Cellmark.  
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern University criminal law professor Myrna Raeder said the defense 
had been forced to rethink its original request once it became apparent that 
the role of its experts would be limited. "The defense doesn't want to buy into 
a protocol that it may want to challenge at trial." 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was clear that the defense still "wants the ability to test 
samples on its own without anybody looking over its shoulder." However, it is 
not clear whether eight blood samples in question are large enough for such 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark maintains that the most sophisticated DNA test -- called RFLP -- 
normally destroys 90% of a sample and if that test is inconclusive, the 
prosecution would need the rest for a retest. 
</P>
<P>
 The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday, on a defense motion that 
the prosecution be required to turn over information that might exonerate 
Simpson. Prosecutors filed their response to the motion late Wednesday, saying 
they had complied with "the overwhelming majority of defense requests," but 
could not comply with others for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that the Los Angeles Police Department "is diligently 
pursuing investigative leads submitted by the public" but that so far "none of 
the leads have resulted in the development of any suspect other than the 
defendant, Orenthal James Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, attorneys for Goldman's mother, Sharon Rufo, announced 
that she has filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson, charging that Simpson 
murdered Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrongful death suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on July 
20, seeks unspecified damages for the loss of Goldman's "companionship, 
society, comfort, attention . . . and support." 
</P>
<P>
 Rufo and Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, divorced in 1974 and Goldman grew up 
with his father. Rufo lives in St. Louis, Mo., and has said she last saw her 
son seven years ago and last spoke to him two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved her son . . . and there's no way of bringing him back," said 
Michael Brewer, Rufo's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview, Fred Goldman said he had not been in contact with his 
ex-wife. "I don't know anything about it other than what I've heard on the 
news. But it doesn't surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer said Fred Goldman has, through his attorney, indicated that he does not 
want to join the complaint. He will nonetheless be a technical party to the 
proceedings because under California law, a wrongful death suit is brought on 
behalf of all heirs. As a procedural matter, Fred Goldman is named as a 
defendant in the case, simply as a way of bringing him into the case.

CITY IS SLOW TO REFORM FINANCES, PANEL SAYS; GOVERNMENT: EXECUTIVES GAVE 
RIORDAN AND CITY COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS AND CLAIM THAT NOT ENOUGH HAVE BEEN 
ADOPTED. MAYOR'S AIDE CALLS THE ASSESSMENT HARSH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of corporate executives said Wednesday that Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan and City Council members have not adopted enough of the panel's 
recommended reforms of the city's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's chairman said he would give the elected officials only a C-plus 
grade for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The critiques come from the mayor's Special Committee on Fiscal 
Administration, which earlier this year recommended turning more government 
services over to private companies and reducing payments to employee pension 
funds, among other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee Wednesday praised Riordan and council members for some of their 
actions -- beefing up the Police Department's budget, plugging a $200-million 
deficit and not increasing taxes. But the group said it "regrets very much" 
that more has not been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Michael E. Tennenbaum, senior managing partner at the 
Bears, Stearns & Co. stock brokerage, had harsher words for elected officials 
in an interview. "The mayor together with the City Council failed to do what 
they needed to do," he said, adding that the city's finances are run "worse 
than a kindergarten PTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ouchi, recently appointed Riordan's chief of staff, said he accepts the 
criticism but considers the C-plus grade harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in the business of assigning grades much longer than Mr. 
Tennenbaum," said Ouchi, a professor of business management at UCLA. "That is 
the grade of a rookie professor who is trying to show how tough he is. I think 
that's what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, the committee outlined dozens of steps officials should take 
to improve the city's finances. Riordan incorporated many of those suggestions 
in his budget proposal. The council adopted some but rejected others when it 
approved the budget in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the changes advocated by the committee face substantial opposi-tion 
from city employee unions and others. The recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing expenditures or increasing revenue at three semi-independent city 
departments -- water and power, harbor and airports. The DWP, in particular, 
can be made more efficient by reducing its staff dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility's managers say they believe staff cuts are possible, but they warn 
that serious reductions could reduce the city's ability to provide water and 
electric service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cutting the amount the city pays into employee pension systems, to produce a 
$70-million annual savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions say the cuts will threaten pension benefits, something committee 
members deny. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boosting street resurfacing dramatically to prevent deterioration and to 
"catch up for years of neglect." The city will spend $47 million in the current 
year, and elected officials said they could not afford the $70 million to $80 
million the panel recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forming a single unit to track and collect all the city's bills as 
recommended in a 1991 audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi noted that Riordan has not given up on most of the committee's 
recommendations. He said that changes in pension contributions cannot be 
accomplished until they are better explained to employees and retirees. He 
noted that consultants are studying ways to charge more of the city's expenses 
to the Harbor Department, another committee recommendation. And he said initial 
plans for some private contracting are still being laid. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent appointment of Bill McCarley to head the DWP also indicates the 
mayor's interest in streamlining that organization, Ouchi said. McCarley was 
Ouchi's predecessor as chief of staff.

COUNCIL BACKS CIVILIANS ON LAPD RIGHTS PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a delay of more than two years, the Los Angeles City Council on 
Wednesday finally decided to put civilians on police disciplinary boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is designed to build public confidence in the department's internal 
disciplinary process and to advance the reform agenda put forth in 1991 by the 
Christopher Commission after the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by Los 
Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's order to draft an ordinance changing the makeup of the Los 
Angeles Police Department Boards of Rights is another milestone in the 
implementation of Charter Amendment F, the sweeping police reform initiative 
approved by voters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boards of Rights, which hear cases of alleged police misconduct, now are 
composed of three police officers of the rank of captain or above. Under the 
measure being drafted for the council, one officer would be replaced by a 
civilian, drawn from a pool of 48 approved by the Police Commission on Tuesday. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in the pool are Avis Ridley-Thomas, whose husband, Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, is a frequent critic of the Police Department, and attorney Carl 
Douglas, whose law partner, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., recently won a $4.5-million 
award for a teen-age girl molested by an LAPD officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the list are Ethics Commissioner Cynthia Telles and former Police 
Commissioners Ann Reiss Lane and Anthony De Los Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said that considering the average number of misconduct cases, 
most people on the list can expect to be called to serve on a board once or 
twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance being drafted, an officer facing a board hearing would be 
given the names of three people drawn from the list. The officer would have the 
right to reject one of the three and the department would have the right to 
reject another. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of those on the civilian list have legal backgrounds, the Police 
Commission will provide the necessary training for those who do not, according 
to Police Commissioner Deirdre Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards examine personnel records, listen to sworn testimony, rule on the 
admissibility of that testimony, determine the guilt or innocence of the 
accused and recommend disciplinary actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 100 recommendations of the Christopher Commission -- named for 
its co-chairman, Warren Christopher, who is now U.S. secretary of state -- have 
become the guiding document of the city's police reform advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Though dozens of the measures recommended by the commission have been stalled 
by budget shortfalls, bureaucratic snafus, stalled negotiations and other 
problems, observers have seen a growing impetus in the push for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to change the Boards of Rights sailed through the council 
Wednesday on an 11-1 vote. Councilman Hal Bernson cast the dissenting vote.

POLITICAL ACTIVIST ZINZUN AWARDED $512,500 TO SETTLE SUIT WITH CITY; POLICE: 
FORMER PASADENA CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATE CLAIMED HE WAS DEFAMED BY LAPD OFFICIAL 
WHO RELEASED INFORMATION ABOUT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Activist Michael Zinzun won $512,500 Wednesday from the city of Los Angeles to 
settle his claim that he was defamed and lost a bid for the Pasadena City 
Council when a top Los Angeles Police Department official improperly released 
information about him. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment ends a 5-year-old case in which Zinzun said he was defamed by 
former Assistant Police Chief Robert Vernon, who used an LAPD computer to 
obtain information about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinzun, chairman of a group called the Coalition Against Police Abuse, had 
contended that the release of the information was particularly damaging because 
it was described in news accounts as having come from the department's 
Anti-Terrorist Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, unanimously approved by the City Council, is the third major legal 
victory for Zinzun. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the LAPD disbanded its Public Disorder Intelligence Division after a 
suit by Zinzun and others. That case also resulted in a $1.8-million payment in 
which Zinzun said he shared. He later won a $1.2-million settlement from 
Pasadena over a 1986 encounter with police that left him blind in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinzun noted that those cases were pending while he made other unsuccessful 
attempts at elected office. "If I need any more money, I will just run for 
office again," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes the approval of the latest cash award will encourage the 
Police Department to keep its hands out of political activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this will be a strong message that if police continue to maintain an 
us-against-them attitude, then the city will continue to pay the bill," Zinzun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon had maintained at the trial that he only used the department's computer 
to obtain the newspaper articles and then gave them to his neighbor, former 
Pasadena Mayor John Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinzun said the damage had been done when The Times and other publications 
reported that the information was from the Police Department's Anti-Terrorist 
Division. "It made people say, 'We are not going to vote for a terrorist.' It 
created suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 Later reports in The Times corrected the initial account and reported that 
Vernon had only retrieved newspaper clippings from a department computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinzun, a onetime Black Panther, said the payment from the city "doesn't make 
up for the fact that they chose to violate my civil rights in the middle of my 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he does not know how much of his award will go to his attorneys, but 
he will use the remainder to help support his family and bolster causes in 
which he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinzun has been an activist on several issues including police use of force 
and the creation of truces between rival gangs. He has not run for office since 
his 1989 loss to Chris Holden in the Pasadena race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zinzun lawsuit took a tortuous route to its final resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 A settlement had been reached before trial that would have paid him $450,000, 
but that was rejected by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in 1991 awarded a $3.8-million verdict against the city and added 
$10,000 in punitive damages against Vernon. Some jurors said they were 
distrustful of Vernon, then the department's No. 2 man, and of former Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates, who also testified in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge overturned that decision, saying it lacked merit. But settlement 
negotiations were reopened when Zinzun appealed.  
</P>
<P>
 The agreement reached Wednesday clears Vernon of liability. He could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Mary Thornton House said the city agreed to the payment to 
avoid the possibility of an even larger loss if Zinzun's appeal succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no guarantees as to the outcome of a second trial if the plaintiff 
prevailed on appeal, especially with knowledge that one jury already went for a 
multimillion verdict," House said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anne Richardson, one of Zinzun's attorneys, criticized the City Council 
for rejecting the smaller settlement at the start of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have saved all the money they spent in trying the case if they had 
settled back then," Richardson said. "They clearly have a very difficult time 
in seeing what's best for all concerned and fail to accept responsibility."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTHEAST L.A. COUNTY; 
FOUR SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN FREEWAY GRAFFITI WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dawn raid of several homes in Southeast Los Angeles County ended Wednesday 
with the arrest of a woman and three teen-agers suspected of participating in a 
mid-May graffiti war along the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, police arrested eight suspects in connection with the freeway 
battle, which caused nearly $100,000 in damages.As many as 60 suspected taggers 
may be charged before the case is completed, said Long Beach Police Officer 
Barry Fowks, who along with his brother and partner, Officer Bob Fowks, is 
heading the multi-agency investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested Wednesday were Jeremy Hampton and Shawn Allen Scarborough, both 18, 
and Jennifer Dean, 21, all of La Mirada, and a 17-year-old Whittier boy whose 
name was withheld because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 The four are scheduled for arraignment today in Long Beach. They face charges 
of conspiracy and graffiti vandalism.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIRE CONTRACTING PLAN WON'T BE ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to ask voters in November whether the city should contract for fire 
services with the Orange County Fire Department got nowhere with the City 
Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members discussed the proposal Tuesday but did not take a vote, 
effectively killing Councilman Craig Schweisinger's suggestion to let voters 
decide if the city's Fire Department should be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger said that residents have urged the city to contract with the 
county to save money. He said that preliminary studies indicate the city could 
save about $2 million a year by disbanding its Fire Department, which has a 
$7-million budget for fiscal year 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is the time to do it," said Councilman Tony Lam, citing 
the ongoing reorganization of the 65-member department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council later approved filling three new management positions in the Fire 
Department. An assistant fire chief and two division chiefs will be hired next 
month or in early September, Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said that applicants were interviewed earlier this month. One of the 
finalists for assistant fire chief is a battalion chief in the department, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this (reorganization) is given a chance to work," DeMonaco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has created a 10-member Finance Review Committee that is looking 
into ways the city could provide fire protection services at less cost. Among 
the options being considered is contracting with the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a massive reworking of our fire services," Councilwoman Charmayne S. 
Bohman said. "We have to look at all alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Review Committee also will consider privatizing fire services and 
combining services with other cities, she said.

 Acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley said that there had been preliminary 
talks with Garden Grove officials to consolidate fire services but reorganizing 
the Fire Department has been his main concern over the past several months.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD ASKED 
TO EXPLAIN DELAY ON NEW ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to reports of problems with plans for a new police academy, a City 
Council member introduced a motion Wednesday demanding that the department 
explain the reasons for any delay, and a top mayoral aide met with Police 
Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "A delay in the renovation of the Westside facility is very disturbing," 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, a member of the Public Safety Committee, said in a 
motion introduced Wednesday.She asked that department officials be ordered to 
give a full report at the next Public Safety Committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting of the Police Commission Tuesday, Police Department officials 
disclosed that final move-in at the new police academy will not take place 
until June, 1997, at least one year later than originally anticipated. Police 
commissioners were outraged, accusing department staffers of misleading them 
and failing to update them about problems with the highly touted Westside 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Violante, deputy mayor for public safety, met privately with Police 
Department leaders Wednesday afternoon and said that he came away satisfied 
that even with any delays, the project will not set back the mayor's police 
buildup plan. It also will save the city more than $40 million and several 
years compared to any other site that had been in contention, Violante said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; 
$200-MILLION AUTO RACING, RESEARCH CENTER PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The founder and promoter of the Long Beach Grand Prix, the city's largest 
revenue-producing yearly event, has unveiled a plan to build a $200-million 
auto racetrack and research complex at the Long Beach-Signal Hill border. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher R. Pook received an enthusiastic response from council members of 
both cities, who voted to study the proposal, called Transwest Park.The plan 
would bring a 1 1/4-mile oval racetrack, 110 acres of automotive research and 
development facilities and a hotel to an area now dotted by oil rigs and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The track would host four major auto races a year, some smaller events such as 
vintage car shows, and provide a test site for the research center. Pook said 
he hopes to lure former aerospace engineers to develop safer cars, stronger 
body compounds and cleaner fuels, and conduct other automotive research 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook said the complex would create 13,000 permanent jobs and bring more than 
$1 billion a year to the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, Pook founded the Long Beach Grand Prix, which attracts more than 
200,000 racing fans each year and generates $40 million to $60 million for the 
local economy.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SOUND WALL APPEAL FALLS ON DEAF EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A philosophical question: If a train hurtles by your home and there's no city 
official there to hear it, does it really make a sound? 
</P>
<P>
 To Karen Winkle and her Northfield Avenue neighbors, who live as close as 60 
feet from the railroad tracks, the answer is a resounding yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkle has been unsuccessful in her efforts for the past year to get the city 
of Anaheim to help pay for a sound wall. The wall would protect her 
neighborhood from the daily clatter of as many as 50 passing trains -- which 
whiz by at 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who come to my house . . . they duck under the table because they 
think it's an earthquake," said Winkle, who led a petition drive last year to 
get a sound wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Her cause received a boost this month when Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar) 
expressed his "shock" at the city's refusal to help purchase a sound wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim pointed out that the Orange County Transportation Authority will provide 
up to $400,000 in non-construction costs toward the wall, and that the 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad will donate the right of way to build the 
sound buffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed that the city of Anaheim found itself unable to show 
similar generosity to its own citizens," Kim said in a July letter. "I hope the 
city will reconsider its decision." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly replied that the city lacks the resources to build 
a sound wall, which would cost from $1.5 million to $3 million. Even if the 
city could afford the wall, Daly said, it should be the responsibility of the 
railroad -- not the city -- to mitigate train noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, he (Kim) feels the city has the financial means to solve a 
problem that is the direct result of the railroad line," said Daly, who has 
toured the noise-plagued neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly added that Santa Fe's right-of-way "gift" didn't "cost them a nickel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities (historically) have not been the lead agency for constructing sound 
walls for the railroad," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the chances of the railroad company paying for the wall are remote, 
Daly pointed out. Federal law exempts the railroad from addressing 
environmental impacts caused by train traffic on a community, Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Winkle and neighbors remain frustrated that the trains still run.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BELLFLOWER; LAW LETS 
CITY SUE PARENTS FOR CURFEW VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of children who repeatedly violate Bellflower's 10 p.m. curfew and 
other city laws can be sued for up to $2,500 under an ordinance adopted by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which takes effect on Monday, is an effort to reduce late-night 
gang activity and targets the parents of habitual offenders, said Mike Egan, 
deputy city administrator."The parents are held accountable for failing to 
control the child," Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although intended to curb curfew violations, the law will also be used against 
the parents of children who break other city laws, including those that deal 
with graffiti, alcohol and drug possession and other misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city will have the authority to sue parents after the first 
violation, in most cases officials will not take legal action until a third 
offense, Egan said. Parents will receive a warning letter after the first 
citation. Municipal Court judges will determine the amount of damages parents 
must pay the city in each case. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of five City Council members opposed the measure when it was adopted 
earlier this month.

CHILDREN TRANSFORM QUAKE FEARS INTO ART AT WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With orange and brown markers, 8-year-old Cindy Llamas drew a picture of all 
the members of her family in their house. Her aunt is screaming, her uncle is 
mad, and one cousin is crying.Cindy's father is trying to kick down the door 
because they are locked in. Cindy and her big brother Humberto just watch. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the images Cindy recalled when she was asked to draw her impressions 
of the Jan. 17 quake in an art workshop at the Boys & Girls Club of San 
Fernando Valley in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 To help children between 6 and 17 overcome their fears of things that go bump 
in the night and measure 6.8, the Los Angeles County Department of Mental 
Health created art workshops through its disaster recovery program, Project 
REBOUND. Children are encouraged to express their anxieties through art, some 
of which will be used to make a calendar for next year commemorating the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids have a lot of apprehensions about the quake, especially 
with all the aftershocks," said Stephanie Angel, a Project REBOUND counselor. 
Angel said she has found that the children draw not only images of cracked 
buildings, but also catastrophes that could have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Lopez drew himself reaching for his dog to keep himself from falling 
into a chasm that opened up underneath him. "I imagined that hole," Guillermo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outreach coordinator Adam Desantis said that although many drawings are of 
frightening experiences, some children depict happy families and neighbors 
working together to clean up damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Desantis said he encourages the children to "express their feelings in their 
own language." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is free at the Boys & Girls Club this week. Other services from 
counseling to hot lines are available for youths as well as adults. Call (800)

CITY COUNCIL URGES MTA TO BRING BACK MONTHLY BUS PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council Wednesday called on the county transit agency to 
resume issuing monthly bus passes for the general public, saying the decision 
creates a "severe hardship" for some riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to resume providing general monthly bus passes will pose a severe 
hardship on many of Los Angeles' most disadvantaged residents who rely 
completely on public transit," Councilwoman Rita Walters said in her motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority recently stopped selling the $42 
passes because Chief Executive Officer Frank White said they were a money-loser 
and open to abuse. The passes were easily counterfeited, and some pass-holders 
abused the program by boarding buses 100 times a month, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board also decided to stop selling special passes for college 
students. Student passes will be available only for pupils at elementary and 
high schools and may be used only during weekdays. The MTA also raised the 
regular bus fare from $1.10 to $1.35 effective Sept. 1. But riders can still 
purchase 90-cent tokens at some stores.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; SHELTER GIVES 60-DAY LEASE 
ON A NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For that small minority who try to wriggle their way out from under the rules 
of the house, the words can be blunt and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about us," Cynthia Caughey or one of her four case managers at the 
Women's Care Cottage might say. "This is about you. You have 60 days to get 
your life together." 
</P>
<P>
 With that clarifying deadline -- a two-month respite from the streets -- 
residents of the North Hollywood shelter for homeless women and their children 
are given a chance to find a place to live, maybe a job and a better life for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some folks need that 60 days," said Caughey, the shelter's executive 
director. "They can really pull it together." 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of the shelter residents leave with permanent housing and half with 
jobs. But a few don't make it, and after two months are in other shelters or 
back on the streets.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know you're not going to save the world," Caughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 15 beds and a daytime drop-in center that handles more than 6,000 visits 
a year -- up from 2,000 only two years ago -- the Women's Care Cottage is the 
only shelter in the San Fernando Valley geared specifically to helping homeless 
women and their children. It is also one of several agencies that won a 1994 
Los Angeles Times Community Partnership Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter backers are trying to raise $375,000 to finance a move for the drop-in 
center into a larger facility to handle heavy demand -- the result of a poor 
economy and because the center has become more widely known. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women who come to the shelter have been beaten or sexually abused. They 
may have left their husbands, but then found that, with a lower earning 
potential than most men, they were barely getting by. Any major financial 
crisis -- such as one of the children getting sick -- may have pushed them onto 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Living out of a car, on the streets or in a shelter can be much more 
frightening for a woman than a man, Caughey said. But the problem is not as 
quickly recognized because a woman with children on the streets may not appear 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women will hide the fact that they are homeless -- even from their 
friends -- spending their days browsing at department stores and getting a 
shower at the YMCA, Caughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference we see between the clients we see and us is that we have 
someone to go to," she said. "They've had to leave all their support systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they may find their way to the Women's Care Cottage day drop-in 
center, where some temporary housing may be found, such as a voucher for a 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most are depressed, kind of in shock," Caughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have lived at the shelter have included professionals, an executive 
secretary, paralegals and other well-educated women who have stumbled into 
poverty. "They have been beaten down to the bottom," Caughey said.  
</P>
<P>
 While at the shelter, the women are required to attend therapy sessions, and 
parenting and budgeting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 A small percentage try to get out of the sessions by lying, which comes as no 
surprise to Caughey. She knows that such manipulation is a survival tool on the 
streets. But in this shelter, Caughey and her staff try to teach the women how 
to handle situations without lying or evasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're worth more than that," they are told. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes when facing the frustrations of finding a job and a place to live, 
they want to give up, saying, "This is too hard, you do it for me."  
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'No,' " Caughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the firm line, former shelter residents often come back to visit years 
after they have settled into new lives. Some come back because their children 
have fond memories of the holidays spent there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to feel like a shelter," Caughey said. "It's a home."

WHO RIDES THE BUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even transit officials acknowledge that Californians have a love affair with 
their cars. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's studies show that its 
most frequent bus passengers tend to be those without wheels of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic minorities and low-income people make up a majority of the ridership. 
So do women -- according to the MTA, 57.3% of bus riders in Los Angeles County 
are female, compared to 53.4% of the county population.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; $65,000 MISSING FROM ESPERANZA HIGH FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police and school officials have discovered that approximately $65,000 is 
missing from the Associated Student Body fund at Esperanza High School. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent audit of the ASB books completed last October revealed that 
some money was misappropriated during the 1992-93 school year, said Kim 
Stallings, assistant superintendent of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School 
District, said at a meeting of the school board Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district "immediately reported this to the Anaheim police, who 
encouraged the auditor to continue its review and share any findings with the 
police," Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The examination of ASB records by police and the auditor is nearly complete, 
he said, but there is no evidence indicating who is responsible for the missing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing money was part of nearly $600,000 in income the ASB received in 
1992-93 from a variety of sources, including ticket sales and concessions at 
athletic events, sale of T-shirts and other fund-raising events. Much of the 
income from these sources is cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's report turned up several insufficient bookkeeping practices that 
have made it impossible for police and the auditor to trace the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the practices discovered during the audit were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Deposits were not made on a timely basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Entries into the accounting records were not done promptly. For example, 
revenue from football games in October and November, 1992, was not recorded 
until January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Checks were not listed sequentially. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not all checks were recorded. About $26,000 in checks that cleared the bank 
are unaccounted for in the financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stallings, students handle most of the cash from fund-raisers but 
are not involved in maintaining the financial records for the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think that any students were involved in any way with the taking of 
money," Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has a part-time bookkeeper assigned to the ASB fund, with the 
activities director responsible for managing the fund and monitoring income and 
expenditures. The activities director for the 1992-93 school year resigned at 
the end of that year. He is not considered a suspect by police, school 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The current activities director, Rick Martens, was not at the school during 
the period the money disappeared. Martens has implemented a series of 
procedures recommended by the auditor to guard against future losses, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The improved accounting system includes issuing receipts at all fund-raisers, 
reconciling cash receipts to bank deposits and installing a new computer system 
that does not allow entries to be erased or changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's insurance policy will cover the loss, less a $500 deductible.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; FIRE DEPT. AUTHORITY DECISION POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted this week to delay action at least for a month on 
whether the city should join a proposed joint powers authority overseeing the 
county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barry L. Denes was among council members who charged that organizers of 
the proposed authority have not fully responded to Villa Park's questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, to me, you have to have everything on the table before you can say 
it's the JPA" for Villa Park, Denes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed authority would be composed of county government and all the 
cities served by the county Fire Department. The new governing body for the 
Fire Department is scheduled to be launched this fall. Its supporters say the 
joint powers arrangement would give cities more say in the department's funding 
and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of the 17 cities that would be in the joint authority have so 
far approved the proposal. Most cities approved the plan with little debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Villa Park City Council announced Tuesday night that it has some 
serious reservations. The council sidetracked a scheduled vote on the authority 
after hearing a critical report on the proposal from Councilmen Joseph S. Barsa 
and Bob Patchin. 
</P>
<P>
 Barsa and Patchin said organizers of the proposed authority have rejected 
Villa Park's suggestions for revised wording of the cities' agreement in 
joining the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin said he could not understand how so many cities have already approved 
the plan. "They are signing blank checks now, with unlimited revision rights by 
two layers of unknown people, forever into the future," Patchin said. "I, for 
one, cannot support this JPA until we know a lot more about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barsa also criticized the proposed authority. He said it is unwise to "enter 
into open-ended contracts." Barsa also said that he and Patchin will later 
propose something other than Villa Park's joining the joint fire authority.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; 9 OFFICERS 
IN GAMBLING PROBE FILE DAMAGE CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Inglewood police officers disciplined in connection with an alleged 
station house gambling ring have filed claims against the city, saying they 
were falsely accused of being involved and that the investigation subjected 
them to humiliation and emotional stress. A ninth officer who was fired from 
the force after the gambling investigation filed a claim seeking $10 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine officers were among 15 Inglewood officers implicated in the gambling 
investigation, which began with an anonymous tip to Inglewood Police Chief 
Oliver M. Thompson last December. Thompson later said the on-duty sports 
gambling involved "thousands of dollars" and was connected to a professional 
bookie outside the department. One officer, Rick Freeman, a 10-year veteran, 
was fired for his role and the other officers were given suspensions of from 
one to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In his $10-million claim, Freeman alleges that search warrants served on his 
home, car and police station locker were obtained through falsified information 
and that his constitutional rights were violated. The other eight officers, who 
are seeking unspecified damages, said they were wrongfully detained and that 
their lockers -- and in some cases, their homes -- were wrongfully searched 
during the investigation. They also charge that the primary investigating 
officer in the case, an Inglewood police sergeant, was involved in an illegal 
betting operation -- reportedly a "fantasy football league" -- that was 
tolerated by police department administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood city and police officials were unavailable for comment on the 
claims, which may be a first step toward lawsuits.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OFFICIALS STRESS NEED FOR IMMUNIZATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State health officials have a message for parents: Preparing their young 
children for the first day of school requires more than buying them lunch boxes 
and new outfits. It also means having kids immunized against diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that children receive nearly a dozen immunizations by age 
5. Officials from the state Department of Health Services recommend that 
children be given many of those shots by age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Children will not be admitted to schools, Head Start programs or child care 
centers if they have not been properly immunized, said Ken August, spokesman 
for the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 5, children are required to have five diphtheria, tetanus and whooping 
cough shots;four polio shots; and at least one immunization for measles, mumps 
and rubella. 
</P>
<P>
 August credited the state's strict immunization rules for preventing the 
spread of measles in schools during a recent nationwide measles epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important that kids are immunized early," he said, noting that 
some preventable childhood diseases are on the rise again in some parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Immunization information can be obtained by contacting your doctor or calling 
a local public health clinic or hospital. Free or low-cost immunizations are 
usually available for low-income families.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE/DANA POINT; WORK TO REOPEN HIGHWAY BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Lee was sitting at the counter of the Ichibiri Japanese Restaurant on 
Wednesday, where business has been hurt by the closure of a section of Pacific 
Coast Highway, when he learned that work to reopen it had just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have done it a long time ago," said Lee, one of the restaurant's 
managers. "Why did it take so long? I want it to open tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The one-mile stretch of highway in Dana Point, next to San Clemente, has been 
buried since February, 1993, by tons of earth that was once a bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.1-million project is scheduled to be completed in January, according to 
Morton August, director of public works and engineering services for Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
 August, who joined mayors from Dana Point and San Clemente at the work site 
Wednesday, said the permit process went quickly once property owners affected 
agreed what the solution should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the bluff will be reinforced and lined with a 
600-foot-long wall that will vary in height from 30 to 40 feet, August said. 
Workers will clear 44,000 tons of dirt and debris from the highway and bluff 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it open by Christmas, myself," August said. The contractor is 
confident he can meet the January completion date, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has involved the cities of Dana Point, San Clemente, the 
California Coastal Commission, Federal Highway Administration, California 
Department of Transportation and affected property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Four San Clemente houses on La Ventana were lost in the landslide, and a fifth 
house on the street suffered significant damage, according to Andy Anderson, 
emergency services coordinator for Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Ginn, who lives on La Ventana across the street and a few houses down 
from where the hillside gave way, smiled and said he had no complaints with how 
long it had taken to start work. 
</P>
<P>
 Up Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point, Holiday Inn Manager Lynda O'Brien said 
the reopening will be welcomed by guests who want to pedal bicycles south to 
San Clemente. For more than a year, a detour has offered a steep hill for those 
riding that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente Mayor Scott Diehl said the reopening will help businesses that 
have been hurt by the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the landslide, an estimated average of 15,000 to 20,000 vehicles 
traveled the closed-down section of Pacific Coast Highway, August said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Highway Administration will reimburse 88% of the $3.1-million 
project, officials said. JEFFREY BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY VOTES TO LAY OFF 5 LANDSCAPE WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite pleas from maintenance workers in the audience, the City Council this 
week voted to lay off five of the city's landscape employees as a 
budget-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said hiring a private firm to do part of the city's 
maintenance would be cheaper.The five maintenance workers will be laid off by 
Sept. 1, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those five jobs, three maintenance positions will be eliminated 
when those employees retire this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Douthit, president of the city's 45-member Maintenance Employees Assn., 
told the council that the Maintenance Department is being unfairly hit by 
budget cuts. He said the department only gets 22.5% of the city's annual 
budget, "but you are asking us to take the biggest cut in the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age said all council members had "sympathy and 
empathy. My heart goes out to you, but I think this is one area (of budget 
cuts) that makes perfect sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately," Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said, "we have to make tough 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The city asked bids for turf maintenance; the low bid by Golden Bear Arborists 
Inc. of Monrovia was $131,472. City researchers said in a memo to the council 
that the eight maintenance workers who now do that job cost Cypress $378,760 a 
year in pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously voted to award the maintenance contract to Golden Bear 
Arborists, with a 30% addition for expected irrigation repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council should have looked into alternatives instead of making 
layoffs," Douthit said. "To give up all we've worked for all our lives is not 
easy." BILL BILLITER

PANEL OKS SHIFTING FUNDS TO SCHOOL REPAIRS; EDUCATION: $30 MILLION EARMARKED 
FOR SPECIAL CAREER HIGH SCHOOLS WILL NOW BE USED TO FIX QUAKE DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state panel Wednesday approved shifting $30 million earmarked for a new Los 
Angeles high school program to pay for earthquake repairs, delaying creation of 
special academies for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval to use the state funds came the same day as release of a school 
district report that found major communications problems at city schools after 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board in a meeting Wednesday granted a Los Angeles 
Unified School District request to use the $30 million for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 State Finance Department officials had recommended that the state bond money 
be used for earthquake claims rather than new programs, said Wales Woodard, 
deputy director of the Office of Local Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district had planned to set up five new schools for students 
interested in careers in medicine, science, business and entertainment. The 
so-called Career Development Partnership Academy Project -- which was to have 
campuses in Van Nuys, Hollywood, Downtown, Compton and Southeast Los Angeles -- 
was designed as a partnership between the city, state and private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the new schools could be reimbursed with the passage of a school 
construction bond on the November ballot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials said earthquake repairs are more important. 
</P>
<P>
 They said release of the state money also would spur the federal government 
into funding its share of the repairs, expected to cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars. The state must pay a portion of the earthquake repair bill that is 
being handed over to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-page earthquake response report, prepared at the request of Board of 
Education President Mark Slavkin in February, contained few surprises and 
underscored the need for updated equipment and an improved emergency plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of an emergency operations center -- equipped with a 
gasoline-powered generator -- that has ample space for employees, telephone 
lines and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase of five radio frequencies to ensure that workers can contact 
district sites when telephones are not working. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improvement of emergency training, including annual refresher courses, for 
administrators and others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring that furniture, such as bookcases, be bolted to the walls to 
minimize injuries and damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Fallon, who chairs the 10th District Parent Teacher Student Assn.'s 
earthquake preparedness committee, blasted the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't answer the question: If you had an earthquake during school, how 
are you going to ensure the students' safety?" she asked. "For having waited 
this long, I was rather disappointed."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; SETTLEMENT NEAR FOR NEW POLICE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two years without a contract, police are nearing settlement for a new 
pact, both city and police association officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect settlement in a matter of days," said Sgt. Gene Komrosky, 
president of the Cypress Public Safety Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. John Cavanaugh, in a separate interview, said, "We believe there 
will be resolution (of the new contract) within the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the proposed new contract have not been released. But Cavanaugh on 
Tuesday said the proposed new pact is for more than one year and represents 
"give and take on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a contract between city and police had caused tensions over the 
past two years, including picketing of council meetings last November and 
December by police and their family members. 
</P>
<P>
 One item of contention between city and police has been a pay raise given last 
year to City Manager Darrell Essex. Some police complained that Essex was given 
special treatment in his contract and questioned whether the city was spiking, 
or artificially increasing his retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The city released a copy Tuesday of a June 30 letter to the police 
association, saying the city had negotiated a three-year contract with Essex 
last year to avoid the possibility of "unfunded liability," or retirement 
spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's letter noted that Essex's old contract would have allowed him to 
retire this year and to legally convert some fringe benefits into final pay for 
retirement purposes. If that had occurred, the city's letter said, the city 
would have owed the state Public Employment Retirement System up to $200,000 in 
unfunded retirement pay for Essex. 
</P>
<P>
 Essex's new contract with the city gives him a 15% pay raise over three years, 
but in the new contract the city manager is "relinquishing conversion 
benefits," which might have been used to spike his retirement pay, the city's 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh, in an interview Tuesday, said the city "wanted to avoid an unfunded 
liability situation such as the one in Huntington Beach." His reference was to 
the retirement-spiking controversy in Huntington Beach, which currently faces 
an unfunded state retirement bill of up to $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Komrosky said Tuesday the police association now has no suspicions about 
Essex's contract and are satisfied with the city's explanation. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY TO LET MANAGER OK SMALL CONTRACTS 
</P>

By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city manager now may sign contracts worth less than $10,000 on behalf of 
the city without first seeking approval from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Monday unanimously approved the new procedure to make it 
easier to contract for routine professional and consulting services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It saves us some money," City Manager Robert C. Dunek said. "It frees staff 
time from preparing reports and getting the council to review and approve 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said that under the old practice, all contracts, regardless of amount, 
go to the council for review and approval. Then they are sent out to bid and 
advertised in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The process takes time and often is not necessary, considering that the 
contract could be just a couple of thousand dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said the practice of soliciting prices from different sources will be 
continued even for small purchases. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SALE AT UNISYS TO AID NONPROFIT GROUP

<P>
 Some 1,300 employees of a local computer manufacturer have been setting aside 
personal belongings during the past year for the fifth annual Unisys Corp. 
rummage sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale Saturday will benefit Saddleback Community Enterprises, a nonprofit 
organization that trains developmentally disabled men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will be spread across the parking lot of the company plant at 25725 
Jeronimo Road. The event will be from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to get involved in the local community and (Saddleback Community 
Enterprises) is right across the street, so this makes sense," said Carole 
Wapelhorst, volunteer coordinator for Unisys. "This has been an annual event 
for us and it's very popular. We get a lot of traffic to the sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Community Enterprises helps train mentally impaired adults for the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 students are taught job skills and placed with employers in the 
area. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COUNCILMAN JONES TO SEEK REELECTION

<P>
 City Councilman Gil Jones says he will seek election to a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 62, became the first incumbent to declare his candidacy, filing 
nomination papers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, the owner of the Jones Family Mini Farm, said he wants to encourage 
businesses to locate in the city. He said some proposed projects in the past 
have made their way toward approval, only to be turned down by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't continue to have this image that we've portrayed over the years, 
that we are a bedroom community," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that his pro-business stance would not override preservation of the 
city's historic setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones served for nearly four years on the city's Planning Commission before 
being elected to the council in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats are open in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer announced last week that he will not seek 
reelection. He was first elected in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeff Vasquez has not said publicly whether he will run. Vasquez was 
elected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of people have taken out nomination papers, but no challengers had 
filed as of Tuesday afternoon. JEFFREY BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; PANEL WANTS SIGNAL AT SCHOOL ENTRANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city traffic commission has recommended placing a traffic signal at the 
entrance to Laguna Hills High School on Paseo de Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council must approve the installation, which would cost $100,000. The 
council will discuss the recommendation at its Aug. 9 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic study showed that more than 420 cars travel along Paseo de Valencia 
in front of Laguna Hills High every hour. At least 140 cars per hour enter or 
exit the high school there. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have complained of congestion as drivers wait for enough time to turn 
left into the school from northbound Paseo de Valencia, or to turn left from 
the school onto northbound Paseo de Valencia. LYNN FRANEY

WOMAN WITH 51 DOGS AND CATS PLEADS GUILTY TO CRUELTY; MALTREATMENT: THE 
ANIMALS, SIX OF THEM DEAD, WERE FOUND IN HER FILTHY, FLEA-INFESTED CONDOMINIUM. 
</P>

<P>
 A woman who let 51 dogs and cats live in their own filth inside her Aliso 
Viejo condominium pleaded guilty to animal cruelty on Wednesday and is not 
allowed to have pets for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Luella Kretchman, 48, will be sentenced in South County Municipal Court on 
Aug. 31 after Judge Blair Barnette receives a report from probation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman pleaded guilty to one charge of cruelty to animals, punishable by 
six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, public defender Tony Pond said he expects Kretchman to receive three 
years' probation under conditions that could include psychological counseling 
and a stipulation that she not have pets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aliso Viejo woman also may be required to compensate the county for 
housing and euthanizing several of the animals, Pond said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sad case," he said. "My client never had any intent to harm her 
animals. My concern is that it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints of an overpowering stench emanating from Kretchman's 
three-bedroom condominium on the 23000 block of El Reposa, sheriff's deputies 
on June 28 found the dogs and cats in the residence -- six of them dead. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a sheriff's report, the home was infested with fleas, and the 
floor was covered with animal excrement. The dogs and cats were taken to the 
Orange County Animal Shelter, where 13 of the animals were said to be in such 
poor health they had to be euthanized. 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman said several others have since been put to sleep. Animal control 
officials, who were given permission to euthanize the dogs and cats or put them 
up for adoption, were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, Kretchman called the sheriff's report 
greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I (pleaded) guilty today to things I'm not guilty of," she said, her eyes 
filling with tears. "They said all of my cats were extremely emaciated. That's 
not true. Only two were skinny because (they had medical problems) and were on 
medication." 
</P>
<P>
 Her greatest fear is that all of her pets will be taken away permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people have their children taken away (by the court), everyone works 
hard to reunite them," Kretchman said. "Why can't the same be done for me and 
my cats?"

NIXON POLICY CENTER BOARD HOLDS FIRST MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business leaders, politicians and diplomats gathered in Washington Wednesday 
for the inaugural board meeting of the Center for Peace and Freedom, a national 
policy center founded by the late President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) and 
former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger are among the directors. 
</P>
<P>
 George Argyros, chairman and chief executive officer of Arnel & Affiliates in 
Costa Mesa and former owner of the Seattle Mariners, was elected to serve as 
the founding chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon announced the formation of the bipartisan public policy center at a 
January ceremony at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. The 
$25-million center will have offices in Washington and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the center will be more "activist" than other Washington think 
tanks, using its array of well-known directors to address questions of national 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't want to do that run-of-the-mill Beltway stuff," said Steven 
Clemons, executive director of the center. "We are designing this to have 
impact, not be a monument." 
</P>
<P>
 The center will endow chairs and focus on both domestic and foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the board approved a first-year program that includes a 
conference in December dealing with post-Cold War policy and a bipartisan 
congressional luncheon group on foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Edward Cox, the late president's son-in-law, represented the Nixon 
family at Wednesday's meeting.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY OFFICER IS SUBJECT OF EMBEZZLEMENT INQUIRY; INVESTIGATION: THE 
10-YEAR VETERAN IS PRESIDENT OF THE POLICE ASSOCIATION AND A MEDAL OF VALOR 
RECIPIENT.

<P>
 The district attorney's office is investigating allegations that the president 
of the Fountain Valley Police Officers' Assn. who is a Medal of Valor recipient 
embezzled from the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Kevin D. Arnold, 33, of Mission Viejo, was placed on paid 
administrative leave July 20 and became the subject of a criminal probe this 
week, said his attorney, Diane Marchant. 
</P>
<P>
 Because that investigation has "just begun," Deputy Dist. Atty. Guy Ormes 
said, nothing has yet been determined.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Elvin Miali would not say how much money is believed to be 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not giving any information on the matter, because it's an internal 
affairs" case, Miali said. "Right now, everything's under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Marchant said Arnold "has been assigned to his home while the investigation 
goes on. He has not been charged with anything by the department." 
</P>
<P>
 She would not comment on the specifics of the case and advised Arnold to do 
the same, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, a 10-year veteran, was decorated with a Medal of Valor in 1990 for his 
actions during a controversial shootout in late 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 A young reserve officer at the time, Arnold was accused by the burglary 
suspect, Michael Wayde Mohon, and Mohon's attorney of using excessive force and 
unnecessarily shooting Mohon six times during a short foot chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohon was charged with trying to kill Arnold, but charges were dropped in 1991 
for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold re-enacts the shootout in an instructional tape that has been used 
statewide at police academies. 
</P>
<P>
 Miali, who presented Arnold with the honor, said after the shootout that he 
had "acted properly throughout this whole thing. . . . Our feeling is that it 
was a good shooting, and he acted within our policy."

EQUAL SCHOOL FUNDING PACT UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appellate court has upheld a landmark settlement in which the Los 
Angeles Unified School District agreed to overhaul its school funding practices 
by 1996, equalizing the amount of money given to schools in affluent and poorer 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents from the Westside had sought to overturn the so-called 
Rodriguez consent decree settlement through a reverse discrimination-style 
lawsuit alleging that schools in wealthy neighborhoods would suffer if money 
was taken from them. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled, however, that the Westside parents failed to show that the 
consent decree -- approved in 1992 by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge -- 
discriminates against the wealthy. "The only showing is that the LAUSD is 
trying to make school funding fairer and less discriminatory," the appellate 
ruling stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the school district agreed to change its policies by allocating 
the same amount of money to every student.

NUMBER OF MAJOR CRIMES DECLINES, SHERIFF SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on Wednesday announced a "significant 
decline" in the number of major crimes reported during the first five months of 
this year compared to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the areas patrolled by sheriff's deputies, homicides were down 8%, rapes 
23%, robberies 8%, aggravated assaults 20%, burglaries 11%, larceny theft 8%, 
auto theft 6% and arson 4% through May.Later statistics were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said the period is too short to draw conclusions about the causes for 
the decline. He speculated that the state's new "three strikes" law, mandating 
life terms for people convicted of three felonies, might be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said state corrections officials report that they have noticed that a 
number of prison inmates possess outlines of the "three strikes" law and seem 
determined not to fall within its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that is having an impact," said the sheriff, who has criticized the law on 
grounds that it would fill the prisons and add substantially to law enforcement 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is responsible for patrolling areas of Los Angeles 
County with a combined population of more than 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics released Wednesday show that through May, 1994, 169 homicides 
were committed in those areas, compared to 183 in the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapes went down from 372 to 288, robberies from 4,500 to 4,125, assaults from 
10,960 to 8,777, burglaries from 11,478 to 10,210, larceny thefts from 19,077 
to 17,505, auto thefts from 11,339 to 10,628 and arson cases from 428 to 412. 
</P>
<P>
 All these major crimes together declined from 58,337 to 52,114, the department 
said.

COUNCIL AGREES THAT FAMILIES OF SLAIN OFFICERS SHOULD NOT PAY FOR MEMENTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council agreed Wednesday to amend a law that requires the family of a 
slain Los Angeles police officer to pay for mementos that are included in a 
memorial plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only the officer's badge is turned over to the family.Other city-issued 
items, such as the service weapon and medals, must be paid for by the family. 
The firearm alone would cost $710. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is disturbing to think that the city would require the family of a police 
officer who made the ultimate sacrifice to spend their own money to include the 
duty weapon of the deceased officer in the memorial," Councilman Joel Wachs 
said in a motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved Wachs' motion directing city attorneys to 
draft the ordinance amendment to permit the city to donate the other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The mementos often are mounted in a glass frame with the officer's badge in 
the center. Within the Police Department, the plaque is called the Parker 
Citation.

<P>
 A two-alarm fire gutted the inside of a furniture store and caused about 
$400,000 in damage early Wednesday, a spokesman for the Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire apparently started in a discarded couch in an alley next to the Life 
Time Furniture store in a business district at Brookhurst Street and Garden 
Grove Boulevard shortly after 5 a.m., said Capt. Nick Booker of the Garden 
Grove Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators said they believe that a transient may have started the 
fire, which gutted the store's showroom and destroyed about two-thirds of the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was contained at 5:41 a.m. by 21 firefighters from the Garden Grove 
and Orange County fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's owner, identified as Chau N. Diep, reported $300,000 in property 
damage and $100,000 in content damage. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported. TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA

RECYCLING CLOGS THE AIR, CHICK SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when residents of West Los Angeles had reason to feel virtuous about 
recycling, a San Fernando Valley councilwoman comes up with this complaint: 
</P>
<P>
 Saving Westside landfill space is having a lousy effect on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because 20 truckloads a week of the Westside's old cottage cheese 
containers, wine bottles and newspapers are being hauled to the Valley and 
Downtown to be sorted, a rate that may eventually reach 150 truckloads a week 
with the upcoming expansion of the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 All those truck trips generate a lot of exhaust emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we're doing wonderful things to reduce the waste stream, I'm concerned 
we're messing up the air," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose Valley district 
includes a recycling center in Reseda, where about a third of the stuff is 
hauled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite five years of effort, city officials have failed to find a site for a 
recycling center in pricey West Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Wednesday that they hope to close a deal next month for a site 
in an industrial area of Palms. Under the deal, a private contractor, Best Way 
Recycling, which runs the Reseda and Downtown centers, would develop the site 
by early next year and buy the city's recyclables for about $14 a ton to resell 
at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25,000 homes on the Westside participate in the recycling program. 
Beginning Sept. 6, about 4,000 homes will be added to the program each week, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' recycling plan calls for each of the city's five sanitation 
districts to contain at least one Materials Recovery Facility, where 
recyclables are sorted, and a transfer station, where garbage and yard 
trimmings are collected before being hauled in larger trucks to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has achieved its goals in all but the Westside district, where the 
lack of both facilities has forced trucks to crisscross the Los Angeles Basin.

FAUX PAS REPORT: ONLY GAMBLERS LEAVE THE TUCK TO LUCK

 In or out? It's a question a lot of guys have regarding short-sleeved sport 
shirts. Tuck it in and you might look like you need horn-rimmed glasses held 
together with tape to complete the outfit. Leave it out and you have a bit of 
the grunge look, with strangers asking you for Soundgarden tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general rule is that if it doesn't have a finished, squared-off bottom, 
it needs to be tucked in," says Mark Schell of Mark Schell Designs for Men in 
Corona del Mar. "That is, unless your goal is grunge." 
</P>
<P>
 Many sport shirts are squared-off and have small slits on the side, a minor 
fashion detail that tells you that the shirt can be worn out if you prefer. If 
it's a squared-off and finished shirt, and you still can't decide, remember, 
when in doubt, leave it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a revolution: He's been gone almost 14 years, and he's still making 
fashion statements. Those round, John Lennon-style sunglass frames continue to 
be hot sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sell very quickly," says Rick Castillo of Strictly Sunglasses in Brea. 
"They're popular with people of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Like jeans of the '80s, sunglass chic is determined by the label you buy. If 
you're out to make an impression outdoors, resist the temptation of cheap, 
drugstore-brand shades. Investing in a good pair of sunglasses is good not only 
for your image, but your eyes as well, because you'll likely get better UV 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lennon look isn't for you, the aviator, or highway patrolman-style 
shades are still popular, as are the plastic horn-rimmed and the 
horn-rimmed/metal combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for arms that open and close evenly; if they're even slightly off they'll 
look crooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweating it out: They're comfortable, and in this age comfort and convenience 
are in. That's got to be the explanation for so many people wearing sweats all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the only place you don't see sweats is at a cocktail party," says 
clothing designer Ellen Corcoran of Yorba Linda. "You'd think some people work, 
play, eat and sleep in the same pair." 
</P>
<P>
 These utilitarian athletic wear can be worn outside the gym with prejudice. 
Grocery store, the mall, movies, fine. The key is to set aside a pair that are 
your "public" sweats and a pair that only you and a few chosen people see. Keep 
your public pair clean and periodically check them to see if they've become 
stretched out. 
</P>
<P>
 The "in" sweats now are the ones that look like they're used to build a sweat 
-- grays, navy, green -- all plain and baggy.

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: ETHNIC BY DESIGN; ADVENTUROUS SHOPPERS GET WRAPPED UP IN A 
COLLECTION OF BATIK FABRICS WOVEN BY TRIBES OF INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucy Sanchez of Lakambini Collection, a line of ethnic clothes for women, has 
a simple philosophy: "to share my ability to translate personality, character 
and just plain chutzpah into charm. And to create a collection that will spark 
emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing inspiration from her native home in the south Philippines and 
influences from neighboring Indonesia, Sanchez has created skirts, tops, 
scarves and accessories. Her unisex kantiu (a tight sarong with a long slit) is 
the line's best seller. 
</P>
<P>
 She uses batik fabrics imported from Indonesia and the Philippines that are 
handwoven by the ethnic tribes. "There is no duplication in design or color 
scheme," Sanchez says. She travels from her showroom in Los Angeles to the 
South Pacific to talk directly with the weavers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fiesta Filipiniana," a celebration held recently at Knott's Berry Farm in 
Buena Park, showcased Sanchez's collection. She also makes frequent 
presentations at the Indonesian Embassy in Los Angeles and will have a fashion 
show at the Hyatt in Downtown Los Angeles on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez arrived in Los Angeles six years ago from the Philippines. "My first 
buyer was an American, and I was inspired by the community's response. It was 
like lightning. All races are buying my clothes because the trend now is ethnic 
designs, and people are looking for something new. My line is exotic and 
tempting and different from anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's consumer, Sanchez says, is reaching out for clothes that are well 
priced, unique and enduring. "My clothes are timeless," she says.

HOT PROPS: LEAVING AN IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES

<TEXT>

 The symbols and words stamped in sterling silver rings, pendants, bangles and 
ID bracelets by Vass-Ludacer recall the hallmarks on the back of flatware. It's 
no coincidence. It's what motivated jewelry designer Hal Ludacer, who finds 
inspiration among the odd and mundane in flea markets and thrift stores. He 
paired up with knitwear queen Joan Vass two years ago to create an accessory 
line for her ready-to-wear collection. The chunky, solid jewelry, however, has 
proved worthy on its own. "It's become really popular with men and women, 
especially in New York," notes Roman Alonso, spokesman for Barneys New York 
stores. "People are actually collecting it." Items imprinted with positive 
words such as "Freedom" or "Help Others" are selling well, he adds. "They're 
wearing five or six rings at once and stating their own messages." Sea the 
Future 
</P>
<P>
 Italian style cognoscente Giorgio Armani is concerned with more than next 
season's sartorial doctrine. Marine wildlife also float through his mind. Hence 
his reasons for creating a T-shirt with the Emporio Armani label for OceanAid, 
a U.K.- and U.S.-based charity set up to reduce problems of pollution and other 
threats in the deep blue. While supplies for the month of August last, all 
profits from the $25 tee will go to the organization. The crisp, white top 
features a cartoonish whale in blue with the EA logo on its tail. Good News for 
Haute Gents 
</P>
<P>
 It took almost five years, but New York can no longer claim the only U.S. 
address for an Ermenegildo Zegna boutique. The 3,000-square-foot-store in South 
Coast Plaza's Jewel Court offers a complete experience for discriminating 
menswear shoppers. After all, Zegna (as it's affectionately known) is one of 
the few European fashion houses left that sees clothes through -- from fabric 
weave to retail sale. A fourth generation of Ermenegildo Zegna's family runs 
the company, based since 1910 in Trivero, Italy. This isn't, however, the 
line's debut here: Bullock's and Neiman Marcus are among the more than 130 
stores that carry the label worldwide. Gentlemen will find suits for career, 
evening and off-time starting at $1,000. In-house tailors will make sure it 
fits, or take measurements for a suit made-to-measure, which start at $1,200. 
They'll even go to your home or office. Signature tuxedos, personal 
furnishings, fragrance and accessories are also available. "We're trying to 
satisfy the needs of every aspect of a man's lifestyle," says Paul Lechlinski, 
vice president of the U.S. subsidiary of Zegna. ROSE APODACA JONES

FASHION / SHOPPING SCENES; A LITTLE ART, A LITTLE CRAFTS, A LOT OF FUN

 Gil Nickerson arrives armed and dangerous, with a wad of cash and a metal 
pushcart he uses like a battering ram to power through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Check this out," he says, tripping over another shopper to get a closer look 
at a homemade wagon wheel lamp. "I've always wanted one of these." Five bucks 
later, it's his. 
</P>
<P>
 Estelle Carter is on a mission of her own. "Isn't this pretty?" she says of a 
$15 wall hanging of dried grass, seeds and vegetables before adding it to her 
wagonload of finds: several print blouses, Tupperware, Rol-a-Decor 
do-it-yourself wallpaper kit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old Saugus Swap Meet in the Santa Clarita Valley, an hour's drive 
north of Downtown Los Angeles, is in many respects like its kin in other parts 
of Southern California -- a mix of garage-sale fodder, such mass-market 
merchandise as tube socks, and handmade crafts. But many shoppers here find 
that the emphasis is on the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the place to find antiques, mind you, but rather hand-painted pine 
shelves, lace-covered baskets and bottles filled with multicolored beans. Did 
we mention the macrame vests? 
</P>
<P>
 The enablers for all this craft abuse are just as eclectic: the women in 
halter tops and shorts munching on $2 breakfast sandwiches and cups of spicy 
fries from the snack bar, the farmers in overalls, grandmothers in tube tops, 
bikers in black leather and even the occasional punk-rocker type. Everyone 
seems to have children in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the odds and ends and cutesy craft work, apparel and 
accessories -- everything from baby-doll dresses, T-shirts and pull-on shorts 
to belts, bags, shoes and Army-Navy surplus gear -- are widely available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say 75% of the merchandise is new," says Ray Wilkings, general manager of 
the 39-acre meet, which doubles as the Saugus Speedway and draws 15,000 or more 
on a given Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing contractor Sonny Quejado has been dealing in women's cotton and rayon 
blouses at swap meets for 16 years. Lately, he's been running a special ($15 
blouses, $5 shorts) at Saugus in hopes of establishing a client base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just moved from New Jersey, so I'm monitoring the crowd to see what they'll 
buy and how much they'll pay for it," says Quejado, who takes in about $1,000 
per show. His customers don't seem to mind that most of his merchandise is 
years out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to buy things you don't really need. It's kind of like going to a 
big carnival but without the rides," says Carter, scurrying off to look at hand 
tools with her husband.  
</P>
<P>
 The Deals: 
</P>
<P>
 A spin through the Saugus Swap Meet turned up plenty of bargains as well as 
some duds. We passed on the $10 weathered fiberglass boat without a rudder; the 
$25 silver ice bucket ("a $95 value," we were assured) and the 
(you-call-this-a-discount?) $15 CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Our purchases included a three-strand gold-plated necklace ($3), two paperback 
books (50 cents each) and a crystal finial ($1). And we got a free sneaker wash 
from a cleaning-solution vendor. Total cost of our afternoon visit: $9 
including admission and snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bargains: White cotton crew socks priced at six pairs for $5; three 
T-shirts (cotton-poly blends) for $10; new and used hand tools ranging from 50 
cents to $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Details: 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Saugus Speedway, 22500 Soledad Canyon Road, Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sundays.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: FOUR 'SISTERS' AND FOUR DISTINCT LOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Sisters" (NBC, Saturdays at 10 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Four tightly connected siblings -- the Reed sisters -- live in 
Winnetka, Ill., and share the dramas and minutiae of their daily lives in this 
comedy-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Rachael Stanley, costume supervisor on "The Colbys" and 
"Falcon Crest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Imagine the challenge: Take four lead actresses with fairly 
extraordinary faces and figures, and dress them as four average Midwestern 
women. Never allow one sister's clothing identity to invade another's. One more 
thing: Never let their colors clash. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the concept mostly works -- there's not a glamorous over-stepper in the 
bunch. When the four of them are together, their colors are amazingly 
harmonious. But blandness frequently rears its ugly head in the form of too 
many baggy sweaters and blue jeans. OK, so Winnetka is not St. Tropez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Breakdown: Alex (Swoosie Kurtz, pictured below second from left), the 
eldest sister and a small-town talk-show hostess, is a cross between June 
Cleaver and Barbara Walters in her bright, polished suits and frozen-hair 
helmet. It's not easy to buy Teddy (Sela Ward, below third from left) as a 
fashion designer as she schleps through Winnetka in a big old varsity jacket. 
Better are her occasional kimono jackets and artsy jewelry. Georgie (Patricia 
Kalember, below right) is the stay-at-home type, but let's call her the 
boring-looking sister. It's conceivable that a woman can look average and 
domestic in something other than jeans and plaid shirts, plaid shirts and 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The individualist is really Frankie (Julianne Phillips, below left), a 
fast-track business type who dropped out to run a malt shop. Now and then she 
dresses to show off her amazingly muscular body -- well, that's a fashion 
statement, too -- in tight leggings and form-fitting dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Since she shed her granny bun for a short, frosted haircut, Mom -- 
Beatrice (Elizabeth Hoffman) -- is one of the zippiest golden girls on 
television. Her collection of antique pins is a nice touch, and the way she 
wears them at the collars of her loosely tailored shirts has style. Sometimes 
she wears the shirts open over camisoles, sometimes she adds an 
antique-y-looking shirt jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "Every once in awhile, one of the actresses will say to me, 'I saw 
this great outfit I'd like to wear,' and describe it to me," Stanley says. 
"I'll say, 'It sounds great for your personal wardrobe, but I don't think it's 
right for the show.' Swoosie, for instance, has her own sense of style that's 
very California and very cute and very hip, but Alex is very East Coast, 
upper-class money. I have to remind her that leggings are not part of Alex's 
life. Every once in awhile, they all get a little adrift and I reel them in, 
but they never complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Georgie's clothes come largely from the Gap, Banana Republic and 
Eddie Bauer. Alex's wardrobe includes Ellen Tracy, Anne Klein, Anne Klein II 
and Armani. Beatrice's blouses are almost all DKNY, and her loose trousers are 
Ellen Tracy and Jones New York. Much of Teddy's and Frankie's clothes come from 
boutiques on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica including Sara, Jana's, Moselle and 
Harari. BETTY GOODWIN

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: RICHARD THE GREAT? MAYBE -- AND FOR MORE THAN CLOTHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Tyler may be a great designer -- but he probably scored more points 
Tuesday night by showing what a great husband he is. After a presentation of 
his sensuous fall Anne Klein collection at the Four Seasons Hotel, Tyler took 
his bows on the catwalk, whereupon he was given the traditional bouquet of 
flowers. To the audible approval of Nordstrom's best customers, Tyler presented 
the blooms to his wife, Lisa Trafficante, conveniently seated in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 The event seemed designed to acquaint Nordstrom's well-heeled but perhaps 
conservative customers with Tyler's sophisticated approach to fashion. It was 
hard to imagine many of those present bouncing around in the collection's short 
leather pants. Even the models struggled with sexy, patent leather pumps with 
four-inch stiletto heels. But afterward, the audience -- including Morgan 
Brittany (in a very un-Tyleresque tomato red suit) and blonder-by-the-minute 
Linda Gray -- swarmed into the ballroom foyer, where racks of clothes and table 
displays of shoes had been set up. And, as they say, it was a love fest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the Shave: Some busy -- and adventurous -- businesswomen are skipping the 
salon these days and running off to the barbershop for quickie haircuts. 
They're trading frills, fuss and gossip for in-and-out precision cuts. At the 
57-year-old Gornick's Druckers barbershop in Beverly Hills -- whose clients 
include Ronald Reagan, assorted city councilmen and piles of Hollywood agents 
-- owner William Gornick reports an increase in the number of women customers 
in the last six months. "We do half-hour haircuts for ladies who don't have the 
time to sit in a beauty shop for three hours," he says. Gornik charges $25 for 
a cut, $40 if you add in a blow dry, and trims bangs for free. Writer Mira 
Advani, who stopped in for a straight blunt-cut bob, was pleased. "I've had it 
with froufrou. This feels good, clean and quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys Will Be Boys: RuPaul, the cross-dressing darling of the dance charts, 
made the switch from "supermodel" to male model Tuesday, strutting the catwalks 
in New York menswear designer Matthew Batanian's spring fashion show at Parsons 
School of Design in Manhattan. Batanian said he had originally planned to have 
the 6-foot-7 drag queen wear a few pieces from his fledgling women's line but 
thought it would be "fresh to put him in the show as a guy" instead. "He's got 
long arms, though," Batanian said. "He made me crazy at the fittings." 
</P>
<P>
 We See London, We See France, We See Heidi's Underpants: Right there in 
conservative Old Town Pasadena, alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss mans the 
counter of her newly opened no-frills lingerie boutique. (On the day we 
visited, a salesclerk was also on hand, skating in circles around the tiny shop 
like some sort of claustrophobic gerbil.) Looking tan and rested, Fleiss 
offered to autograph any piece of Heidi Wear that caught our fancy. Stock is 
limited to T-shirts, tank tops, boxer shorts, jackets and leggings -- none of 
it more than $30. If the media has staked out your house, leaving you stranded, 
Heidi understands. Her stuff is available by phone, too, at (800) HEIDI-PJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Is Wasted on the Young: Just what's so wrong with the fashion world's 
compulsion to exploit ever younger models? The answer is found in Guy Trebay's 
juicy piece in the August Vogue on 16-year-old supermodel-to-be Bridget Hall. 
Miss Hall, Trebay reports, is on the brink of signing a multimillion-dollar 
deal with Ralph Lauren. She also never finished eighth grade. Think about that 
when next you see her gazing out from some old-money setting. What's eerie is 
seeing pictures of Hall in fashion magazines just a year ago, posing in 
improbably sophisticated clothes with crooked teeth and an innocent gaze. These 
days, the teeth are straight, her bosom heaves, but the gaze is still blank. 
Now we know why.

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; VIVA, SOCIETY! LET THE SEASON BEGIN; SCR'S 
BLACK-TIE AFFAIR IN SEPTEMBER KICKS OFF A YEAR'S WORTH OF GREAT TO-DO'S

 It's only six weeks until South Coast Repertory officially launches Orange 
County's 1994-95 social season with "Viva Teatro!" -- a black-tie salute to the 
theater's Hispanic Playwrights Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Word's out that gala chairwomen June Wankier and Michele Wankier Edwards -- a 
mother-daughter team -- have dreamed up an Aztec-flavored event for Sept. 10 at 
the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. The reception will take place at Town 
Center Park Mall, where a golden step-pyramid (courtesy SCR design genius Cliff 
Faulkner) will provide the centerpiece for entertainment by a guitar ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 After guests have dined on hors d'oeuvres from the Westin, they will sweep, " 
posada -style," along a path lit by luminaria to the hotel ballroom for dinner 
and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gala decor will utilize a dramatic black and gold theme, highlighted by exotic 
tropical greenery and flowers. Changing images from SCR productions will appear 
in gold frames displayed around the room. Dinner entertainment will focus on 
music from Uruguay, Guatemala and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets begin at $350 each. For information, call (714) 957-2602. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other mega-events in the works: 
</P>
<P>
 * Next year's Center of Fashion, sponsored by the Guilds of the Center, is in 
the planning stages. (This year's production was canceled due to lack of retail 
support.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Esayian -- fresh from her duties as chairwoman of last weekend's 
"Phantom Gala" -- is busy choosing her committee for the fashion extravaganza, 
which will be staged Sept. 29, 1995, at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. "We know it will be wonderful," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one problem: The event has no artistic director. An Artistic Director 
Search Committee, headed by Barbara Moreland, has been established. Are you 
listening, Tommy Tune? 
</P>
<P>
 * The center's annual Christmas Candlelight Concert will take place on Dec. 11 
at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. Catherine Thyen will chair the event, which is the 
centerpiece of Orange County's holiday season. Tickets are $250 per person. For 
information, call (714) 556-2121. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pacific Symphony Orchestra is busy scheduling post-performance bashes 
for its 1994-95 Pops series. PSO buffs will get to schmooze with Shirley 
MacLaine after she performs with the symphony at the center on Nov. 18 and 19. 
Also included in the pops series: Kathie Lee Gifford, Mel Torme, Ben Vereen and 
Andrea Marcovicci. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch for Chanel at South Coast Plaza to stage a stylish tribute to the 
educational outreach programs of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra, Opera Pacific 
and South Coast Repertory on Nov. 5. "We're taking over the mall space between 
Nordstrom and Bullock's," says Roger Martin, Chanel director. "It's going to be 
huge." Food will be orchestrated by Wolfgang Puck. Chanel fashions will be 
modeled, of course. Stay tuned.

'DARK SHADOWS' TO FALL ON L.A. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Dark Shadows," Barnabas Collins could look deep into Angelique's eyes and 
she was mesmerized -- much the same way fans were mesmerized by the TV horror 
soap of the late '60s. When the show vanished from afternoon television, many 
of the fans remained -- much like Barnabas did week after week when the show 
was on the air, popping up in different centuries despite a stake through the 
heart (a feat any fan has yet to top). 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Lara Parker (Angelique) will be among the numerous cast members 
on hand for the annual Dark Shadows Festival, an expo of memories, memorabilia 
and fodder for "Dark Shadows" fanatics, such as lost episodes and blooper 
reels. There will be a ghost story session, costume party (dress as your 
favorite character) and more. Other actors scheduled to attend include John 
Karlen (Willie Loomis) and Barbara Steele (Dr. Julia Hoffman) and others from 
the original ('66-'71) and the 1991 revival.

A BIT OF CICELY IN POLAND; FANS FIND POST-COMMUNISM RESPITE WITH 'NORTHERN 
EXPOSURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Krystyna Pawlak did the unimaginable last week, and she would like to thank 
the good people of Cicely, Alaska. Never mind for now that there really is no 
such place. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sleeping bag, two backpacks, $50 and her two daughters in tow, Pawlak 
fled the swelter and drudgery of her kitchen for the first time in years -- 
hitchhiking 400 miles over two days to this lakeside town on Poland's woodsy 
northern frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 To pull it off, the 47-year-old housewife lied to her husband (he thinks she 
took the train), spent a night in a convent (it was all she could afford) and 
ultimately set up home here in an army tent (she rented it from the Boy 
Scouts). 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighbors would never understand this," she said. "But the Indian woman in 
Cicely would. She once went off to Seattle looking for adventure. I am looking 
for adventure as well, and it has been wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian woman is Marilyn Whirlwind, a character played by Elaine Miles in 
the American television series, CBS' "Northern Exposure." In just one year on 
Polish television, the quirky series has captured the imagination of this 
country and, as evidenced by Pawlak and other fans gathered here, has set off a 
social revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausted and disoriented by the trying social and economic changes of the 
last five years, many Poles have found an uncanny respite in the fictional 
environment of "Northern Exposure," an uncomplicated place where people accept 
life as it comes, tolerate differences among themselves -- no matter how 
bizarre or comical -- and work out problems peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our village (Stara Rudna) is completely different from that town -- people 
are fighting with each other all the time, and we never really talk to each 
other about our problems," Pawlak said. "The town in the series may be 
artificial, but it shows how we could live if we tried." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 fans of the offbeat series met last week in this 
out-of-the-way place, which has proclaimed itself Poland's own Cicely, Alaska, 
the fictional setting of the television series. Because there are only 150 
hotel rooms here, most visitors improvised on accommodations, sleeping in a 
school, pitching tents and wigwams and crowding into the homes of residents, in 
some cases free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Four barrel-sized kettles were kept boiling on a wood stove in a shady grove, 
one brimming with potatoes and the others with water for tea, coffee and, for 
the immodest, a sponge bath. The town collected donations so a family of 11 
with no money could attend, while another penniless fan stopped to paint a 
garage en route to Olecko to finance the last leg of his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "This series has drawn people of all ages and all walks of life, from the cab 
driver to the university professor," said Irena Groblewska, a Warsaw publicist 
who founded the fan club three months ago. "We have blind people who listen to 
the show. We get letters from convicts in prison, retirees and 8-year-old 
schoolchildren. It is an absolutely inspiring phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 Oleckoans acknowledge that their town is certainly not a postcard image of 
Cicely. It is far bigger and less rustic than its television counterpart; there 
are only imitation Native Americans; it is terribly flat, and the only moose in 
town has been rented and hangs above the entrance to a downtown convenience 
store. A small toy factory produces stuffed animals, which residents call 
Alaskan bears but look like koalas. 
</P>
<P>
 Townspeople say many of them share the uncommon warmth -- if also some of the 
quirkiness -- of the television characters, and, in the very least, they have a 
longing to be like Cicely. The silhouette of a moose has been unofficially 
added to the town logo, as has the slogan "Way Station, Olecko," a play on the 
Polish name for the television series, "Way Station, Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
 In one year on the air, "Northern Exposure" has become the most watched show 
on Poland's more highbrow second channel, even outdistancing the ever-popular 
evening news despite a less than ideal broadcast slot at 10:15 p.m. on Fridays. 
So encouraged by the viewer response, Channel 2 executives have already 
purchased 25 additional episodes and made it clear they want more as they 
become available. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of communism, American television programs and movies have 
become ubiquitous in Poland, accounting for about 80% of the entertainment on 
the two national channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But few shows have attracted such a passionate following -- or aroused such 
intense feelings -- as "Northern Exposure." Some prime-time soap operas and 
action series on Channel 1, including "Dynasty" and "The Colbys," have drawn 
larger audiences, but the attraction was more fascination than the deep, inner 
connection "Northern Exposure" viewers profess, programmers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a period of great transition in Poland, where it seems people are 
only eager to run to the stock exchange and check the value of their holdings," 
said Danuta Celinska, program manager for Polish television. "After more than 
four years of this, we feel the need to visit such places as Cicely, Alaska, 
and experience interpersonal contacts without any economic motives behind 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 For those meeting in Olecko, it was an opportunity of a lifetime to encounter 
other Poles who share their vision of a more ideal Poland. A packed calendar of 
events leaned heavily on back-to-nature themes, with outings into the nearby 
forest, seminars on growing sprouts, demonstrations on the customs of Native 
Americans, and kayak and bicycle races. There was also a series of cultural 
offerings, ranging from rock concerts to open-air experimental theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We created a certain program, but the idea was to let people create most of 
it themselves," said Bohdan Skrzypczak, director of Olecko's cultural center 
and one of the town's many self-described Joel Fleischmans, the transplanted 
New York doctor in the series who must practice in Cicely as payment for his 
medical school bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though this is a small town, you can realize your dreams here," said 
Skrzypczak, who moved to Olecko seven years ago only because he could find a 
large apartment there. "There are moments when I want to leave, but after 
events like this, I realize how much you can accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 It was "Northern Exposure" that inspired the gathering, and it was the series 
that served up the most meaningful offerings of the week. An early morning 
radio show, fashioned after the show's "Chris in the Morning" radio program, 
provided a daily tally of good deeds in Olecko, sprinkled with poetry readings, 
guest interviews and philosophical musings. 
</P>
<P>
 And each evening at 6, hundreds of viewers crammed into a stuffy auditorium to 
watch the first episodes of the show, followed by soul-bearing, free-flowing 
group discussions on a breezy lakeside knoll. Topics ranged from the motives of 
characters on the show, to flaws and inconsistencies in the story line, to how 
a faraway -- and make-believe -- place could strike such a responsive chord in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Warsaw therapist Tanna Jakubowicz said the sessions were extraordinary because 
Poland has no tradition of group discussion. Sitting on the grass in a large 
circle, viewer after viewer bemoaned the pessimistic state of affairs in Poland 
and the lack of such interaction in their hometowns, while at the same time 
sounding hopeful that this unusual television series might help make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a history in Poland of being victims, so people have always looked 
for someone to blame, someone to project our problems on," Jakubowicz said. 
"For years it was the Communists, but we don't have the Communists anymore, so 
there is a tendency to blame your neighbors, people who are different from you, 
who have a different religion or nationality. This meeting has helped people 
understand their neighbors are not their enemies, just as in 'Northern 
Exposure.' "

SHE ACTS, SHE SINGS, SHE MODELS, SHE'S 18; POP MUSIC: MILLA'S GETTING PRAISE 
FOR HER LATEST CAREER VENTURE, 'THE DIVINE COMEDY,' AN ALBUM OF 
ACOUSTIC-ORIENTED, AIRY, FOLK-POP TUNES THAT SHE WROTE WHEN SHE WAS 16.

<P>
 Don't hate her because she's beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate Milla -- if you must -- because she's beautiful and bright too, because 
she gets to make movies as well as model, and because she's not only cut her 
first album but is actually drawing good critical notices for it. And, perhaps, 
because she's 18. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's any consolation, having it all does come with its own minor psychic 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sick to my stomach last night," says the sometimes-supermodel, 
recalling a key gig the previous evening in which she had to prove herself to a 
cynical L.A. insiders' audience. "I had to keep telling myself to stop thinking 
about throwing up." 
</P>
<P>
 On this morning, the usually effusive Milla is back in her wired-up, cocksure, 
chain-smoking mode, sitting cross-legged on the couch at her mother's Hollywood 
Hills house. She doesn't believe that all the music industry sorts who packed 
the pub for her invitation-only show were well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess people really wanted to see if I could do it," she says, figuring 
some cynical observers showed up hoping she'd fall flat. Not everyone can be 
expected to be supportive when a cover girl turns up on her own album cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind that at all, because I would expect the same (scrutiny) of 
anybody else in the position I'm in," she says. "I expected the album to be 
slagged from every corner, like, 'What is she trying to do, this little model?' 
And I knew that all the people were there to see if I could really perform. I 
could feel everybody's Filofaxes going in their heads, marking things down." 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, Milla kept her dinner down and the mental Filofax scores high. The 
expected slagging hasn't come; much the opposite. Music fans can judge for 
themselves when she makes her first public appearance in L.A. on Sunday at 
LunaPark, where the queasiness quotient should be lower, given the approval 
level she's been enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthused Rolling Stone of Milla's "The Divine Comedy" in a 3 1/2-star review: 
"She is no crossover opportunist or vacant pretender. She is a natural poet and 
melodist . . . (with) the burning intelligence of an artist."  
</P>
<P>
 Her acoustic-oriented, airy, folk-pop tunes ("For me it epitomizes that time 
of my life where I was listening to a lot of Kate Bush, a lot of Enya") aren't 
tremendously radio-ready. Even so, the wistful first single, "Gentleman Who 
Fell," did well with stations of the "adult alternative" ilk, as well as 
garnering play on alternative rockers such as L.A.'s KROQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Milla (pronounced MEE-la; she recently stopped using her last name, Jovovich) 
emigrated to America from Russia with her parents at age 5, and her modeling 
career took off just a few years later. A handful of movies followed -- from 
forgettable starring roles in "Return to the Blue Lagoon" and "Kuffs" to a 
fleeting appearance in "Dazed and Confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was signed by SBK Records on the basis of an original demo she 
cut at age 12, she was soon shuffled off to sing along with tracks laid down by 
producers who saw her as a potential looker out of whom they might be able to 
squeeze a couple quick European hits. She initially complied, then balked, 
defiantly insisting on recording her own material. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse was resolved in her favor; SBK eventually allowed its headstrong 
teen creative control, and those embarrassing early sessions never saw the 
light of day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They signed me for the package they got, and they just got a lot more of the 
package than they expected," she says, breaking into the loud, pronounced 
snicker that is one of her more endearing personal trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The musings on "The Divine Comedy" were written when Milla was 16, and though 
there is nothing at all overtly teen-age about them, she describes the album as 
"this great mix of youth and experience. I was confused like any other 
16-year-old is. There's this young woman just fighting to get out, but there's 
still a kid, you know -- an experienced kid that's gone through a lot, that's 
read a lot of books and that knows a lot more than a lot of 40-year-olds do." 
</P>
<P>
 In person, the Ayn Rand-quoting Milla is fast-talking, high-spirited, 
exceptionally sharp for 18 and just slightly coarse -- not the ethereal figure 
her album, or a sultry model's portfolio, might suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities helped make her a premier party girl on L.A.'s social circuit 
while she was in her mid-teens. But, even if by her own admission she was 16 
going on 40, Milla considers being "in business" as a very young actress-model 
a factor that helped save her from indulging too heartily, rather than a root 
of indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what fast lane I was running through, I never lost my head to a 
point where I could never get it back. I never let myself hit rock-bottom, 
because I had too much respect for myself, for my career and for the life that 
I was working toward -- and too much respect for the books I had read, for the 
knowledge I had taken in -- to let myself go pfffft and just go underground for 
the rest of my life or take stupid drugs or whatever. Most young people don't 
have that sort of reality to relate to -- a career they need to uphold. I had 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head is just straightening out to where I can really feel responsible for 
my life and career and choices, whereas a lot of people wouldn't feel that way 
until they're in their 20s," says Milla, who currently lives in London. "I feel 
like I've gotten a head start on life, because I can at this age say, OK, well, 
I've gone through all my (expletive), I partied and did all that stuff when I 
was younger, and now I can be a lot smarter about it, in every aspect of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Impulsively, she yells out to the patio. "Mom! Can I have a cigarette?" In a 
moment, her mother's clicking heels approach, vice dutifully in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love doing that! She hates it!" chortles Milla, out of earshot of Mom. "I 
mean, god, she started smoking again because of me. I've been the bad 
influence." She snickers, not letting the onset of the age of legality shove 
her entirely into the slow lane just yet.

EX-TUSTIN MD INDICTED ON FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Tustin gynecologist Ivan C. Namihas, who escaped state criminal charges 
despite more than 100 sexual abuse complaints by his patients, was indicted 
Wednesday on mail fraud charges for allegedly billing patients and insurers for 
unnecessary tests and treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors launched what turned into a yearlong investigation of 
Namihas, after the Orange County district attorney's office said it could not 
bring criminal sexual abuse charges against the gynecologist because the 
statute of limitations had run its course on the alleged sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the women who came forward to make complaints against Namihas 
described incidents of sexual abuse they said occurred five or 10 years 
earlier, and the state has a one-year statute of limitations on such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state medical board stripped Namihas of his license in June, 1992, after 
the physician declined to defend himself against sexual molestation charges at 
a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas could not be reached for comment. He has repeatedly denied allegations 
of sexual misconduct through his attorneys since the accusations surfaced more 
than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking mail fraud charges against Namihas, federal authorities were able 
to present to a Los Angeles grand jury evidence of alleged criminal activity 
dating back five years to July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas' attorney, Paul S. Meyer, released a statement Wednesday saying 
Namihas was "saddened that we must now revisit a matter that has already been 
closed out through thorough investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We suspect that the motivation to reopen an investigation that has previously 
been closed may have been influenced by the great amount of publicity that 
accompanied the district attorney's decision not to file," Meyer said. "Now, 
over two years later, we are faced with charges arising from that same period 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment documents 14 instances between August, 1989, and April, 1992, 
in which the 62-year-old Namihas fraudulently billed patients and insurers for 
"unnecessary and improper examinations," collecting nearly $16,000 in payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas would typically inform patients that they suffered from various 
diseases when he knew otherwise, subjecting them to extensive examinations and 
surgical procedures that never should have been performed, the indictment 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "By creating the impression that the victim patient's health was seriously 
threatened," Namihas "ensured that the victim would consent to further, more 
expensive treatment," the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the treatments, prosecutors said, Namihas performed painful laser 
surgery on patients -- even when test results and biopsies came back negative 
-- and he billed exorbitantly for the procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a scheme by Namihas to defraud based on fraudulent representations 
of the conditions of his patients," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Jonathan S. 
Shapiro. "Based on those fraudulent representations, the indictment alleges 
Namihas got women to agree to have further treatments." 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas was arrested by federal authorities on Wednesday in Las Vegas, where 
he now lives, and appeared before a magistrate judge, who set bail at $100,000. 
Namihas is expected to be arraigned in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles 
within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the California Medical Board accused Namihas of sexually abusing 69 
of his patients over the past decade, and nearly 100 more women called to 
report similar allegations to the board after it announced it was filing a 
complaint against the doctor, the indictment does not mention sexual abuse 
allegations. There is no federal jurisdiction over such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, federal statutes make it illegal for anyone to obtain money through 
the U.S. mail with "false and fraudulent pretenses, representations or 
promises. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas faces a maximum penalty of 70 years in federal prison, a $250,000 fine 
and three years of supervised probation if convicted on all counts. The U.S. 
Postal Inspection Service in Santa Ana assisted in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors said they could not have brought criminal charges 
against Namihas back in 1992 because many of the alleged incidents occurred in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s and they were faced with a one-year statute of 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lazar, the deputy state attorney general who represented the state medical 
board in the Namihas case -- the biggest medical sexual abuse case in state 
history -- said he was elated at the decision of federal prosecutors to bring 
the matter to a grand jury and to secure an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In nine years of prosecuting cases like this, the Namihas case dwarfed all 
others, just by the sheer viciousness of the acts and number of victims," Lazar 
said. "We described him in court as a predator in a white coat, and I'll stand 
by that. This is a guy who richly deserves what's coming to him." 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said the Brazilian-born Namihas "repeatedly used his 
position of authority as a physician, and his unique position of access as a 
gynecologist, to invade women's most intimate areas of personal privacy, solely 
to carry out the most egregious . . . sexual exploitation for his own perverse 
sexual gratification." 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of women complained to the medical board that they had been fondled, 
masturbated or otherwise sexually abused. One patient charged that Namihas 
raped her. Another accused him of deliberately withholding anesthesia while 
suturing her after a hysterectomy. Many said Namihas made inappropriate sexual 
innuendoes or tried to kiss them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Namihas agreed to an out-of-court settlement over a civil 
malpractice lawsuit filed by Stacy Crumpler of Huntington Beach, who accused 
Namihas of performing unnecessary surgery on her when she was 19. Of the 14 
mail fraud counts filed against him, four involve billings through the mail to 
Crumpler or her insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Crumpler also told the medical board that Namihas falsely accused her of 
having a sexually transmitted disease and told her she had cancer and would 
become infertile. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical board revoked Namihas' license after preparing for what was 
expected to be a 14-week hearing on allegations lodged against him. The day 
before his hearing was to begin, Namihas offered to surrender his medical 
license, but the board rejected the offer and held the hearing anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Namihas did not appear, telling the board in a letter that the media had 
"unmercifully indicted, prosecuted, convicted and professionally executed me 
before a hearing could be held." The board took only 30 minutes to find him 
guilty of all 69 counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had as many witnesses as I wanted. Hordes of angry women. I was going to 
schedule them four a day," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sidney E. Wechsler, professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the 
USC School of Medicine who reviewed the Namihas case for the state medical 
board, called Namihas "professionally abusive." 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, he said, was "good news, in that someone else can carry forth 
a criminal prosecution." Namihas Chronology 
</P>
<P>
 Former Tustin gynecologist Ivan C. Namihas gained notoriety two years ago when 
more than 100 women filed complaints claiming he had sexually abused them 
during examinations. A look at his case: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 18, 1992: Seeking to revoke Namihas' medical license, the California 
Medical Board cites a series of incidents from 1968 to 1986 stating he 
allegedly fondled patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 10, 1992: Medical board seeks to accelerate the revocation process 
after more than 50 women call, claiming Namihas molested them as far back as 
the late 1960s. Police explore possible criminal action against him. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 13, 1992: Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Eleanor M. Palk 
issues a temporary restraining order to close down Namihas' medical practice 
until another hearing can be held. The previous day, Namihas had removed 
furniture from his office and nameplates from his door and building directory. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 25, 1992: Namihas fails to honor a subpoena to testify in malpractice 
case involving another doctor. His lawyer says he is helping build houses for 
the poor in the Dominican Republic. Superior Court Judge Francisco F. Firmat 
says he will issue a warrant for Namihas' arrest if he does not appear in court 
the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 31, 1992: The arrest warrant is canceled when plaintiff's attorney, 
who originally persuaded the judge to issue the warrant, decides she can do 
without his testimony. 
</P>
<P>

BOEING IMAGE A FACTOR IN ACTION ON 757 WAKE; AVIATION: DOCUMENTS SHOW FAA 
CONCERN REGARDING POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF SAFETY MEASURES ON AIRCRAFT MAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration officials were concerned about the economic 
well-being and image of the Boeing Co. when they pondered whether to adopt 
measures to prevent accidents caused by potentially deadly wake turbulence from 
Boeing 757 jetliners, internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, as the FAA was deciding what to do about 757 wake turbulence after 
the phenomenon had been linked to two fatal crashes, agency officials expressed 
concern about what effect the new safety measures might have on sales of the 
popular, fuel-efficient jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably desirable to coordinate with Boeing before this change is 
made," the agency's then-chief scientist Robert E. Machol wrote on Jan. 12, 
referring to a proposal to require smaller planes to stay an additional mile 
behind 757s on final approaches. "It could have an adverse effect on the sale 
of 757s, and while I am not a lawyer I suppose there is even some possibility 
that (Boeing) could sue us." 
</P>
<P>
 On a list of pros and cons drawn up in an analysis of possible consequences of 
the FAA's taking action, a Jan. 25 chart lists as a con, "Boeing's perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Contained in thousands of pages of documents obtained through the Freedom of 
Information Act, the references involving Boeing appear to reinforce a frequent 
criticism that the FAA sometimes favors the well-being of the airline industry 
over public safety in its decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy FAA Administrator Linda Hall Daschle said Wednesday that it was 
"appropriate" for the agency to seek information from all sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is what due process is all about," Daschle said. "What would be 
inappropriate," she said, would be to give "greater weight" to Boeing's view 
and "that was not done." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Boeing said that he had not seen the documents and could not 
comment on whether it was appropriate for the FAA to consider Boeing's 
interests on an issue that involved public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA is the one that determines the regulations," said Jerry Johnson, 
Boeing's communications manager. "Safety is first and foremost our greatest 
concern on any issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who retired as FAA chief scientist April 30, said Wednesday that he 
had expressed concern about the possibility of Boeing suing the FAA because he 
"thought it was a consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it was likely, but I thought it was worth mentioning," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Machol emphasized that he did not intend to suggest that Boeing should be 
allowed undue influence over the decision-making process. "I know there's a 
feeling out there that the FAA doesn't consider safety," he said. "The truth is 
we try and get along well -- and we do get along well, especially with Boeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The previously undisclosed documents, released this week over the objections 
of some officials within the FAA, also indicate that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning as far back as 1988 and continuing until recently, Boeing lobbied 
against increasing the separation distance for aircraft landing behind 757s, 
even though aviation officials had pushed for such a measure in the interest of 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * The FAA's Flight Standards Office recognized there was something unique 
about the 757's turbulence as far back as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in April, 1988, the Air Line Pilots Assn. red-flagged the issue 
in a letter to the FAA and formally requested that the agency test the 
sleek-bodied 757 to determine why pilots were reporting that it seemed to 
produce much stronger wake turbulence than other aircraft in its weight class. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier set of FAA documents obtained through the Freedom of Information 
Act suggested that the agency had only become aware of the 757 phenomenon in 
mid-1990. The FAA never responded to ALPA's letter or its request. However, the 
kinds of tests ALPA sought are now underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Contents of the FAA documents suggest that at times concerns within the agency 
about its image, airport capacity and the threat of lawsuits eclipsed concerns 
about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really have very little choice on this," Machol wrote on Jan. 14, a month 
after five people died in a Santa Ana crash after a corporate jet encountered 
757 wake turbulence, and 13 months after a similar crash in Billings, Mont., 
killed eight people. "We are under pressure from the media." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA's Daschle said "perception" is a legitimate part of the 
decision-making process, especially on controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While some FAA officials believed that action was unnecessary, others within 
the agency noted the organization's lack of response on the 757 issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a list of safety concerns and recommendations promulgated by 
Machol in October, 1992 -- before any of the fatal accidents -- one official 
whose identity was unclear scribbled on a route slip, "Shouldn't we 
urge/promote implementation of those (recommendations) we know he's right on, 
and sponsor research where questions remain? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a bit nervous just 'sitting' on this stuff," the official wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, air crew program manager Glenn Holmbeck wrote to the Office of 
Accident Investigation in the Recommendation and Quality Assurance Division: 
"Daily, we are risking the traveling public by not addressing the B-757 wake 
turbulence problem. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Any good safety program has got to be proactive (preventive), not reactive. 
Our customers are the traveling public (taxpayers), who pay our salaries, and 
not the industry that we are supposed to be regulating." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations have surfaced in the wake of an internal review that concluded 
that the FAA might have mishandled reports that 757s cause unusual turbulence, 
and that the agency should view the 757 issue as a "wake-up call" to reform the 
way it handles potential safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take up the agency's handling of 
the 757 issue today, as well as the larger issue of the agency's ability to 
identify and act upon safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after five incidents, including two that claimed 13 lives, did the FAA 
institute measures designed to prevent accidents caused by 757 turbulence. 
Announced by FAA Administrator David R. Hinson in May, the new program includes 
an aggressive education requirement for pilots and air traffic controllers, and 
a requirement that smaller planes flying under instrument flight rules -- those 
being guided by controllers -- remain four miles, instead of the standard three 
miles, behind 757s during landings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots flying under visual flight rules, which generally call for the pilot to 
determine how closely he or she follows a leading plane, are urged to keep the 
same four-mile separation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials disagree on the level of danger, the 757's smooth body and 
wing design appears to make it capable of producing unusually potent wake 
turbulence -- volatile funnels of air with hurricane-force winds that emanate 
from each wingtip. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has concluded that until recently there was insufficient evidence to 
make any changes relating to 757s, and that nothing it could have done would 
have prevented the 13 fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality," Daschle said, "is that up until (a recent crash in) Charlotte, 
you had 27 months where more than a billion people flew without an accident 
involving a major commercial airline." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA for years has resisted efforts to call attention to the 757 issue or 
increase separation distances because it could potentially decrease the number 
of flights at major airports, which could cut into airline revenue. By law, the 
agency is bound to promote the airline industry and ensure public safety, 
missions that many believe are contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle acknowledged that the FAA's twin responsibilities sometimes put the 
agency in a position of asking itself some "hard questions," but she maintained 
that it performs both tasks well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been able to accomplish the job that Congress gave to us," she said. 
"I've seen more occasions where safety has come first." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the newly released documents indicate that Boeing has been 
involved in the 757 decision-making process from early on, and that FAA 
officials were sympathetic regarding effects of the controversy on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers include: 
</P>
<P>
 * An October, 1992, memo from Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate 
administrator for regulation and certification, saying: "We will most certainly 
antagonize Boeing by moving their 'large' B-757 into the 'heavy' or some 
special weight category." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick was referring to the weight classification scheme used to determine 
separation distances between landing planes. Some safety experts have said the 
757 belongs in the "heavy" category, which would mean that smaller planes would 
have to stay either five or six miles back instead of the current four miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing has long opposed such a move, in part because it would place the 757 in 
a category with much larger airplanes such as the Boeing 747. But the company 
also has argued against a category change because it is a selling point to have 
an aircraft that doesn't require lengthy separations: The shorter the 
separation, the more planes can land and the more customers can be moved 
through airports. 
</P>
<P>
 * A handwritten report indicating that Boeing officials participated in a wake 
turbulence meeting in January at which it was decided that the FAA should 
"avoid" characterizing the wake turbulence hazard as a problem associated with 
a particular plane, such as the Boeing 757. 
</P>
<P>
 * A July 22, 1988, letter from Boeing's Richard W. Taylor, vice president and 
government technical liaison, indicating that he had been sent a copy of the 
April, 1988, letter from the Air Line Pilots Assn. in which the organization 
relayed pilots' concerns about 757 wake turbulence and called for testing. 
Taylor rebutted the report, arguing that any reclassification was unwarranted, 
and asked the FAA "to keep us informed of future activities in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Feb. 17, 1994, letter written on behalf of a Boeing official identified 
only as G.R. Mack to Paul H. Strybing, manager of the FAA's procedures 
division, which urges the FAA to include Boeing and the rest of the industry in 
the decision-making process on 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 "These tasks can best be addressed through the coordinated efforts of the FAA, 
NASA and industry," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle said it was appropriate to include Boeing in the process because "this 
is the manufacturer of the plane involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Boeing President R.B. Woodard on July 21 wrote to U.S. 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, pledging the company's support, but 
maintaining that "education" -- not additional separation requirements beyond 
the new four-mile limit -- was all that was needed until more definitive tests 
prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June 1, the latest figures available, the twin-engine 757 ranked as 
Boeing's third-best seller, Boeing spokesman Steve Thieme said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the $60-million plane has become increasingly popular with 
air carriers because it can ferry upward of 200 passengers and because its 
engines use substantially less fuel than those of other large passenger jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Other memoranda and letters released this week touched on the FAA's concerns 
about its own image and potential legal exposure in the context of the 757 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, the ex-chief scientist who predicted in 1992 that an accident due to 
757 turbulence would occur and who issued warnings as early as 1989, took a 
more pragmatic approach in July, 1993, after the crash in Billings, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-page letter referring to imminent actions by the National 
Transportation Safety Board on the 757 issue, Machol urged swift measures and 
wrote: "We are going to be sued in any case by the survivors of the people 
killed in that Citation, and if the NTSB says that we should have enforced 
separations, that might cost us a lot of money."

HOUSE OKS BILL PROTECTING VAST DESERT ACREAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of partisan wrangling, the House on Wednesday passed a sweeping 
land-protection bill, creating two national parks and dozens of wilderness 
areas in the ecologically fragile and archeologically rich California desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The House voted 298 to 128 to approve the landmark legislation after Natural 
Resources Committee Chairman Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) took the 
extraordinary step of asking for a time limit on debate over several remaining 
Republican amendments. Once that procedural point was won, opponents, led by 
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), ran out of tactical maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The House has done the people of California a great favor and given the 
people of the country a great gift," said an ebullient Miller after the vote, 
which sends the bill to a conference committee to resolve differences with the 
Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 8 million acres of land would be preserved under the legislation, which 
environmental groups and congressional supporters have labored for years to 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the House bill, Death Valley and Joshua Tree national monuments would 
become national parks and have their lands expanded. And millions of acres of 
desert territory would be off-limits to mining and motorized recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 But enthusiasm over House passage was tempered by the loss of national park 
status for the East Mojave National Scenic Area -- once the centerpiece of the 
original House bill. 
</P>
<P>
 This setback, combined with several other Republican-sponsored amendments, 
promises to complicate the bill's future in conference committee with the 
Senate, which approved a bill designating the East Mojave lands as a national 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who navigated the bill through the Senate, 
said, "I'm confident that it will become law." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein regards passage of a California Desert Protection Act -- its 
official name -- as a crucial goal of her term and she hopes to be able to tout 
the legislative accomplishment in her battle with millionaire challenger Rep. 
Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who voted against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined all California Republicans save one -- Rep. Steve Horn of Long Beach 
-- in opposing the bill. All of the state's Democrats voted for the bill except 
Rep. Robert T. Matsui of Sacramento, who did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Mojave National Park designation fear that the provision may 
be lost during the reconciliation process. Neither Miller nor Feinstein would 
make a prediction on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer the Senate bill," Feinstein said, "and we'll try to get the 
strongest possible bill. But we need to get it to the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters hope a largely intact desert bill will be ready for Clinton's 
signature before Congress adjourns in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert bill would become the largest land conservation law since the 1980 
Alaska Lands Act, which protected 103 million acres from development, and 
environmental groups were jubilant after the House vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sunrise for desert protection and a sunset for desert abuse," said 
Elden Hughes, a longtime Sierra Club leader from Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have come out of the House in very good shape, and the bill has a lot of 
momentum behind it," said Jay Watson, California/Nevada regional director for 
the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill had a more difficult legislative birth than anticipated. For 
years it met certain death in the Senate. But Feinstein took high-profile 
command of the bill last year and agreed to numerous modifications and 
compromises with various interest groups. The upper chamber passed its version 
of the bill in mid-April on a 69-29 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller predicted that similar House action would be swift. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Southern California Republicans conducted a parliamentary war of 
attrition and were able to slow the bill to a desert-tortoise crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Although final passage in the House was never in doubt, Lewis and his comrades 
-- Reps. Al McCandless of La Quinta, Duncan Hunter of El Cajon, Bill Thomas of 
Bakersfield and Howard P. (Buck) McKeon of Santa Clarita -- were able to 
frustrate the bill's backers through a series of time-consuming roll call votes 
on non-controversial amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 Their biggest victory was downgrading the proposed 1.5-million-acre Mojave 
National Park to "preserve" status, thus allowing hunting, fishing and trapping 
to continue there. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists criticized the Republicans' delaying tactics. But Lewis 
blamed Miller for rushing the bill to the floor without an adequate airing of 
opponents' views. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (was) irritating to have our views and needs, and those of our 
constituents, belittled and disregarded in order to pacify the always ravenous 
environmental community," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill passed Wednesday was introduced in January, 1993, by Rep. Richard H. 
Lehman (D-North Fork). The House passed a similar bill in 1991, but it died in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage by both houses has been like the Holy Grail for environmental groups, 
who consider the vast stretches of arid California landscape a threatened 
national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 It was strongly opposed by Gov. Pete Wilson and a coalition of miners, 
ranchers, hunters and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The California desert -- 25 million acres, most tucked in the state's arid 
southeast corner -- contains 90 mountain ranges, more than 100,000 
archeological sites, waterfalls, wetlands and 760 species of wildlife, 
including the endangered desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 The crown jewel of the legislation was to have been the upgrading of the East 
Mojave National Scenic Area to national park status. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Larry LaRocco (D-Idaho) offered an amendment -- backed by the 
National Rifle Assn. -- to designate the East Mojave area as a national 
preserve and expressly allow hunting there. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar hunting amendment passed the House in 1991, and Miller anticipated 
trouble this time around. House members, having already approved the Brady Bill 
and a ban on semiautomatic weapons, were unwilling to send a third rebuke to 
the politically potent NRA, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argued that the LaRocco plan would lead to poaching and put visitors 
in danger. But the hunting amendment passed by more than 50 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists also hoped to phase out livestock grazing in the East Mojave 
and Death Valley areas by barring renewal of existing grazing contracts. That 
amendment too was defeated. The House bill now allows grazing in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert legislation was first introduced in 1986 by Democratic Sen. Alan 
Cranston, but was held up for six years in disputes with the state's successive 
Republican senators, first Wilson and then John Seymour. With the election in 
1992 of Democrats Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, chances of Senate passage were 
greatly enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans remain highly critical of the desert bill because it would 
add land to a National Park system that is cutting back visitor center hours, 
unable to provide adequate housing for rangers and scheduled to lose 3,700 
positions over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and others think environmental zealots and elitists who do not live in 
the desert want to protect it, ignoring the needs of those who live there to 
continue development and maintain the economy. Protecting the Desert 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. House of Representatives has approved landmark legislation that would 
protect 7.96-million acres of California desert. A similar bill has been 
approved by the Senate; next a conference committee must work out the 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest roadblock is the status of the East Mojave Scenic Area. The Senate 
bill would elevate the area to a national park -- off limits to hunting; the 
House version would make the East Mojave a national preserve and allow hunting 
to continue.

THE TIMES POLL; DISSATISFIED AMERICANS MAY SPELL DEMOCRAT LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Storm clouds are gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the stark message from a new Times Poll to Democrats looking toward the 
November midterm congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, Americans express enormous pessimism about the country's 
direction, rising dissatisfaction with President Clinton's performance and 
integrity, and substantial skepticism about a key Democratic argument -- that 
religious conservatives pose a threat to American society. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that Americans remain overwhelmingly disappointed in 
Washington's progress on major problems facing the country and that they are 
less likely than early in Clinton's term to believe that the President and the 
Democrats have better solutions than the GOP. Asked who had better ideas for 
solving the country's problems, those surveyed split almost evenly between 
Clinton and his chief antagonist in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of whether they intend to vote for Democrats or Republicans in 
the congressional elections, those polled closely divided, giving Democrats a 
narrow 44%-42% preference. 
</P>
<P>
 That split could presage significant problems for Democrats. Although broad 
national opinions do not necessarily predict the results in hundreds of 
congressional elections, in the past Democrats have generally needed a 
significant advantage to run well on Election Day. In October, 1992, for 
instance, Democrats held a 10-point lead on that question in a Times survey but 
still lost 10 House seats in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, supervised by John Brennan, surveyed 1,515 adults from 
Saturday through Tuesday; it has a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey shows that Clinton's position has eroded across the board -- to the 
point where he could emerge as a significant drag on Democratic candidates in 
the fall election if he cannot reverse the trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 45% of those surveyed approve of Clinton's performance as President 
and 47% disapprove. That's a 9-percentage-point drop in Clinton's approval 
rating since April and his second-lowest showing in a Times survey: The nadir 
came during the budget battle in June, 1993, when only 42% gave Clinton 
positive grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Partisan preferences in the fall election closely track sentiments about 
Clinton's performance: 70% of those who give Clinton positive job approval 
ratings say they will vote Democratic in November; 68% of those who disapprove 
say they will vote Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one in five of those polled said they would be more likely to vote for a 
congressional candidate if they believed that he or she "would support 
President Clinton most of the time." One in three said they would be less 
likely to support such a candidate, and 44% said that would not have much 
effect on their votes. Among independents, the critical swing vote, 35% are 
less likely to vote for candidates seen as Clinton loyalists and just 14% are 
more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton retains relatively strong approval ratings among traditionally 
Democratic groups like blacks and union members, but he has slipped 
substantially among the groups he needs to broaden his base: Since April, his 
positive ratings among former Ross Perot voters plummeted 18 points, and his 
backing among men slid by 14 points. His performance produces significant gaps 
by sex and marital status: Women and single adults are far more satisfied with 
Clinton than men and those who are married. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's overall job performance rating actually exceeds the marks Americans 
gave him on individual issues. On the economy, just 39% approve of his 
performance, with 50% disapproving. On foreign policy, just 38% approve, with 
52% disapproving. Both those ratings are down since April. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they have a clear idea of where Clinton wants to lead the country on 
foreign policy, only 15% say yes; nearly three-fourths, including a substantial 
majority of Democrats, say no. Even on health care Clinton's vital signs are 
weakening: Only 40% approve of his handling of the issue, with a 52% majority 
again disapproving. 
</P>
<P>
 If those numbers look bad for Clinton on the surface, digging deeper makes 
them look worse. For one thing, Clinton is struggling even though Americans are 
generally positive about the economy. Clinton's overall approval rating and his 
economic grade have eroded since April even though voters' assessment of the 
economy has remained stable over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 A second problem for Clinton is what might be called the intensity gap. Just 
14% of those surveyed strongly approve of his performance as President; twice 
as many strongly disapprove. Just one in 10 strongly approve of his foreign 
policy performance; one in three strongly disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar mismatch occurred when registered voters in the survey were asked 
whether they were inclined to support Clinton for a second term in 1996. Those 
sentiments are unlikely to predict actual voting behavior more than two years 
away, but they are another measure of the depth of feeling about the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 37% of voters surveyed say they are likely to vote for Clinton in 1996, 
and 50% say they plan to vote against him. Only 13% say they definitely plan to 
vote for Clinton, and one-third (including one-third of independents and 
three-fifths of Republicans) say they will definitely vote against him. 
</P>
<P>
 A third large area of concern for Clinton is the resurgent doubt about his 
character and integrity. When those who disapprove of Clinton are asked in an 
open-ended question why they dislike him, fewer than one in 20 mention the 
Whitewater controversy or the allegations of sexual harassment against him by 
Paula Corbin Jones. Asked directly, fewer than three in 10 say that not enough 
is being done to investigate the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 But those controversies nonetheless seem to be reopening uncertainties about 
Clinton's trustworthiness. In the survey, just 55% say he has the honesty and 
integrity needed to serve as President; 35% disagree. That is his weakest 
showing on that measure in his presidency and represents a steady erosion since 
last December, when the Whitewater controversy burst into the news: At that 
point, two-thirds of Americans endorsed Clinton's honesty. Similarly, Americans 
now split evenly, 45% to 45%, when asked if Clinton represents their values. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the disillusionment with Clinton, the poll spotlights some glimmers 
through the gloom for Democrats. It indicates that most Americans have by no 
means written off the President. 
</P>
<P>
 A 49%-41% plurality of those polled still say he is "working hard to bring 
fundamental change" and nearly three in five still consider him either very or 
somewhat effective as President. Almost three-fifths of voters polled say they 
are inclined to vote to reelect their member of Congress -- which could help 
Democrats, who have the most incumbents on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey casts doubts, however, on a recent strategy employed by leading 
Democrats who have sought to focus voter anger on the increasing visibility of 
religious conservatives like broadcaster Pat Robertson within the Republican 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Americans generally do not worry too much about the political 
influence of religious conservatives. The poll found that 40% do fear that 
"conservative Christians have too much political power," but that is actually a 
smaller group than the total of those who believe that they have either the 
right amount of power (33%) or too little (13%). 
</P>
<P>
 One in five of those polled said the involvement of religious conservatives 
would make them less likely to vote for Republicans, but that sentiment was 
strongest among partisan Democrats least likely to back the GOP in the first 
place. Among independents, nearly two-thirds said the issue would have no 
effect on their attitude toward Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikingly, more Americans display concern about the political influence of 
culturally divisive groups associated with the Democrats. Asked who posed a 
"greater threat to American society," 38% picked "liberal groups like feminists 
and gay activists," whereas just 12% named conservative religious groups. The 
rest said neither, both, or that they did not know. Even Democrats were 
somewhat more likely to worry about the influence of feminists and gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans increasingly share the concern of religious conservatives that moral 
decline is at the root of many social problems -- though they do not always 
agree with the solutions that the conservatives advance. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 * The poll asked whether American families are threatened more by economic 
strains, as liberals usually maintain, or by "a moral climate that hurts 
community standards." By a five-to-three margin, the respondents worried more 
about trends in morality. That represents a shift since the recession, when 
economic concerns dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 * To the question of which poses "a greater danger" to America -- intolerance 
of divergent lifestyles or too many people who "have lifestyles which are 
harmful to themselves and society" -- by a roughly five-to-three margin those 
polled worried most about the impact of harmful lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked if the problems of minority groups in the inner city are primarily 
rooted in racism and economic injustice or in a lack of personal 
responsibility, by a margin of nearly five to three respondents fingered a lack 
of personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In their attacks on the "religious right," Democrats risk alienating a 
substantial segment of the population. According to the survey, white 
Protestants who describe themselves as born-again Christians constitute 23% of 
the population. A slightly smaller group, 18%, are white Protestant 
fundamentalists, meaning they believe that the Bible is the literal word of 
God. There is a substantial overlap between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But both groups have clearly soured on Clinton: Three-fifths disapprove of his 
job performance. Roughly half say he lacks the honesty and integrity to serve 
as President. More than 60% say he does not share their values. Nearly half of 
white born-again and fundamentalist Protestants registered to vote say they 
will definitely vote against him in 1996. A Growing Discontent 
</P>

Americans continuing to doubt things are getting done in Washington.

IMPACT MOUNTS IN TRANSIT STRIKE; LABOR: MTA WILL NOT MEET AGAIN WITH MECHANICS 
UNTIL FRIDAY; NO WEEKEND SERVICE IS PLANNED IF WALKOUT CONTINUES. LONG WAITS, 
LOST WAGES PLAGUE STRANDED RIDERS. 
</P>

<P>
 As Los Angeles' first transit strike in more than a decade wore on, 
frustration mounted across the region's tangled roadways Wednesday with angry 
freeway drivers bristling over rush-hour delays and anxious bus riders 
scrambling to keep their daily routines from also screeching to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its striking mechanics ended six 
hours of negotiation late Tuesday night and will not meet again until Friday. 
If no agreement is reached by then, bus riders face an even tougher time: No 
weekend service is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The full impact of the walkout, now entering its fourth day, is only beginning 
to register for hundreds of thousands of car-less commuters, who have been 
forced to put up with long waits, lost wages and unexpected hardships -- like 
the Mid-City woman who was denied a job interview after arriving 15 minutes 
late in a bandit cab, or the stranded Delta Airlines cabin cleaner who had to 
spend the night curled up at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has totally turned my life upside down," said Katheryn Marie Smith, 25, as 
she waited for a bus in the Westlake district to take her home to Eagle Rock. 
"I'm buying a car." 
</P>
<P>
 The job action, led by the MTA's 1,900 mechanics, is also taking a growing 
toll on those who work for the nation's second-largest transit system, which 
Wednesday put only 18% of its buses on the road. Supervisors -- some of whom 
have not maneuvered the lumbering vehicles for decades -- rushed to relearn the 
basics. They were greeted with taunts from mechanics, as well as drivers and 
clerks who are honoring the picket lines; the workers formed human blockades 
outside some of the MTA's 32 bus yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing claims by transit officials that replacement drivers had been 
threatened as they crossed the picket lines, a Superior Court judge Wednesday 
ordered the strikers not to come within five feet of a moving bus. Although 
there were indications that the strikers had backed off, they remained a vocal 
presence outside many yards, such as the South-Central facility, where they 
chanted, barbecued ribs and hooted at their bosses, who responded from behind 
the wheels with sheepish shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon baby . . . let's see what you can do . . . don't hurt nobody," some of 
the strikers teased, as the rusty drivers hesitantly pulled into the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great feeling to be operating under these conditions," conceded 
veteran supervisor Will Ivory, 47, who was thrust into emergency service 
despite having last driven a bus when Richard Nixon was President. "I know a 
lot of these guys. I definitely understand where they're coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 3: 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite the two-day suspension of negotiations, striking workers and MTA 
management expressed cautious optimism. Sources close to the talks said the two 
sides are considering a compromise that would eliminate the major stumbling 
block: the issue of subcontracting. Under discussion is a labor-management 
committee that would set rules on the MTA's desire to shift some work from its 
unionized workers to less expensive private companies. Union leaders fear that 
the practice could ultimately eliminate their jobs. In a pointed jab at the 
MTA's top brass, strikers leaked a document revealing the salaries of the 
highest-paid officials -- 40 of whom, according to the list, earn more than 
$100,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * The strike-crippled agency managed to put another 27 buses on the road, 
bringing the total in service to 345, which traversed 30 selected routes. 
Normally, 1,900 buses serve 200 routes. The MTA also boosted from 40 to 56 the 
number of phone operators assigned to staff an information hot line, 
1-800-COMMUTE. Even so, callers lucky enough to get through had to wait an 
average of seven minutes before speaking to an operator. A new phone line 
featuring recorded transit information -- 1-800-870-0MTA -- also was placed 
into service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traffic on freeways remained congested, though the increase Wednesday was 
gauged at just 2%, which officials said was the equivalent of adding five 
minutes to the typical commute. "It's the difference of going 50 m.p.h. versus 
35 m.p.h. or less," said Chuck O'Connell, deputy district director of 
operations at the local Caltrans office. Those figures represented a decline 
from Tuesday, when Caltrans had said that extra congestion was adding about 15 
minutes to the average commute. Traffic volume was reported as slightly heavier 
on freeways that buses usually travel, such as the Hollywood, San Bernardino 
and Pomona. Vehicles on surface streets continued to flow smoothly -- the 
result, city officials say, of fewer buses on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * With hundreds of students unable to attend summer school because of the 
strike, Los Angeles Unified School District officials adopted a new policy 
allowing students to make up class assignments and tests, or to be dropped from 
the program without a grade. The policy differs from previous summer school 
rules in which students who miss more than three days without valid excuses can 
be given a failing grade. But district officials said that the bus strike is 
unusual and that they do not believe the students should be penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business was booming for taxi companies, as well as for other entrepreneurs, 
who took advantage of the chaos by charging stranded straphangers for rides to 
their destinations. At the same time, many Angelenos were barely aware of the 
problem -- further evidence of the two-tiered nature of Southern California 
commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a lot of things in the news -- you feel kind of detached unless it 
directly affects you," said David Schrader, an attorney with Brobeck, Phleger & 
Harrison who commutes from Manhattan Beach to his Downtown office in a black 
Mitsubishi Eclipse. "I don't drive past any of the picket lines. I haven't seen 
anyone waiting endlessly at a bus stop. I haven't even really noticed any 
increase in the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 As it has from the beginning, the brunt of the strike continued to be felt by 
the more than 500,000 commuters who rely on the public transit system every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since MTA mechanics, followed by 5,000 bus and train drivers and clerks, 
walked off the job at 12:01 a.m. Monday, Alfredis Tapia has been forced to 
spend more than seven hours a day improvising his way to a hodgepodge of 
part-time jobs around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm depressed, worried, just like everyone," said Tapia, a Westlake district 
resident, as he boarded a bus at Alvarado Street and Wilshire Boulevard, hoping 
to make it on time to his job at a dry cleaner in Pacific Palisades. If the 
strike goes on, he said, "I'll probably go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Fernando Bangandian fumed, while fingering his monthly bus pass. 
"I'm wasting my money like this!" snapped Bangandian, 27, as he waited for a 
bus to take him from his class at the nearby Associated Technical College. He 
just started classes this month, but said he was thinking of dropping out if 
the bus strike continues to make his commute last several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people's getting mad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few have a horror story, however, to compare with that of Paula Smith, who 
works nights cleaning the cabins of Delta airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to work from her Mid-City home Tuesday afternoon, Smith caught a yellow 
school bus, which took her only as far as Slauson Avenue before the driver 
announced to her surprise that it was the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 She then walked to Century Boulevard and waited at another bus stop for about 
45 minutes before she was spotted by a friend with a car who took her the rest 
of the way to the airport. But if her journey to work was a pain, it was 
nothing compared to the return trip. When Smith got off work at 12:30 a.m. 
Wednesday, she discovered that there would be no bus service until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty bad," is how she described her restless night, spent huddled in an LAX 
passenger terminal. "Tonight will probably be the same thing again." 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambling to get more buses on the road, MTA officials on Wednesday continued 
their efforts to train administrators in the finer points of defensive driving. 
</P>
<P>
 While no MTA personnel were forced to become bus drivers during the strike, 
they would not have been paid had they declined to attend the intensive 
four-week bus driver program being held at the agency's El Monte depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Lowe, a grant analyst in the MTA's capital planning section, was among 
several dozen employees who spent the day in class, shoulder to shoulder with 
many other reluctant but diligent students, who never imagined that they would 
sit behind the wheel of a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to drive," the 35-year-old Santa Clarita resident lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my cup of tea," added Larry Bates, 51, who usually conducts seminars 
on interpersonal skills. He said he was stunned when he first sat in the 
driver's seat. "Seems like a cockpit with all these buttons. It's a whole 
different view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The striking drivers who stood vigil since 2:30 a.m. outside the MTA's 
South-Central bus yard on 54th Street made sure to use their replacements' lack 
of experience as ammunition. Chanting "Whoomp there it is!" to a rap beat, they 
blocked each bus from leaving the facility for four minutes -- a time mutually 
agreed upon by union leaders and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Mitchell, a 17-year veteran mechanic, complained Wednesday that one of 
the supervisors behind the wheel had stared him down and then barreled by, 
grazing his hip with the bus bumper. "If that had been one of us, we would have 
been called in for a drug test," said Mitchell, who was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the other strikers were remarkably sympathetic to the drivers who 
had been called in, explaining that their beef was with the top brass and not 
mid-level managers, who had no choice in the matter. The gentle teasing during 
the four-minute blockades was like a congenial minuet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason it's peaceful is that we know these guys would rather not 
drive these buses off the yard," said Willie Haigler, 46, a driver for the last 
10 years. "If these were scab drivers, all hell would break loose here." 
</P>
<P>
 After reading one replacement driver's tale, however, Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge William Huss decided to impose some limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit presented to the judge, Andrew Bernstein contended that his 
life was threatened and his path was blocked as he tried to maneuver a bus out 
of a Downtown Los Angeles bus yard. "A (striking) driver ran to my bus . . . 
and pulled open my window and tried to get at me," Bernstein wrote. "My home 
was threatened with destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Katzman, an attorney for the MTA, also contended that picketers 
were "endangering themselves by attempting to block or impede the 40-foot, 
seven-ton buses that enter and exit the divisions. The picketers are causing 
the buses to delay commencement of service on MTA's lines. They are causing the 
buses to leave the divisions at alternate exits, which creates a danger to the 
bus operators and to motorists on the public highways." 
</P>
<P>
 Huss, in ordering strikers to keep their distance, said: "This is serious, and 
it will not be tolerated by this court if it is true." He set an Aug. 12 
hearing on a preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Freitas, a lawyer for the mechanics union, said that the protests at the 
bus yards have been noisy but have been nonviolent and monitored by Los Angeles 
city and transit police with no arrests. He added that he did not believe any 
mechanics had prevented replacement buses or other vehicles from entering or 
leaving bus yards, but that union members would abide by the court order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't anticipate any problems whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the MTA bus yard in Sun Valley on Wednesday, there were not enough strikers 
to try to block buses anyway. Where about 40 had picketed at the entrance of 
the yard the previous day -- delaying buses for up to 15 minutes at times -- 
only two strikers were out Wednesday afternoon. Everyone else had gone 
elsewhere to avoid the searing sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'd be successful in blocking a bus," said John Crogan, a 
striking mechanic, sitting in the shade as supervisors pulled buses out of the 
depot. "Everybody's just being real cool today." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley taxi driver Stephen Kloc has no ill will toward the 
strikers or frustrated commuters, but he's in no hurry for the strike to end, 
just the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say business has increased maybe 60-70%," said Kloc, an ex-Marine, as he 
pulled out of the Checker Cab yard at 7 a.m. on his way to his first fare of 
the day. "All through the days the calls come, not just during the drive-time 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The clientele is by and large pleasant too. Those displaced by the strike 
might not be big tippers -- after all, they're making a major adjustment from 
the $1.10 bus fare to the cab's $1.90 pickup fee plus 20 cents for each 
one-eighth of a mile or 40 seconds waiting time -- but Kloc figures they are 
not likely to pull a knife on him, as happened once, or to get sick in his cab, 
which has happened a few times with fares picked up at bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are nice people who woke up Monday morning and realized they . . . 
would have to find another way to get to work, or wherever," said Kloc, who has 
been driving a cab since January of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Alex Regio, the strike has been a chance to turn a quick buck, albeit 
illegally, undercutting the prices charged by cabbies like Kloc. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the 19-year-old unemployed painter had to get his '87 Nissan Sentra out 
of the shop, where it was being serviced for clutch problems. But by Wednesday, 
even though it shakes and rattles between gears, he was ferrying people in the 
MacArthur Park area for $2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to take advantage of the extra opportunity that the RTD is giving 
us," said Regio, who after 2 1/2 hours of work had shuttled 10 riders and had 
$20 in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, he had developed a marketing strategy, placing his wife, 24-year-old 
Miriam Cruz, in the front seat with him. "There's people who look at me, I'm a 
man, and they're nervous," he said. "When they look at my wife, they look her 
over and say, he doesn't look that bad."

250,000 TIPSTERS DELUGE HOT LINE IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraged by the promise of a huge reward or the chance to contribute to a 
historic investigation, 250,000 callers have flooded a newly created defense 
hot line with tips about the O.J. Simpson murder case, while similarly besieged 
police have designated a full-time "clue chaser" to run down the leads coming 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beyond belief," Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro said Wednesday of the 
hot-line deluge. Shapiro, who disclosed the number of calls in an interview 
with The Times, said they have become so overwhelming that the operators have 
had to install a special backup recording system to keep up with the crush. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipsters have included private investigators with clues based largely on news 
reports, amateur detectives with theories implicating other possible suspects, 
and people claiming to have witnessed the events involving the grisly slayings 
of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the tips are seemingly credible, many appear to be the 
products of overactive imaginations. One Maryland woman has called repeatedly 
to tell of dreams in which she sees another killer. To her frustration, 
Simpson's camp has not gotten back to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing from every psycho and every crazy person," said Bill Pavelic, 
an investigative consultant working with the Simpson team. "But if I get one 
call in a hundred that's a good lead, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising to that thin promise, investigators on both sides of the case are 
painstakingly chasing down each lead, reluctant to pass up any information that 
could prove important. 
</P>
<P>
 The onslaught of tips has convinced some Police Department officials that 
Simpson's camp may be fueling the fires in part to occupy detectives who might 
otherwise be building a case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Any tip that is not checked out could be used against the prosecution at 
trial. Simpson's camp already has made clear its intention to attack the 
thoroughness and competence of the investigation into their high-profile 
client. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's people that are giving us theories, there's psychics, that kind of 
thing," said Detective Dennis Payne of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division. 
"And then there's people who have information. We're checking it all out." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers say they're braced for Simpson's team to show up someday with a 
basketful of leads, wondering whether all of them have been thoroughly 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're absolutely right to be concerned," said Pavelic, a retired LAPD 
detective now at odds with his former colleagues. "We're getting calls from 
people who are saying they're being kissed off by the Police Department. If 
they don't interview these people, they've got a problem. We're going to ask: 
'Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
 With the stakes so high for both sides, police detectives and Simpson 
investigators are simultaneously pounding the pavement. In fact, Simpson's crew 
and LAPD detectives have occasionally run into one another at the crime scene 
and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources in both camps, the most recent wave of tips has featured 
several from eager private investigators trying to uncover clues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Katz of Los Angeles-based Katz Investigations hooked up with a pair of 
Colorado private eyes last week to take a crack at the case. They scoured the 
area near Nicole Simpson's condominium and found red spots resembling blood in 
an alley close to the crime scene. They photographed the spots, as well as some 
intriguing tire tracks, and forwarded the pictures to police, who are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he has rejected tabloid offers of money for the story and added that 
neither he nor his colleagues are interested in the reward. They are just 
trying to solve a mystery that has preoccupied much of the country, he said, 
and hope to get credit for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that was missed by O.J.'s team and by the LAPD," said 
Robert S. Hatch Jr., one of the Colorado investigators who flew to Los Angeles 
at the behest of some Colorado businessmen interested in the Simpson case. 
"It's potentially important evidence, and we found it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said he and his colleagues also turned up a witness who purportedly saw 
Nicole Simpson arguing with someone -- he's not sure who -- on the morning of 
the killings. Having uncovered those tidbits, Hatch and Salvador C. Torres, 
another Colorado investigator, headed home this week, leaving Katz to continue 
hunting for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really expect to come up with too much," Hatch said. "When we 
turned up what we turned up, we were amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 They are not alone. Private investigators from throughout the region and some 
from beyond have descended upon the crime scene in recent days. They are quick 
to tout their finds. 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator forwarded information to both sides that he says will shed 
new light on Nicole Simpson's character, while others have offered thoughts on 
the police and medical examiners involved in the case. Scores of calls to the 
hot line, meanwhile, come from people who say they have information about 
Simpson, his ex-wife or Goldman that could help the case one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the tips -- founded and unfounded -- are about the principal 
players in the celebrated whodunit, many come from people with a dizzying array 
of thoughts on other issues. One Santa Barbara woman hypothesized that a large 
dog might have carried a bloody glove to Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 She called police and Simpson's hot line Wednesday, urging both sides to 
demand a test of the glove to determine whether it had saliva that could be 
matched to a large white Akita owned by Nicole Simpson. So far, neither side 
has complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the self-professed burglar who says he was casing houses in 
Brentwood on the night of the killings, looking for some quick jewelry and 
cash. He came forward within days of Simpson's arrest and said he heard a woman 
scream and saw two white men fleeing the crime scene about the time the 
killings took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, according to the prowler, were carrying a bag or a pillowcase and 
fled Nicole Simpson's home by running out the front of the condominium 
property, not out the back gate, as police and prosecutors have theorized that 
Simpson did. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson has offered $500,000 for information leading to the arrest of 
the "real killer or killers," the prowler says he wants no part of the reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to straighten this out," he told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The prowler, who asked that his name not be used, has been interviewed by 
Simpson's investigators, who said they find him credible. He also has spoken 
with detectives over the phone and is scheduled for a formal interview later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be his first face-to-face encounter with the detectives. When he was 
being videotaped at the crime scene by Simpson investigator Pavelic, LAPD 
Detective Tom Lange happened by. According to Pavelic, Lange asked who the 
witness was, but Pavelic said he brushed him off. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are reluctant to disclose their investigative efforts, but law 
enforcement officials say both police and prosecutors have received a stream of 
calls and letters from across the nation and even other countries. The pace of 
tips slowed down a bit after Simpson's preliminary hearing, officials said, but 
picked up again after the Simpson camp opened its toll-free tip line. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seemed to make everyone out there feel like they were Deputy Dan," said 
one law enforcement source. "Our phones started ringing and the letters started 
arriving."

FAA CONSIDERED EFFECT OF 757 RULING ON BOEING SALES; AVIATION: PERCEPTION OF 
FIRM WAS WEIGHED, DOCUMENTS SHOW. AGENCY OFFICIAL SAYS DISCUSSION WAS 
APPROPRIATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration officials were concerned about the economic 
well-being and image of the Boeing company when they pondered whether to adopt 
measures to prevent accidents caused by potentially deadly wake turbulence from 
Boeing 757 jetliners, internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, as the FAA was deciding what to do about 757 turbulence after the 
phenomenon had been linked to two fatal crashes, agency officials expressed 
concerns about how new safety measures would affect sales of the popular, 
fuel-efficient jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably desirable to coordinate with Boeing before this change is 
made," the agency's then-chief scientist Robert E. Machol wrote on Jan. 12, 
referring to a proposal to require smaller planes to stay an additional mile 
behind 757s on final approaches. "It could have an adverse effect on the sale 
of 757s, and while I am not a lawyer I suppose there is even some possibility 
that they could sue us." 
</P>
<P>
 On a list of pros and cons drawn up in an analysis of possible consequences of 
the FAA's taking action, a Jan. 25 chart lists as a con "Boeing's perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Contained in thousands of pages of documents obtained through the Freedom of 
Information Act, the references involving Boeing raise questions about a 
commonly leveled criticism that the FAA sometimes favors the well-being of the 
industry over public safety in its decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy FAA Administrator Linda Hall Daschle said Wednesday it was 
"appropriate" for the agency to seek out all sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is what due process is all about," Daschle said. "What would be 
inappropriate," she said, would be to give greater weight to Boeing's view, and 
"that was not done." 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing communications manager Jerry Johnson said Wednesday that he had not 
seen the documents and therefore could not comment on whether it was 
appropriate for the FAA to consider Boeing's interests in a safety matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA is the one that determines the regulations," Johnson said. "Safety is 
first and foremost our greatest concern on any issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol, who retired as FAA chief scientist April 30, said Wednesday that he 
had expressed concern about the possibility of Boeing suing the FAA because he 
"thought it was a consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Machol emphasized that he did not intend to suggest that Boeing be allowed 
undue influence over the decision-making process. "I know there's a feeling out 
there that the FAA doesn't consider safety," he said. "The truth is we try to 
get along well -- and we do get along well -- especially with Boeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Released this week over objections from some within the FAA, the previously 
undisclosed documents also indicate: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning as far back as 1988 and continuing until recently, Boeing had 
lobbied against increased spacing for aircraft landing behind 757s even though 
aviation officials had pushed for such a measure in the interest of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * The FAA's Flight Standards Office recognized that there was something unique 
about the 757's turbulence as far back as 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in April, 1988, the Air Line Pilots Assn. red-flagged the issue 
in a letter to the FAA and formally requested that the agency test the 
sleek-bodied 757 to determine why pilots were reporting that it seemed to 
produce much stronger wake turbulence than other airplanes in its weight class. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier set of FAA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 
suggested that the agency had only become aware of the 757 phenomenon in 
mid-1990. The FAA never responded to the pilots association letter or its 
request; the kinds of tests it sought are under way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Concerns within the agency about its image, the threat of lawsuits and 
airport capacity appeared, at times, to eclipse concerns about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really have very little choice on this," Machol wrote on Jan. 14, a month 
after five people died in Santa Ana when a corporate jet encountered 757 wake 
turbulence, and 13 months after a similar crash in Billings, Mont., killed 
eight people. "We are under pressure from the media." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA's Daschle said perception is a legitimate part of the decision-making 
process, especially on controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although some FAA officials believed that action was unnecessary, others 
noted the organization's lack of response on the 757 issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a list of safety concerns and recommendations promulgated by 
Machol in October, 1992 -- before any of the fatal accidents -- one 
unidentified official scribbled on a route slip: "Shouldn't we urge/promote 
implementation of those (recommendations) we know he's right on, and sponsor 
research where questions remain? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a bit nervous just 'sitting' on this stuff," the official wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, air crew program manager Glenn Holmbeck wrote to the Office of 
Accident Investigation in the Recommendation and Quality Assurance division: 
"Daily, we are risking the traveling public by not addressing the B-757 wake 
turbulence problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any good safety program has got to be proactive (preventive), not reactive. 
Our customers are the traveling public (taxpayers), who pay our salaries and 
not the industry that we are supposed to be regulating." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations have surfaced after an internal review that concluded that the 
FAA may have mishandled reports that 757s cause unusual turbulence, and that 
the agency should view the 757 issue as a "wake-up call" to reform the way it 
handles potential safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take up the agency's handling of 
the 757 issue today, as well as the larger issue of the agency's ability to 
identify and act upon safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after five incidents, including two that claimed 13 lives, did the FAA 
institute measures designed to prevent accidents caused by 757 turbulence. 
Announced by FAA Administrator David R. Hinson in May, the new program includes 
an aggressive education requirement for pilots and air traffic controllers, and 
a requirement that smaller planes flying under instrument flight rules -- those 
being guided by controllers -- remain four miles, instead of the standard three 
miles, behind 757s during landings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots flying under visual flight rules, which generally call for the pilot to 
determine how closely he or she follows a leading plane, are urged to keep the 
longer distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials disagree on the level of danger, the 757's smooth body and 
wing design appears to make it capable of producing unusually potent wake 
turbulence -- volatile funnels of air with hurricane-force winds that emanate 
from each wingtip. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has concluded that until recently there was insufficient evidence to 
make any changes relating to 757s, and that nothing it could have done would 
have prevented the 13 fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality," Daschle said, "is that up until (a recent crash in) Charlotte, 
you had 27 months where more than a billion people flew without an accident 
involving a major commercial airline." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA for years has resisted efforts to call attention to the 757 issue or 
increase separation distances because it could potentially decrease the number 
of flights at major airports, which could cut into airline revenues. By law, 
the agency is bound to promote the airline industry and ensure safety -- 
missions that many believe are contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle acknowledged that the FAA's twin responsibilities sometimes put it in 
a position of asking itself some hard questions, but she maintained that the 
agency performs both tasks well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been able to accomplish the job that Congress gave to us," she said. 
"I've seen more occasions where safety has come first." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the newly released documents indicate that Boeing has been 
involved in the 757 decision-making process from early on, and that FAA 
officials were sympathetic to how the controversy would affect the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A handwritten report indicating that Boeing officials participated in a wake 
turbulence meeting in January at which it was decided that the FAA should 
"avoid" characterizing the wake turbulence hazard as a problem associated with 
a particular plane, such as the Boeing 757. 
</P>
<P>
 * An October, 1992, memo from Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate 
administrator for regulation and certification, saying: "We will most certainly 
antagonize Boeing by moving their 'large' B-757 into the 'heavy' or some 
special weight category." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick was referring to the weight classification scheme used to determine 
landing distances between planes. Some safety experts have said the 757, now 
classified as "large," belongs in the "heavy" category, which would mean that 
smaller planes would have to stay five or six miles back instead of four miles.

GOP MODERATES WARN OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT TAKEOVER; POLITICS: CONSERVATIVES ARE 
OUTFLANKING MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS, LEAVING NATIONAL PARTY AT RISK, SENATORS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many moderate Republicans, including veteran U.S. senators, have concluded 
with a mixture of alarm and amazement that the religious right -- already a 
potent grass-roots force -- is poised to take control of the national party and 
precipitate a political confrontation unparalleled since the rise of Barry 
Goldwater 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they say, middle-of-the-road Republicans have only themselves to blame: 
While Christian conservatives have worked tirelessly to take over party 
organizations at all levels from coast to coast, GOP moderates have remained 
passively on the sidelines, unwilling to fight with members of their own party 
over abortion and other explosive social policy issues that dominate the 
conservatives' agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless their own wing becomes more aggressive, these mainstream Republicans 
warn, the religious right will reach Christian Coalition founder Pat 
Robertson's stated goal of winning "a working majority of the Republican Party" 
by 1996. And that could alienate millions of independent voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we let this thing continue to percolate without attacking it head-on," 
declared Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a leading moderate, "we will assure 
President Clinton's reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, Arizona Sen. Goldwater won the GOP presidential nomination after a 
grass-roots campaign by the conservative wing of the party but was mauled in 
the general election by Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Specter reported some progress in a quiet campaign to persuade 
Republican senators to oppose addressing the abortion issue in the party's 1996 
platform, he has not convinced Republican Party Chairman Haley Barbour or other 
GOP leaders. They have told him that failing to include an uncompromising 
anti-abortion plank would alienate Christian conservatives. The 1992 GOP 
platform called for a "human life amendment" to the Constitution, outlawing 
abortion in all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, another GOP moderate, shares Specter's 
assessment. The religious right "has taken over a lot in Kansas," she said, 
"including my own county organization." 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem," Kassebaum said, "is that moderates aren't willing to 
work in the trenches, while the Christian conservatives have gone door to door 
and worked hard and won control fair and square. My hat's off to them for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The view is widely held that moderates have been "asleep at the switch," in 
the words of former Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.). Arthur Kropp, president of 
the liberal People for the American Way, which issued a recent report detailing 
extensive religious right victories in the GOP, criticized the Republican 
moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no fan of the religious right," he said in an interview, "but they didn't 
steal anything, they have just worked harder through the process to win the 
party over to their side and there has been no challenge to them by the 
national party." 
</P>
<P>
 Already religious conservatives are far more potent than they were in 1992, 
when they dominated the Republican National Convention with an uncompromising 
platform and fiery rhetoric that -- in the view of many analysts -- hurt George 
Bush's bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is the religious right's unyielding anti-abortion stance that has 
most worried moderates in the past, Pat Robertson has won wide support for 
another position that is anathema to most mainstream Republicans and 
independents: challenging the basic American principle of separation of church 
and state. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson has denounced the principle as "a lie of the left," stirring 
Christian conservatives to action throughout the country. Specter said that he 
was shocked when Iowa Republicans booed him last month after he stressed 
church-state separation and declared the Texas GOP convention, where delegates 
carried signs saying "A Vote for Our Candidate is a Vote For God," was "wrong 
philosophically" for defying the principle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Republican Assembly, recently formed to push for conservative 
candidates within the GOP, declared that God "has ordained moral absolutes 
which govern the universe" and that the Constitution is "the product of divine 
Providence." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, through his own national television program and other media, has 
done "a tremendous job of trashing the whole idea of church-state separation," 
said the Rev. Robert L. Maddux Jr., a Bethesda, Md., Baptist minister and 
former director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson has "deliberately confused the idea of church-state separation with 
rhetoric about Christians participating in government," and the idea has taken 
on a bad odor among most religious conservatives, Maddux declared. "It's part 
of a scary movement that has duped a lot of good people with conservative 
leanings." 
</P>
<P>
 GOP moderates are even more concerned about what the rising influence of 
uncompromising conservatives will do to the image of the party in the eyes of 
independent voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudman pointed to the recent Virginia GOP convention that nominated 
Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North for the Senate as an example of what he sees 
as the problem when religious conservatives take over. "That Virginia 
convention was as representative of the Republican Party as Uganda is but those 
who controlled were organized and effective and nominated a far-right 
candidate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious right has become so powerful, Rudman said, that no Republican 
with presidential ambitions will dare defy it. He pointed to the case of Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who balked at endorsing the North nomination 
until Robertson told him that an endorsement would be important to Christian 
conservatives in 1996. Subsequently, Dole not only endorsed North but 
contributed $1,000 to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole "doesn't really believe in what the religious conservatives do but he 
doesn't want to alienate them," Rudman said. "Occasionally in politics you just 
have to rise above principle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudman, Specter and Kassebaum, along with Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), former 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, California businessman David Packard, 
and then-Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Stanford) were among a group of moderates who 
formed the Republican Majority Coalition in December, 1992, to counteract the 
growing influence of the conservative Christians on the GOP. Campbell, who 
reported that the religious right controlled 32 of California's 58 county 
Republican central committees, was named chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization conducted several public hearings in 1993, including one in 
Los Angeles. It also announced that it would endorse a candidate in the 1996 
nominating contest and would assemble a list of some 250,000 moderate and 
liberal Republicans to be used by its candidate in building a grass-roots 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the group has been relatively inactive. 
</P>
<P>
 Specter said that he sees little inclination by moderates today to challenge 
the religious right. He has met behind closed doors with representatives of 
several women's abortion-rights groups, including Republicans for Choice, to 
seek their support in an effort to strip the anti-abortion plank from the 1996 
platform. "But I couldn't get them to act. I'm not getting much help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious conservatives have been challenged in strong terms recently by 
Democratic leaders who no doubt hope to add to the divisiveness of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, a frequent target of attacks from religious conservatives, 
declared: "Anyone who doesn't agree with them is fair game for wild charges, no 
matter how false." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee, assailed what he called "the fire-breathing 
Christian radical right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic attacks have touched off a barrage of counterattacks by 
Republican Party leaders who have defended the religious right and accused the 
Democrats of an orchestrated strategy of "Christian bashing" to deflect public 
attention from Clinton's low standings in the polls and problems caused by the 
Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to GOP leaders calling Clinton's legislative and regulatory agenda 
"hostile to both values and religion," Barbour said that the Democrats' attacks 
"reveal just how far out of the mainstream their own party has drifted." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for defending the conservative Christians and accusing the Democrats of 
attacking religion, the Republican leaders have been largely silent on the 
issue. "I don't know that the party could have a better strategy than to just 
keep accusing the Democrats of attacking religion," said a veteran Kentucky 
Republican leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentuckian, a moderate who declined to be identified, said: "In large 
groups of Republicans you just don't talk about it. It's so emotional that I 
look around the room to see who's there before I say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kentucky's 3rd Congressional District, Susan Stokes, a state representative 
who favors abortion rights, fought off the religious right to win the 
Republican nomination for a House seat -- only to see the conservatives back a 
Republican running as an independent in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to make an ideological statement," Stokes said. "I feel their 
tactics reflect a desperation. They used scare tactics, talked about baby 
killers, and sent out mailings that didn't reflect the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 In Georgia, where veteran political analyst Bill Shipp joked that "you could 
put all the moderate Republicans in a phone booth," two religious right 
candidates -- businessman Guy Milner and former Waycross Mayor John Knox -- are 
in a runoff for the gubernatorial nomination. The candidate they defeated in 
the primary, Paul Heard, former state House minority leader, Shipp said, would 
have been a stronger opponent than either of them to face Gov. Zell Miller in 
the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, Dolly Madison McKenna, a moderate rejected by the GOP in a 
congressional race and in an election for state party chairman, said that 
moderates "got lazy and didn't recruit while the radical right group, 
manipulating people through the churches, has gained control." A Houston 
businesswoman, she was booed at the Texas GOP convention this year when she 
declared: "There are people in this audience who want the Republican Party to 
be a church." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna, who plans to set up an organization to identify moderate Republicans 
and persuade them to become active in the party, said that activists of the far 
right have "recruited through the churches with gay bashing and anti-abortion 
crusades and other emotionally charged issues and they have taken over party 
organizations throughout Texas and other parts of the country."

SERBS BLAMED IN DEADLY ATTACK ON U.N. CONVOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In provocative acts that may signal a closing in for the kill in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbian rebels Wednesday cinched off Sarajevo's last 
tenuous lifeline to the outside world and were implicated in a deadly attack on 
U.N. peacekeepers traveling in clearly marked vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 A British soldier was killed and another wounded in the assault on the unarmed 
U.N. convoy -- an attack that seemed intended to dare the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization to deliver on longstanding threats to launch air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO planes conducted routine low-level flights over the area after the 
incident, but U.N. commanders appeared reluctant to call a Western air attack 
at what has become a volatile juncture in the 27-month-old Bosnian conflict, 
saying the assault was only "presumed" to have been perpetrated by Serbian 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fog of battle is still around us," U.N. Protection Force spokesman Paul 
Risley said of the apparent confusion following the ambush outside Sarajevo. 
"But the convoy did report a Bosnian Serb position very close by, and we are 
making the presumption that was who fired on them, since it was small-arms 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The spray of machine-gun fire also exploded at least one fuel tanker that the 
troops were escorting, Risley said from U.N. mission headquarters in Zagreb, 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.N. spokesman said French peacekeepers who arrived to recover the 
stranded British vehicles came under fire and had to abandon their efforts for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 By compelling U.N. officials to close the only open road into the capital, 
Serbian rebel leaders flaunted their knack for getting outsiders to do their 
dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces backing Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic do not control any of the 
rutted dirt track across Mt. Igman into Sarajevo that has been used to truck 
food, gasoline and other necessities to the city since March. 
</P>
<P>
 But by raising the threat of renewed attacks on civilians and aid workers 
plying the front-line route, Karadzic effectively blackmailed U.N. commanders 
into sealing off the road for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of this morning, because we no longer have the guarantee of safety and 
security, (U.N. Protection Force) troops are forced to prevent use of the 
Butmir road across the airport to commercial and civilian traffic until further 
notice," Risley said. "This is a tremendous step backward in the process toward 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs' move to resume a stranglehold on the Bosnian capital was the latest 
in a series of belligerent actions punctuating their rejection last week of a 
peace plan drafted by mediators from the United States, Russia, Britain, France 
and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace plan, reluctantly endorsed by the Sarajevo government, would divide 
Bosnia in roughly equal shares between rebel forces and the larger Muslim-Croat 
population that remains committed to a multiethnic republic. The Serbs 
currently hold more than 70% of the country and are loath to retreat from any 
of the territory they have seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign ministers of the five nations that drafted the proposal plan to meet 
in Geneva on Saturday to ponder a response to the rebels' rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Little in the way of decisive action is expected, as Russia opposes military 
measures to punish the Serbs for their intransigence and the four NATO-member 
countries disagree over the risks and merits of lifting an arms embargo that 
has tied the hands of Bosnian government defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stakes at the Geneva meeting have been substantially raised by recent 
Serbian actions. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. airlift of humanitarian aid for Sarajevo was suspended indefinitely 
last week after gunmen fired on five relief aircraft in or near Serb-held 
territory, and Serbs have repeatedly attacked civilians in the U.N. "safe area" 
of Gorazde this week. 
</P>
<P>
 By forcing U.N. commanders to reimpose the total blockade Serbian forces 
themselves maintained until March, Karadzic has presented the five mediating 
powers with the unsavory choice of military intervention or capitulation to the 
rebel premise that even NATO is powerless to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO was instrumental in breaking the artillery siege of Sarajevo in February, 
when it threatened to bomb any tanks, guns or other heavy weaponry left within 
a 12-mile radius of the capital. Backed by Russia's warnings that it would not 
act to prevent air strikes if the Serbs remained defiant, Karadzic ordered most 
of his artillery out of firing range of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But dozens of artillery pieces have gradually been repositioned around 
Sarajevo, with U.N. monitors putting up no resistance and senior officials of 
the peacekeeping force dissuading NATO from making good on its threat of air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and NATO reluctance to punish the Serbs for blatant acts of aggression 
appears to have emboldened the rebels to press their campaign of terror aimed 
at driving other ethnic groups and U.N. forces from territory they want annexed 
to a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "As usual before a big meeting, the Bosnian Serbs want to show the 
international community how difficult and complex and unpredictable Bosnia is 
in order to deter any resolute action," said Peter Kessler, spokesman for the 
Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's food warehouses in Sarajevo are down to less than a 10-day supply 
of flour rations for the 380,000 trapped and war-weary residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic characterized the road closure as temporary, indicating it could be 
reopened if U.N. intermediaries force the Bosnian government to release nearly 
200 Serbian prisoners of war and agree to cease armed resistance. He also said 
the supply route was being closed because it had been used to smuggle weapons 
to government troops in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Risley said U.N. peacekeepers encountered no evidence to back the smuggling 
claim during routine inspection of cargo transported over the route since 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 The road closure "has to be seen in the context of a number of very serious 
actions the Serbs have taken in the last few days across Bosnia that have us 
very concerned," Risley said, referring to the attacks in Gorazde and the 
targeting of aid flights. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials also report increased Serbian shelling around the key northern 
town of Brcko and cross-border rebel attacks near the Croatian resort of 
Dubrovnik, which had largely been at peace since the 1991 rebellion by Serbs in 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats and humanitarian relief officials say U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali may have encouraged the recent wave of Serbian 
belligerence on Monday, when he recommended a pullout of the nearly 
40,000-strong U.N. Protection Force no matter what the outcome of the 
foundering peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali suggested that NATO troops would be better suited to handling 
the increasingly dangerous work of escorting relief convoys and patrolling 
so-called safe havens.

COLUMN ONE; A RAFT OF DRAFT DODGERS; YOUNG RUSSIANS ARE EVADING MILITARY 
SERVICE IN EVER-INCREASING NUMBERS. SOME DREAD THE HAZING AND HARSH CONDITIONS. 
OTHERS FEAR HAVING TO REPRESS DISSENT. AND MANY OF THEIR PARENTS BACK THEM.

 Porridge and potatoes. Potatoes and porridge. Mashed potatoes diluted into a 
watery gruel. Thin porridge cooked with water instead of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter of 1993 was long and bitter. On a bleak Russian air force base deep 
in the Ural Mountains, 20-year-old recruit Vladimir German was slowly starving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunger haunted me for the first two months in the army, and then I got used 
to it somehow," German said. "But still I was not getting enough food." 
</P>
<P>
 One desperately hungry December day, German and his buddies caught and ate a 
stray dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought, what the heck, half the planet eats dog meat. . . . What harm 
will it do if a Russian eats it once in his life?" German said. "We understood 
that this was probably our last chance not to starve to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Their fears were not exaggerated. A month later, on Russky Island in the Far 
East, four sailors died of starvation and at least 86 others were hospitalized 
with illnesses stemming from severe malnutrition. Recruits who survived were 
reported to be more than 66 pounds underweight. The incident prompted President 
Boris N. Yeltsin to sack the commander of the Pacific Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 The military said the Russky Island incident was isolated, but hunger 
apparently is not. German finished his mandatory military service this spring 
and came home, his mother says, "looking like a walking corpse." 
</P>
<P>
 His advice to the thousands of young men who are now desperately trying to 
avoid being drafted into the Russian army: "Do whatever you can to wiggle out 
of it. You should go serve only on one condition: if your goal in life is to 
become a dumb invalid." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia is at peace, young men are dodging the draft in far greater 
numbers and with a determination not seen even when young Soviet soldiers began 
coming home from Afghanistan in coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsheviks proclaimed the army to be indivisible from the people, and for 
70 years the Red Army was one of the most respected institutions in the Soviet 
Union. A recent poll showed that citizens still trust the army more than they 
do their president, their Parliament or the Russian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 But today 70% of draft-age men think military service is unnecessary, and 35% 
say they are prepared to leave Russia to avoid the draft, according to data 
cited with dismay by Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of young men are voting with their feet. And a surprising 
number of their fathers support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though deeply proud of their own military service, many men feel that the army 
that defeated Adolf Hitler is no longer an honorable institution that will 
teach their sons to be men. It is not uncommon to hear the father of a teen-age 
boy reminisce fondly about his own army stint, yet swear to do whatever it 
takes to keep his son from serving. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Yeltsin ordered that 216,000 young men be drafted into an army 
that will number below 2 million by the end of the year, down from a peak of 5 
million in Soviet days. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials say they are having no trouble mustering the required 
number of recruits, though some experts say draft dodging and desertion have in 
fact thinned the army's ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of increasingly harsh tactics to round up conscripts, including 
cancellation of some student deferments and 5 a.m. raids on draft dodgers' 
homes, indicate that fewer young men are willing to perform their 18 months to 
two years of mandatory military service. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the army registered 41,500 draft dodgers in 1993, or nearly one 
for every five men drafted. But the real number is certainly far higher, as men 
ages 18 to 27 struggle frantically to get student deferments or bribe doctors 
with up to $5,000 to certify them unfit to serve. Some hide out with friends 
and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Their motives are varied. Many have heard horrifying tales of cruelty in the 
army, ranging from dreadful living conditions to brutal hazing that can lead to 
crippling injuries, gang rape or murder of young recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Russian military prosecutor's office, 169 servicemen died in 
hazing incidents in 1993. The deaths are blamed on a general lack of 
discipline, ethnic tensions in the army and in particular on the tradition of 
dedovshchina , or bullying of new recruits by second-year soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men cite fear of dedovshchina as a major reason for dodging the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Other draft evaders, emboldened by the end of Soviet rule, do not want to 
serve in an army they believe may yet be used as an instrument of political 
repression, at home or in the neighboring former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 And some young men are avoiding military service now simply because they can 
get away with it amid the general chaos in Russian society that has accompanied 
the dismantling of totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Defense Ministry, of the 41,500 dodgers on file in 1993, only 
470 were convicted of draft evasion, a crime punishable by up to five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 As young Russians search for spiritual meaning in the vacuum left by the 
demise of the Communist Party, some have turned to religion. A growing number 
of draft dodgers are pacifists or have religious beliefs they say prevent them 
from bearing arms. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a dramatic shift in attitude from Soviet times, a striking number of 
people here in the Russian heartland believe Russia should abandon the draft 
and shift to an all-volunteer, professional army. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories told by the young soldiers who have recently returned to 
Chelyabinsk help explain why. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dmitri Medvedyev, the problem with the army was not the food or the guns, 
but the beatings. 
</P>
<P>
 Night after night, a group of second-year soldiers would pounce on a sleeping 
new recruit, curse and humiliate their victim and then beat him, sometimes 
savagely, while the duty officer in the next room pretended not to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinny, handsome and bookish, Dmitri showed up nearly every morning with 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 After four months, he deserted and went home. Officers came and brought him 
back and promised that the culprits would be punished. But the beatings only 
got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who could put up with it did, and the rest just broke," he said. "I 
guess I broke." 
</P>
<P>
 He deserted twice more, hiding out at his grandfather's home. His mother, 
Zinaida Medvedyev, 45, said police often telephoned or pounded on the door in 
the middle of the night, demanding to know Dmitri's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitri was finally discharged only after his mother brought military 
authorities a medical certificate showing that he had undergone surgery to 
repair a kidney that was damaged as a result of the beatings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitri, now 21, described his military training with contempt: "I held a gun 
once, and that was all." Mostly, he said, he did janitorial work and unloaded 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army is nothing but a system for free labor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Ministry officials in Moscow said they are trying by all means 
possible to eliminate hazing. If so, the message has not penetrated even 
through the top army brass. The military commander of the Chelyabinsk region, 
Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Fedik, said he thinks hazing "is maybe not even a 
problem. It's talked about more than it really happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Medvedyev beatings, Fedik said: "Maybe there was such a case. 
I don't know. But this could happen on the street, in a disco, in a restaurant. 
. . . It also happens in the American army." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazing does exist in the U.S. military, but it is rarely lethal. Pentagon 
spokesman Col. Doug Hart said he was not aware of any deaths due to hazing last 
year, although 85 service personnel were victims of homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 2,572 Russian servicemen of all branches died in noncombat 
situations, according to the military prosecutor's office, out of a force of 
roughly 2.2 million. That rate is about 64% higher than in the U.S. military, 
where 1,244 Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps personnel died out of a 
force of about 1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee of Russian Soldiers' Mothers, a group formed in 1989 to expose 
and combat brutality in the military, says the official Russian death 
statistics are probably understated. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of struggle, the families of slain and injured soldiers have 
finally managed to publicize what they say is an unacceptably high rate of 
peacetime deaths and injuries. Last month, the Russian Parliament took the 
unprecedented step of summoning a top general to testify on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, Deputy Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Anatoly Bogdanov, told 
lawmakers that most of the 518 deaths in the first half of 1994 were due to 
safety violations, but 8% were murders, 27% suicides and 5% were caused by 
barracks violence, or dedovshchina . 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at Defense Ministry headquarters in Moscow, Maj. Gen. Vasily 
V. Smirnov said the army's problems are grossly exaggerated by the Committee of 
Russian Soldiers' Mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the army only reflects the increase in violence and crime plaguing 
Russian society in general. Smirnov said other top officials say they feel the 
honor of the Russian army is being undermined by an incessant barrage of bad 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nation that still prides itself on having won World War II, plenty of 
people agree. Some are saddened by the army's loss of glory and prestige, while 
others think draft dodgers are scum.

BOMBS SPUR SECURITY BOOST AT ISRAELI SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT and WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after two bombings in London, U.S. and European intelligence agencies 
issued new warnings Wednesday about possible further attacks against Israeli 
targets, leading to tightened security at hundreds of Israeli facilities and 
Jewish religious and cultural centers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to specific threats picked up by the FBI, the Israeli Embassy in 
Washington was effectively cordoned off Wednesday, while concrete barriers were 
erected around Israel's consulate and U.N. mission in New York. In London, more 
than 100 Jewish and Israeli sites were placed under 24-hour police protection. 
</P>
<P>
 An anti-terrorism team in Los Angeles stepped up security at several locales. 
Late Wednesday, a police bomb squad blew open the trunk of an unattended car in 
the garage of the high-rise that houses the Israeli Consulate in the 
Mid-Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said it was unclear whether there were any explosives in the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic tests are far from complete at any of four sites bombed over the past 
week in London, Argentina and Panama, but both U.S. counterterrorism officials 
and private experts are tentatively concluding that Islamic extremists linked 
to Lebanon's Hezbollah, or Party of God, are responsible for at least three and 
probably all four attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah has denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The London attacks "are consistent with the pattern we've seen in the past," 
State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Wednesday. "And that points toward 
involvement by radical factions including Hezbollah, with sponsorship and 
support by Iran." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official went further, tying together all four. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are parts of the same whole, whether or not they (the perpetrators) 
know about each other. Like spokes on an axle, they are probably cells linking 
back to one unit. The wave of attacks is not a coincidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and European experts now believe that the motive for the spate of 
attacks, the most deadly in years with more than 100 dead, was twofold: to 
retaliate for a series of recent Israeli raids on Hezbollah bases in Lebanon 
and to undermine progress in the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of a renewed outbreak of international terrorism abruptly dampened 
the optimism of the previous two days, during which Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein signed a historic document at the White 
House ending nearly half a century of warfare between their countries. 
Washington is believed to be a potential target because it hosted the signing. 
</P>
<P>
 A terse statement from the Israeli Embassy in Washington confirmed that 
security measures at offices across the United States were tightened after the 
bombings. The subsequent U.S. warning led authorities to take further actions. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, huge Sanitation Department dump trucks, normally used to spread 
salt during winter storms, were filled with sand and rushed to two Israeli 
offices to serve as temporary barriers. They were later replaced by large 
concrete barriers, while heavily armed police emergency squads stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials are wary of predicting the renewal of the kind of 
terrorism witnessed in the 1980s, Israeli and Jewish officials do not believe 
the attacks have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many groups in the Middle East intent on hitting the Jewish 
community in the foreseeable future," said Mike Whine, director of the Board of 
Deputies of British Jews. "We are in for a tough time. There is concern and 
apprehension throughout the community now, and we must be on our guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorism specialists are concerned because of the magnitude of the recent 
attacks. Almost 100 died July 18 in a building in Buenos Aires that housed 
several Jewish organizations, while all 21 passengers, including 12 Jewish 
businessmen, perished the next day in the crash of a Panamanian commuter 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The London car-bomb attacks, one at the Israeli Embassy on Tuesday and the 
next at offices of several Jewish organizations early Wednesday, injured 19 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new dimension for us is the power and ferocity of the devices being put 
down and the total disregard for their own or anyone else's lives by the 
terrorists involved," Police Commissioner Paul Condon said Wednesday in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are totally reckless. The timing on these devices is so short 
they are risking their own lives -- they are almost suicide bombers." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, terrorism specialist Bruce Hoffman of the Santa Monica-based 
RAND Corp. think tank said that all four recent bombings were highly 
professional, in stark contrast to the amateurs involved in the 1993 bombing of 
New York's World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright reported from Washington and Tuohy from London. Times staff writers 
Shawn Hubler, Jim Newton and Kenneth Reich in Los Angeles and John Goldman in 
New York contributed to this report.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN TRIES TO PIN THE 'TAX HIKER' LABEL ON 
WILSON; IN A NEW AD, SHE ACCUSES THE REPUBLICAN OF RAISING TAXES. BUT HIS 
SPOKESMAN SAYS THE DEMOCRAT BACKED THE HIGHER LEVIES DURING EACH OF THE PAST 
TWO YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Democrats have had the label thrown at them for years, so it was with no small 
amount of pleasure that Kathleen Brown's campaign for governor Wednesday threw 
it back at Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting a twist on lines of attack that California voters have come to expect, 
the Democrat Brown called the Republican Wilson a tax hiker. In a 30-second 
television commercial that began running statewide Wednesday, she accused him 
of raising "almost every tax in California," inventing new taxes and, indeed, 
of lying about his past record on tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A different kind of ad for a Democrat," offered Brown spokesman John 
Whitehurst in a bit of understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign, for its part, scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hypocrisy here is so thick you could choke on it," said Wilson's 
spokesman Dan Schnur. "Kathleen Brown has called for tax increases on the 
people of California in each of the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax ad and an earlier Brown commercial criticizing Wilson's parole policy 
are meant to strike at the heart of traditional political theology -- that 
Republicans, not Democrats, are tough on crime and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with public opinion polls that show voters most concerned about crime, 
she has tried to wrest that issue from Wilson by criticizing his handling of 
the state's parole system. On that subject and on taxes, Brown contends that 
the issue is how Wilson's promises compare to his record. 
</P>
<P>
 But she continues to open herself to charges of hypocrisy. In her most recent 
advertisements, Brown does not mention that she supported most of the things 
that she criticizes Wilson for advocating. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax ad lists a host of levies that have risen under Wilson, among them the 
"sales tax, the candy tax, the farm tax, the railroad tax, the health insurance 
tax, the gas tax, the billboard tax, the beer tax, the business tax, the 
vehicle tax, the renters tax, the day-care tax, the snack tax, the newspaper 
tax, the magazine tax, the water tax." And "the income tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst, when asked, acknowledged that Brown had sanctioned the hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She supported all of them at the time," he said. "For example, the snack tax 
and the tax increase of 1991 was about, from the perspective of the treasurer, 
how do you make the state solvent and you've got to do it by either having the 
revenue or having the cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown aides argued, however, that her positions were beside the point. Had she 
been governor, they said, the tax increases would not have been necessary 
because she would have better managed the state's fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In her ad, the treasurer also flatly accused Wilson of lying in his 1990 
campaign commercials when he contended that he was "the only candidate for 
governor who has balanced 11 straight budgets without raising taxes." The 
slogan was meant to compare Wilson's tenure as mayor of San Diego with that of 
his 1990 opponent, Dianne Feinstein, when she was mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Wilson lied," the ad says. Aides based that statement on Wilson votes to 
hike the San Diego hotel tax and business license taxes when he was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second advertisement, which will run only in Southern California, Brown 
took Wilson to task for the economic difficulties that have befallen Los 
Angeles and neighboring counties. The commercial is the opening salvo in a 
series of regional appeals aimed at voter-rich areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown contends that Wilson "forced local tax hikes, slashed services for 
children, threatened our fire protection and jeopardized county law 
enforcement" by blocking $1.5 billion in state funds from the counties over 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money, however, was part of a 1993 tax shift in which the 
state kept revenues that it normally disbursed to local governments and, in 
exchange, gave counties and cities a half-cent share in the state sales tax 
income. The threats to fire and police departments that the ad cites dissolved 
when voters in November approved extension of the half-cent tax, for which 
Wilson campaigned. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown in 1993 supported only half of the $2.6 billion in local cuts that 
Wilson initially advocated, she endorsed almost all of the $500 million in cuts 
that he advocated this year, Brown aides said. The major exception was $30 
million to $40 million in criminal justice funds to be spread statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's budget this year included a $350-million loss to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, the governor's campaign spokesman, said a host of reasons -- including 
natural disasters and the downturn in defense employment -- were to blame for 
Southern California's dogged recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown has got to be the only person in the state of California who 
thinks that Pete Wilson is responsible for fires, earthquakes and the end of 
the Cold War," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's spokesman said the treasurer's campaign intended to hold Wilson 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point of the ad is his record," Whitehurst said. "She has a whole series 
of economic recommendations which would not have allowed the Los Angeles region 
to face the crisis."

GROUP SEEKS DISCLOSURE ON USE OF COW HORMONE; HEALTH: COALITION SAYS THE STATE 
IS VIOLATING THE LAW BY NOT TRACKING SALES OF THE DRUG. AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS 
SAY THERE IS NO DANGER AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES.

 A coalition of consumer and environmental groups complained Wednesday that the 
Wilson Administration has violated state law by refusing to require disclosure 
of the use of a new synthetic growth hormone in milk production. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the hormone "extraordinarily controversial," the coalition demanded in 
a petition that the California Department of Food and Agriculture comply with 
the law, which it said required the agency to track all sales of livestock 
drugs having a "hormone-like action." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition said the new drug, commonly known as Posilac and mostly in use 
in Southern California, is clearly a hormone within the meaning of the law. The 
state's tracking of its sales, the group said, would provide a way for 
consumers to determine which dairies use the drug. Labeling of Posilac on milk 
cartons is not required. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CDFA has done everything it can to make it impossible for consumers to 
just say no to milk produced with synthetic hormones," said Harry Snyder, 
director of Consumers Union's West Coast office. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint produced angry responses from state officials as well as several 
industry organizations. They accused the Consumers Union of attempting to 
spread fear among consumers about the safety of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and Agriculture Secretary Henry J. Voss, charging that the coalition has 
"told half-truths," said his agency is required to track and make public the 
sales of livestock hormone drugs, but only those found to "have an adverse 
biological effect on humans or animals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though Posilac is a protein hormone, it does not meet the criteria set 
by CDFA and FDA of restricted hormones, those which might be dangerous to the 
health of livestock or humans," Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Posilac, approved for use by the federal Food and Drug Administration this 
year, is injected in cows to increase their milk production. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union's complaint to the state agency is the group's latest move in 
a long-running battle over the regulation of milk and milk production. The 
organization, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, is the only consumer 
group to consistently focus attention on milk producers, an industry that 
Snyder contends is more often protected rather than scrutinized by its 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union was joined in the complaint by the Community Alliance with 
Family Farmers, a farmers organization, and the California Dairy Campaign, an 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Nedelman, of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, said health studies 
on the hormone had found its use to be "safe for consumers and cows." 
</P>
<P>
 "Calls for tracking and publishing (Posilac) sales information are nothing 
more than a thinly disguised effort to mislead consumers that the safety of 
(Posilac) or the safety of milk and milk products from (Posilac-treated) cows 
is somehow in question," said Juanita Duggan, vice president for the National 
Food Processors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union's Snyder acknowledged that there is no evidence that milk 
produced by cows injected with the hormone is unsafe, but he said the drug's 
long-term effects on cattle and humans has not been fully tested. He said 
consumers have a right to know if the milk they are drinking was produced by 
cows treated with the hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder contended that health studies have shown a huge increase in udder 
infections among cows treated with Posilac. 
</P>
<P>
 He said if there is a mass outbreak of infections it would most likely cause 
more "puss and bacteria" to be contained in the milk. Although that would not 
make the milk unsafe, he said, it would lower its quality. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom McDermott, director of biotechnology and communications for the St. 
Louis-based Monsanto Co., which manufactures the drug, said an FDA panel has 
considered the infection issue and did not find a link between the drug and 
udder infections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is Consumers Union is quite wrong on this issue," McDermott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he said any increase in udder infections in California would be 
detected by milk inspections that could cause immediate sanctions on producers.

FATAL BLAST PROBE COULD TAKE WEEKS; SAFETY: THREE INVESTIGATIONS ARE UNDER WAY. 
DAUGHTER OF A ROCKWELL ENGINEER WHO DIED IN THE EXPLOSION PRAISES HIM AS A 
DEDICATED SCIENTIST.

 As relatives mourned two engineers who were killed at Rockwell International's 
rocket engine test site near Simi Valley, investigators continued searching 
Wednesday for clues to the cause of the fatal chemical explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said it could be 10 days to several weeks before three 
separate investigations into Tuesday's blast at the Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have put together what we are confident is the best team of experts 
available to us," said Paul Sewell, a spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
Division. "And we're going to look at every possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rockwell, the Ventura County Fire Department and the California 
Division of Occupational Health and Safety are conducting investigations into 
the accident, the first at the lab involving fatalities since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne engineers Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks and Otto K. Heiney, 
53, of Canoga Park were killed instantly and a third man was seriously injured 
in the explosion at the 2,700-acre hilltop facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were preparing for a controlled burn of a catalyst used in solid 
rocket fuel motors when the accident occurred at 9:07 a.m., officials said. Two 
unidentified Rockwell workers involved in the outdoor test escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people lost their friends," Sewell said, describing the mood of 
employees at the lab Wednesday, where work went on. "We're not taking it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh, who had worked for Rockwell since 1977, lived in the Sunset Hills 
neighborhood of Thousand Oaks for 17 years with his wife, Antoinette, and 
daughter Meredith, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith Pugh, a student at Loyola Marymount University, described her father 
as extremely dedicated to his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He absolutely loved his job," she said. "He had a real passion for science." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was in high school, she said, her father helped her research science 
projects and experiments. Although she said she was never scientifically 
inclined, she said that was fine with her father, who had a deep sense of pride 
about his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh said her father never mentioned any fears associated with his work at 
Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never afraid," she said. "He was very brave." 
</P>
<P>
 Heiney's survivors live in Florida and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell test mechanic Lee Wells, 62, who suffered second- and third-degree 
burns over 20% of his body, was listed in stable condition Wednesday. The 
Newbury Park resident is being treated at the burn center at Sherman Oaks 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three investigative agencies was able to shed new light on the 
cause of the accident. Sewell said that the men were working on an experiment 
for Rockwell, not for a private contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA sent two inspectors to Santa Susana immediately after the accident, 
spokesman Rick Rice said. One inspector will focus on possible worker safety 
violations, and the other on possible criminal activity associated with the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to say at this point how long the investigation is going to 
take," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event any worker safety regulations were violated, a citation would be 
issued, which could range from a maximum penalty of $7,000 for one violation to 
several hundred thousand dollars for multiple violations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne has received six citations since 1990, all for minor health and 
safety violations, including one $300 fine for failing to keep a proper log of 
injury accidents, Rice said. Other records of citations were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Field Laboratory, which employs 742 workers, is a renowned 
rocket engine test site for the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. The facility has been in operation since 1947, when it 
was opened by Rocketdyne's predecessor, North American Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said Tuesday's fatalities were not the first to occur at 
Santa Susana. Six workers were killed in various accidents at the facility in 
the early 1960s, Sewell said.

LITTLE BIG FIND; SKELETON OF PYGMY MAMMOTH IS DISCOVERED ON CHANNEL ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 26,000 years ago, pygmy mammoths no taller than ponies roamed the 
Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Now scientists have discovered what they believe is the first full, fossilized 
skeleton of the rare species indigenous to the islands off Ventura County, 
scientists and officials at Channel Islands National Park confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, paleontologists and students will excavate the remains of the 
elephant ancestor found buried in a sand dune on one of the park's five 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is figure out, what is this little critter that lived off 
the California coast?" said Jim Mead, a paleontologist involved in the project. 
"We don't really understand that species at all." 
</P>
<P>
 What they do know, Mead said, is that the woolly mammoths in Southern 
California swam to the land that is now the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 And once there, they began to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 "When large animals stay on an island, (succeeding generations) usually become 
smaller," said Mead, who studies the species at the Mammoth Site in South 
Dakota and at the University of Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The pygmy or dwarf mammoths measured four to six feet tall, compared to the 
10- to 12-foot beasts that ended up in the La Brea Tar Pits. The island 
dwellers kept their tusks but lost much of their hair, becoming considerably 
less woolly, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always like to think about what they sounded like, with those little 
trunks," Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studying the full skeleton should give scientists some insight into the rare 
mammoth and the environment in which it lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Its bones hold the key to the pygmy's descendants, either the Columbia or 
Imperial variety of mammoth. Remains of both have been found in Southern 
California. Also, scientists hope to tell whether the mammoth ate grass or 
woody substances. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give them a picture of the Channel Islands in the late Pleistocene 
age. Actually, several of the islands were one land mass at that time and much 
closer to the mainland, said John Johnson, curator of anthropology at the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have uncovered scores of pygmy bones on the various islands, but 
never a full skeleton, Johnson said. In the 1950s, a former museum curator, 
Phil Orr, spent years trying to prove his theory that the island's early 
settlers hunted the pygmy mammoths. 
</P>
<P>
 His finds have been pieced together into a complete skeleton on display at the 
museum. But he searched, in vain, for a full set of bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, a National Park Service archeologist discovered the 
remains by accident, said agency spokeswoman Carol Spears. Spears would not 
name the island, for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After the discovery, the Park Service called in Mead and Larry Agenbroad, his 
partner at The Mammoth Site. They viewed the remains and set up a dig, to begin 
Aug. 9, with their Northern Arizona University students. 
</P>
<P>
 After excavating the bones, the team will preserve them with resin and plaster 
casts. At the South Dakota center, they will prepare molds and create a 
Fiberglas model for the Park Service's visitor center at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists will keep the bones for further study. Mead said he was 
delighted with the find. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we know, there is not a complete, articulated pygmy mammoth" 
skeleton anywhere in the world, he said. "You rarely find a complete fossil."

STUDY FINDS PERIL IN WATER SUPPLY; SAFETY: ABOUT 14% OF U.S. POPULATION DRINKS 
FROM SYSTEMS THAT HAVE VIOLATED FEDERAL CONTAMINATION STANDARDS IN LAST THREE 
YEARS, RESEARCHERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The drinking water of more than 36 million Americans, about 14% of the 
nation's population, comes from water systems that have reported unsafe levels 
of contamination during the past three years, according to a study released 
Wednesday by an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on data collected by the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1992 
and 1993, the study lists California with the most people -- 2.8 million -- who 
are dependent on drinking water systems that registered contamination levels in 
excess of federal safe drinking water standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's authors arrived at the 36 million figure by adding up the number 
of people served by water systems found to be in violation of EPA contamination 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also says that about 50 million people, including 16 million 
Californians, depend on drinking water systems that failed to comply with all 
federal water quality regulations in effect in 1992 and 1993. Noncompliance 
increases the chance of contamination. The regulations require systems to 
protect watersheds from microbiological contamination and to make systems less 
corrosive in order to prevent lead from leaching into tap water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most drinking water systems comply with federal requirements, but today's 
report shows that there is still cause for concern," said EPA Administrator 
Carol M. Browner. "Too many systems fail to meet basic public health 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
 The study does not say how many people got sick as a result of drinking 
contaminated water. The author of the study, NRDC attorney Erik Olson, cited a 
report by the Centers for Disease Control estimating that 900,000 people a year 
are made sick by inadequately treated drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Olson's report, the most common types of contamination showing up 
in poorly treated water include microorganisms such as cryptosporidium, which 
was responsible for the outbreak of intestinal illness that affected 400,000 
Milwaukee residents last year. Other contaminants cited by Olson range from 
pesticides and industrial solvents to toxic byproducts of the chlorine used to 
purify most drinking water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said that the widespread evidence of contamination reflects "a gross 
under-investment in treatment facilities in most big cities." According to the 
NRDC's report, "90% of the nation's large water utilities are using pre-World 
War I water treatment technology." 
</P>
<P>
 These facilities, he said, fail to catch a variety of chemical contaminants as 
well as microorganisms. The antiquated facilities, Olson said, rely on sand 
filtration supplemented by chlorine purification. High levels of chlorine 
byproducts, called trihalomethanes, have been detected in people with rectal 
and bladder cancer, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRDC released its study in the midst of a congressional battle over 
proposed changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act. The NRDC and most other 
environmental groups argue that a coalition of municipal water agencies, which 
includes the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, is trying to 
soft-pedal the contamination problem while it works to weaken the Safe Drinking 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the same people who have kept from the public full knowledge of the 
extent of contamination are now mounting efforts to weaken the law that 
protects the public's health," Olson states in the introduction of the NRDC 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the legislation argue that they are proposing the most 
cost-effective ways for municipal water systems to make the most-needed 
improvements, and they accuse the NRDC, in its report, of making EPA data look 
worse than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tactic to whip up public support by one side of a legislative 
contest," said Bruce Kuebler, director of water quality for the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebler said that his department is "technically" in violation of the act 
because it is late in complying with a 1993 regulation requiring additional 
treatment of water stored in exposed reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Complying is going to take us 10 years and cost several hundred million 
dollars," Kuebler said. "So, sure, you can say that's a violation. But it 
doesn't mean people are drinking contaminated water." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Fox, director of policy development at the EPA's Office of Water, said 
that Kuebler has a point. 
</P>
<P>
 "A violation doesn't necessarily translate into a threat to the public's 
health," Fox said. But he also said that, in general, the NRDC is not making 
too much out of the violations compiled by EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fair to say that the violations are indicative, in many cases, of a 
certain public health standard not being met," he said. "With a reported 
violation, a system is often saying, 'We don't have in place the facilities 
that can consistently provide the public the protection required under the 
law.' "

STABLE OWNER CHARGED IN CANDY HEIRESS BRACH'S DEATH; CRIME: THE WIDOW 
DISAPPEARED 17 YEARS AGO. THE SUSPECT IS ONE OF 23 INDICTED IN U.S. PROBE OF 
INSURANCE FRAUD AND CONFIDENCE SCHEMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It has been 17 years since 65-year-old candy heiress Helen Vorhees Brach 
disappeared, leaving behind a $17-million estate, an empty stone manor in an 
exclusive Chicago suburb and a mystery over the fate of a lonely widow with a 
weakness for sleek horses and suave gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a team of federal and state investigators said they have solved 
much of the mystery, outlining a case of murder that seems cast from a Dick 
Francis suspense novel, populated with high-society rogues and schemes 
involving fraudulent sales and brutal killings of rare-breed show horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Brach was last seen after finishing a regular medical checkup at the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., on Feb. 17, 1977. As her case grew cold, she was 
declared legally dead by a Cook County court and her fortune was divided up, 
left mostly to a charitable trust. A grainy final photograph of Brach, 
distributed over and over by desperate law enforcement authorities, was all 
that remained of a privileged life. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing Wednesday the indictment and arrest of Richard J. Bailey, 62, an 
affluent stable owner, federal prosecutors in Chicago said Brach had been 
murdered after she had become suspicious that Bailey had swindled her out of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent horse-buying deals. Bailey was 
held on charges of conspiring to murder Brach and on 28 other counts ranging 
from money-laundering to racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey arranged Brach's killing but did not commit the crime, said James B. 
Burns, U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois. He declined to say 
whether investigators know who killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who once sold Brach several thoroughbred horses for $300,000, was one 
of 23 people indicted Wednesday as part of a sweeping federal investigation 
into insurance fraud and confidence schemes in the upper echelons of the 
national show-horse circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicted along with Bailey were several prominent stable owners, equestrian 
riders, horse trainers and workers ranging from veterinarians to stable hands. 
Prosecutors said 19 of the suspects participated directly or indirectly in the 
execution of at least 15 show horses whose deaths were portrayed to insurance 
firms as accidental. Bailey was not charged in the horse deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animals were drugged. Others were bludgeoned to death. At least three, 
prosecutors said, were burned alive in their stables. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the dirty little secret of the industry and now it's coming out of the 
closet," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Miller, one of the prosecutors in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse show circuit thrives on a patrician audience, and some of its owners 
are among the nation's wealthiest families. The circuit stretches from popular 
venues in bluegrass towns like Raleigh, N.C., and Lexington, Ky., to wintertime 
haunts in South Florida and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exclusive sport for an exclusive group of people," said Terry McVey, 
president of Equine Adjusters Inc., which investigates insurance claims in the 
equestrian business. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the investigation, authorities said, is the plot to murder 
Brach, which involved Bailey and at least one other man among four defendants 
named in a string of extensive Chicago-area fraud schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities declined to disclose much of the details of Brach's murder 
and would not even say if they know where her body lies. But they alleged that 
Brach and 12 other wealthy women -- and perhaps many more -- were victims of 
Bailey's honeyed scams, each launched in the personal advertisement sections of 
local newspapers in Chicago's wealthy North Shore suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising as a horse breeder with expensive tastes, Bailey allegedly met and 
then wined and dined his victims, eventually persuading them to lend him money 
or put up tens of thousands of dollars for purchases of show horses. Most of 
the purchases were fraudulent, authorities said. The scams continued until "he 
got enough or they caught on," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Bailey "broke his way into their lives and hearts by telling them 
that he loved them and wanted to marry them." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were "victims who were alone in life due to the death of a spouse or 
divorce," Burns said. Brach, originally a country club hostess from Miami, 
retreated to her 18-room mansion after the death of her husband, candy 
executive Frank Brach, in 1970. 
</P>

 After her disappearance, police centered their suspicions on Jack Matlick, 
Brach's chauffeur and houseman, who claimed that he was the last to see her 
alive, when he drove her to O'Hare International Airport for a vacation flight 
to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, prosecutors declined to name Matlick or any other suspect 
besides Bailey in Brach's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll just have to wait for the trial," Miller said.

AMERICAN ALBUM: WOODSTOCK '94: WILL IT PLAY WITH MTV CROWD?; 25 YEARS LATER, 
COUNTDOWN IS UNDER WAY FOR AUGUST EVENT. KEY FOCUS IS SECURITY, SAFETY.

 It is hardly a mellow, tie-dyed happening. A quarter of a century after 
Woodstock, promoters are scrambling to leave little to chance this time on the 
fringes of this picturesque Hudson Valley village. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews have built two huge tanks on the Winston Farm, each holding 
1 million gallons of water. Workers have stretched 25,000 feet of pipes leading 
to drinking stations. Security personnel have erected more than 10 miles of 
chain-link fence surrounding the property. Police will patrol on horseback and 
with all-terrain vehicles. Checkpoints will be set up on local roads. 
Contingency plans are in place for mass arrests of gate-crashers. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts have mapped locations for two field hospitals and helicopter 
landing pads. Tow truck operators have been recruited to remove any cars 
abandoned by fans, who will pay hefty fines to retrieve them. In the heat and 
humidity of late July, the assault against mosquitoes and poison ivy is about 
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The countdown to Woodstock '94 on Aug. 12-14 is nearing completion. Amid the 
bustle of construction, it is hard to imagine the sign that graced Max Yasgur's 
Farm, where the original Woodstock Festival was held, being placed on the 
Winston Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't bother Max's cows. Let them moo in peace," that sign said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five presidents have passed, the Cold War has ended and the information 
superhighway has been created in the years since 400,000 young people gathered 
in rain, mud and tribalism on Yasgur's farm in Bethel, N.Y. -- about 60 miles 
from here -- to cheer artists ranging from Jimi Hendrix to Ravi Shankar and to 
protest the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout was a huge surprise. Abandoned cars clogged all roads for miles, 
leading Wes Pomeroy, Woodstock's security director, to lament: "Anyone who 
tries to come here is crazy. Sullivan County is a great big parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Serious shortages of food and medical supplies raised fears of an epidemic. 
One hundred campfires alone were fed by fence posts. Physicians treated 4,000 
people for illnesses, injuries and adverse drug reactions, although the crowd 
was peaceful. Hendrix closed Woodstock with a searing version of the National 
Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, Yasgur looked over his littered acres. "What happened . 
. . was that these young people, together with our local residents, turned the 
Aquarian Festival into a dramatic victory for the spirit of peace, goodwill and 
human kindness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year-old college student from Ohio added a codicil. "There was so much 
grass being smoked last night that you could get stoned just sitting there 
breathing," she said. "It got so you didn't even want another drag of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, the Woodstock generation is grayer, thicker at the 
waist and saddled with mortgages. Planners of Woodstock '94, realizing that 
nostalgia alone could be a tough sell to the MTV generation, are installing a 
six-acre, multimedia "Surreal Field." Sponsors include Apple Computer and 
Philips Media, which will have a 90-station play tent where visitors can 
experience hands-on interactive technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Surreal Field" is aimed squarely at what its architect, Danny Socolof, 
calls "the first postgraduates of Nintendo University." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not content to sit back and watch. They want to participate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also call for up to 250,000 festival-goers at Woodstock '94 to be 
screened: Not only are drugs and alcohol forbidden, so are video cameras, tape 
recorders, pets, stoves, grills and cooking utensils. Food is in the purview of 
the concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodstock Nation has met merchandising -- and merchandising has won. The 
festival has the backing of PolyGram Diversified Entertainment. Tickets cost 
$138 each and have to be bought in groups of four. Portions of the concert -- 
which will feature more than 30 groups, including Aerosmith, Johnny Cash, 
Crosby Stills and Nash, Bob Dylan and the Red Hot Chili Peppers -- will be 
carried live on pay-per-view TV. Plans also include a concert movie, album and 
perhaps as a spin-off, a chain of Woodstock cafes. A commemorative plate will 
be offered on the QVC home shopping network. 
</P>
<P>
 At Seasons, a stationery store in Saugerties, the shelves are stocked with 
T-shirts, buttons, dog tags, posters, trading cards, beer steins, shot glasses 
and coffee mugs licensed by PolyGram. "I'm excited about it. . . . It has been 
very good for business," said Susan Brilbeck, the store's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Business can use the boost. Unemployment has been high in the Hudson Valley 
after IBM laid off thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 For many residents, the excitement is mixed with apprehension. Normally, the 
biggest event in Saugerties, a town of 18,500 people, is the annual garlic 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reassure property owners, concert promoters held local 
meetings and pointed to extensive preparations by New York state officials, who 
do not want -- especially in a year when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is facing his 
toughest reelection fight -- a repeat of problems of the original Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 But some anxiety remains. "We have had several meetings on security and the 
cops say they have 400 state police and 140 county police and town police," 
said Ed Reppert, whose property borders the Winston Farm. "I asked how long it 
would take to get someone to my home, and they didn't answer."

ONE SAILOR'S FATE EXEMPLIFIES RUSSIAN MILITARY'S GRIM REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sailor Marat Miftakhov was looking forward to finishing his 18 months of 
mandatory military service and spending his 20th birthday at home with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama, please cook as much food as you can.I will come home and eat 
everything," he wrote from his ship in the port of Severomorsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Marat died May 16, six days before his birthday. His commander told Marat's 
father that the boy had hanged himself. Marat's body was sent home to 
Chelyabinsk in a sealed zinc coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Miftakhovs are ethnic Tatars, whose religious law requires them 
to wash a body before burial. They forced open the coffin. When they saw the 
marks on Marat's body, they felt sure their son had been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 A severe bruise on Marat's forehead had been covered with makeup, according to 
the letter demanding a criminal investigation that Marat's father, Rashit 
Miftakhov, wrote to the public prosecutor. The boy had a puncture wound in the 
back of his head, a wound to his ear, strangle marks on his neck and scratches 
all over. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most horrifying about Marat's case is that it no longer even shocks 
most Russians. Since glasnost lifted a corner of the curtain of Soviet military 
secrecy in 1989, families of slain soldiers have been protesting the hundreds 
of deaths that the military has ruled suicides even though the evidence screams 
foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's request for a criminal investigation has been granted, but Rashit 
Miftakhov does not think he will ever learn the truth about why Marat died. And 
he believes those responsible will never be brought to justice. "There is this 
military machine that thinks that everything is permissible," he said.

DEFECTOR CLAIMS NORTH KOREA HAS 5 NUCLEAR BOMBS; ASIA: U.S. DOUBTS REMARKS BY 
MAN IDENTIFIED AS PREMIER'S SON-IN-LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A defector identified as the son-in-law of North Korea's prime minister 
declared Wednesday that Pyongyang has already built five nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Seoul, Kang Myong Do said the security chief at the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, told him that North 
Korea intends to announce its development of nuclear weapons after building 
five more. He added that assembly-line production of missiles to carry the 
warheads is expected in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang offered no documentation for his claims, and the U.S. State Department 
cast doubt on their reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, his statement marked the first time that any defector from North 
Korea has charged that the Stalinist nation has already constructed nuclear 
bombs. The remarks also came from one of the most elite North Koreans ever to 
defect -- a member of the Kim family clan that dominates the ruling group. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang, 35, is married to the only daughter of North Korean Prime Minister Kang 
Song San. He defected in May and was subjected to two months of detention and 
interrogation by South Korea's Agency for National Security Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's news conference, which was tainted with obvious South Korean 
propaganda, was staged by the intelligence agency. It was timed to coincide 
with the 41st anniversary of the armistice ending the 1950-53 Korean War -- a 
day that North Korea celebrates as "Victory Day" commemorating the "defeat" of 
American "aggressors." 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea early today angrily denounced South Korea for putting a "criminal" 
defector on show in Seoul and flatly denied Kang is related to the North's 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The official Korean Central News Agency accused the South of jeopardizing 
reconciliation of the two Koreas and of brainwashing Kang to report that the 
North has developed five nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pyongyang, both Prime Minister Kang and Kim Jong Il, the country's new 
leader, failed to attend the Victory Day celebration, a major Communist event. 
</P>
<P>
 Their absence, combined with the younger Kang's declarations, raised new 
questions about what is happening in North Korea, where President Kim Il Sung, 
82, died of a heart attack July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victory Day commemoration was the second occasion since his father's death 
that Kim Jong Il, who has never been known to give a speech, failed to use a 
natural opportunity to deliver an address. A speech was read on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference in Seoul, Kang said he was told that North Korea has 
not yet admitted it has built the bombs because it fears "the international 
community would impose sanctions upon us and we would not be able to build any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bombs are being built to provide defense against threats from the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between the United States and North Korea over the nuclear issue 
are scheduled to resume Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Agency officials in Tokyo noted that neither the United States nor 
Japan believes North Korea possesses enough plutonium to build five bombs. The 
CIA estimates that it has enough plutonium to have built only one or two. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Kang's statements 
"are not consistent with information within our own intelligence community." 
</P>
<P>
 Kang, vice president of a trading company run by the North Korean president's 
office, is a distant relative of Kim Il Sung on his father's side. His 
father-in-law, the North Korean prime minister, is a cousin of the late 
dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 To establish his identity, Kang provided South Korean intelligence officials 
with family photos of himself with his wife -- whom he left behind in the North 
-- and the prime minister. He also had a passport and other official documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters were shown a photograph of Kang and his wife flanking Prime Minister 
Kang, 63, who was most recently ranked No. 3 in the North Korean hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang said he sought asylum when he suspected that his position with the 
trading firm had become threatened.

BRAZILIAN REPLACES RUNNING MATE IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil's leftist presidential contender Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva changed 
his vice presidential running mate Wednesday, choosing his closest economic 
strategist to campaign with him in a bid to halt a recent slide in opinion 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloizio Mercadante, a leading member of Lula's Workers' Party, was selected 
for the party's vice presidential ticket at an overnight meeting between the 
party and its allies that ended early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaced Socialist Sen. Jose Paulo Bisol, who has been embroiled for almost 
a month in a dispute over alleged financial irregularities and nepotism -- 
charges denied by Bisol. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula and the Workers' Party leadership originally stood by Bisol. But as the 
dispute unfolded, polls showed Lula losing the big lead he had held in the race 
for the presidential elections, the first round of which begins Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll by the private Ibope group published Wednesday showed Lula's lead over 
his closest rival, former Economy Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, falling 
to just three percentage points from 15 points two weeks ago.

POLICE SEEK BROTHER OF ITALY PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Italian police were seeking the brother of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on 
Wednesday after magistrates ordered his arrest for suspected corruption in the 
latest blow to the battered right-wing government. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest warrant was issued as prosecutors examined allegations that tax 
examiners were bribed in exchange for approval of doctored books at 
Berlusconi's firm Fininvest. 
</P>
<P>
 The whereabouts of Paolo Berlusconi, who heads the family's property 
businesses, were unknown, but judicial sources speculated he might surrender 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolo Berlusconi already faces trial in two other corruption cases.

RELIEF STARTS MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR REFUGEES; AFRICA: RWANDANS IN ZAIRE 
RECEIVE CRITICAL SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND MEDICINE. SOME AID EVEN COMES FROM 
SOMALIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One camp is in a sports center, the other in a rocky field. Each is swamped 
with sick and dying Rwandans. And both received desperately needed medical help 
from the outside world Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There the similarities end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goma Cercle Sportif houses 2,400 ill and wounded soldiers, officers and 
political agents of the former Rwandan army, a force accused of widespread 
atrocities as it fought and lost a civil war to prop up a murderous regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, the S.O.S. Orphanage houses nearly 4,000 Rwandan children whose 
parents were killed or have disappeared. From 6 months to 10 years old, the 
lonely children are among the saddest victims of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is a measure of the chaos and misery here that the United Nations 
Children's Fund (UNICEF) rushed an 11-member anti-cholera team and four tons of 
supplies to the orphanage from a country better known for receiving emergency 
aid than for sending it: Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to round-the-clock relief flights and to a growing lifeline of truck 
convoys, critical supplies of food, medicine and other emergency goods are 
finally pouring into Goma, hub of the global effort to aid an estimated 1.2 
million Rwandans who flooded across the border almost two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more specialized aid is going to groups largely overshadowed or 
forgotten until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli military, for example, arrived Monday to erect a 250-bed field 
hospital on the shores of Lake Kivu. But the 50 Israeli doctors, nurses and 
technicians will treat few refugees and focus instead on helping residents of 
this once-obscure border town. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Zairians, even prisoners in the city jail, have been stricken by 
the still-raging cholera epidemic that is now killing an estimated 1,800 
refugees a day. Goma is considered the center of the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Other humanitarian aid goes to a little-known walled camp specifically set up 
for thousands of ethnic Tutsis who fled Rwanda before the current crisis. They 
are kept separate from the other refugees for understandable reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to half a million civilians, mostly Tutsis, were butchered by the majority 
Hutu army and civilian militias after the country's Hutu president died April 6 
in a still unexplained plane crash. But when the Hutu army was routed by the 
Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Hutu population and their leaders fled 
in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Now members of the exiled government and militias are regrouping in the 
refugee camps. They are largely responsible for distributing the hundreds of 
tons of food brought in each day by relief groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the aid finally reached the Rwandan soldiers at the sports center 
Wednesday. But more than 1,000 of the wounded already had died. A rutted tennis 
court was turned into an open-air morgue, and gaunt bodies in tattered uniforms 
were dumped in rows awaiting burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a small building were piles of crates from Norway's Red Cross. Dr. 
Halvor Fossum Lauritzsen supervised as the dark, dank rooms were mopped so they 
could house a mobile surgical hospital, complete with two operating theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauritzsen said surgical teams expect to operate on about 40 soldiers daily. 
"We'll deal mostly with gunshot wounds," he said. "They are badly infected with 
gangrene. There's going to be a lot of amputations." 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Winqvist, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross 
here, said her organization's mandate is to treat all those wounded or affected 
by war, not just civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very dangerous path to start moralizing in war, to say who is good, 
who is bad, who should live and who should die," she said. "That is not for the 
Red Cross to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, new aid also appeared at the orphanage, which is set on a rocky 
field pitted by ravines and straggly patches of cassava. The 11-member UNICEF 
team bustled about in white T-shirts, but Awilhagil Ali, a Somali public health 
officer, stopped to shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions here are worse than in Somalia, and the population is much 
larger," he said, referring to last year's international operation to feed 
Somalia's starving population. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ahmad, a Somali hydrologist, agreed as he worked nearby. "In Somalia, at 
least we had coordination. Here there is no coordination." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffan de Mistura -- the UNICEF representative in the Somali capital, 
Mogadishu, and head of the anti-cholera team -- said far more refugees are 
crowded together here without proper housing or sanitation than during the 
Somalia crisis. And many are already sick and exhausted by the long trek from 
Rwanda and the horrible conditions in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is here we are not being shot at," he said with a grin. He said 
the members of his medical team wear bulletproof vests in Mogadishu for 
protection from the country's fratricidal clan wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, four young Hutu men had approached the camp earlier and demanded entry, 
De Mistura said. "One man said he had a grenade. We said they can't come in, or 
over our dead bodies. They got very agitated and said they'll be back. But 
we've been too busy to worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 De Mistura said about 20% of the children at the camp have cholera and that 58 
had died so far. "The situation is appalling," he said. "But I believe it will 
change in the next three days." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the team will dig six latrines and that UNICEF trucks will bring clean 
drinking water twice a day. Since chlorine kills the cholera bacteria, shallow 
wells of chlorinated water will be dug outside for the children and camp 
workers to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF's four doctors joined three already here, giving the children far more 
medical attention than other refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 newly arrived children were immunized Wednesday for measles and 
polio, and screened by a doctor. A dozen others lined up to be washed, while a 
crowd of half-naked children waited with plastic cups at a feeding center for 
steaming dollops of high-protein gruel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens sat on the ground in a tent, clapping their hands as an animated man 
sang to them through a bullhorn. Others wandered about in freshly washed 
donated clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of new white canvas tents stood in the sun, a carpenter sawed away 
noisily and boys laughed as they played in the water that gushed from a ripped 
hose. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Dr. Lalani Nimet, the ever-harried camp doctor who has seemed to work in 
perpetual motion during the past week, slowed from a run to a fast walk as she 
talked. For the first time, she even smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK now," she said with a grin. "We've got doctors, nurses, food and 
water. I'm feeling on holiday today."

CLINTON MAY DISPATCH 2,000 U.S. TROOPS TO RWANDA; MILITARY: SOLDIERS WOULD AID 
RETURNING REFUGEES. DECISION AWAITS REPORT ON AIRPORT'S CAPABILITY, ASSURANCES

 The Clinton Administration is considering sending at least 2,000 U.S. troops 
to Rwanda to help set up a relief network for refugees returning from Zaire, 
but the President still has not made a final decision on the plan, senior 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is awaiting a U.S. assessment team's recommendation on whether the 
airport in Kigali, the capital, can be upgraded to handle additional relief 
traffic -- and the new Rwandan government's assurances that refugees who return 
home will not be subject to reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers met to review the issue 
Wednesday, but officials said they took no action. The White House said Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry will travel to the area this weekend to survey the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Pentagon has drafted a contingency plan to dispatch 2,000 
U.S. military personnel to Rwanda -- possibly as early as next week, should the 
President give the go-ahead. The troops would come from the U.S. European 
Command, based in Stuttgart, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would involve setting up a series of "way stations" from Goma, 
Zaire, where 1.2 million refugees are now camped, back toward Kigali to help 
provide food, shelter and medical care and to help guarantee refugees' safety 
as they make their return march. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that the number of U.S. 
troops in the immediate region, including Uganda and Zaire, already is likely 
to surge to about 4,000 within a week -- and could swell more if Clinton 
decides to send troops into Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's new proposal also calls for expanding the current effort 
to combat the cholera epidemic sweeping the refugee camps around Goma. The 
disease has killed thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Americans would be part of a combined operation involving 
contingents from several U.N. countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration was forced to acknowledge its plans before it was ready 
after details of the operation were disclosed at a news conference in Stuttgart 
on Wednesday by Gen. George A. Joulwan, commander of U.S. forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that a major reason for sending U.S. troops into Rwanda would 
be to help convince those who fled the country that they would be safe if they 
decided to return. The huge flow of refugees has swamped neighboring Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Administration has been trying to make sure that, before it 
attempts such an operation, it has assurances that the new rebel government 
will cooperate with U.S. forces and will not harm any of the returning 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rawson, the U.S. special envoy to Rwanda, has been negotiating with the 
new government, but he has had only limited success. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States still has not recognized the government, which was formed by 
the rebel Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front but has a president and prime 
minister from the Hutu majority, which ruled Rwanda before it was overthrown 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has come under increasing criticism for not acting sooner to stem the 
carnage in Rwanda. Perry on Wednesday called the situation there "a tragedy of 
unprecedented proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Washington has limited its involvement in the Rwandan problem to 
humanitarian aid efforts. Policy-makers fear that taking on a wider military 
role could lead to a situation such as the one in Somalia, where 42 Americans 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has 750 troops in Goma, where it has been setting up 
water-purification equipment to help fight the cholera epidemic. The system is 
providing almost 100,000 gallons of water daily and is expected to produce 1 
million gallons a day by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Washington is encouraged because the new government has 
agreed to allow human rights monitors to re-enter the country, but that it 
wants Rwandan authorities to extend a formal invitation to U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clinton's own advisers appear to be split on the issue. Although 
Perry is said to support the plan to send troops, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher reportedly has been wary, for fear that such a move might embroil 
U.S. forces in full-fledged peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation in Rwanda is far from stable. Despite the apparent truce there, 
Pentagon officials said the armies of the two warring parties are still camped 
at opposite ends of the runway in Kigali and that no one is sure whether either 
side will back away.

CLINTON APPEALS FOR BIPARTISAN HEALTH BILL; REFORM: HE SAYS HE 'DESPERATELY' 
WANTS REPUBLICANS TO HELP BUT THAT THEY HAVE REBUFFED HIM. DOLE REPLIES NATION 
MIGHT NOT WANT ANY ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The political rhetoric over health care reform took on an even harder edge 
Wednesday as President Clinton proclaimed that he "desperately" wants a 
bipartisan bill but that Republicans retreat each time he reaches out to them. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP leaders were unmoved by Clinton's plaintive entreaty during a South Lawn 
rally commemorating the enactment of the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't pass it, my view is there might be a big sigh of relief around 
the country," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) as he emerged from 
a GOP strategy session. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange came as Democratic leaders in both houses raced to complete 
separate health care reform bills for floor debate early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 With the broad outlines of the House Democratic leadership bill already known, 
focus is riveted on the efforts of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) to craft a compromise that stands some chance of passage -- "a 
difficult task," he conceded good-naturedly Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its current state, Mitchell's bill would seek universal coverage without 
imposing an employer mandate unless voluntary measures failed to provide 
coverage to at least 95% of the population, perhaps by the year 2001. Even 
then, sources said, it would exempt some small businesses -- the most vocal 
opponents of an employer mandate in any form. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also said Wednesday that a competing provision being floated privately 
would impose an employer mandate only on a state-by-state basis. In essence, 
just states that had not reached a target for coverage -- probably 95% of their 
populations -- by a certain date would be subject to a requirement for an 
employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill, being assembled by Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.), is a virtual clone of that produced by the Ways and Means Committee 
and could be ready by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said Wednesday that his bill will be ready either by the end of this 
week or early next. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maine senator declined to reveal specifics of his emerging bill but said 
that it will offer the country a "coherent, rational program" to overhaul the 
nation's health care system, which represents one-seventh of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 With a scheduled monthlong recess to begin on Aug. 13, time is running out on 
Congress to debate and enact comprehensive reform, a fact that both Mitchell 
and Dole addressed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once debate begins, Mitchell said, he intends to keep the Senate going six 
days a week and "stay in session until we finish -- however long it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole predictably took a different tack. He demanded that Republicans be given 
a week off "without interruption" to study the Democratic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the rush on this bill that's not even going to take effect for five 
years?" Dole demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, meanwhile, got some additional room to negotiate when Sen. John B. 
Breaux (D-La.) said that he and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) will not put 
forward their latest health reform proposal until they see Mitchell's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux has been at the center of a group of moderate Republicans and 
conservative Democrats who could become the swing votes when the bill reaches 
the Senate floor. The group opposes any type of mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Breaux and Lieberman produced their own plan, it could have distracted and 
divided senators at a critical moment while Mitchell is trying to forge a 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House ceremony attended by thousands of guests, including many in 
wheelchairs, the President was joined by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended as a celebration of the enactment of the disabilities law, the event 
instead became something of a pep rally for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 With a supportive, chanting crowd, the President made a spirited pitch for the 
central element of his reform agenda: workplace-based insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen no one yet who has come up with a better idea than shared 
responsibility between employers and employees for private health insurance in 
our private health care system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I desperately want a bipartisan bill," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have reached out to members of the other party . . . " he continued. "But 
every time I have reached out, they have moved further away." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Clinton referred to a bill authored by Sen. John H. Chafee 
(R-R.I.) that sought to provide universal coverage -- Clinton's bottom-line 
goal -- by requiring individuals to buy insurance. Dole initially was a 
co-sponsor, but he no longer supports the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas Republican also has backed away from his earlier endorsements of 
Clinton's characterization that a health care "crisis" existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his criticisms of GOP tactics, the President concluded his remarks by 
urging bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us discard politics," he said. "And let our focus be simply this: What 
will work? I have no pride of authorship, nothing would please me more than if 
somebody else's name, a hundred names, four hundred names, five hundred names 
in both houses of Congress would be on a health care bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the guests at the White House rally later lobbied for health reform on 
Capitol Hill and some were among the more than 40 persons arrested for 
attempting to stage a sit-in in Dole's office.

GOP'S BIG GUNS RAKE CLINTON'S HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICY; POLITICS: BAKER, 
JOINED BY CHENEY, KISSINGER AND KIRKPATRICK, LEADS CHARGE AGAINST PRESIDENT. 
THEY ASSAIL POLICIES ON HAITI AND NORTH KOREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented partisan broadside, four of the Republican Party's biggest 
foreign policy guns raked President Clinton on Wednesday for undermining U.S. 
prestige abroad, weakening U.S. defenses and -- most of all -- being 
inconsistent in his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Haiti, the Administration seems to have changed policies more often than 
most of us change our shirts -- and it's July in Washington," said former 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who led the charge against the White 
House at a foreign policy forum sponsored by the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the attack against Clinton's handling of foreign affairs were former 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and 
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with verbally cuffing Clinton before about 200 Republican contributors 
and aides to former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the four 
Republicans offered Clinton some unsolicited advice on global issues: don't 
invade Haiti and take a tougher stance in dealing with North Korea's burgeoning 
nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Their far-ranging assault represented an extraordinary development in American 
politics, where both parties have hewed to the tradition of foreign policy 
bipartisanship in word, if not always in deed, for most of the post-World War 
II era. Most of the debate that has taken place has been over specific issues 
in presidential election years. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the decision to break with past custom is the conviction -- widely 
held by GOP strategists and privately acknowledged by their Democratic 
counterparts -- that foreign policy represents a huge chink in Clinton's 
political armor. 
</P>
<P>
 This judgment is supported by results from the latest Los Angeles Times Poll. 
Only 38% of those interviewed in the survey approved of the President's 
handling of foreign policy, compared with 45% who approved of his overall job 
rating. And only 15% believed that he is leading the country in a clear 
direction on foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having watched an Administration that has no foreign policy at all, we feel 
Republicans have an obligation to put forward their own views," national 
committee Chairman Haley Barbour said at the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican professionals said they doubt that any particular foreign policy 
issue will play a prominent part in this fall's election campaign. But several 
interviewed at last weekend's fall campaign strategy meeting of the Republican 
National Committee in Los Angeles said that, by hammering the President on this 
weak point, they can reduce his overall value to the Democrats and boost their 
own candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to call him on the carpet for his foreign policy positions, 
and the more his numbers decline the more people will stand up and question 
what he does," said GOP pollster Anthony Fabrizio. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP report card on Clinton's diplomacy was not all F's. Baker, designated 
as chairman of the forum, gave him good marks for gaining congressional 
approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and negotiating a new world 
trade agreement, both of which he pointed out were Republican initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 He also commended the President for his success in helping to reduce tension 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But by and large, Baker charged, in its policies on Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, 
North Korea and Japan, the Clinton Administration has "squandered American 
credibility and undermined our preeminence around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his recommendations is the setting of priorities abroad. "All our 
interests are not equal," Baker said, arguing that a nuclear threat from North 
Korea is "a far greater threat" to the United States than the instability of 
the Haitian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar vein, Cheney, who called the Administration "one of the least 
competent of the 20th Century" in its management of foreign policy, asked: "Why 
would we want to invade Haiti and what would we do with it once we'd got it?" 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he viewed North Korea as far more dangerous, not only to the 
37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea but to the balance of power in Asia. He urged 
Clinton to give notice that he reserved the right to use "any means at his 
disposal," not excluding nuclear weapons to counter aggression from North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney also chided Clinton for cutting back defense forces as if the Bush 
Administration in which he served had not already made significant reductions. 
And he cited evidence of "a declining readiness" on the part of the U.S. 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkpatrick chided Clinton for depending too much on "multilateralism," 
specifically, the United Nations, instead of mustering this country's own 
resources and prestige to carry out his goals abroad. "We can only do good in 
the world if we have the power to do good," she said. "But that power is being 
neglected and dissipated." 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Kissinger said that Clinton's approach to foreign policy owes 
more to theory than to practical understanding. He was reminded, he said, of 
the man who suggested that the way to deal with the menace of German submarines 
during World War II was to heat the ocean and boil them to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he would accomplish this, he replied: "I've given you the idea, the 
technical implementation is up to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kissinger: "It is one thing to talk about the enlargement of democracy 
but in foreign policy the problem is what are you going to do about it, how 
much are you willing to pay for it and what is the operational method for 
carrying it out."

ESPY CALLS TAINTED MEAT SERIOUS PROBLEM; FOOD: THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS 
INSPECTIONS HAVE IMPROVED SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE BUT AGREES THAT CONTAMINATION 
WITH BACTERIA IS A 'TIME BOMB.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy acknowledged Wednesday that the nation's meat 
and poultry supply has serious contamination problems that are far from solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy insisted that the Agriculture Department's meat inspection system is 
better than the one he inherited 19 months ago and that the department is 
making progress fighting the growing threat from potentially harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he agreed with a scientific group's recent claim that bacterial 
contamination is a "time bomb" waiting to explode into human illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not an overstatement because the bomb has already gone off with the 
deaths from E. coli (linked to contaminated ground meat) in Washington state, 
New Jersey, Texas and elsewhere, as many as 360 each year," he said. "We are 
trying to disassemble the bomb but we have a way to go before declaring 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy granted a series of interviews Wednesday, apparently as part of a public 
relations offensive meant to counter recent news stories alleging a possible 
conflict of interest because of his relationship with Arkansas-based Tyson 
Foods Inc., the nation's leading poultry producer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department is considering the appointment of a special prosecutor 
to investigate Espy's acceptance of travel and entertainment from Tyson at a 
time when the Agriculture Department was considering tough new regulations for 
chicken processors. The agriculture secretary later reimbursed Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not the issue and have not done anything wrong," he said. "And I can't 
wait to prove it. If Tyson had been a Massachusetts-based company then Mike 
Espy would not be having these problems. There is an obsession with the 
President's connections in Arkansas and everything is seized upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said improving the food safety system has been his priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said his critics come from all quarters: the food industry, the consumer 
advocacy movement and within the USDA bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone too far for some and not far enough for others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy was critical of former agriculture officials who, he said, knew about the 
danger of the E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria in ground meat since the early 1980s and 
did nothing about it. The nation's largest outbreak of E. coli erupted on the 
Pacific Coast in January, 1993, with more than 500 illnesses and four deaths. 
Washington state health officials alerted Espy's department about the unfolding 
outbreak on his third day as secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Espy said, the government has launched 70 initiatives to improve 
the safety of meat and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures are an increase in the number of inspectors, enforcement of 
the longstanding zero-tolerance standard for feces on beef carcasses, 
development of a similar zero tolerance regulation for poultry and introduction 
of mandatory safe handling instructions for consumers on packages of all raw 
meats and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the long-term threat from contamination will not be stemmed by simple 
changes in an inspection system that still relies on sight, touch and smell. 
Harmful bacteria are microscopic and can only be detected through 
time-consuming laboratory tests now beyond the government's capability. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, in 
a report on changes at Espy's department, said the recent efforts have "neither 
dealt with the inspection system's inherent weaknesses nor fundamentally 
changed the system's reliance on sensory inspection methods." The department is 
only "marginally better" at protecting the public from bacteria, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said the department is experimenting with a new rapid testing method for 
beef that would allow inspectors to determine the overall presence of bacteria 
on carcasses before they enter retail channels. A similar procedure for poultry 
is also being developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional hearings next week will consider the Agriculture Department's 
request for the authority to recall suspected contaminated meat and poultry. 
The department now must rely on the goodwill of firms for such recalls. Espy 
said he also wants authority to require ranch, feedlot, slaughter and 
processing facilities to maintain detailed records so problem carcasses can be 
traced.

PACIFIC NORTHWEST FIRES RAGE THROUGH 60,000 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wildfires raged across more than 60,000 acres of Oregon and Washington state 
Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of several hundred people and burning homes, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tyee Creek fire burning in central Washington's Wenatchee National Forest 
had grown to 20,000 acres, said Roberta Hillbruner, spokeswoman for the 
Northwest Interagency Coordination Center in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated 400 people from their homes in the Entiat Valley, where 
at least 13 homes burned, she said. No one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Mike Lowry, who observed the fire from the air on Wednesday, was told the 
blaze could grow to cover 50,000 acres before it is contained. 
</P>
<P>
 In north-central Oregon, a range fire on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation 
exploded from 11,000 to 25,000 acres overnight. The fire destroyed one house 
and forced the evacuation of residents from 50 other homes near the Kah-Nee-Ta 
Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no estimate of when either fire would be contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews also fought 11 other major fires in Washington and seven in Oregon, 
Hillbruner said, in addition to numerous smaller fires. A total of 3,500 state, 
federal and tribal firefighters have been deployed in the two states. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires included a cluster of four fires burning on more than 3,000 acres of 
the Yakima Indian Reservation in central Washington, a 6,400-acre range fire 
near the John Day River in central Oregon and a 3,900-acre forest fire in the 
Kalmiopsis Wilderness of southwestern Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received 3,500 lightning strikes Sunday night," Hillbruner said. "That's 
what touched off the fires. It has been hot, dry and windy. The fires are on a 
rampage." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Lowry declared a state of emergency Tuesday night after receiving word of 
the destruction caused by the Tyee Creek fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon Gov. Barbara Roberts invoked the state's Conflagration Act, which 
allowed her to order local fire departments to send personnel and equipment to 
assist federal and state firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, workers built firebreaks Wednesday around the largest set of 
fires remaining from a series touched off by dry lightning in the Klamath 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, more than 6,200 acres were burned in the state and roughly 1,600 
firefighters were at work.

FATHER IN DAY-CARE CUSTODY BATTLE CHARGED WITH ASSAULT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A father who won custody of his 3-year-old daughter because the mother puts 
the girl in day care while attending college pleaded innocent Wednesday to 
assaulting the woman in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A misdemeanor arrest warrant for Steven Smith, 20, was issued in October but 
was never acted on by the sheriff's office until this week, after the 
discrepancy was reported in the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Boedecker, a Macomb County counsel, said the sheriff's department either 
never received the warrant "or if they did, one way or another, it fell through 
the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Judge Raymond Cashen took sole custody of the girl away from 
Jennifer Ireland, 19, because the child's paternal grandmother could care for 
her full time. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision brought expressions of outrage from working parents across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the alleged assault, Cashen said in his ruling that "the issue of 
domestic violence is not pertinent here." 
</P>
<P>
 "The parties in their youthful way apparently crashed or mauled one another," 
his ruling said. "It is all superfluous and can have no bearing on this issue 
of custody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland, who would share legal custody and get visitation on alternate 
weekends, holidays and other times, planned to appeal the custody case. For 
now, Maranda Ireland-Smith lives with her mother and spends about 35 hours a 
week in day care near the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Ireland claims that Smith assaulted her in 
December, 1992, during a visit to see their daughter, saying he grabbed her, 
shook her and pushed her into a wall. A friend of Ireland's said she witnessed 
the incident, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's attorney, Sharon-Lee Edwards, told the Macomb Daily of Mt. Clemens 
that the allegations were false. "Anyone can file charges," Edwards said. "She 
has filed many complaints. She has filed stalking complaints and all kinds of 
complaints. It's outrageous."

PRESS PANEL CALLS 'POLITICAL CORRECTNESS' BASIC FAIRNESS; MINORITIES: UNITY 
CONFERENCE MEMBERS SAY AVOIDING DEMEANING TERMS IS SIMPLY GOOD JOURNALISM. IT 
IS SEEN AS PROMOTING A TOLERANT DISCUSSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years many conservative writers have complained that the "political 
correctness mind-set" has infected academia and the press. They say white males 
have been made the victims of derision, or worse, simply because they used an 
ill-advised term. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday evening, a panel of minority journalists and prominent newspaper 
executives who are meeting here this week went on the counterattack. They 
argued that it is simply good journalism, as well as basic fairness, to 
describe people without using demeaning terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we want a civilized, tolerant discussion. And when we start labeling 
folks, it cuts off the discussion," said David Lawrence, publisher of the Miami 
Herald, during a session at the "Unity '94" conference, a joint meeting of 
groups representing black, Latino, Asian and Native American journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle with language is a worthy task for a newspaper," added Los 
Angeles Times editor Shelby Coffey III. Last year The Times revised its 
guidelines for terms used in ethnic and racial identification. Under the 
guidelines, for example, the term illegal immigrants is preferable to illegal 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey said the diverse readers in a major urban area simply demand "some 
recognition, some respect, and to be listened to." As for political 
correctness, "I think the term ought to be quickly retired," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal, said he was not ready to 
give up a term that his editorial page has done so much to promote. It was 
Bartley's editorials that drew much of the national attention to the case of 
the University of Pennsylvania freshman who was disciplined because he leaned 
out a dormitory window and shouted to a group of black women, "Shut up, you 
water buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, (political correctness) means the use of peer pressure to enforce a 
certain mind-set," he said, and not always regarding matters of race, ethnicity 
or gender. "Clearly there is a politically correct view on the environment," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wall Street Journal editor conceded that it is a mistake to toss 
around demeaning terms, even when they are used to make an ironic point. He 
recalled with regret that his editorial page had used the word "wetbacks" in a 
headline on a commentary about immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I kind of agree that some words are so powerful they interfere with 
communication," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some minority journalists said the press needs to go much further to clean up 
its language. Consider the routine use of words such as "Redskins" and "Braves" 
as names for professional sports teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the last vestiges of overt racism that is acceptable, that is 
right out in the open," said Suzan Shown Harjo, a Cheyenne woman. She and other 
Native American journalists say the continued use of such terms fosters the 
stereotype that the native people were violent and aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Sacramento Bee angered many of its black readers by printing 
a cartoon showing a Ku Klux Klansman uttering a racial slur to praise Nation of 
Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan. Cartoonist Dennis Renault said he sought to 
convey the idea that racism was evil, whether fostered by Farrakhan or a 
klansman. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the panelists said the cartoon did not work as humor and 
needlessly offended readers by printing a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Stanley Crouch, an author and contributing editor of the New 
Republic, noted that rap artists routinely use racial slurs, even as titles for 
their works. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the panelists said mainstream media must be held to a higher standard. 
"You can't use rappers as an excuse," said Juan R. Palomo, a columnist for the 
Houston Post. "The reality is shaped by the people in power. This is about 
respecting people and respecting their sensibilities."

CONFEREES ENDORSE BAN ON 19 KINDS OF ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A joint congressional committee approved Wednesday a ban on 19 types of 
semiautomatic assault weapons as part of a sweeping crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference committee of representatives and senators is trying to resolve 
differences over crime bills the Senate passed last November and the House 
approved in April. 
</P>
<P>
 House members of the conference voted, 6 to 4, to include the gun ban in the 
crime bill. Senate conference members had approved the ban, 5 to 4, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These assault weapons do not belong on our streets. They were made for one 
purpose, to kill as many people as possible," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer 
(D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.) said the ban would do little to reduce violent 
crime. "The bad guys will continue to procure these weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton strongly supports the ban, but the National Rifle Assn. 
opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The final version of the bill as approved by the conference must pass both the 
House and Senate. Rep. James F. Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) said the gun ban 
might kill the entire bill by prompting a filibuster in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate had included the ban as part of its version of the bill, while the 
House passed it as a separate bill by a two-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill includes the "three strikes and you're out" mandatory life sentence 
after three convictions for violent crimes.

THE MTA STRIKE; MECHANICS DON'T WANT LAYOFFS -- OR LONG WALKOUT; UNION: ACTION 
IS OVER JOB SECURITY, NOT PAY, SAY WORKERS WHO MAKE AN AVERAGE OF $44,000 A 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He can trouble shoot a broken transmission in nothing flat. Leaky air systems 
and worn brakes are the kinds of thing he can almost fix with his eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
 If only bus mechanic Lawrence Dupre could repair those broken-down 
negotiations between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the 
Amalgamated Transit Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the economy the way it is, there's not a person out there who can afford 
this," Dupre said during a break from picketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get no strike benefits. This first week is a test: Come next week, we're 
all going to have to get out and find some kind of job and make some money. If 
this goes 30 days, I'm in a serious bind." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most strikes, the walkout that started at 12:01 a.m. Monday is not over 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The average mechanic earns about $44,000 yearly, according to the MTA. The 
average service attendant salary is about $35,500. 
</P>
<P>
 For MTA mechanics, the $20.83 per hour top-pay rate is the third-highest in 
the country. Transit system mechanics in San Francisco ($22.99) and Boston 
($21.43) earn more. But they earn less in Chicago ($19.31), New York ($18.84), 
Seattle ($19.73) and Washington ($19.38). 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree that job security is the issue that has idled the MTA's 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides mechanics, the striking union represents such workers as bus cleaners, 
electricians, roving janitors, signal inspectors, welders and cabinetmakers. 
Union members are worried that the MTA plans to phase out some of their jobs by 
contracting work out. 
</P>
<P>
 The average MTA mechanic has been on the job 15 years and has another eight to 
go before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials acknowledge that they are trying to save money wherever they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 80 ATU employees were recently laid off as part of a cost-reduction 
process," MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene said Wednesday. "It's the layoffs that 
caused this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Greene, the mechanics' pink slips came as part of an agencywide 
belt-tightening triggered by the recent formation of the MTA through the 
consolidation of the former Southern California Rapid Transit District and the 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. In all, 550 jobs were eliminated, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the outside contracting of work arose when details of the layoffs 
were being worked out between the MTA and the union, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the transit agency had agreements with 17 outside groups to do 
such work as power sweeping, building maintenance, fence repair and public 
address system repair. One contract with the county Probation Department called 
for the use of juvenile offenders to scrub graffiti off bus seats and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the union is refusing to let the MTA resume any of the outside contracts 
unless all of the laid-off workers are first rehired, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is true, said Carlos Curiel, a vice president of the mechanics' union. 
"We're telling them they cannot subcontract out as long as one of our members 
is laid off," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue of subcontracting goes deeper than that, according to Curiel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specifically, they said they wanted to subcontract 10% of our work . . . they 
want to subcontract 10% of everything we do -- generators, alternators, 
everything. That's a lot of work out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiel said the MTA has informed the union that it is willing to halt outside 
contracting if the union is willing to give up about 400 more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said she was unable to immediately respond to that report. "I can say 
no current ATU employee will lose his or her job as a result of MTA 
subcontracting proposals." 
</P>
<P>
 Union members say reducing the mechanics' work force is false economy. They 
say they have kept aging MTA buses in service years longer than other transit 
agencies would have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 220 Grumman Flexibles that we bought in 1978, I believe, that had 
cracks and the air conditioners didn't work. Hawaii had them too, and got rid 
of them. New York had them and put their fleet to sleep," Curiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've kept buses going way after others have junked them or sent them to 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Dupre agrees. The transit agency he worked for in the New Orleans area bought 
new buses when the old once wore out. "We keep them rolling here," the 
41-year-old North Hollywood man said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupre, who has had his job for 14 years, said he hopes negotiators get things 
rolling too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up doing mechanics with my father," he said. "I learned diesels in the 
Army. I love my job. This is definitely my life."

AIDS STUDY CALLS FOR MORE RESEARCH ON ROLE OF BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be years before scientists develop an effective vaccine against the 
virus that causes AIDS and more focus is needed on changing behavior that can 
spread the disease, a study said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by a committee of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy 
of Sciences urged more research into the kinds of behavior -- sexual practices 
and illegal drug use, for example -- that can spread the deadly AIDS virus.It 
complained that social science research was the most underfunded of all AIDS 
research activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absence of information about the actual sexual behaviors in which people 
are engaging has hampered AIDS prevention efforts," the committee said. It 
called for a national survey of sexual behavior and for lifting a ban on the 
use of federal money for needle exchange programs.

WESTLAKE-ROYAL HAS THE ARMS TO MAKE PITCH FOR AREA 6 TITLE; LEGION: MCCLURE CAN 
TROT FOUR QUALITY STARTERS TO THE MOUND AND BACK THEM WITH SEVERAL OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One prediction about the American Legion baseball Area 6 playoffs is fairly 
safe: The team that pitches the best will win. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure likes his team's chances. McClure 
boasts a four-man rotation with a 19-1 record and a 1.42 earned-run average. 
McClure's four starters are Phil Derryman (3-1, 2.26), Jay Kenny (6-0, 1.52), 
Maki Kramer (4-0, 1.21) and Todd Singleton (6-0, 0.96). 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt since the beginning of the season that if we could effectively use 
the seven or eight legitimate high school pitchers we have, we are going to 
have an advantage over most teams," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching and endurance will be the keys in the four-day, double-elimination 
tournament, which runs today through Sunday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
The winner could play as many as six games on its way to a berth in next week's 
Southern California finals in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo (25-7) meets St. Bernard (14-5) in the tournament opener at 10 a.m. 
Valley North (19-8) will play Arcadia (30-7) at 2 p.m. and Westlake-Royal 
(25-5-1) will face Westchester (16-7) at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal, which won the District 16 title, is led offensively by center 
fielder Scott Morris (.397), second baseman Kevin McClure (.431) and left 
fielder Bryan Fernandez (.398). 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North, which won the District 20 tournament despite being the 
10th-seeded team, is better known for its offense, but right-hander Jim DeBiase 
(5-1, 1.79), left-hander Ray Daryabigi (3-2, 2.29) and right-hander Fred 
Farzaneh (3-1, 3.68) have pitched well. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's top hitters are first baseman Tony Montiel (.447, 29 runs batted 
in), shortstop Bryan LaCour (.377), Daryabigi (.380) and catcher Brandon Murphy 
(24 RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, the District 16 runner-up, includes players from Rio Mesa, 
Camarillo and Moorpark highs. Left-hander Richard Soliz (5-1), and right-hander 
Dan Martinez (6-2) are the team's best pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The top threats at the plate are a trio of Camarillo High players -- shortstop 
Nathan Kaup, second baseman-catcher Rodell Desamparo and outfielder Matt 
Buttell. Third baseman Eric Flores and first baseman Fernando Barajas are also 
top hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia swept a doubleheader Sunday from defending Area 6 champion Claremont 
to win the District 18 title. Right-hander Jason Cly (6-1, 3.56) pitched 12 
innings Sunday, picking up both victories, so he is unlikely to pitch until 
Friday at the earliest, Coach Chris Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia's other top pitchers are right-hander Josh Oder (4-1, 2.46) and 
left-hander Greg McClelland (6-3, 1.97). 
</P>
<P>
 But the team's best all-around player is probably first baseman Pete Paciorek 
(.453, six home runs, 32 RBIs). Paciorek, drafted by the San Diego Padres, was 
the Southern Section Division IV player of the year this spring at San Marino 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester, which has won three consecutive District 24 titles, is similar to 
Westlake-Royal in that its strengths are pitching and defense, Coach Todd 
Frelinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting pitcher today will be either right-hander Rob Green (4-1) or 
left-hander Richard Sturm (5-1). Green, a 1993 graduate of Loyola High, pitched 
this spring at Creighton University. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's best hitters are center fielder Dana Harrison, who has signed to 
play at Long Beach State, and first baseman Doug Espinoza. Both graduated this 
spring from St. Bernard High, but they play for Westchester because the St. 
Bernard Legion team uses only players returning to school. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard's top player is right-handed pitcher Brandon Pernell (5-0), who is 
likely to start today. Pernell was an All-Mission League pick for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Leadoff hitter Nick Norton (23 stolen bases), center fielder Dion Dattee 
(.327, four home runs) and catcher Oscar Martinez are St. Bernard's top 
offensive threats. Play Ball! 
</P>
<P>
 * What: American Legion Area 6 playoffs. Six teams compete in a 
double-elimination tournament. The winner advances to the Southern California 
finals next week at Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Today through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * Today's schedule: Camarillo (25-7) vs. St. Bernard (14-5), 10 a.m; Valley 
North (19-8) vs. Arcadia (30-7), 2 p.m.; Westlake-Royal (25-5-1) vs. 
Westchester (16-7), 6 p.m.

AFTER TAKING STOCK, KRAMER CAUGHT CROOK; BASEBALL: WESTLAKE-ROYAL PITCHER NABS 
SHOPLIFTER, GETS STABBED IN THE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Maki Kramer was just doing what he was told. He didn't expect a knife in his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 As a K mart rookie stock boy, he didn't know his job included chasing down 
armed shoplifters. Now Kramer is just hoping his back wound heals enough so he 
can pitch for Westlake-Royal in the American Legion Area 6 playoffs this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm planning on playing," Kramer said. "I'm going to keep (the stitches) in 
to pitch so the cut doesn't bust open." 
</P>
<P>
 This whole mess for Kramer, a recent Royal High graduate, started last week on 
his fourth day on the job at the store in Simi Valley. He was loading 
merchandise onto shelves, when a store security guard asked him to come outside 
and help apprehend some shoplifters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know I had to help out the security guards, but I was new there, so 
I just said OK," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer and the guard waited in the parking lot for the two teen-age 
shoplifters to leave the store. When they did, the guard grabbed one of the 
shoplifters, but the other ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer chased him. 
</P>
<P>
 About a quarter-mile away, Kramer found the culprit hiding in the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed him and threw him on the ground," said Kramer, who is 6-foot-1, 200 
pounds. "I had him face down in a (wrestling hold). He had a knife with him, 
and he reached around and stabbed me in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer at first didn't know he had been stabbed. But as he escorted the 
shoplifter back to the security guard, Kramer felt "something sticky on his 
back," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 It was blood, dripping from a two-inch wound near his right shoulder blade. 
Doctors closed the wound with three stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I'm worried about now is pitching," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer was told not to play baseball for 10 days, meaning the earliest he 
could pitch in the Area 6 playoffs would be Saturday. Westlake-Royal must win 
Thursday or Friday to remain alive Saturday in the six-team double-elimination 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kramer would be quite a loss if he weren't able to pitch. He is 4-0 with a 
1.21 earned-run average in Legion play. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring at Royal, Kramer was 9-1 with a 2.02 ERA and was selected to The 
Times' All-Ventura County team. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure said he was not surprised at the way Kramer 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not one of those guys who just stands around and watches things happen," 
McClure said.

O.C. POP BEAT: DARK, SUBVERSIVE STUFF -- AND PUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will punk rock never cease? Probably not in Orange County, where punk and its 
offshoots have been the lingua franca of a musically loquacious underground 
since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's column of local album reviews consists mainly of punk records, and 
some pretty good ones at that. Veteran bands D.I. and Big Drill Car come back 
with renewed vigor after so-so previous efforts, while four bands of spunky 
young-uns with a sense of local punk history team up for a joint release called 
"coast hwy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the grandest punk of all in this batch doesn't play the hard-and-fast 
stuff. Stanley Wycoff, auteur of Bierce in L.A., favors tradition-steeped 
country music. His new album's predilection for the dark side and willingness 
to outrage qualify him as a bona fide eccentric and an artistic hard case. Any 
punk-rock tough would have to acknowledge him as a spiritual brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings range from **** (excellent) to * (poor). Three stars denote a solid 
recommendation. 
</P>

<P>
 *** 1/2 Pierce in L.A. "Vale of Tears" Rococo Records  
</P>
<P>
 Bierce in L.A. is a studio assemblage presided over by Stanley Wycoff, a Long 
Beach-based singer-songwriter who identifies with Ambrose Bierce, the 
turn-of-the-century writer known chiefly for disappearing into Mexico without a 
trace, and for his horrific stories that displayed a markedly venomous attitude 
toward humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that namesake, one doesn't expect an album of sweetness and light. But 
"Vale of Tears" is even bleaker than that. Emerging from this 10-song journey 
through the depths of matrimonial hell, the luckier ones among us may breathe a 
relieved "There but for the grace of God go I." Those unfortunate enough to 
recognize themselves in these songs deserve our deepest sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wycoff's corrosively witty story-songs have the truthful ring of portraits 
drawn directly from life. He is also an expressive singer in the creaky-voiced 
tradition of John Prine, Guy Clark, Gram Parsons and Keith Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to finding classy help, he's the equal of any corporate 
headhunter. Among those in his revolving lineups are guitar virtuoso John 
Jorgenson, Dave Alvin, Nicky Hopkins (yes, the Nicky Hopkins, piano player to 
the '60s rock pantheon) and O.C. roots-music heroes Chris Gaffney and Danny 
Ott. 
</P>
<P>
 They ably provide a wide-ranging palette for such sprightly traditional forms 
as rocking country, honky-tonk and bluegrass -- upon which Wycoff can 
perversely foist lyrics full of disastrous consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trailer Park," in which Jorgenson switches to whoosh-treated saxophones, 
sounds like an outtake from a minimalist-modernist-avant-gardist experiment by 
Tom Waits, Captain Beefheart or Was (Not Was). 
</P>
<P>
 The album is a loosely unified collection of sketches. In some, decent but 
flawed people sacrifice not only happiness, but also a good chunk of their 
sanity. In others, such as "It's All Up to You" and the bizarre "Trailer Park," 
Wycoff gets into the minds of people you wouldn't want to know and visits 
places you wouldn't want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 His monologue songs are richly but economically drawn, implying volumes more 
than they actually tell. Together, they form the portrait of an oppressive and 
claustrophobic little world. 
</P>
<P>
 Wycoff opens with "Do Some Don'ts," a cheerfully twanging country-rockabilly 
number punctuated with Jordanaires-style bop-shoo-wops . In it, a dissatisfied 
husband blithely heads out for a night of misbehavior. Soon, in "Living With 
His Conscience (Living With Her Fears)," this protagonist will learn that the 
wages of extramarital sin can be a form of living death. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gaffney taking over as a gravelly voiced surrogate on lead vocals, Wycoff 
laconically paints a picture of what happens to a marriage when the trust is 
sucked out of it following the husband's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh, what a lonesome fate  
</P>
<P>
 To be caught between love and hate  
</P>
<P>
 She'll never leave, no she'll just wait  
</P>
<P>
 For it'll work again, but it'll never work great At his most uncompromising, 
Wycoff explodes country-music pieties in a way deliberately calculated to 
offend the easily offended. 
</P>
<P>
 The protagonist of "Unobstructed Shot" lays blame for the world's ills on 
religion's doorstep and fantasizes about drawing a bead on Jesus in a rifle's 
cross-hairs and vengefully nailing him for failure to abolish evil. 
</P>
<P>
 But look beyond the sensationalism, and you'll find a memorable portrait of a 
mind barely able to cope with a world of suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and two adds up to four, that's Arabic addition  
</P>
<P>
 But two and two came out to five in the Spanish Inquisition  
</P>
<P>
 And all that talk about that seamless robe  
</P>
<P>
 And all the strength and the patience of Job  
</P>
<P>
 Cannot explain how one child should ever have to call Calcutta home  
</P>
<P>
 Wycoff resists melodrama, singing the role with understatement that only 
implies menace, leaving it to Jorgenson's barking guitar to make explicit the 
character's lacerated mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's All Up to You" is a quieter, more subtle country cousin to one of John 
Cale's seething, mid-'70s proto-punk rants. Wycoff takes us into the mind of a 
truly evil wife abuser, but nastily tweaks the listener with writing so clever 
that the audience, at least, will enjoy the loathsome fellow as entertaining 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's all up to you to make this marriage work  
</P>
<P>
 But if you don't start to do your part  
</P>
<P>
 You know it's bound to hurt  
</P>
<P>
 Well, Tammy sang, "Stand by Your Man"  
</P>
<P>
 And I believe each word is true  
</P>
<P>
 And you can live to sing along, but it's all up to you  
</P>
<P>
 Wycoff's heart isn't so corroded that he can't muster a sense of sympathy for 
his characters' awful lot. But "Vale of Tears" is one of the few pop works that 
truly deserves the much-bandied adjective "subversive." 
</P>
<P>
 If Garth Brooks or one of his mega-selling colleagues in the country 
mainstream ever covers "It's All Up to You" or "Unobstructed Shot," I'll take 
back every nasty thing I've ever written about the safe, staid, sugarcoating 
ways of the Nashville machine. 
</P>
<P>
 That'll probably happen the day after Ambrose Bierce rides back from Mexico.

 ***Big Drill Car "No Worse for the Wear" Headhunter/Cargo  
</P>
<P>
 A new rhythm section is in place, but improved song-architecture helps at 
least as much as the new blood to get Big Drill Car revving nicely again on its 
fourth studio release. 
</P>
<P>
 After a promising start with the late-'80s recordings "Small Block" and "Album 
Type Thing," BDC started spinning its wheels on material that was lean and 
crunchy, but not memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstays Frank Daly and Mark Arnold haven't changed their basic approach, 
which involves pop-informed, sing-song melodies taken at racing tempos. But 
Arnold's ornery bucking bull of a guitar is channeled into more varied, less 
linear arrangements than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 He draws not just from punk rock and Led Zeppelin, the main arsenal of 
previous albums, but from the exuberant riffing of such '70s arena-rock 
mainstays as Van Halen and Ted Nugent. Arnold finds an adept partner for 
high-velocity tag in new bassist Darren Morris, and drummer Keith Fallis lends 
an explosive kick (he has since been replaced by Jamie Reidling, the former 
Cadillac Tramps drummer). 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's singing has bite, but his slender, nasal voice has always sounded a 
little naked. That's true here, but stronger melodies avert the monotony that 
set in on the band's 1991 release, "Batch." 
</P>
<P>
 Big Drill Car always has recorded for small, independent labels, working with 
longtime buddies from the band All as producers. If BDC ever finds itself in 
the money, it might consider double-tracking Daly's voice to thicken his sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the songs have an urgent, desperate cast as Daly sorts through 
relationship crises in "Friend of Mine," "Hye" and "Step Right Up." In each 
case, it looks as if the narrator and his friend or lover won't be able to hold 
their bond together, but an affirmative, striving tone prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 For BDC, embracing vivid experience appears to be its own reward, even if 
happiness remains out of reach. For contrast, Daly waxes sardonic or wrathful 
on "Nagaina," "Crystal's Ball" (a rare slower song) and "Yer Holdin," with 
two-timing sex-aholics and drug addicts among the objects of scorn or shrugging 
pity. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Drill Car still rolls down a relatively narrow stylistic track, but after 
stalling through the early '90s, it's fun to hear the band writing songs that 
go places.

<P>
 ***D.I. "State of Shock" Doctor Dream  
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years on the Orange County punk scene, D.I.'s singer and co-founder, 
Casey Royer, carries himself well in the role of older-brother figure to a new 
generation of teens drawn to the band's ever-reliable thrashing, hard-cranking, 
hard-core punk. 
</P>
<P>
 Innovation isn't part of the equation. On its seventh album since 1982, D.I. 
sticks to the old hard-and-fast, mosh-ready beats, and to the zooming, massed 
guitar onslaughts and catchy, shout-along choruses that were the essence of 
Royer's previous band, the Adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 Royer's main subject is survival. As one roiling song puts it, the world is a 
"Clownhouse" of evils and absurdities that will tax your sanity. Royer's advice 
is to watch your back and persevere. 
</P>
<P>
 D.I.'s clenched, stormy onslaught makes it clear that it won't be possible 
without determined, desperate effort. The band sounds recharged after a poorly 
focused outing on its last studio release five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Royer's vocal style suits his big-brother stance. He doesn't go in for 
screaming, titanic drama. Instead, he delivers his cogent, if less-than-poetic 
lyrics in a clean, earthy Everyman's voice. Behind him, the band provides the 
dramatics with hard-charging, well-etched playing and hefty backup singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dark humor that cropped up in D.I.'s earlier work comes through in 
"Better Than Expected," in which a woman's ignorance of the seedy and dangerous 
side of life proves fatal when she goes on a barhopping fling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colors and Blood" is an embattled anthem bewailing the gang mentality: "When 
you live like there's no rules / Makes it like any day's a good day for dying." 
In "Martyr Man," Royer registers a mixture of admiration and bewilderment as he 
wonders what meaning can be gleaned from the death of an idealistic but 
foolhardy punk-rock hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, it leads into an album-closing cover of "Lexicon Devil," a 
punk-rebellion anthem originally sung by the ill-fated Germs singer, Darby 
Crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Still vigorous at 35, Royer shows that, even for an inveterate and unchanging 
punk, there is a livable middle way between Neil Young's dreaded rust and a 
premature crash-and-burn. It's not a bad example for a big brother to set for a 
new generation of punk rock youth.

 ** 1/2 Peace Corp., Just Plain Big, the Scenes and Hard Fast & Loud "coast 
hwy" 
</P>
<P>
 NoLA Recordings  
</P>
<P>
 The first album-length punk salvo out of Orange County 15 years ago was the 
"Beach Blvd" compilation featuring the Crowd, Rik L Rik and the Simpletones. 
Now a new generation of O.C. bands pays homage to their local roots with the 
title, concept and, in some instances, the musical styles of this new punk 
compilation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice idea: Each band gets about 17 or 18 minutes, the length of an EP, while 
splitting the cost. All show promise, although Hard Fast & Loud hews too 
closely to old-line hard-core and winds up serving up familiar, resentful rants 
and music that's little more than functional, if crisply played, mosh-pit 
soundtrack fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based Just Plain Big is the most impressive of the coasters. Its 
trademarks are racing tempos, pop-flavored melodies, buzzing fuzz-tone guitars 
and two lead voices that move in unison or in tandem harmonies, adding up to 
more than the sum of the two parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crowd seems to be an influence on the straight-ahead punk tune "Modern 
Persuasion," while some '60s garage-psychedelic strains (the Doors and Love are 
possible influences) emerge on JPB's best and most controlled track, the darkly 
trippy "A Ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace Corp. is brash, snotty, deliberately obnoxious and proud of it. The 
Newport Beach band targets religion (the song title, "God Is Dead (I'm Taking 
Over)" says it all), resurgent Nazism in Germany (they recommend nuking the 
whole country before it gets out of hand again), and musical trends ("What the 
hell is wrong with Seattle? The sound is (expletive), the bands are cattle"). 
</P>
<P>
 Their best song, "Jacqui-O," has shades of Redd Kross in its brawny punk-pop 
merger. In it, Peace Corp. sings with deliberate insensitivity about the 
dangers of anorexia. Unless they're talking about some other Jacqui-O we don't 
know, they somehow got it in their heads to appoint the late Mrs. Onassis as a 
poster child for eating disorders. Terminal cancer doesn't do wonders for 
anybody's appetite, so perhaps a change of title would be a good idea. Candy-O 
worked fine for the Cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Peace Corp. come off like louts, but if your sensibilities aren't 
too delicate, they're kind of fun as they work punk-comedy turf previously 
occupied hereabouts by the Vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scenes go halfway down the same road on a couple of deliberately dopey but 
zestful garage-rock songs, "It Suits Me Well" and "Lime in My Beer." Then they 
do an about-face and turn into some kind of smarmy, so-sincere, post U2 
Brit-rock band ("Painting Pictures") or a high-minded Neil Young knockoff 
("Orange Pos"). 
</P>
<P>
 It's always fun hearing bands on the ground floor who give at least a hint of 
character; one never knows what turns they'll take. Someday we may look back 
again at "coast hwy" as the start of something bigger (five years ago, on its 
debut album, O.C. punk's most successful progeny, the Offspring, was somewhere 
near the level heard here). 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it will just be one more small artifact proving that when kids in fin 
de siecle Orange County thrashed around looking for something to do, a lot of 
them hit on the idea of playing punk rock. 
</P>

COMEDY REVIEW; SHOW AND TALES MOVE JENA TO HEAD OF THE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's give Jeff Jena an A on his latest class project, "Sex, Love and the 
Pledge of Allegiance."The updated one-man show is polished, holds together for 
90 minutes and includes several hilarious bits. (Be sure to hear how he got 
grounded forever -- "So technically, I shouldn't even be here tonight" -- and 
his take on God's sense of humor. Jena, by the way, admits he's risking grave 
consequences if he's wrong on this one.) 
</P>
<P>
 When the Midwest-raised comic first turned in his project, he titled it "In a 
Class by Himself." Pleasing, but nothing too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 The new moniker, appropriately, is more revealing, sexier and closer to the 
bone. The fans who saw an earlier draft didn't see the same piece. When Jena 
brought it to the Irvine Improv earlier this year, the show would have earned 
him a C+, B- maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at the Brea Improv through Sunday, Jena offers a much more substantial 
version. Starting with the basics, he has fleshed the piece out with more bells 
and whistles than the previous incarnation, which limped along at times trying 
to fill 1 1/2 hours. Like most kids saddled with school reports, he had less 
material than the teacher had pages. Too many soft spots sabotaged that effort. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With this show, Jena hits the mark and joins a cadre of others going it solo 
successfully. The one-person format is being welcomed as club owners and 
comedians look for something different to boffer patrons in a period of comedic 
saturation on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shows combine elements of theater and stand-up to set a tone and offer a 
point of view. The trade-off, though, is sacrificing stand-up's rapid-fire 
laughter for the depth of a theater piece. Performers hope the audiences have 
the patience to go along with it. If not, back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's exactly what Jena did. Though audience reaction to the original 
wasn't bad, Jena continued to fine-tune his work, stripping some theater 
trappings and adding more stand-up material as he uses the classroom format to 
take a look at getting through life. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. resident has the perfect background for such a show. Before getting 
into comedy, Jena spent seven years as a junior-high schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transition is easy," he told the audience Tuesday night. "You just have 
to be quick on your feet and a little smarter than everyone else in the room."  
</P>
<P>
 The results are thoughtful observations that don't preach, but simply spread 
out and put an interesting spin on what's important to learn. Or not to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is a mystery to be lived, not a problem to be solved," he said. "Just 
take a shot, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind a desk or pacing the stage -- with black drapes as a backdrop, 
two maps (for the geography portion of the show), a U.S. flag and a grease 
board -- Jena covered the material in the syllabus, including how classes were 
divided into "advanced," "average" and "moron" when he was in school. But 
because they couldn't use the third label, they came up with "moon shots," 
"orbiters" and "ground crews." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jena uses the grease board to hold the show together, writing such categories 
as "When Will I Use This in My Real Life?," "What Is Love?" and "Who Cares How 
Bad My Grammar Are?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the first heading, Jena relates this question from a pupil: "Will I use 
math in my real life?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he answers. "You will never use the quadratic function, but we study it 
because it's difficult, boring and it sometimes seems completely pointless -- 
exactly like real life." 
</P>
<P>
 All the categories feed his main point. Too many people, Jena contends, derail 
themselves by getting caught up in the little things. You have to look at the 
big picture, laugh at yourself, take charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be like George Bailey, he warns, because not everybody is going to have 
a guardian angel step in. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; YORBA LINDA'S 'SOUTH PACIFIC': DULL COMPANY AND A LOUSY VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dites-moi: pour quoi?"  
</P>
<P>
 As that sweet opening line of "South Pacific" asks, tell me why. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do "South Pacific" without a bona fide set? Why do Richard Rodgers' 
timelessly gorgeous score, arguably his most emotionally resonant, with an 
orchestra that sounds, in effect if not in fact, thrown together? Why do this 
odd-couple love story of All-American Ensign Nellie Forbush and exiled 
Frenchman Emile de Becque with so little chemistry between the actors? 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera provides no good answers. Indeed, director 
Gary Gordon's impoverished production at the Yorba Linda Forum sends up a 
warning flag: Not all civic light operas should attempt all musicals. Any CLO 
naturally would feel obliged to stage "South Pacific," but that doesn't 
necessarily mean it should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Music director John Massy's messy orchestra does not get things off to a good 
start. Further, for the first time in this reviewer's visits to various "South 
Pacifics," Emile's oceanside estate has no view of the ocean and the Bali Ha'i 
paradise is kept offstage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janine Benson's Nellie is cute enough but stricken with an incurable case of 
the giggles that quickly becomes annoying rather than endearing. David Corbin 
pushes Emile's proper airs to the point of being stolid, and cannot accommodate 
the wide octaval range of the character's demanding songs ("Some Enchanted 
Evening," "This Nearly Was Mine"). 
</P>
<P>
 Like a trade wind whooshing into a shuttered room, the jolly Navy guys led by 
David Sumerford as the amusing, acerbic Luther Billis give the show a 
much-needed jolt. But it doesn't last long, because Casey Marshall's Lt. Cable 
soon strides in. Neither a good singer nor a good actor, Marshall cannot 
provide important emotional counterpoint to the Nellie-Emile affair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Distracted from his spy mission by a visit to Bali Ha'i, Cable falls in love 
with young Liat (Ramona Marshall) and finally there is some passion in the room 
(even if Bali Ha'i has been reduced here to a straw hut). But Casey Marshall 
rushes through the usually powerful "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught" and 
exits without leaving behind a sense of this man's doomed fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a sure-bet number like "Honey Bun," the naval equivalent of a drag show 
(and Nellie's and Luther's opportunity to clown to the max), is pretty tepid 
here, and the drama of the Act II spy mission is undercut seriously by Tory Cox 
as a Cmdr. Harbison whom no one ever could call "Old Ironbelly."

ON STANDBY; RELIEF EFFORT GIVES HOMELESS VETERANS FREE SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During the dark times, Tom Pratt wondered whether he could go on. 
</P>
<P>
 By last fall, the 40-year-old Vietnam veteran and single parent had lost his 
job. And his home. And he was on the verge of permanently losing custody of his 
7-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very much preoccupied with some pretty devastating thoughts," recalls 
the Ventura man. "I was at the point where I didn't have anything else to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he stumbled across Stand Down, a relief effort for homeless 
veterans held last year. The three-day event -- which offers free medical care, 
legal help and a variety of other social services -- will be held for the 
second time at Ventura College starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 homeless veterans from throughout Ventura County took part in last 
year's program, including Pratt, who said it turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time I ran across Stand Down, it was looking pretty hopeless," said 
Pratt, who lost his job because of illness. Stand Down volunteers helped him 
find a new one, which put a roof over his head and allowed him to keep his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stand Down gave me a second chance," he said. "It saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how many veterans received long-term help during Stand 
Down 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the homeless are so transient, event organizers have had a tough time 
tracking participants who were searching for jobs and permanent housing last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 All organizers know for sure is that people such as Pratt were helped, and 
that gives them hope that Stand Down 1994 will be an even bigger success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to help as many veterans as want to be helped break out of 
homelessness and back into mainstream society," said Claire Hope, founder of 
the Ventura County event. "At the very least, we can provide three days of 
food, shelter and clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand Down is a military term used when a unit is shifted from a combat 
situation to one of safety and security. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs have been staged nationwide, and this year 47 Stand Downs will be 
held in 29 states. Hope said she attended her first Stand Down in Long Beach in 
1992 and was so inspired that she decided to start the same thing here. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 14 months to pull it together, culminating last October with a 
mini-tent city on the Ventura College football field. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors offered physical exams to the military veterans. Lawyers helped them 
clear up outstanding warrants for misdemeanor charges and fines from 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Career counselors helped the veterans look for jobs, and barbers cut their 
hair without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard dentist Robert Keating spent the weekend providing free dental exams 
and dispensing advice on oral hygiene. He will be at it again this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very rewarding," Keating said. "I think our success comes from letting 
some people know what is out there and available to them." 
</P>
<P>
 To boost attendance this year, organizers advertised on posters and flyers 
earlier than last year. In addition, dozens of social service and nonprofit 
agencies have been enlisted to spread the word and sign up participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, nearly 150 homeless veterans have pre-registered. Still, some 
veterans want no part of Stand Down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to go into town to sleep in a tent," said Ted Edwards, a 
Vietnam veteran who has made his home on the Ventura River bottom for the past 
six years. Event organizers and volunteers acknowledge that Stand Down is not 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything is going to happen for an individual, he's going to have to make 
it for himself," said Gary Wood, who supervises veterans' programs for the 
state employment department. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he attended Stand Down last year, Marvin Jenkins says he too often 
sought comfort at the bottom of a bottle. He attended his first Alcoholics 
Anonymous meeting in a camouflage tent at Ventura College football field. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he holds a full-time job, has a permanent place to live and has been 
sober for nearly a year. He will attend this year's event as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just new I had to start turning my life around," Jenkins said. "And that's 
when it started." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Stand Down 1994 will take place at Ventura College starting Friday. The 
three-day relief effort will offer medical care, legal help and a variety of 
social services to homeless military veterans from across Ventura County. The 
event ends Sunday afternoon.

CUTS IN AID TO HOMELESS ATTACKED; GOVERNMENT: THE BUDGET REDUCTIONS COULD MEAN 
MORE PEOPLE WILL END UP ON THE STREETS, ADVOCATES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County could lose tens of thousands of dollars in grants to aid and 
shelter its homeless under county budget cuts approved earlier this week, 
advocates for those without housing said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors to slash 65 jobs and millions 
of dollars in services has nonprofit caregivers worried that more people will 
slip through the cracks and that more homeless will drift about the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless Ombudsman Nancy Nazario, who coordinates information and services 
among nonprofits and generates the data they use in writing grants, was told 
Wednesday that her job was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the 15-year county employee will become a caseworker in the adult 
services division of the Public Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm grateful to have a job because I have a daughter to support," Nazario 
said. "But it's quite a change from the rough-and-tumble world of 
homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past six years, Nazario has scoured homeless camps in the Ventura 
River bottom to help residents get assistance, and built up a clearinghouse of 
information used by other agencies to apply for state and federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to establish a relationship of trust with some of the more 
mentally ill patients who won't have anything to do with the system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when supervisors made the decision to close a budget deficit of almost $15 
million, they told Public Social Services Director James E. Isom to pare his 
costs by $363,000, by any means necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Isom said he had little choice but to close out Nazario's job because it is 
among a handful of county services that are not required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply a matter of economics," said Isom, who also was told by 
supervisors to cut his department's budget without hurting veterans' programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of nonprofit organizations who can do the same thing and 
do it with their money," Isom said. "The homeless population does not belong to 
Ventura County per se, it belongs to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating Nazario's job will save $46,500 a year, county Budget Manager Bert 
Bigler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 2,000 to 3,000 homeless people shuffling through the county, the news 
was disappointing to many directors of the 30 or more nonprofit agencies that 
coordinate with Nazario to offer services to homeless clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy is so well-known in the county that a lot of our referrals come through 
her," said Jean Gartlan, who manages the Vince Corner Family Lodge in Ventura 
for Project Understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's extremely well-versed in the whole homeless situation," Gartlan said. 
"Because of her intervention, there have been a lot of people who were homeless 
that got the help they needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Nazario said the worst effect of eliminating her position would be in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these agencies are under a lot of pressure to provide immediate 
assistance," she said. "We were able to take a long-term approach to assist 
people in finding housing, getting a landlord to rent to them, putting a 
deposit together and getting the kids in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Decaen of Catholic Charities said there will be no way to replace 
Nazario. "We'll just have to coordinate and collaborate that much more closely 
with the other agencies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget cuts should have been made elsewhere, Decaen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there are so many homeless and such desperate situations, to eliminate 
this position is absurd," she said. "It just seems like those who are the least 
able to fend for themselves and are in the most desperate situations get the 
short end of the stick." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor John K. Flynn, who sat on a homeless task force in 1988, said 
Nazario already has made an impact on the homeless situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make cuts someplace, and there are a number of organizations 
helping the homeless," Flynn said. "She helped bring about a lot of the 
organizations we have now, so she may have completed her job."

METAL DETECTORS POSSIBLE AT GRADE SCHOOLS IN FALL, '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a rising number of students bringing knives to class, members of 
the Oxnard elementary school board said Wednesday that school officials may 
have to start searching students with metal detectors as early as the fall of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard School District, with 13,000 students between kindergarten and 
eighth grade, would be the first elementary district in Ventura County to 
search students with metal detectors, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think we have to look at this carefully," Oxnard school Trustee Jack T. 
Fowler said at Wednesday's board meeting. If the number of students with knives 
goes up, he said, "then the district needs to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District does not use metal detectors in their 
elementary schools, although authorities there conduct random searches on their 
middle, intermediate and high schools, spokeswoman Ria Parody said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Oxnard school officials resort to metal detectors, they said they would 
focus on junior high students, ages 12 to 14. But school officials are not 
ruling out employing the devices in the lower grades as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Oxnard teachers and other school officials caught 29 students with 
knives, compared to five students the year before, Supt. Bernard Korenstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students carrying knives were 13 or 14 years old, Korenstein said. Two of 
these students were expelled and 21 were suspended or placed on probation. But 
six of the students were so young, ages 7 to 9, that principals decided not to 
bring these cases to the school board for an expulsion hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The board did not take action Wednesday, but several members said the district 
may have to begin using metal detectors as soon as the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our world we need to give serious consideration to crime in schools," 
Fowler said. "For every knife we found, there were two that we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of trustees President James J. Sutter said that although he is concerned 
about pupils carrying knives to school, he is not sure if metal detectors are 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have reservations about metal detectors because I am not sure if we have a 
real need for it," Sutter said. "We have had only 23 episodes among 13,000 
students. I don't think that was so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "If the number of students carrying weapons continues to 
increase, we will have to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each school year, students and their parents sign a letter agreeing that 
students will not bring weapons to school and that both parents and students 
are aware of state laws prohibiting weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Stan Myers said police officers often are asked 
to help school officials in subduing a student carrying a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not uncommon for our field officers to be asked to contact or seek out 
a youngster who has weapons with him," Myers said. "From time to time, we 
actually have to arrest some students." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard School District Parent Teacher Assn. member Janis Johnson said she is 
pleased the school board is focusing on student safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that random search is not the ideal solution. It may be only a quick 
measure," she said. "But students' safety is in jeopardy and we do need to do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors though, have not deterred some older students from bringing 
knives to high schools in the Oxnard Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the district began to use metal detectors in 1993, the number of 
students caught with knives has remained constant, with 44 caught during the 
1992-93 school year and 43 the next school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, students and teachers feel much safer," said Rafael B. Gonzales, 
director of support instructional services. "But what we have seen is that a 
vast majority of the students who are caught carry key-chain type of knives, 
which are harder to detect."  
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District is the only district in Ventura County 
to conduct random weapon searches every day, officials said.

INVESTIGATORS STILL SEARCHING FOR CLUES ABOUT ROCKWELL DEATHS; EXPLOSION: TWO 
ENGINEERS WERE KILLED IN INCIDENT AT THE SANTA SUSANA FIELD LABORATORY. THREE 
SEPARATE INQUIRIES COULD TAKE 10 DAYS TO SEVERAL WEEKS. 
</P>

<P>
 As relatives mourned two engineers killed at Rockwell International's rocket 
engine test site near Simi Valley, investigators continued searching Wednesday 
for clues to the cause of the fatal chemical explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said it could be between 10 days and several weeks before 
three separate investigations into Tuesday's blast at the Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have put together what we are confident is the best team of experts 
available to us," said Paul Sewell, a spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
Division. "And we're going to look at every possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rockwell, the Ventura County Fire Department and the California 
Division of Occupational Safety and Health are conducting investigations into 
the accident, the first at the lab involving fatalities since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne engineers Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks and Otto K. Heiney, 
53, of Canoga Park were killed and a third man was seriously injured in the 
explosion at the 2,700-acre hilltop facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were preparing for a controlled burn of a catalyst used in solid 
rocket fuel motors when the accident occurred at 9:07 a.m., officials said. Two 
unidentified Rockwell workers involved in the outdoor test escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people lost their friends," Sewell said, describing the mood of 
employees at the lab Wednesday, where work went on as usual. "We're not taking 
it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh, who had worked for Rockwell since 1977, lived in the Sunset Hills 
neighborhood of Thousand Oaks for 17 years with his wife, Antoinette, and 
daughter Meredith, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith Pugh, a student at Loyola Marymount University, described her father 
Wednesday as extremely dedicated to his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He absolutely loved his job," she said. "He had a real passion for science." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was in high school, she said, her father helped her research science 
projects and experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she was never "scientifically inclined," she said that was 
fine with her father, who had a deep sense of pride about his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me to just be me," she said. "He was very proud of our family. We 
enjoyed spending time together." 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh said her father never mentioned any fears associated with the work he did 
at Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never afraid," she said. "He was very brave." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Pugh will be held at 7 p.m. today at Pierce Brothers 
Valley Oaks Memorial Park and Mortuary in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiney's survivors live in Florida and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell test mechanic Lee Wells, 62, who suffered second- and third-degree 
burns over 20% of his body, was listed in stable condition Wednesday. The 
Newbury Park resident is being treated at the burn center at Sherman Oaks 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three investigative agencies shed any new light on the possible 
cause of the accident. Sewell said the men were working on an experiment for 
Rockwell, not a private contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-OSHA sent two inspectors to Santa Susana immediately following the 
accident, spokesman Rick Rice said. One inspector will focus on possible worker 
safety violations, the other on whether criminal activity was associated with 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to say at this point how long the investigation is going to 
take," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 If worker safety regulations were violated, a citation would be issued, which 
could range from a maximum penalty of $7,000 for one violation to several 
hundred thousand dollars for multiple violations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne has received six citations since 1990, all for minor health and 
safety violations, including one $300 fine for failing to keep a proper log of 
injury accidents, Rice said. Other records of past citations were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susana Field Laboratory, which employs 742 workers, is a renowned 
rocket engine test site for the U.S. Air Force and NASA. The facility has been 
in operation since 1947, when it was opened by Rocketdyne's predecessor, North 
American Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell has tested engines for nearly every U.S. rocket program, including 
the space shuttle and first manned flight to the moon. Current work includes 
testing of Atlas and Delta rocket engines that propel satellites into space, 
and the development of hardware for NASA's space-station project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said Tuesday's fatalities were not the first at Santa 
Susana. Six workers were killed in various accidents at the facility in the 
early 1960s, Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time we were testing rocket engines around the clock, seven days a 
week," he said. "That's when we were doing work for the Apollo program. There 
were 6,000 employees at Santa Susana." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at past fatalities at the lab: 
</P>
<P>
 *On Feb. 26, 1963, Rocketdyne electrician Harley C. Rice, 43, of Canoga Park, 
was electrocuted while inspecting a circuit panel. 
</P>
<P>
 *On Nov. 25, 1963, Rocketdyne mechanics Barry D. Hunt, 24, of Woodland Hills, 
and John M. Scribner, 21, of Reseda, were killed when a storage tank they were 
cleaning exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 *On April 17, 1964, Rocketdyne worker Stanley J. Tykarski, 62, of Canoga Park, 
was killed when a pressurized tank he was attempting to move exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell said Rockwell officials are certain that there were two other deaths at 
the lab in the 1960s, but details were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Joel Jensen, 62, a former Rockwell technician now living in 
Washington, recalled the 1963 accident involving Hunt and Scribner. He said the 
two men were flushing out a 30-gallon high-pressure tank when cleaning 
chemicals reacted with residue in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemicals got mixed together and it blew up," he said. "It was kind of 
like a bomb right in front of them . . . It was kind of sobering to think we 
were working with stuff that could do that."

THOUSAND OAKS' CITY HALL AIMS TO TRIM THE FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager Grant Brimhall can see it now: the much-maligned Thousand Oaks 
bureaucracy transformed into a lean, mean, service machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fat will be trimmed. Belts will be tightened. And productivity will soar. 
</P>
<P>
 All because the new City Hall, now under construction at the Civic Arts Plaza, 
will include a $17,500 gym. 
</P>
<P>
 In a novel approach to downsizing, Thousand Oaks will offer its employees an 
in-house exercise room -- only 500 square feet in area, but filled with modern, 
fat-busting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressed-out workers will be able to sweat away their lunch hours in the 
mini-gym, or slip in for some mind-clearing exercise before or after their 
shifts. The workout room will offer a treadmill, rowing machine, two stair 
climbers, three exercise bikes and some sit-up benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also plan to install a weight machine, so those who routinely heft 
the City Council's phone-book-sized agendas can build up a little muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so jazzed about it," said the city's ombudsman, Maria Prescott, an avid 
treadmill walker. "I think it'll really catch on." 
</P>
<P>
 The new City Hall's layout, however, could foil even the best intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the gym, employees will have to pass a concession booth loaded with 
hot dogs, croissants, cookies and other high-calorie snacks. They'll also have 
to walk straight by a lounge filled with comfy sofas. 
</P>
<P>
 "That might be a little bit tempting," administrative clerk Susan Kane 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 No other city in Ventura County keeps exercise equipment on hand for municipal 
employees. But Thousand Oaks officials figure their gym will be well worth the 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 They expect to save on health care premiums, which slide up or down depending 
on how many employees have needed medical treatment during the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Blue Cross, Kaiser Permanente and Metropolitan Life said their 
health-care divisions have not produced any studies about the benefits of 
in-house gyms. And they did not know whether insurance rates would fall just 
because a company installed a few treadmills. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks officials remained confident that heavy use of the gym could 
swell the city's coffers even as it shrinks employees' waistlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to pay for preventive medicine, or you're going to have 
to pay for remedial medicine, and preventive medicine is a whole lot cheaper," 
City Manager Grant Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruefully patting his slight paunch, he added with a grin: "Some of us really 
need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the potential insurance savings, Thousand Oaks supervisors said 
they expect productivity to rise when workers begin to take advantage of the 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 As a prime example, Deputy Planning Director Mike Sangster pointed to his own 
remarkable history. Sangster has accumulated more than 2,000 hours of sick 
leave -- that's 50 full weeks worth -- during his quarter-century in Thousand 
Oaks. He attributes his impregnable immune system to regular workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise really does improve your alertness," Sangster said. 
</P>
<P>
 His boss, Phil Gatch, who bikes nearly every morning at a local gym, agreed: 
"If you have a job that has any kind of pressure associated with it," he said, 
"it's a real stress reliever." 
</P>
<P>
 Even gym rats like Sangster and Gatch said they eagerly await the City Hall 
workout room. If it's not too crowded, they said, they would prefer to work out 
at least a few times a week in City Hall, rather than trek over to the gym and 
waste precious exercise time. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what Brimhall wants to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need a place where people can work out," he said, "so we can make 
sure our employees' physical abilities are enhanced . . . so they can take the 
rigorous mental duties we require of them."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SPICE NETWORK FANS MAY REQUIRE FILTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cable provider for Oxnard, Port Hueneme, El Rio, and some incorporated 
areas of Ventura County announced Wednesday that it has found a way to improve 
the scrambling of the Spice Network, a controversial adult channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones Intercable and the network were harshly criticized in March by residents 
and religious leaders who complained that despite scrambling, the audio portion 
of the broadcast, as well as an occasional image, could be heard and seen in 
some homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable company plans to block the channel from the transmission point, 
requiring those residents who subscribe to the Spice Network to install small 
filters that allow the channel to come through. 
</P>
<P>
 The filters will not be available until early August. For information, call 
485-7774. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<P>
 Lt. James E. Barrett, a 22-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department and an 18-year Ojai resident, has been named to head the Ojai Valley 
substation, essentially becoming Ojai's chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett, 46, leaves his position as administrative support lieutenant to 
Sheriff Larry Carpenter to take the new job Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a known territory for me," he said of the Ojai Valley. "Besides, this 
is where I live." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett replaces Cmdr. Joe Harwell, who moves to the Ventura office, where he 
will be in charge of the Ventura County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett will supervise a team of 30 people who patrol the unincorporated area 
that runs from Casitas Springs to the Santa Barbara County line. 
</P>
<P>
 His new territory also includes the city of Ojai, which contracts with the 
Sheriff's Department for police service within the incorporated area. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett , who holds a master's degree from Cal State Northridge, was selected 
from among 28 candidates by the Sheriff's Department and by Ojai city 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very selective in sending people to head the unincorporated areas," 
Carpenter said. "Lt. Barrett is a well-respected senior officer who has a lot 
of experience and common sense." CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ACCUSED KILLER WON'T FIGHT EXTRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old gang member accused of fatally shooting another gang member last 
week in Ventura has agreed to waive extradition proceedings in Nevada and 
return to California, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Corral, accused of shooting Roger Rowland a week ago, was arrested 
Sunday at a motel just off the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Lt. Brad Talbot said Corral would not fight extradition, a 
process that can take months. The murder suspect will be transported to Ventura 
County Jail within days, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still pending is the extradition of Ruben Viveros, Corral's 19-year-old 
suspected accomplice, who also was arrested last weekend in Las Vegas. Nevada 
charges of illegal possession of alcohol and lying to police may slow down that 
extradition, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral and Viveros are accused of killing Rowland at the home of Corral's 
girlfriend on July 21. According to police, Corral kicked in the front door of 
the Kirk Avenue residence and shot Rowland once in the stomach. He died less 
than an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Las Vegas Metro Police last weekend, Ventura investigators also 
broke up what they suspect was a revenge plot aimed at Corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested two men, including another suspected gang member, for 
allegedly conspiring to kill Corral. Those charges are pending in Nevada's 
Clark County Justice Court. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TOP SMOG COP RETIRING AFTER NEARLY 40 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After working nearly 40 years enforcing southern California's tough 
anti-pollution laws, Al Danzig figures he is entitled to splurge. 
</P>
<P>
 So Danzig, who retires today as enforcement chief at the Ventura County Air 
Pollution Control District, has decided to buy a new car. And he has already 
picked the type -- a Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the car's reputation as a gas guzzler may make it seem an unlikely 
choice for someone so dedicated to the environment, Danzig said the new models 
meet the state's strict emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Danzig, that is the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not violating the law," he said, "that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig has made it his business since 1956 to make sure motorists, businesses 
and even government offices abide by clean air laws. 
</P>
<P>
 As a smog cop for the South Coast Air Quality Management District in the late 
1950s, Danzig patrolled the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles for smoke-belching 
cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a badge and a blue uniform and driving a black-and-white patrol car, 
Danzig and other smog cops stopped and cited drivers whose vehicles did not 
meet pollution-control standards. AQMD officials decided in the 1970s to stop 
using smog cops, who had been unarmed, because the job had become too 
dangerous, Danzig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig served in various enforcement jobs with the AQMD for 28 years and then 
with the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District for 5 1/2 years before 
coming to Ventura County in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his retirement, he will work part-time for the Environmental 
Protection Agency, traveling around the country training air pollution control 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Danzig's leadership in Ventura County, the staff of the Air Pollution 
Control District's enforcement division has grown from three people to 16. And 
the number of fines that the department collects from polluting businesses has 
grown from about $25,000 a year to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he still considers himself a smog cop, Danzig said his department 
tries to collaborate with the 1,400 businesses it regulates rather than just 
punish them. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig and his team of inspectors try to help dry cleaners, chemical companies 
and other businesses that emit pollutants comply with clean-air laws by 
upgrading their equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the toughest part of his job, Danzig said, has been enforcing Ventura 
County's controversial Rule 210 -- the law that makes employers responsible for 
getting workers to car-pool, use mass transit or find other ways to work rather 
than driving alone in their automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking people to change their driving habits is far more difficult than 
forcing companies to install new equipment, he said. "Now we're dealing with 
social evolution instead of technological evolution." MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AIDS CARE COMES UP SHORT IN FUNDING BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AIDS Care of Ventura County has lost an appeal for aid from a local consortium 
that distributes federal funds to help HIV-infected people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately for us, the funding review came at a time of great turmoil in 
the agency," said Doug Green, AIDS Care's third executive director in the past 
seven months."We were still denied in the (appeal), but the scoring was much 
closer the second time." 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS Care, which had received funding for the past three years, was denied a 
part of $300,000 in federal grants last month by the Ventura County HIV Care 
Consortium. The consortium distributes federal AIDS money under the Ryan White 
AIDS Emergency Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium spread the money out to eight other agencies. It had ranked 
AIDS Care ninth on its list of 10 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 After AIDS Care appealed, United Way representatives from Northern California 
were brought in to examine the applications. They also ranked AIDS Care's 
application ninth, but the rankings were closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said AIDS Care, which has a $200,000 operating budget made up of private 
donations, will be able to survive without compromising its services. MIGUEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; INMATE MAY FACE 2ND '3 STRIKES' CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man facing life in prison for petty theft under the 
"three-strikes-and-you're-out" law who is now accused of raping his cellmate 
will probably be charged under the new statute a second time, prosecutors said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt C. McCowan, 52, pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Ventura County 
Municipal Court to one count of forcible sodomy and one count of sodomy 
committed in a correctional facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said McCowan could become the first 
defendant in California to be charged twice under the three-strikes law if a 
judge orders him to stand trial on the sodomy charges at his Aug. 10 
preliminary hearing, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly appears that way," McGee said. "I can think of no compelling 
reason why we wouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the three-strikes statue, judges must sentence anyone who has two prior 
violent or serious felony convictions, and who is convicted of a third felony, 
to at least 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after he was convicted last week of stealing 18 bottles of cologne, 
qualifying him for a three-strikes sentence, McCowan allegedly raped his 
cellmate, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 His case has been assigned to the presiding judge of the Superior Court, 
Melinda A. Johnson. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SHELLFISH QUARANTINE ENDS; BAN REMAINS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The quarantine on shellfish imposed by Ventura County Public Health officials 
during the McGrath Lake oil spill late last year was lifted Wednesday, but the 
seasonal ban on taking the animals remains in effect through October. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Health Officer Gary Feldman said test results of samples of mussels and 
clams taken recently were free from oil and any other residue leftover from the 
December oil spill north of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the seasonal quarantine that prohibits consumption of shellfish between 
May and October each year is still in effect, Feldman said. The so-called "red 
tide" condition that exists in summer months increases the risk of poisoning if 
the shellfish are consumed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "don't worry about the oil," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took longer than necessary to get the (test) results," he said. "But since 
I was in the middle of a general quarantine anyway, I just waited to get an 
accurate evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman issued a public health advisory days after 84,000 gallons of heavy 
crude oil leaked from a Bush Oil Co. pipeline. He warned beach-goers not to eat 
the clams and mussels along the coast because of possible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill killed hundreds of migratory birds and prompted the closure of seven 
miles of coastline. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOLARSHIP WINNER WISE BEYOND YEARS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Autumn Kerr is not your average 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 A Simi Valley honors student who would rather watch the nightly news than 
"Beavis and Butt-head," Autumn was recently awarded a $1,000 college 
scholarship in a statewide academic contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley View Junior High School eighth-grader finished first among 35 girls 
7 to 12 years old in the California All-American Student contest. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning the event earlier this month, Autumn qualifies for a scholastic 
competition at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even expect to win," she said Tuesday, holding a handful of medals 
and a giant cardboard check. "I said to myself, 'Even if I don't get in the top 
10, I'll still be happy for the experience.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The contest evaluated students on the basis of their academic skills, poise 
and public speaking. During the three-day competition, students were required 
to write an essay, take a multiple-choice exam and participate in a series of 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The final stage of competition required a timed response to a question. Autumn 
was asked, "If you could ask President Clinton to change one thing about our 
country, what would it be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her response: "The health care system. That really is hard on America today." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to swimming and playing softball and volleyball, Autumn said she 
likes to exercise her brain by reading and keeping up with current events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch the news every night," she said. "And I like to read the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Beavis and Butt-head, she could not care less. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL URGED TO RAISE DEVELOPER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Convinced that new residential development costs the city more than it 
contributes, Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski has persuaded her 
colleagues to consider dramatically hiking developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday approved a study that will identify costs the city 
incurs each time new housing is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants, working with city managers, will examine how much Thousand Oaks 
spends to provide new residents with such services as libraries, police 
patrols, street sweeping and road maintenance. They will then decide whether to 
impose new developer fees to help fund those services. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Grant Brimhall said he did not yet know how much the study will 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Zinke of the Building Industry Assn. has estimated that developer fees add 
$20,000 to $30,000 to the price of a single-family home. But the city is 
considering hiking them still further to pay for unanticipated projects, 
especially road improvements in the Newbury Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever costs we absorb are absolutely passed on," she said. "For people to 
say we can absorb the costs (by cutting into profits) -- well, yes, we can, and 
we can go out of business, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite developers' firm opposition, however, Zukowski said the city must 
consider raising fees in order to ensure financial stability as the population 
grows. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Ventura County commuters who rely on Los Angeles public transit to get to work 
can call a toll-free hot line for updates on the MTA strike and alternate 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transit in Ventura County has not been affected by the strike. But some 
residents may be affected if they take the bus or train to work once they are 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The number for the hot line, which provides information in English and 
Spanish, is 1-800-COMMUTE. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line offers updates on MTA bus routes and rail schedules, Metrolink 
schedules and fares, car-pool and van-pool information and Caltrans freeway 
advisories. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District will spend $275,000 over the next five 
years to make the district's buildings fully accessible to the disabled, school 
board members decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Only $50,000 will be spent over the next six months, however, to meet the 
January, 1995, deadline for compliance to the Americans with Disabilities 
Act.All public agencies, including schools, are required to meet ADA 
requirements by the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mary Beth Wolford assured board members that $50,000 worth of initial 
improvements, such as wheelchair ramps and restroom alterations, is enough to a 
make a "good faith effort" toward compliance with the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the board unanimously approved the expenditure, some board members 
questioned whether more money should be spent right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that that isn't enough to show a good faith effort," board 
member Diane Collins said during Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 An evaluation of the district's existing facilities by an outside consultant 
determined 28 areas that needed improvements, including parking spaces and 
signs, wheelchair ramps and restroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already done some things," said Roger Grady, director of planning and 
facilities for the district. "Resurfacing in parking lots, new ramps -- we want 
to make sure there is access to the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements will be paid for with money the district receives from the 
state for student attendance. The $275,000 needed to fully comply with the 
federal law is not a stiff price tag considering how many sites need 
adjustments, Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fairly minimal seeing as how we have 33 sites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Educational Service Center is the first facility that will be upgraded 
because it services the most people, Grady said. Structures at the secondary 
schools and adult education are next on the list. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD OKS $259,000 FOR VEHICLES

<P>
 Lagging two years behind on its vehicle replacement plan, the Simi Valley 
school board approved a $259,000 expenditure this week to purchase new school 
buses and maintenance trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite financial problems, district officials told the board that the 
district's vehicle fleet has deteriorated so badly that it hinders employees' 
ability to drive safely and efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have workers who have no vehicles to go out and do the work in," Supt. 
Mary Beth Wolford told the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from a variety of accounts budgeted for new and replacement equipment 
will pay for the new vehicles, which will include three 20-passenger school 
buses, four maintenance trucks, three vans and a warehouse truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolford said the district should have the new vehicles by December. TRACY

AROUND THE VALLEY: BUILDING IS NO MINI-MALL -- IT'S MAXIMAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the western San Fernando Valley in a proper suburban location between a 
freeway and an industrial park lies what is arguably the perfectly 
representative Southern California building. 
</P>
<P>
 It houses the headquarters of a prominent hair-care and beauty products 
manufacturer; a salon; a cosmetics shop; a rain-forest exhibit; a gym, and -- 
to dissuade any thoughts that we are solely consumers who produce only 
entertainment -- a high-tech defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a politically correct collection of tenants with slick, futuristic names 
like Perceptronics, Aesthetics and Quest Fitness. The defense contractor, known 
chiefly for its simulated war games and weapons-training programs, is beating 
its electronic swords into digital plowshares. 
</P>
<P>
 The hair-care and beauty products are cruelty-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the landscaping is drought-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills building is architecturally distinct. Its main entrance on 
DeSoto Avenue is an imposing gray stone pyramid edged in neat rows of tall 
green horse tails (those leafless, bamboo-like stalks). Inside, concrete floors 
dotted with silvery squiggles and furniture upholstered in fuchsia and neon 
orange look like something out of the Jetsons. 
</P>
<P>
 With a place like this to work, work out and be groomed in, why ever leave? 
Who needs the biospheres of Arizona? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for the gym to open its juice bar -- then we'd have 
everything," said Perceptronics personnel director Devra Eckmann with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old defense contractor, which specializes in "virtual reality" 
simulators, occupies two floors on the north side of the building. 
Forward-thinking as it is, the firm is dispensing with full metal jackets for 
exposed metal ductwork; some of the revealed pipes in its ceilings are even 
painted pastel. A small atrium holds dozens of corn plants -- a restful view 
when looking up from the lens of a trainer TOW, or Tube-launched, Optically 
tracked, Wire-Command-Link-Guided anti-tank weapon system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bulk of its work remains defense-related, the company wants to 
convert its simulation technology to civilian uses and has already done some 
jobs tailor-made to Los Angeles, at least before the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a fancy "surrogate travel" marketing device for a Beverly Hills 
developer who wanted clients to be able to "tour" their future mansions and 
lush grounds before they were even built. And a gift-of-the-year from Neiman 
Marcus' Christmas catalogue was a $20,000 exercise bike with workout levels 
(flat, hilly) coordinated to an attached large-screen TV that displays 
appropriate terrain to the pedaler. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtual bike tour has yet to make its way to Quest Fitness, although the 
gym's clients include Perceptronics CEO Gershon Weltman and software engineer 
Moshe Kirsh. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the gym's managers, a buff Marine veteran and aspiring physical 
therapist named Richard Irby, confirmed it will soon open a juice bar serving 
sandwiches and cappuccino, before he was summoned to check an aerobics-class 
stereo on the blink. Class members kept stomping and leaping in rhythm, even 
without the soundtrack of Van Halen's "Jump" to urge them on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women -- they're serious about their workouts now, music or no music," 
Irby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym is open 24 hours a few days a week, he said. For anyone who feels like 
moving into the building or just spending the night and needs a change of 
clothes, Quest also has a pro shop selling comfy sweats. There are personal 
trainers available, a nutritionist and a masseuse.  
</P>
<P>
 "We say it's the quintessential California building," Eckmann said. "We just 
need a film studio and we'd be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even without one, there is glamour enough at the C.E.N.T.R.E. salon, where you 
can get your hair cut, colored, permed or relaxed in an atmosphere that oozes 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Already perfect-looking clients sip water, juice or coffee as French rap 
blares. The partitions between workstations are artfully bubbled and cracked 
clear glass, providing privacy while also letting in plenty of natural light. A 
leggy gamin drifts past in a miniskirt, white knee socks and a pair of 
elevated, post-modern Mary Janes. The Spank-Me-Hard look. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, you pay in the Profumeria, purveyor of ultra-sensual, 
ultra-expensive beauty products made from rain-forest extracts, the (plastic) 
bottles say. They're made by the Sebastian company, also headquartered in the 
building. Farther down the hall is the euphemistically named Aesthetics, which 
does waxing, electrolysis, derma peels, plus a couple other sadomasochistic 
beautification procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the Little Green Rainforest, an educational exhibit aimed at 
children and often serving as a sort of in-house day-care center. "A lot of 
times, I'll send my clients' children in there to sort of browse around and 
keep them busy," said hair stylist Adrienne Firestone, who takes an aerobics 
class at Quest Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 By now it's probably obvious that this assembly of complimentary businesses 
didn't just come together spontaneously but was planned that way. In fact, 
Sebastian either owns or is affiliated with most of the building's tenants 
except for Perceptronics and Quest Fitness -- and it sought out a gym for the 
premises. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's contrived -- so what? So are a lot of things we enjoy here in Image 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 It just makes this building that much more a perfect little microcosm of 
Southern California.

GOING FOR GOLD AT SURFING EVENTS; ECONOMY: MERCHANTS, SPONSORS ARE BANKING ON 
BIG FINANCIAL REWARDS FROM THE OP PRO AND THE U.S. OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS IN 
HUNTINGTON BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Surf's up here, and Sebastian International Inc. is hoping to catch a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Woodland Hills-based hair salon products company is bringing more than 
2,000 people to Huntington Beach's Waterfront Hilton next week for a convention 
and sales force pep rally tied to the company's role as a major sponsor of the 
inaugural U.S. Open of Surfing. Sebastian will also be introducing a new line 
of products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're involved with the U.S. Open because surfing is something that forms 
trends in clothing, music and people's lifestyles," said Michael Hastings, 
Sebastian's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing to gain just as much are local businesses and the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants are counting on a strong boost from surfers and fans at the U.S. 
Open, as well as from corporate guests of the contest's sponsors, including 
Coca-Cola, Chevrolet and Haagen-Dazs. And they are hoping that, when 
conventioneers and visiting dignitaries aren't working, they'll be eating, 
drinking and shopping around town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials see an opportunity to improve an image tarnished by Fourth of 
July disturbances two years in a row and scenes of police officers in riot gear 
trying to clear the downtown streets. Late-night violence this year resulted in 
more than 50 people being arrested on a variety of charges, including public 
drunkenness and failure to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter that negative picture, the televised surf coverage to be provided 
by Prime Ticket "is publicity that you can't buy," said Diane Baker, president 
of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau. "It's all about 
building image and pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a beach community, and we market ourselves as 8 1/2 miles of beautiful 
beach. That's what people are going to see on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Many surfers and fans are already arriving for the 13th annual Ocean Pacific 
Pro Surfing Championship (Op Pro), which runs through Sunday. The Op Pro serves 
as a qualifying event for the U.S. Open, which begins Tuesday and runs through 
Aug. 7 and is the first Assn. of Surfing Professionals' world tour event on the 
U.S. mainland since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they're prepared for the thousands of beach-goers expected 
to jam the beach in downtown Huntington Beach during the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Op Pro is expected to draw as many as 5,000 fans on weekdays and 20,000 
people daily on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 For the U.S. Open next week, attendance is expected to soar. "We're prepared 
for the maximum-case scenario, which is 25,000 people a day for the qualifying 
days, jumping to 50,000 on Friday and 100,000 daily on Saturday and Sunday," 
said Ron Hagan, Huntington Beach's director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do local officials expect violence like the beachfront riot that marred 
the Op Pro in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year after the riot, we changed the logistics. We haven't had a problem 
since," Hagan said. "We don't let people get inebriated on the beach, we 
eliminated the bikini contest, and we don't have live bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've changed the event from a 'Beach Blanket Bingo' type thing to a major 
sporting event. You don't get the party animal types . . . you get the person 
who's interested in" sports. 
</P>
<P>
 There are early signs that beachfront businesses are doing well. Aaron Pai, 
owner of Huntington Beach Surf & Sport on Main Street across from the pier, 
reports that his shop has already sold out of two shipments of U.S. Open 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel space is scarce. Sebastian International, for example, was able to book 
enough rooms at the Waterfront Hilton for the first half of its convention but 
will have to move to a Long Beach hotel for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, of the Conference and Visitors Bureau, said it's too early to predict 
just how much additional business the two surf events will generate. "We'll 
have a much better idea in the next few days," she said. "But we think the 
Huntington Beach area and its neighbors, including Fountain Valley and Newport 
Beach, should benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials see potential gains far beyond image enhancement. 
Surfing fans will use city-owned garages and will patronize beach-area food 
concessions that generate tax revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that lots of people show up, park in our garage and buy food," 
Hagan said.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: CORPORATE '1984' MAY INTRUDE ABOUT 10 YEARS LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a glimpse of where management is heading in an increasingly technological 
world, don't just look to the casual campuses of Silicon Valley corporations. 
Instead, pay close attention to America's largest bureaucracy and how it's been 
analyzing the horror of aerial fratricide. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons here offer a sobering preview of how "knowledge workers" will do 
their jobs in the coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of errors surrounding the accidental shooting down of two U.S. 
Army UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters over Northern Iraq in April by two U.S. jets 
was painfully detailed in a 21-volume report recently issued by the Pentagon. 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry described the report as "profoundly 
disturbing." Gen. John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, found the details to be "shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this report will trigger essential reforms of the military command 
and control system. But what makes this analysis so provocative won't be found 
in the thoughtful details of future recommendations but in the comprehensive 
details of the disaster itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Between computer consoles, audio recordings and the videotapes, practically 
every meaningful gesture and decision during the incident was captured, 
recorded and documented. From conversations between the E-3A AWACS controllers 
and the F-15C pilots to what was on the radar at any given time to the video of 
the downing of the helicopters, these professionals were under constant 
monitoring and surveillance. Their decisions -- whether good or bad, intuitive 
or analytical -- would become part of an immutable record. Privacy means 
nothing here. 
</P>
<P>
 This high-tech environment of highly trained individuals collaborating in the 
context of vital communications is the prototype for tomorrow's 
high-performance organizations. The social, economic and technological trends 
all point to multimedia monitoring as an integral management tool. The cost of 
capturing data continues to plummet; enterprises are increasingly becoming 
networked via electronic mail, and top managers insist on knowing what's going 
on at any given moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The same high-tech infrastructures of surveillance that have become an 
essential part of the military seem destined to be replicated by organizations 
comparably concerned about mission analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do welfare recipients in Los Angeles, IRS workers in Washington and 
senior partners at New York law firms have in common?" asks Marc Rotenberg, 
director of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He worries about whether AWACS standards should apply to desk-bound 
executives: "Three years out, they will all be part of high-tech organizational 
monitoring efforts. . . . Unlimited data capture is what the modern workplace 
increasingly provides for management. The more sophisticated the organization, 
the more likely it will want to do things like keep tabs on electronic mail and 
computer systems usage." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Rotenberg observes, companies thought nothing of using 
electronic surveillance techniques to monitor lower-echelon employee 
performance. In the name of assessing productivity, telephone company 
supervisors eavesdrop on their operators; software counts the number of 
keystrokes per minute of data entry workers.

 What with massive managerial layoffs, the proliferation of low-cost digital 
technologies and the need to better assess productivity, white-collar 
"knowledge workers" are becoming just as vulnerable to electronic surveillance 
as their blue-collar counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surveillance is creeping up the 'org' chart," Rotenberg says. "This is the 
next generation of the punch clock, but I don't think people really appreciate 
yet the level of depth and comprehension of the data collection these 
technologies can manage." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, society thinks nothing of putting flight recorders and black boxes 
in jetliners flown by highly skilled commercial pilots. In fact, society 
insists on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the multibillion-dollar shenanigans in Wall Street trading firms, why 
shouldn't a Kidder Peabody or a Salomon Bros. insist on recording conversations 
on trading desks or tracking software manipulations on computer consoles? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, consider that the health care economy makes up over 15% of the 
nation's gross domestic product. Health care is a field ripe for extensive 
electronic surveillance. The stakes are life and death, and medicine has a 
healthy tradition of record-keeping. Intensive-care units are electronically 
monitored. Extending that network to other parts of a hospital should be 
cost-effectively straightforward. Similarly, videotaping operations and using 
digital-compression techniques to store the tapes might also make economic 
sense. Indeed, the insurance companies and malpractice lawyers of tomorrow may 
insist on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is a compelling health and safety need, there is a reason for 
electronic surveillance tools," acknowledges Evan Hendricks, who edits the 
Privacy Times. "But generally, making your people live in a fishbowl is highly 
stressful and counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the technologies to monitor and track is becoming so cheap and easy 
that it's understandable why organizations will use them. Just how much time is 
that auditor spending on those electronic spreadsheets? Why does this copy 
editor spend so much more time per story than that copy editor? Why does this 
senior manager send out proportionately more electronic mail -- but get so 
little in reply? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday we couldn't answer those questions cheaply. Today we can. Tomorrow 
we can monitor even more for less. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Orwell's "1984" making its corporate appearance a decade late? There's no 
way of knowing yet. But just as the Pentagon now depends on its multimedia 
autopsies to prevent future disasters, these new media of surveillance are 
destined to be on the job along with us.

AT&T PULLS THE PLUG ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATOR; TECHNOLOGY: COMPANY SAYS ITS EO 
DIDN'T SELL WELL ENOUGH. MOVE COMES EVEN AS PCS LICENSES ARE BEING POUNCED ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even as bids reached towering heights at a federal auction of the airwaves for 
the newest generation of wireless communications devices, AT&T announced 
Wednesday that it is giving up on EO, a 3-year-old venture that sought to 
exploit exactly that market. 
</P>
<P>
 EO produced a so-called personal communications device -- a hand-held computer 
that can send electronic mail, among other things -- that flopped in a market 
that has proven slow to develop. AT&T said that when its partners refused to 
invest more money to rejuvenate the product, it decided to pull the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the slow development of the personal communicator market generally and 
the low acceptance of EO's products, AT&T believed it would not be prudent for 
AT&T to invest more in EO without additional financing from other investors," 
said Carl S. Ledbetter, president of AT&T Consumer Products and an EO board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Ledbetter said he sees no irony in the fact that AT&T's 
pullout occurred during the week that investors were pouring about $470 million 
into the Federal Communications Commission's auction of licenses to operate 
such devices -- far above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bidding on the licenses shows an enormous number of people are willing to 
bet that there will be an enormous market when we get it right," Ledbetter 
said. "We are still a long-term investor in this business category, but EO's 
implementation may not be it." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T wouldn't say what it had invested in Sunnyvale, Calif.-based EO. The 
company said it will take a charge against earnings, but it said the charge 
will not have a significant effect on corporate results. 
</P>
<P>
 EO can take some comfort in the problems facing everybody else in the 
business. Virtually all companies looking at the personal communicator business 
-- including Apple Computer, Motorola, Compaq, Microsoft and IBM -- have 
complained of unusually tough hurdles in designing products that combine 
multiple technologies, tackling a new market and facing high requirements for 
quality, price and usability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 EO was formed in 1991 with backing from such big names as AT&T, Japanese 
electronics giant Matsushita Electric and Italian computer power Olivetti. The 
idea of a portable device for the mobile executive that could be a phone and 
fax as well as offer e-mail was attractive and received much publicity. EO 
predicted 100 million personal communicators would be sold by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the product came out in 1993, it cost $3,000, weighed six pounds and 
was the size of a note pad. Customers weren't interested. Only 10,000 of the 
gadgets were sold. The company cut its 200-man staff in half in February. The 
closing will throw 97 people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may take 10 or 12 years before we can look back and say this market was 
successful," Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology shortcomings were a key factor in problems at EO as well as with 
Apple's Newton. Both products relied heavily on handwriting recognition to 
avoid having to include a large keyboard. Users found the technology clumsy and 
impractical. Handwriting technology will play a far smaller role in new 
products such as Microsoft's WinPad. 
</P>
<P>
 The EO product's greatest strength, its cellular phone, also proved to be a 
great weakness. While consumer use of cellular phones is subsidized by service 
providers, so that one can buy for $100 a phone that may cost five or 10 times 
that to make, EO had to charge customers the full cost of adding a phone to its 
device. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer introduced a second version of its Newton to respond to 
complaints about the handwriting-recognition problem as well as the lack of 
communications on the device. But while the Newton can now receive e-mail 
messages, it must be plugged into a phone jack to send them. 
</P>
<P>
 A new generation of devices is trying to learn from the tribulations of EO and 
Apple. But they are facing tough engineering and marketing challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola said earlier this month that shipment of its Envoy, a $1,500 device 
that could send and receive faxes and e-mail, would be postponed until the end 
of the year for additional testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These systems are very complex," said Jeff Morris, vice president of 
marketing at Motorola's wireless data group, citing the challenge of combining 
a new operating system with a computer and a wireless transmitter. For example, 
the microprocessors, which provide the computer capability, and the device's 
transmitter tend to interfere with each other's operation unless they are 
properly shielded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty of bringing together all of the various elements required to 
make the personal communicator work means the handy devices won't arrive as one 
great revolutionary gadget everybody will want, said Gerry Purdy, editor of 
Mobile Letter, an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see this developing step by step," he said, adding that the first big 
step won't come with expensive products such as Motorola's Envoy but with 
cheaper devices such as two-way pagers that can send and receive snippets of 
text and voice messages. 
</P>
<P>
 But such low-cost devices may create demand for the more sophisticated 
products now coming on the market. Such use will also help create the 
communications infrastructure needed to support the personal communicator 
business. Personal Communicators 
</P>
<P>
 At&T is pulling out of the market for hand-held communications gadgets though 
some forecasters see a fast-growing future for them. Here are some of the 
devices available now or slated for introduction in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compaq: Plans a hand-held communicator in mid-1995 that will use Microsoft 
WinPad, a portable extension of Windows. The product offers E-mail and software 
for scheduling and other personal tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Newton: The second-generation product is still selling slowly. Apple 
is targeting corporate customers as opposed to the general market. The Newton 
has a similar range of functions as promised by WinPad. 
</P>
<P>
 * EO: A startup backed by AT&T, Matsushita and Olivetti that sold 10,000 units 
and is now liquidating. The device is a cellular phone with fax and E-mail 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Motorola and Sony: Both are expected to introduce devices this summer using 
Magic Cap, software produced by General Magic. Features: e-mail, home shopping, 
personal productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell South: A product called Simon, built by IBM and Mitsubishi Electric, 
was expected out in March but is now slated for late summer. Fax, pager, 
cellular phone and E-mail.

INFLATION FEAR ARISES FROM POSITIVE DATA; ECONOMY: DURABLE GOODS ORDERS SHOW A 
SHARP INCREASE AND FORD POSTS A RECORD PROFIT, RAISING SPECTER OF FED RATE 
HIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's manufacturing sector is so strong it's scaring some people on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. reported record quarterly earnings Wednesday of more than $1.7 
billion, and the Commerce Department said orders for big-ticket durable goods 
rose a sharp 1.3% last month, triggering a new round of inflation fears that 
sent bond yields higher and stock prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The two reports refueled investor concerns that the economy may be running too 
fast for its own good and that the Federal Reserve might soon raise interest 
rates again in its continuing battle to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects of another rate increase pushed bond yields sharply higher, with the 
yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbing to 7.61% from 7.54% on 
Tuesday. Stocks fell, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 15.21 
points at 3720.47. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of factories are running at full speed, and price hikes are starting to 
filter into the economy," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of financial 
services giant Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "This increases the probability 
that the Fed will have to raise rates again in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department's report that factory orders for durable goods shot up 
1.3% in June from May to a seasonally adjusted $151 billion surprised most 
analysts, who had expected an increase of only half that. June was the fourth 
straight month in which orders rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup was widespread, with demand for cars and other 
transportation-related items up a strong 2.3%, orders for industrial machinery 
up 2.2%, and bookings for electronic equipment up 1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already, many American manufacturers -- from auto makers to furniture 
companies -- say their factories are running at full tilt and that the prices 
they charge to consumers are beginning to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing its record $1.71-billion second-quarter profit Wednesday, Ford 
noted that its auto plants have been operating overtime during the past few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford also said its per-car profits have doubled, in part because strong 
consumer demand has allowed it to raise prices and trim back costly incentive 
programs. Chrysler Corp. reported its own record earnings last week, and 
General Motors is expected to announce similarly good news today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's second quarter "was double last year and showed better pricing (and) 
stronger unit sales," said David Healy, an auto industry analyst for S.G. 
Warburg & Co. in New York. "You're going to have to look pretty hard to find a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But if sales by U.S. manufacturers remain strong, more companies will begin 
raising their prices and inflation could make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already seen the auto companies raise their prices, and we can expect 
some other industries to start raising prices because they're running at full 
steam and still can't keep up with demand," Sohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Higher prices means higher inflation for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep inflation from surging out of control, some analysts say, the Fed has 
little choice but to raise interest rates again in an effort to keep the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has already raised its short-term discount rate four times since 
February, but the economy has continued to hum along. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp jump in durable-goods orders "reinforces my expectation that the Fed 
is going to move rates higher again soon," said Richard Berner, an economist 
with Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although consumers have already begun feeling the pinch of higher prices, the 
pain could get even worse in 1995, according to a survey also released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based William M. Mercer Inc., the nation's largest human resources 
consulting firm, said its poll of 1,800 mid-size and large employers found them 
planning to raise wages by an average 4.2% in each region of the country next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Federal Reserve has said it expects inflation to run as high as 3.5% 
in 1995, so workers who don't get at least average raises "risk finding 
themselves in an inflationary squeeze," said Linda Ison, a Mercer consultant.

CALIFORNIA, HERE WE STAY; MORE BUSINESSES ARE FINDING REASONS TO REMAIN IN THE 
STATE 
</P>

 After Freeman Cosmetics decided to expand its manufacturing operations back in 
1991, it did what hundreds of other companies in Southern California have done 
in recent years: It moved elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the usual array of problems that the region's corporate executives have 
long complained about -- a long list that ranged from high real estate values 
to burdensome pollution regulations -- the cosmetics maker emptied out its 
manufacturing plant in Long Beach and headed for the Las Vegas area, lured by 
cheap land and no state income tax. The company took about 100 jobs with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the fast-growing shampoo and skin care company needs an even bigger 
facility, in part because its work force has grown to 350. But rather than 
simply expand its current Nevada plant, Freeman is moving again -- back to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that today's California is completely different than the one we 
left a few years ago, but it's certainly a better place to do business than it 
once was," said Larry Freeman, the firm's chief executive. "And frankly, a lot 
of my best executives are sick of 115-degree heat."  
</P>
<P>
 Although experts say the exodus of companies from California isn't over, the 
wagon train is at least getting shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 Relocations to other states peaked in 1992, when 140 companies announced plans 
to move nearly 18,000 jobs out of Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties, according to the Economic Development Corp. of Los 
Angeles County. About 44 firms began packing their bags in 1993, taking nearly 
7,100 jobs with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is still feeling the ripple effects of those moves. The 
last of the 800 workers at Transamerica Insurance Group, which decided to move 
about a year ago, are just now cleaning out their Woodland Hills offices, with 
the few who still have jobs with the company heading for its new corporate 
headquarters in Texas. Officials at Haas Automation, a fast-growing machine 
tool manufacturer with more than 200 workers in Chatsworth, said earlier this 
month that it wants to depart by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, though, only eight companies, employing a total of slightly 
more than 2,000 workers, have officially announced plans to leave the region. 
</P>
<P>
 And though few of the firms that left earlier have taken the extraordinary 
step of coming back, Freeman's plan to "re-relocate" in either Covina or the 
Rancho Dominguez area is the latest in a string of signs that California is 
beginning to shed its image as a lousy place to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn a state's reputation around overnight, but California is 
taking steps toward becoming a little more business-friendly, and its economy 
is definitely on the upswing," said David Hensley, who left his job as UCLA's 
chief forecasting czar about a year ago and is now a regional economist for 
Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some (California) companies are starting to look around and realize 
that the grass isn't necessarily greener in other states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even MagneTek, an electrical equipment firm that announced Tuesday that it 
will move its headquarters from Los Angeles to Tennessee as part of a corporate 
restructuring, said California's business climate had nothing to do with the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50 jobs MagneTek will take with it will be offset by the 100 that will be 
created by BHP Steel USA, which began building a new wing at its existing 
Rancho Cucamonga plant Tuesday after deciding against moving out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the luster that has returned to the Golden State's business image 
stems from last year's well-publicized overhaul of California's fraud-ridden 
workers' compensation system and the package of state tax incentives approved 
for companies that want to expand or modernize their plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the governor and the Legislature didn't push those changes through, there 
would be a lot fewer jobs in California than there are today," said Bill 
George, Gov. Pete Wilson's deputy director of the Department of Commerce and 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is another key factor now keeping businesses from leaving: a 
long, recession-induced decline in real estate prices that has cut as much as 
50% from the cost of building or renting space over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was soaring real estate values that helped fuel the business exodus from 
California in the first place, experts say. When property values were rising 
more than 20% annually in the late 1980s, many companies wanting to expand 
moved to states where land was cheaper because rents and real estate prices 
were simply too high here.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they were willing to put up with all of California's other problems, 
a lot of companies just couldn't cope with our high real estate prices," said 
Adrian Sanchez, regional economist at the First Interstate Bank headquarters in 
Los Angeles. High rents pushed operating costs out of sight, Sanchez said, and 
exorbitant home values made it difficult to recruit and keep good workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Southern California real estate prices had peaked near 1990, the 
exodus continued because many firms had by then become fed up with government 
red tape and were nervous about the looming recession, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the regional economy is back on track and government bureaucracy 
has gotten a little smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Property values have tumbled so far that it is actually cheaper to rent 
first-class office space in Downtown Los Angeles than in Phoenix or Seattle, or 
to buy a manufacturing facility in the South Bay or Riverside than to build one 
in Las Vegas, said Bob Bach, research director for commercial brokerage giant 
Grubb & Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Large companies still based in Southern California are quietly using the 
current glut of office and industrial space as a powerful weapon to wrest deep 
concessions from landlords and to slash overhead costs by millions of dollars a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell Corp.'s recent decision to keep its corporate headquarters and 
1,000-person work force in Irvine rather than take them to Texas came only 
after it was able to wring a new lease from its landlord, a move that is 
expected to save the fast-food company more than $350,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that can squeeze their landlords and get help from their local or 
state government can compound their winnings. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carson-based Leiner Health Care Products needed to expand its vitamin- 
and drug-making plant in the South Bay last year, officials in Nevada, Arizona 
and Colorado tried to woo its executives with tax credits, job-training 
subsidies and reimbursement for relocation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Leiner instead found two vacant 250,000-square-foot warehouses in Carson 
owned by a landlord ready to deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's office offered some state tax credits of its own, and the city 
of Carson chipped in $600,000 to help fund construction of a conveyor bridge 
linking the two buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiner's 1,200 employees will move into their new facility next month, and the 
company may add a few hundred more jobs soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really think that anybody in the government would care if we packed 
up our bags and left," said Gale Bensussen, Leiner's president. "Pleasantly, we 
were dead wrong." Staying Put 
</P>
<P>
 Although no government estimates are available, the number of businesses 
leaving the greater Los Angeles area -- which includes Ventura, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- appears to have peaked in 1992 and has 
dropped dramatically since then. 03,07,15,11 Year Firms leaving Employees 1990

 IBM to Inform PC Employees of Cuts: The company said it will announce Friday 
an expected consolidation in its personal computer operation, eliminating up to 
20% of its job force in that sector.The 1,500 to 2,000 cuts will come as IBM 
moves more of its PC offices and employees to Research Triangle Park, N.C., its 
chief manufacturing site for desktop and laptop computers. The moves, which 
will occur in phases during the next year, involve development teams in Boca 
Raton, Fla. and Lexington, Ky., and procurement personnel in Atlanta and 
elsewhere. Some employees at the division's headquarters in Somers, N.Y., will 
also be moved. IBM employs between 10,000 and 11,000 in its PC operations.

 Aldus to Sell FreeHand: The two computer software companies, which want to 
merge, agreed to sell one of their major products to settle Federal Trade 
Commission concerns that the combined company could dominate the $60-million 
computer illustration business.It was the first FTC challenge to a merger 
between software firms. Seattle-based Aldus Corp. will sell its sophisticated 
illustration program FreeHand to Altsys Corp. in order to merge with Adobe 
System Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. Altsys, based in Richardson, Tex., 
originally developed the FreeHand program. When the Adobe-Aldus merger plan was 
announced in March, the FTC objected that the combined company would have a 
monopoly on professional-illustration software, which enables designers to 
create free-form drawings on computers.

 Chip-Building Alliance Formed: International Business Machines Corp., AT&T 
Corp., Motorola Inc. and Loral Corp. are joining forces to develop a new 
computer chip-making technology based on X-rays instead of ultraviolet 
light.X-rays are expected to allow the production of chips with circuits half 
the width of those found today, making it possible to pack more transistors on 
a chip. This heavyweight alliance comes as companies in the semiconductor 
industry increasingly seek partners to spread the high costs of developing new 
generations of chips, said Ronald Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc. The 
alliance will be formally announced in the next several weeks, an IBM 
spokeswoman said. Marketable products are not expected until early next 
century.

 Denver Airport to Open Without Baggage System Fixed: Officials have decided to 
open Denver International Airport before the problem-plagued automated baggage 
system is working, City Council members were told. The new plan calls for 
combining elements of the $193-million automated system with tags and carts 
like those now used at Stapleton International Airport and other air terminals. 
The new airport has become an embarrassment to Denver and a costly economic 
drain on the city, which originally envisioned the Manhattan-sized facility as 
a prized improvement that would vastly expand business and tourism.

 May Department Stores to Buy Shoe Chain: The St. Louis-based retailer, the 
nation's sixth-largest, said its fast-growing Payless ShoeSource subsidiary 
will acquire Columbus, Ohio-based Kobacker Co.Terms of the deal were not 
disclosed. Kobacker, a private retailer, is shedding almost all its assets. Six 
hundred of the 679 Kobacker stores will be remodeled and reopened. Payless, 
which represented $2 billion of May's $11 billion in sales in 1993, will have 
4,600 outlets after the acquisition and expansions in the next year. "The newly 
acquired stores will add significantly to Payless ShoeSource's nationwide 
presence, strengthening our position in a number of major markets," Payless 
Chairman and Chief Executive Dale Hilpert said.

<P>
 News of an unexpected surge in orders for durable goods in June reignited 
investors' inflation fears, driving interest rates up and stock prices down 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields rose across the board at the same time that the Treasury sold $11 
billion in new five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the bellwether 30-year T-bond shot up to 7.61% from 7.54% on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials fell 15.21 points to 3,720.47, though 
broader indexes generally posted smaller declines. Still, losers topped winners 
by 12 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange in moderate trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that orders to factories for 
long-lasting, big-ticket items such as cars and appliances jumped 1.3% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad-based nature of the surge, which was more than twice market 
expectations, sparked new concern that the Federal Reserve Board will soon 
raise short-term interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger-than-expected gain in orders points to an economy "that's 
overheating, and that's inflationary," warned Stephen Gallagher, economist at 
Kidder Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short rates four times this year in an attempt to moderate 
the economy's pace and keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The durable goods report didn't help the Treasury on Wednesday as it sold the 
five-year notes. But the average yield of 6.98% was lower than the 7% some 
traders thought the Treasury might have to pay as bond market sentiment 
crumbled in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, losses weren't severe overall, as investors again weighed 
generally healthy second-quarter corporate earnings reports against the 
deteriorating bond market outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many analysts warn that the rally in stocks since July 1 is fragile and 
could be upended by another Fed rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "You still have a very nervous market environment," said Marshall Acuff, 
strategist at brokerage Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotech stocks, long depressed, stole the spotlight after Biogen said final 
trials of its multiple sclerosis drug showed that the disease's progression was 
significantly slowed. Biogen said it will seek regulatory approval for the drug 
in the first half of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trial was designed with high expectations, and results are very 
promising," said Jim Vincent, Biogen's chairman. The company declined to 
provide further details of the study, which is to be presented Oct. 10 at a 
neurology meeting in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street, which expects the drug to be a billion-dollar seller, sent Biogen 
shares soaring 15 1/4 to 44 3/4 in wild trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other biotech shares also sparked to life on the news. Amgen jumped 1 
15/16 to 49 3/8, Centocor leaped 1 7/16 to 11 7/16 and Genzyme added 5/8 to 28 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chiron plunged 5 1/8 to 52 5/8. Its rival drug for multiple sclerosis is 
viewed as threatened by the Biogen drug. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense stocks rallied, buoyed by earnings reports from Loral, which rose 1 
7/8 to 36 3/4, and Martin Marietta, which gained 2 to 45 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Lockheed, up 2 1/8 to 63; McDonnell Douglas, up 2 1/2 
to 113 7/8, and Raytheon, up 1 1/8 to 64 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, some industrial issues were clipped despite the strong 
durable goods report. Bethlehem Steel led the selloff, down 1 5/8 to 20 3/4 
after reporting earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industrial losers included International Paper, down 1 5/8 to 71; Alcoa, 
off 2 3/4 to 77 7/8, and Inland Steel, down 7/8 to 37. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks fell despite Ford's healthy profit report. Ford fell 1 to 30 
3/8, Chrysler dropped 1 to 47 1/8 and GM eased 3/4 to 49 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gum giant Wrigley tumbled 4 1/8 to 44 after its earnings fell short of 
expectations. But Disney added 1/2 to 42 1/8 on its report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas, European stocks were pressured by another jump in bond yields 
there, as investors began to refocus on prospects for a resurgence of economic 
growth worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index dropped 34.9 points to 3,082.3. Frankfurt's DAX 
index fell 11.52 points to 2,140.44, while Paris' CAC-40 index gave up 21.15 
points to 2,055.69. European stocks had been rebounding in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, selling of export-oriented high-tech shares helped drag the market 
lower. The Nikkei 225-share index closed down 208.14 points at 20,137.23, 
threatening to fall below the 20,000 mark for the first time in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, however, the Bolsa index soared 39.82 points to 2,433.22, its 
fifth straight advance and the highest level since June 7. Investors' appetite 
for stocks has been recharged primarily by stronger-than-expected corporate 
earnings and by optimism over the ruling party's chances in the Aug. 21 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S.-traded Mexican stocks and funds, Telmex gained 1 1/4 to 60, 
Televisa rose 1 1/2 to 55 3/8, Coca Cola Femsa rose 1/2 to 29 3/8 and Mexico 
Fund jumped 7/8 to 31 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen, after an 
influential U.S. economist and adviser to the Clinton Administration said trade 
sanctions against Japan are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar rose to 98.55 Japanese yen from 98.28 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar fell to 1.574 German marks from 1.584. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities markets, prices for frozen pork bellies tumbled to two-year 
lows at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to abundant supplies, 
pointing to a possible fall in bacon prices for consumers.

 IMF Report Urges Federal Sales Tax: The International Monetary Fund's annual 
report says the United States should consider the tax to reduce its budget 
deficit. The review said that with such a tax, the United States could 
encourage consumers to save more and spend less and could reduce its need for 
foreign investors to finance the deficit through Treasury bond purchases. The 
far-reaching review, covering the year ended April 30, said the IMF's executive 
directors all agreed that the United States should move further to deal with 
its deficit.

STATE SELLS $3 BILLION IN NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong demand from individual investors helped the cash-short state of 
California sell $3 billion in 11-month revenue anticipation notes with relative 
ease Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fixed-rate portion of the notes, or RANs, was originally priced to yield 
4.2% annualized.But heavy demand allowed the deal manager, Bank of America, to 
set the final yield at 4.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the cost to the state is high, reflecting its ongoing budget problems: 
Other, fiscally healthier states would pay as little as 3.9% on similar notes. 
</P>
<P>
 About $2.3 billion worth of the notes were sold at the fixed rate; the other 
$700 million were sold as floating-rate securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was helped by an Internal Revenue Service decision Tuesday clarifying 
a potentially sticky tax issue. The IRS exempted the California notes and 
others from a recent tax ruling that could have resulted in the notes being 
considered "zero-coupon" securities for tax purposes. The IRS said it needs 
more time to study the possible effects of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The RAN offering was the second part of a $7-billion, short-term borrowing 
program necessitated by the state's budget crunch. Last week, California sold 
$4 billion in 21-month securities. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4.1% -- exempt from federal and state income tax -- the yield on the RANs 
is worth significantly more, depending on the investor's tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 34.7% combined state and federal bracket (taxable income of $61,241 to 
$91,850 for joint filers), a 4.1% tax-free yield is the same as a 6.28% fully 
taxable yield.

KAISER WINS BREAK FROM HEALTH REFORM CLAUSE; HEALTH CARE: UNDER THE PROVISION, 
THE HMO WOULD RETAIN CONTROL OVER THE DOCTORS IT HIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kaiser-Permanente, the largest health maintenance organization in the nation, 
has won a special break from a congressional committee that would exempt it 
from a critical element of federal health care reform, lobbyists and 
congressional sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge Oakland-based health system, which provides coverage for 4.6 million 
Californians, would be allowed to retain control over the doctors it hires, 
avoiding proposed new federal regulations that could force other major HMOs to 
use almost any doctors who asked to join their networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser won the exemption in the House Ways and Means Committee, which adopted 
its version of health care reform in late June. Industry lobbyists and 
congressional staff members said Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) pushed the 
amendment, in part to give a similar break to a smaller HMO in his home state, 
Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has praised the Puget Sound organization as 
a model for first-class health care. Rep. Fortney H. (Pete) Stark (D-Oakland), 
chairman of the health subcommittee of the Ways and Means panel, also supported 
the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 The special break for Kaiser gets the big nonprofit organization out of a 
bitter political fight now raging between the nation's physicians and the 
country's rapidly growing HMOs over the direction of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are fearful that the rise of HMOs will limit their independence and 
reduce them to little more than subcontractors for large insurance firms. They 
are using the health care reform legislation now before Congress as a way to 
push for new restrictions on how HMOs control physicians and their access to 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the American Medical Assn., which represents 300,000 of the 
nation's doctors, has fought for a provision in the health care legislation 
that would require an HMO to accept any doctor willing to join its system. 
</P>
<P>
 That controversial "any willing provider" clause was included in the Ways and 
Means bill and may also be included in the House Democratic leadership's health 
care bill that Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) issues in the next 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists for HMOs have argued that such an AMA-backed provision would 
devastate the managed-care industry and make it difficult for any reform effort 
to contain health care costs. The AMA has argued, however, that it would give 
more doctors access to the new world of HMO networks and allow patients to see 
doctors with whom they are most comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Ways and Means legislation, HMOs that hire physicians directly or 
contract with groups of physicians to work exclusively for the HMO would be 
exempt from the AMA-backed proposal. Only a handful of HMOs fit that 
description, and by the far the largest in that category is Kaiser. Most HMOs 
set up networks of physicians who accept HMO patients, but those doctors do not 
work exclusively for those HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal for Kaiser means it could continue its current practices, turning 
away physicians eager to gain access to Kaiser's vast pool of patients. HMOs 
like to limit the number of doctors in their systems to contain costs. By 
directing a large volume of work to a smaller group of physicians, HMOs have 
the leverage to negotiate lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kaiser exempted, the "any willing provider" proposal would mainly affect 
HMOs owned by large insurance firms, notably Aetna, Metropolitan Life, 
Travelers Insurance Co. and Cigna. Lobbyists for those HMOs said they are 
angered by the Kaiser exemption but had been unable to stop it because they 
were fighting other battles on health care.

SONY TO INSTALL DIGITAL SOUND IN AMC THEATERS; MOVIES: $25-MILLION DEAL COULD 
ESTABLISH THE FIRM AS THE LEADER IN ITS BATTLE AGAINST DTS AND DOLBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sony Corp. scored a victory in the digital movie soundtrack wars Wednesday by 
signing an estimated $25-million deal to install its Sony Dynamic Digital Sound 
system in AMC Entertainment theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for AMC to purchase 1,700 SDDS digital film playback units 
for exclusive use in its theaters. The Kansas City, Mo.-based chain has 1,618 
screens, with roughly 400 more planned or under construction. Sony executives 
described the agreement as the largest commitment ever by a theatrical 
exhibitor to a digital cinema sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact also has the potential to establish Sony as the leader in a battle 
against two key rivals: Digital Theater Systems of Westlake Village and Dolby 
Laboratories of San Francisco. Each is pushing to become the industry standard 
for digital movie sound. Most analysts are convinced that only one standard 
will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital movie sound quality is similar to that of compact discs. It offers 
crystal-clear tones free of the snaps and pops sometimes found on traditional 
movie soundtracks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to installing SDDS at AMC theaters, Sony will introduce the system 
in at least 150 of its 900 Sony (formerly Loews Theatres) by the end of the 
year, according to SDDS President Jim Fiedler. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, exhibitors have been reluctant to commit to one digital movie sound 
format over another, although a few have been investing in multiple formats 
because of the rising popularity of digital sound with audiences. Stanley H. 
Durwood, AMC's chairman and chief executive, said his company felt the time was 
right for a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only room for one system, and this is it," Durwood said. "This is a 
signal to all. They better get on the bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony has been talking to all the motion picture studios about SDDS, and it 
expects to see its format on non-Sony Pictures Entertainment movies soon. 
Despite delays in getting the system to market, Sony of America President 
Michael P. Schulhof said he is confident of its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studios follow the marketplace," said Schulhof, a onetime physicist who 
helped introduce digital audio technology in the United States in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 AMC's Durwood said the chain will install 350 SDDS units before Christmas in 
key theaters around the country, including the AMC Century City multiplex, 
where "The Next Karate Kid" will open Aug. 5 as the first film in major release 
featuring SDDS.  
</P>
<P>
 Durwood said AMC decided to go with Sony's system because of superior quality, 
despite its higher cost. "It's pricey," he said, "but the quality, consistency 
and dependability are with SDDS." At $13,800 a theater, SDDS is more expensive 
than DTS and Dolby. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mead, Dolby's vice president of film marketing, downplayed the 
significance of the announcement. "It's business as usual. We're going to 
proceed along," he said. Dolby's hardware has been installed in 700 to 800 
theaters worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead said exhibitors should realize it's in their best interest to do business 
with a company not under the influence of a major studio.

 Sport Utility Vehicles, Trucks Recalled: Isuzu Motors Ltd., American Honda 
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. are recalling about 140,200 vehicles. The 
companies said there have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to 
the problems.The Isuzu and Honda recalls affect 133,190 sport utility vehicles. 
The engines have a rubber and metal oil plug that could dislodge and cause 
leaks that might result in engine damage or fire. Affected are Isuzu Rodeos 
from 1992-94, Honda Passport LX and EX models from 1994 and Isuzu Troopers from 
1992-93. The Chrysler recall involves Dodge Ram 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks 
from 1994 that were built without rear bumpers. Federal crash tests of the 
vehicles showed that impact from the rear could cause fuel leaks.

 EU Sees Japan Trade Discrimination: The European Commission welcomed a 
narrowing of the European Union's chronic trade deficit with Japan, but 
expressed concern that Tokyo was discriminating in favor of goods from the 
United States. John Richardson, head of the commission's unit for relations 
with Japan, said Japan's trade surplus with the EU had fallen by 29.7% in the 
first six months of this year compared to the same period of 1993. But a 
commission statement stressed concern that trade talks between Japan and the 
U.S. had resulted in a series of discriminatory decisions by Japanese importers 
in favor of U.S. goods, to the detriment of European goods.

 Japanese Car Dealer to Sell Chryslers: In a small step toward quieting 
complaints that Japan's car distribution system locks out foreign competition, 
Chrysler Corp. is linking up with a dealership that until now has sold only 
autos made by Daihatsu Motor Co. Chrysler will begin selling its cars, 
including the Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle and the Vision sedan, through 
Niigata Daihatsu Motors Co. on Japan's northern coast.Niigata Daihatsu signed a 
franchise sales agreement with Chrysler's main distributor in Japan, Seibu 
Motor Sales Co. Sales generated by the agreement won't lead to huge gains in 
market share, but Chrysler and Seibu hope the agreement will be the first in a 
series that give them direct access to showrooms, a Seibu spokesman said.

 Strike at Auto Plant Averted: General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers 
tentatively agreed on a local contract for workers who build most of GM's 
Cadillacs.The agreement averted a strike that would have shut the plant. 
Members of UAW Local 22 were set to stop work Wednesday at the 
Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant when they received word of the agreement just 
before a strike deadline, said Susan Lutz, secretary to a vice president of the 
local. About 4,350 production and skilled trades workers build Cadillac 
DeVilles, Sevilles and Eldorados at the plant. Fleetwood models are the only 
Cadillacs not produced there. Details of the agreement were not immediately 
available from union or company officials.

EARNINGS: DISNEY INCOME RISES 3%, BOOSTED BY 'LION KING'; ENTERTAINMENT: PROFIT 
IN ITS THIRD QUARTER HITS $267.5 MILLION, EXCEEDING ANALYSTS' EXPECTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co.'s earnings climbed 3% in its fiscal third quarter as the 
company's animation business continued to roar with "The Lion King" but its 
theme park business languished because of lower attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings in the quarter ended June 30 rose to $267.5 million from $259.1 
million a year earlier, exceeding the expectations of most analysts and causing 
some to boost their estimates for the company's returns in fiscal 1994 and 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The results show that Disney's animated movies and the merchandise they spawn 
continue to be the driving force at the Burbank-based entertainment giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest boosts for Disney came from sales of "The Return of Jafar," the 
videocassette sequel to "Aladdin," and from the initial box office receipts 
from its new animated hit, "The Lion King." In addition, the company benefited 
from sales of "Lion King"-related merchandise and the film's top-selling 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's overall revenue rose 22% to $2.4 million, from $1.9 million a year 
earlier. For the nine months, Disney's earnings climbed 18.1% to $884.5 million 
while revenue climbed 16%, to $7.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for Disney's filmed-entertainment business surged 53% to surpass $1 
billion for the quarter, with operating income rising 24% to $167.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has been plagued by poor results from its recent live-action films such 
as "I Love Trouble" and "Renaissance Man." But "Lion King" has made up the 
difference. The film has grossed more than $200 million domestically in 
slightly more than a month, $70 million of which came before the third quarter 
closed June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's theme park operations fell 4% to $942.2 million, with operating 
revenue dropping 9% to $238.4 million. The company took a $52.8-million charge 
in the quarter related to the recent financial restructuring at Euro Disney, of 
which Disney owns 49%. The company attributed the theme park results largely to 
fewer Europeans visiting the United States and the weak tourism market in 
Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 But Smith Barney analyst Jill S. Krutick said the lack of foreign tourists 
only partly accounts for the languishing theme park business, which she said 
has not been recovering in step with the improving domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that businesses need a fresh look. They need to take a close 
look at the marketing strategies and cost-cutting potentials," Krutick said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she has raised her estimate of Disney's earnings for both 1994 
and 1995 based on the strength of "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Chairman Michael D. Eisner, who is currently recuperating from 
quadruple-bypass surgery, singled out the company's filmed-entertainment and 
consumer products results, both of which show record revenue and operating 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's stock rose 50 cents to $42.125, on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday.

EARNINGS: NORTHROP PROFIT JUMPS 23% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman Corp. said Wednesday that earnings climbed 23% in the latest 
quarter because of higher margins in certain businesses, and sales boomed 28%, 
propelled by the acquisition of Grumman Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second quarter, the giant defense-aerospace firm posted profit of $65 
million, or $1.33 a share, compared to earnings of $53 million, or $1.12 a 
share, a year earlier. Sales increased to $1.68 billion from $1.3 billion in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop said without the Grumman acquisition in the second quarter, sales 
would have declined 13% because of fewer contracts for planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the purchase of Grumman, as expected, was basically neutral 
to earnings in the second quarter, but it expects the acquisition to boost 
results starting in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based company said the Grumman purchase also boosted its order 
backlog to $12 billion from $7 billion a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman said the higher earnings reflect improved operating margin in 
its electronics countermeasures business and a slightly higher profit margin on 
the B-2 bombers. Overall operating margin rose 43% to $133 million. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 AirTouch Communications, formerly the cellular arm of Pacific Telesis Group, 
said it earned $33.1 million in second-quarter profit, nearly triple its 
year-ago performance. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch earned 7 cents a share in the quarter ended June 30, its first as an 
independent company. It earned $12.5 million, or 3 cents a share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue was $279.2 million, up 8% from $259.5 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our second-quarter results confirm that we're building a strong foundation 
that will enable us to continue performing successfully in an increasingly 
competitive industry," Chairman and Chief Executive Sam Ginn said. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch said it has 2.9 million customers for its cellular and paging 
services in the United States and 10 other countries, including Germany, Italy, 
Japan, South Korea and Thailand. It holds a minority stake in the overseas 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp.'s defense-electronics and data-processing subsidiaries 
reported improved second-quarter results Wednesday because of increased demand 
for their products and services. GM's financing business said profit declined, 
largely because of reduced mortgage financing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GM Hughes Electronics said it earned $267.3 million, or 67 cents per GM Class 
H share, up 15% from $232.0 million, or 58 cents a share, the year before. 
Revenue totaled $3.54 billion, up 7% from $3.32 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based 
subsidiary, said the improvement reflects growth in some of the non-defense 
segments of the company, particularly automotive electronics. Although 
production volumes for missiles such as the Stinger and Tomahawk fell, the 
company's defense business improved its profitability because of cost 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Data Systems posted an 11% increase in earnings on a 12% rise in 
revenue as the company won $3.9 billion in new contracts in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS earned $197.3 million, or 41 cents per Class E share, on revenue of $2.33 
billion, up from $178.1 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of $2.1 
billion in the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Plano, Tex.-based data processor said it signed $6.02 billion in new 
contracts in the first half of this year, up from $7.03 billion in all of 1993, 
the best year in EDS history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit-based General Motors Acceptance Corp. earned $216 million in the 
second quarter, down 24% form $285 million earned the year before. GMAC 
attributed most of the decline to a reduction in both financing and insurance 
operations, notably mortgage results, a reflection of the industrywide decline 
in mortgage originations because of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance subsidiary financed or leased 333,000 new vehicles in the second 
quarter, 16% below the year-earlier results. Outside the United States, GMAC 
financed or leased 177,000 new vehicles, up 24% from 143,000 the year before. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bethlehem Steel Corp. announced a $26-million second-quarter profit, saying 
increases in basic steel operations helped it recover from a $14-million loss a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit equals 14 cents a share and contrasts with a loss of 27 cents a 
share for the second quarter a year ago. Sales for the period were $1.23 
billion, up 10% from $1.12 billion in the year-ago period.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bethlehem, Pa.-based company said profit was hurt by the cost of 
modernizing its Burns Harbor plant and an increase in contributions to employee 
pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings for the second quarter reflect strong demand from the automotive, 
machinery and light-construction markets, the company said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 DuPont Co., the nation's biggest chemical company, reported record 
second-quarter earnings of $792 million, up 53% from the same period a year 
ago.

ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS POLICY OF HELPING FUND DEFENSE MERGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration defended a Pentagon policy Wednesday that uses 
taxpayer dollars to help defense contractors merge. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch told a House panel that the policy will 
save four to seven times what it costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the government is spending money to lay off workers under 
the year-old policy now under congressional scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the policy, contractors that merge with competitors may bill the 
government for some of their restructuring costs. These may include the costs 
of shutting down a plant, workers' severance pay and consolidation of 
production lines. Not covered are buyout costs, broker fees or "golden 
parachutes" for executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before the House Armed Services oversight and investigations 
subcommittee, Deutch said that if the government refuses to pay these costs, 
"we will pay dearly in the form of higher prices and reduced defense 
capability."

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; WHEN PLANS GO AWRY, KNOW YOUR 
RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most business travelers have had some form of corporate training, whether it's 
in sales strategies or management techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 What most have not had is any instruction in how to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the least understood aspects of business travel is the rights and 
recourse travelers have when things don't go as planned, said Chris McGinnis, 
director of Travel Skills Group, an Atlanta-based corporate training firm. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many business travelers do not know all of their rights when they 
are bumped from airline flights or that they have some recourse when they 
arrive at a hotel to find their reservations have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most business travelers have a feeling they're not getting what they're 
supposed to get, but they don't know what it is they're supposed to ask for," 
said McGinnis, who wrote the book "202 Tips Even the Best Business Traveler May 
Not Know" (Irwin Professional Publishing, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a rundown on what travelers should know when their plans go awry. 
Airlines 
</P>
<P>
 If you are involuntarily bumped from a flight, you have the right to financial 
compensation from the airline.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just take the free ticket that the airline offers," McGinnis 
said. But federal regulations stipulate that if you are bumped and the airline 
can't get you to your final destination within an hour of your originally 
scheduled arrival time, it is required to give you as much as $200 cash or the 
value of a one-way fare to that place, whichever is less. If the airline does 
not get you there within two hours, it must reimburse you up to $400, or the 
value of a round-trip fare, whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash is in addition to your original ticket, which the airline must still 
honor, said Chris Chiames, spokesman for the National Air Transport Assn., a 
Washington-based trade organization representing airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to qualify for the cash compensation, you must have arrived at the 
airport gate at a prescribed number of minutes before the departure time to 
claim your seat. If you arrive after that time and the flight is overbooked, 
you have essentially broken your agreement with the airline, which is no longer 
required to compensate you if you are bumped. Therefore, it is important for 
passengers to know how far ahead of departure they must check in, Chiames said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also keep in mind that even if you have checked in at the gate and have a 
boarding pass, you risk losing your seat (and therefore are not entitled to 
compensation if bumped) if you do not board when the flight crew calls your 
seat row number, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Airlines will sometimes offer a bumped passenger a voucher for a new ticket or 
a free ticket to a destination of his or her choice in lieu of cash. Business 
travelers may prefer to take the free ticket, but they should know that they 
have the option to choose cash, McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also note that if the airline offers a choice of a free round-trip ticket or a 
voucher to apply toward the ticket of your choice, the free ticket would not 
qualify for frequent-flier mileage but the ticket purchased with a voucher 
would, McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
 If your flight is delayed or canceled and it's the airline's fault, the 
airline is required to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 According to what's known as Rule 240 of the airlines' official rules, the 
airline is required to get you to your final destination within a certain time 
even if it means putting you on another airline. If you are concerned about 
making an appointment or connecting with another flight, you can ask the 
ticketing agent to "240" you on another flight. It will help to have a copy of 
the Official Airline Guide, available in bookstores and airport newsstands, 
with current flight schedules so you can look up other flights that will get 
you where you want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 When asserting your rights with the airline, it helps to be courteous, Chiames 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some passengers think that being belligerent is the way to get things done, 
but a kindhearted, sincere, patient request is going to go a lot further than 
pounding on the counter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the airline loses your luggage, you are entitled to reimbursement of up to 
$1,250 a bag. If the bag is not lost but does not get to you in time for an 
event you had planned to attend, the airline must reimburse you for the costs 
associated with having to buy or rent clothing, McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, if you have been inconvenienced because of an airline's actions, you can 
ask for some small favors such as meal vouchers, a toilet kit, a pass to the 
airline club or a free phone call to notify someone of changes in your travel 
plans. Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 With airlines, travelers' rights are guaranteed by regulations. It's different 
in the hotel industry, where "rights" are not backed by law but rather by 
industry convention, said Maura Nelson, spokeswoman for the American Hotel & 
Motel Assn. in Washington. For example, hotels, like airlines, routinely 
overbook on busy weekends because they count on a certain percentage of 
no-shows. If the hotel cannot honor your reservation, it will probably pay for 
transportation to a comparable room in another hotel and for your first night 
there. If the hotel doesn't offer to pay for the first night, ask for it, 
McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before asking for such compensation, though, make sure you have checked in by 
the time stipulated by the hotel, Nelson said. Most hotels will hold a 
reservation only until 6 p.m. unless it is guaranteed with a credit card, in 
which case you can check in anytime you choose. 
</P>
<P>
 When making a reservation, always get a reservation number and the name of the 
employee who made it for you as insurance against lost reservations, McGinnis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware that you don't have to accept the first room the hotel offers you. If 
it's not to your liking, ask to see something different. Rental Cars 
</P>
<P>
 Your "rights" here are also dictated by industry convention, not government 
regulation. The main thing to keep in mind is that the rental company is not 
supposed to downgrade you to a smaller or less expensive car if it doesn't have 
the model you reserved; you should get something equivalent or better, McGinnis 
said. Conversely, if you requested a smaller car and the company doesn't have 
one that size when you arrive, you can ask for an upgrade at the same price.  
</P>
<P>
 Another tip on renting: If you want to get the newest car on the lot, ask for 
the one with the lowest mileage. The rental agent should have that information 
available, McGinnis said. Many travelers use this strategy to make sure they 
get cars with the latest safety technology.

GLOBAL PIRACY BRINGS NEW BRAND OF SLEUTH; TRADE: INVESTIGATORS TELL OF FLEXIBLE 
METHODS USED TO TRACK INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY CRIME, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 6% OF 
WORLD'S VOLUME.

<P>
 Private investigators of the 1990s -- far removed from the traditional 
trench-coat-clad sleuths tracking marital indiscretions, have found a new line 
of business -- the fight against intellectual-property crime. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called intellectual-property enforcement is a response to the upsurge in 
brand counterfeiting, copyright piracy and illegal importing that market 
liberalization and cheaper manufacturing methods have made much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the various forms of intellectual-property (IP) crime are now 
estimated to make up 6% of all world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the latest wave of IP crime is not just about faking trendy T-shirts 
and sneakers. A potentially fatal trade in bogus pharmaceuticals, automotive 
and even aircraft components are where the real profits are often found. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, most of the world's legal authorities appear ill-equipped -- 
or unwilling -- to stamp it out. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where private investigators, with their more flexible methods, come 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigation firm MRH Partnership, whose services were used in some of the 
British takeover battles of the 1980s, is one of a handful of firms now working 
in intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 MRH partner Duncan Mee said his first IP enforcement case was a large European 
drug company which had found out that a hospital in the former Czechoslovakia 
was being supplied cheap versions of its best-selling post-operative drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Locating the Dutch trading company making the shipments was easy enough. But 
Mee's client wanted to know who was actually manufacturing the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dutch authorities showing no interest in the case, he set about 
tracking the source using a classic investigation technique -- checking each 
night's garbage from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport for shipment notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tenth day of searching, Mee and a colleague found a torn-up note 
indicating the same, peculiar storage conditions needed for the drug and the 
name of the Israeli company that had sent the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 That, it turned out, was what the client needed. Mee was not told what action 
was then pursued but believes that, as often is the case, the client was 
content with an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mee insists methods such as garbage-searching -- or "garbology" as some call 
it -- are carried out strictly within the laws of the country involved. "Our 
clients are mainly blue-chips. They wouldn't like it if we were caught doing 
something illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Other common methods for catching the IP criminal include "trap-buying" -- 
posing as a potential customer for bogus goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Infiltrating a company by becoming an employee can also work well, 
particularly in catching users of pirated computer software, one of the most 
frequent license abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when hard evidence of counterfeiting or patent abuse is unearthed, 
getting a meaningful prosecution for such crimes remains unusually difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts are still giving out pathetic sentences," says Paul Carratu, 
managing director of investigation firm Carratu International. 
</P>
<P>
 "Britain is one of the worst," he added. "Whether it's still an effect of 
(former Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher's free-market philosophy or not, I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Carratu, whose retired father Vincent is widely acknowledged to have been the 
forerunner in the field of IP enforcement during the 1970s, said another 
problem was lack of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these crimes span more than one country. The police simply haven't 
got the budget to chase them internationally." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the predominantly poor countries where much patent and 
copyright abuse originates shy away from enforcing thorough IP legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that they cannot afford the prices being charged for what is to 
them critical industrial equipment or health products made by Western 
multinationals.

 Ford Negotiating Loan With Japan: The auto maker is discussing a $300-million 
loan with the government-controlled Import-Export Bank of Japan to help it 
develop right-hand-drive vehicles for export there, according to the Japanese 
newspaper Nihon Keizai. The action signals Japan's eagerness to narrow its U.S. 
trade surplus and earn good will after resisting Clinton Administration calls 
to guarantee more imports of U.S. cars. The bank officially denied the report, 
but bank sources and a Ford official said they have discussed a loan with an 
interest rate of slightly above 4%.

BRIEFING BOOK / CAROL J. WILLIAMS: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; CROATIA'S 
SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY: OPPORTUNITIES FOR RISK TAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Inspired by the numerous natural harbors along the Adriatic coastline 
that stretches 400 miles past 1,000 islands, Yugoslavia built an impressive 
network of shipyards and marine repair facilities before the federation was 
destroyed by nationalism and war. 
</P>
<P>
 The now-independent Republic of Croatia has inherited most of the coast and 
the entire shipbuilding industry, and investors are pondering whether the 
former workhorses can be revived in the capitalist era as the country seeks to 
revamp a thoroughly shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a global shipbuilding slump, the looming menace of another war and 
Zagreb politicians' penchant for interference in business matters have combined 
to cast doubts on the likelihood of a rescue.  
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: After tourism, shipbuilding was the most important economic 
activity in Croatia during the Yugoslav era. It produced more than 30,000 jobs, 
5% of the gross domestic product and more than $800 million in exports at the 
mid-1980s peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide recession and the virtual standstill that gripped Croatian industry 
after its 1991 war with Serbian nationalist insurgents meant a drop in 
construction contracts. Banking disorder that resulted from the breakup of 
Yugoslavia have exacerbated the crisis, as potential buyers find it difficult 
to get the necessary loans and credits to finance their projects.  
</P>
<P>
 The shipbuilding crisis mirrors the general economic catastrophe in Croatia. 
The unemployment rate, at 20%, is among the highest in Europe. Military 
spending continues to drain national resources, and the program of privatizing 
state industries has been discredited by corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipyard jobs have been reduced by more than half, to about 15,000 today, and 
many of those positions are at risk unless the major yards lure foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Hyperinflation has been brought under control in less than a year by 
severely limiting the money supply, but most statistics indicate further 
contraction of the economy. Also, the 3-year-old standoff between the Croatian 
government and the Serb rebels, who hold about a third of the country, has been 
heating up, stirring fears that the government may push to recpature the lands. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats say they see little chance of Croatia's coastal industries 
being directly affected by the fighting, because the disputed territory lies 
inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater concern to most foreign analysts is the Croatian government's 
tarnished record on privatization. Independent economist Drazen Kalodjera 
estimates that less than 5% of industrial assets have been transferred to 
private hands since the undertaking began three years ago. Evaluations and 
bidding are controlled by senior members of the ruling Croatian Democratic 
Forum, and this often results in sweetheart deals for political backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have again today an amalgamation of state, ruling party and economy, just 
as we had four years ago," Kalodjera complained, comparing the present to the 
former Communist order. 
</P>
<P>
 A Zagreb-based diplomat agreed: "If I were a foreign investor, I would hate to 
have to go to the Croatian court system." 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: Croatia's shipyards are judged by industry analysts to be 
well-equipped with skilled workers who are more affordable since the crisis has 
depressed the average wage to $120 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 On a strictly economic basis, joint ventures with Croatian companies would 
appear to offer good long-term prospects for investors, Western economic 
attaches say. They cite a large backlog of orders at one Rijeka yard, hints 
from Iran and other Islamic oil-producing countries that they might bankroll 
major tanker projects if Croatia cooperates with Bosnian Muslims, and 
suggestions that the shipyards might be suitable for servicing U.S. naval 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, area conflicts increase risks. 
</P>
<P>
 And as one Western diplomat noted, the Croatian government's current 
willingness to revise laws and remove impediments to foreign investment should 
be viewed as a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're being very flexible now, and my guess is that the Croatian government 
would pave the way for foreign investment in shipbuilding sooner than any other 
industry," the diplomat said. "But politics can change priorities."

 EU Clears Subsidies for Air France, Olympic: The European Union has approved 
billions of dollars in subsidies for Air France and Greece's Olympic Airways 
for the next three years. The EU's executive commission will let France pump 
$3.7 billion into its money-losing carrier and approved Greek plans to inject 
$2.28 billion to help restructure state-owned Olympic.Even before the decision, 
Britain threatened to take the commission to court if it approved the 
subsidies. SAS, the Scandinavian airline, said it would keep an eye on Air 
France to ensure it does not use the subsidies to reduce fares and undercut 
competitors. The EU said the money is to be used only to make both airlines 
financially sound, and it put conditions on both deals.

 Mexico's Maquiladora Industry Grows: The industry, which is situated mostly on 
the U.S.-Mexico border and imports parts and components duty-free for export 
production, posted a value-added growth rate of 5.6% in the first four months 
of 1994, said the state-owned Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografia e 
Informatica. Inegi said Mexico had 2,059 maquiladora plants in April, up 0.8% 
from the same period a year ago. Inegi's value-added concept measures the 
combined effect of the industry's wages, worker benefits, expenses, profits and 
prices of raw materials and packaging.

CASHING IN WITH COLLECTIBLES TAKES EXPERTISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the inflation rate in this country has subsided over the past 10 years or 
so, a lot less attention has been paid to collectibles as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, there have been continued hot spots in markets for collectible 
items as diverse as fine art and sports cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But like real estate, gold and other assets that tend to do well when 
inflationary expectations run high, collectibles just aren't getting the kind 
of ink they were accorded in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent story, however, caught the eye of Mark Stumpp, chief investment 
officer at PDI Investment Strategies in Short Hills, N.J. It told of a card 
table, valued at 50 cents in 1821, that was put up for sale by an antiques 
auction house in 1991 for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale prompted Stumpp to do a little research on what sort of annual 
compounded return the table brought its owners -- and whether it worked out to 
be a better investment than paper securities like stocks and bonds would have 
been over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the card table increased at an annual rate of 8.9%, Stumpp 
figured -- making no allowance for the costs of storage, insurance or furniture 
polish. 
</P>
<P>
 If one had invested instead in commercial paper and stocks from 1821 through 
1991, Stumpp calculated that the annual return would have been 8.7%, not 
including commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the table was a good investment, but hardly a spectacular one," Stumpp 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stumpp also notes that the story suggests a prime rule for small investors in 
collectibles: To get an exemplary return, you need to buy something with 
uncertified value. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this instance, appraisers in 1821 goofed, valuing this particular card 
table as used furniture and not as high art," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a lesson many young sports fans have discovered on the card-show 
circuit in recent years. By the time a given collectible has become recognized 
as an investment medium and acquires an active dealer market, the easy-money 
days are very likely gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The presumption that something like a baseball card will continue to increase 
in value rests heavily on the "greater fool" theory -- that someone will come 
along tomorrow willing to pay even more than today's price. 
</P>
<P>
 In stocks, by contrast, you get an asset backed by a business that can grow 
and generate increasing dividends, Stumpp asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taken as a group, stocks will appreciate with inflation and economic growth 
even if everyone recognizes their intrinsic value," he says. "Therefore, 
although beneficial, it's unnecessary to uncover undervalued stocks in order to 
make money in the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
 One could debate some of Stumpp's points. History has shown that there is a 
very real risk, at least some of the time, of buying overvalued stocks, 
especially if you don't diversify your holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth may be as strong and persistent in the future as it has been 
in this country's past, but it isn't guaranteed to turn out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of that part of his argument, he puts collectibles in a 
useful perspective. By all means, people can enjoy collecting whatever 
interests them that fits reasonably into their budgets, whether it's stamps, 
old movie posters, vintage cars or, yes, even sports cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they are looking to make big money in collectibles, they can expect to 
need a lot of capital, tenacity and expertise -- or else an exceptional amount 
of luck.

TEMPORARY HIRING TREND SIGNALS NEW 'INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION'; EMPLOYMENT: EXPERTS 
SAY BUSINESS IS TURNING MORE TO PART-TIMERS BECAUSE OF SPECIALIZED SKILLS, COST 
SAVINGS AND WORK HABITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA GENASCI, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hiring temporary workers is part of the business strategy at Silicon Graphics. 
At any time, between 10 and 12% of the computer company's work force is 
employed on a short-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes good business sense," said Leilani Gayles, vice president of 
employee relations. "It allows us to be responsive, access people with specific 
skills and saves us money." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, it's estimated that employees who work part-time, on a temporary 
basis or as free-lancers or consultants, now make up about a quarter of the 
work force. And the fastest-growing category is that of temporary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing short of another industrial revolution going on out there in 
terms of how work is being structured and people are being paid," said David A. 
Hofrichter, managing director of The Hay Group, a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofrichter estimates that in the not-too-distant-future, three out of every 
seven workers hired will be on a short-term basis. A company's work force will 
consist of a small core of highly skilled permanent workers aided by temporary 
employees brought in during peak periods or for special projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies have found that hiring temporary workers saves them a lot of money. 
Temporary employees usually work without health care or pension benefits and 
save companies on payroll expenses and administrative costs as well as office 
and plant space. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is now an incentive for employers to hire temps and part-timers as a 
permanent solution," said Ellen Bravo, executive director of 9 to 5, National 
Assn. of Working Women. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "That's often at the expense of workers and their families." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of people taking short-term jobs do so because they have no choice -- 
they can't find full-time work, analysts say. And many find themselves having 
to take both night and daytime jobs to earn the salaries they need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best I can do at the moment," said a systems engineer who has worked 
a series of short-term assignments at IBM. She asked not to be named for fear 
of jeopardizing future employment with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The systems engineer was offered incentives by International Business Machines 
Corp. to quit her job of 13 years, then took a temporary assignment at the 
company after 10 months of unemployment. The job ended after a year, but she 
has since taken shorter assignments at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 But some workers do seek part-time or temporary jobs that give them more time 
to spend with family. At Uniforce Services, an employment agency, 30% of 
temporary employees aren't looking for a permanent job, said Rosemary 
Maniscalco, the company's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of temporary workers has grown with the pace of corporate 
restructurings, even expanding as the economy has recovered, said John 
Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an employment consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 With more people left unemployed by layoffs, more workers are available for 
short-term assignments. Increasingly, they include highly skilled and 
professional employees whose jobs were eliminated in restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, after companies have laid off permanent workers they have 
often turned to temporary employees to meet their needs during the ebb and flow 
of the work cycle and to reduce employment costs, Hofrichter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies want to have a work force that can flex with demand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM found the need for temporary workers after having eliminated 150,000 
permanent jobs since 1986. However, the company says it does not know how many 
of its former employees are working there on a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy changing rapidly, companies often aren't sure what their 
staffing needs will be and by contracting for shorter periods, they can hire 
workers to fill gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the circumstances of their employment, many temporary workers have 
qualities and work habits that companies want. For example, they can be more 
productive because they don't have the social relationships at the office that 
permanent employees enjoy, Maniscalco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are paid by the hour. There's no chatting around the water cooler, they 
don't spend time on personal calls," Maniscalco said. "They are only paid for 
the time they work, not for lunches or other breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary work can have some positive results for employees. Hiring someone 
for a specific period allows companies to take a look at a prospective 
full-timer. Recent college graduates are now frequently hired on a short-term 
basis, business consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies are skittish about taking on new full-time employees," Challenger 
said. "This is a way to select the cream of the crop." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in temporary hiring has also been a plus for employment agencies, 
whose business has grown to meet the demand for short-term employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers hired through temporary help firms make up 1.4% of employees, up from 
0.5% in 1983. Meanwhile, annual payroll for temporary agencies last year was 
$19.6 billion, up from $4 billion a decade ago, according to the National Assn. 
of Temporary Services, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Although maintaining a just-in-time labor force offers advantages to business, 
it isn't necessarily good for workers or for the economy, said David Chu, 
research director of the Service Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think companies have given adequate thought to the issue," Chu said. 
"There will be grave long-term consequences of working people into the economy 
in a more narrow sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Chu said companies risk ending up with a large portion of the labor force that 
makes less money and lacks basic benefits. If people have less money, they 
spend less and that hurts economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a problem for an economy built partly on consumer spending," Chu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of the temporary work force, Challenger said, has also helped 
weaken bonds between employer and employee. While employees in past decades 
started with a company they might reasonably expect to work with for their 
entire working life, now the average tenure is about seven years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means temporary workers may not have the loyalty to a firm that permanent 
employees have. And there may be friction between the short-term worker and the 
permanent staff -- often, in higher skilled professions, the contract workers 
who receive no benefits are paid higher hourly wages than their permanent 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger says the old structure of the workplace has changed completely in 
today's business world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have nostalgia for the past, but it doesn't exist anymore," he said. 
"There is new management and new people, a new set of rules and that's what the 
marketplace is about." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Dell Computer Corp., executives found after relying heavily on 
temporary workers that a permanent staff often made more sense, according to 
Kevin O'Conner, director of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Permanent employees, Dell found, had a higher commitment to the company, 
produced higher quality work and improved morale. The company is converting 
about 150 temporary jobs into permanent positions.

FINALLY HEARD; DEAF WOMAN IS PLEASED BY CITY PLEDGE TO IMPROVE HANDLING OF TDD 
EMERGENCY CALLS; HER COMPLAINT PROMPTED U.S. PRESSURE FOR ACTION

 "There was blood all over the place," Sheri Farinha Mutti said. "I'd never 
seen anything like it. I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Mutti is deaf. In her moment of terror, she sought help through the Los 
Angeles 911 system. When that system failed her, she took matters into her own 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Her complaint ultimately led to a settlement earlier this month between the 
Justice Department and the city, with the city agreeing to give telephone 
operators and police personnel special training on how to handle calls received 
over a communications system for the deaf.  
</P>
<P>
 Mutti, a longtime activist for the hearing-impaired, is proud but wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to finally have a victory, to know they're finally going to do 
something," she said, speaking to a reporter through a sign-language 
interpreter. "But I still wonder about that 911 system -- whether the police 
really will respond when someone in the deaf community needs them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mutti said her ordeal began on a warm July night in 1992, when she and her 2 
1/2-year-old son, Ryan, were getting ready for bed in their Sun Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan was jumping up and down on the bed, which is right under the window, 
when he suddenly veered forward and his head crashed down on the window sill," 
Mutti said. "There was a deep cut on his head, blood gushing out all over the 
bedspread." 
</P>
<P>
 As she had been instructed to do in the event of an emergency, Mutti dialed 
911, using the city's telecommunication device for the deaf, known as TDD. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashing light on her device told her the call had gone through. But 
instead of a message on her TDD screen asking her what she needed, the light 
stopped flashing, showing that the party on the other end had hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I redialed," Mutti said. "They hung up again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "By then, I'm totally freaking out," she said. "There was so much blood. I 
wanted someone to tell me what to do. I called back again. They hung up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Grabbing her son, the 34-year-old woman ran down three flights of stairs to 
the basement, where her husband, Steven, who also is deaf, was working on his 
computer. The three of them drove to a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 His head bandaged, Ryan recovered fully. But Mutti -- who has since moved to 
Sacramento to accept an executive position with the Northern California Center 
on Deafness -- did not forget the desperation of that night and her inability 
to reach the Los Angeles Police Department in her time of need. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote the Department of Justice in Washington, complaining that the city 
had failed to live up to the new federal Americans With Disabilities Act, which 
requires cities to ensure that their telephone emergency services provide 
access to individuals using TDDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was minding the store," she said. "I think it was ignorance, a lack of 
training. That's what infuriated me." 
</P>
<P>
 She said a beeping noise on the line alerts anyone answering a phone that the 
call is coming from a TDD machine. Operators at 911 centers see an address 
flash on their screens, showing the location from which the call is being made. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutti said she knows the call was received and her address appeared on a 
screen because, while the family was at the hospital, a patrol car stopped by 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did they know it wasn't a life-and-death emergency?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish, who is in charge of the department's communications 
systems, said records show that Mutti's calls came in about a minute apart, 
beginning at 9:33 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was one of the machines was malfunctioning," Kalish said a few 
days ago. "There definitely was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that although Mutti's address and phone number appeared on the screen, 
the call was never accepted by a TDD machine at the 911 center, and Mutti was 
unable to reach anyone. Kalish said that after getting busy signals when they 
attempted to return the calls, police drove to the Mutti home, arriving there 
at 9:50 p.m., about 15 minutes after her last call and about 10 minutes after 
she had left for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutti said the Justice Department asked for a letter requesting an 
investigation. That eventually led to this month's settlement, in which Los 
Angeles city officials pledged to improve the Police Department's TDD system.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the training for operators will involve the use of an instructional 
video prepared by Richard Ray, who is deaf and a coordinator for the city's 
Office for the Disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already had been looking at and evaluating the existing 911 system to 
enhance access," Ray said through an interpreter. "We were able to find (TDD) 
equipment that would be compatible with that system." " 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new equipment, which could be in place by Aug. 15 -- well before 
the Justice Department's target date in early September -- will automatically 
switch an incoming TDD call to a TDD machine at a 911 center, instead of 
requiring an operator to respond to an alerting beep signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the new equipment, we'll be able to take a (TDD) call at each answering 
point," Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mutti: "It's kind of a mixed feeling. I'm happy, and I'm optimistic. But 
there's still that feeling. Will I really be safe?"

TAXI DRIVERS BENEFIT FROM MTA STRIKE; LABOR: SOME PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY TAKE THE 
BUS ARE NOW CALLING A CAB TO GET TO WORK AND ELSEWHERE.

 Taxi driver Stephen Kloc wishes no ill will on bus riders, but he is in no 
hurry for the strike to end either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say business has increased maybe 60-70%," ex-Marine Kloc says as he pulls 
out of the Checker Cab yard at 7 a.m. Wednesday on his way to his first fare of 
the day. "All through the days, the calls come -- not just during the 
drive-time hours." 
</P>
<P>
 The clientele is by and large pleasant, too. Those displaced by the strike 
might not be big tippers -- after all, they're making a major adjustment from 
the $1.10 bus fare to the cab's $1.90 pickup fee plus 20 cents for each 
one-eighth of a mile or 40 seconds waiting time -- but Kloc figures that they 
aren't likely to pull a knife on him, as once happened in North Hills, or get 
sick in his cab, which has happened a few times with fares picked up at bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are nice people who woke up Monday morning and realized . . . they 
would have to find another way to get to work, or wherever," says Kloc, who has 
been driving a cab since January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can afford the fare are happy to see him arrive at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard I might have to wait an hour, but this wasn't bad at all," says 
David Felix, emerging from his apartment building in North Hollywood at 7:20 
a.m., his untied tie draped around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix asks Kloc to stop at a nearby liquor store so he can get a copy of The 
Times, and then to take him to Paramount Studios, where he works as an 
accountant. Normally, he catches a bus that travels over the hill to Hollywood 
at 6:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to drive, but I had this little problem with speeding tickets," he 
says as Kloc drives the cab -- actually a van that seats up to six -- onto the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up in Camarillo, where I have a house, over the weekend, so I didn't 
know anything about the strike," Felix says. "I went out to catch my bus as 
usual on Monday and I was out there an hour, wondering what was going on, when 
a policeman came on by in his patrol car and told me. It just blew me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Kloc pulls into the driveway under the ornate studio gates. The fare is 
$15.10. Felix hands him a $20 bill and asks for $4 back. But because Kloc has 
not yet gotten change that morning, he has to give him a $5 bill -- losing not 
only his tip, but an extra dime. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kloc shrugs it off as he heads back to the San Fernando Valley. "That 
happens," he says with a smile. It was certainly better than the few times 
passengers have bolted from his cab without paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Kloc receives no salary. In fact, he has to pay $650 a week to Checker, which 
owns and maintains the cab and sends him out on calls. Anything earned above 
that amount in fares and tips is his profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not bad work; the money is good," says Kloc, who began studying real 
estate at Valley College after his discharge from the Marines. When he found 
that he needed some extra money to pay bills, he started to drive a cab and 
liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being on vacation," says the affable Kloc, dressed in regulation 
white shirt, dark pants and tie, with the added personal touch of a red San 
Francisco 49ers cap. "I get paid for sightseeing." 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate market being what it is, Kloc stuck with the cab. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the second fare is in Van Nuys: Philip Hawkins, an architect, 
wants to go to the Amtrak station in Burbank, where he is to board a train for 
the start of a train and bus trip to Lake Tahoe. Hawkins is barely aware of the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 21 years in Los Angeles, I could probably count the number of times I've 
taken a city bus on one hand," Hawkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare is $4.50; Hawkins hands Kloc $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher has another fare for Kloc in nearby North Hollywood. Polo 
Maramba, 20, usually car-pools to his job as an accountant at Burbank-based 
Iwerks Entertainment, a company that makes special-format movie theaters and 
virtual-reality attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car-pool driver got in an accident and couldn't come today," Maramba 
says. Normally when he can't car-pool, Maramba takes the bus to Iwerks. But 
this day, he enjoys the relative luxury of the cab for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nice," he says, slumping down in the seat. "And this guy doesn't 
drive like a New York cab driver." 
</P>
<P>
 The fare is $7.30. Maramba hands over $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kloc is off to the next pickup radioed to him by the dispatcher. He never 
knows when one of these normal calls could end up as a chapter in local cabby 
lore, a thought that reminds him about the time he picked up a man in North 
Hollywood who simply said, "I'm going to Vegas." When Kloc asked the man if he 
was aware how much that would cost, the man tossed $500 on the front seat and 
off they went. By the time they reached Las Vegas, the meter read $440. But 
with a generous tip, plus money for gas and meals, Kloc got a total of $1,300 
for the one-way trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The call in North Hollywood turns out not to be in that league. Brandon Siler, 
19, emerges from an apartment building carrying a suitcase, garment bag and 
electronic keyboard. He is going to the Greyhound station in North Hollywood to 
catch a bus back to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 An aspiring rapper, Siler had been in town for a couple of weeks looking for 
work as a waiter, hopefully in Hollywood, near the music industry. But the bus 
strike interrupted his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't take the bus anymore, so I decided to go to my mother's for a 
while," Siler says. "I won't come back until I get a car." 
</P>
<P>
 His brief time in Los Angeles, trying to get around in spite of the strike, is 
not a total loss, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll get a song out of it," he says, getting out of the cab. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare is $3.90. There is no tip.

DISTRICT RELAXES SOME SUMMER SCHOOL POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With hundreds of students unable to attend summer school because of the bus 
strike, city school officials adopted a new policy Wednesday allowing students 
to make up class assignments and tests or to drop a course without getting a 
failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said in approving the change 
that students should not be penalized because of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, students who miss more than three days of summer school without 
valid excuses would get an "F" grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is considered an emergency," said Doris Dillard, the district's summer 
school coordinator. "It's not something the students, their parents or the 
district has control over. It's having a tremendous impact on the lives of the 
students and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 David Clinton can vouch for that. The 18-year-old Canoga Park resident -- who 
is taking English and biology courses at Monroe High School -- said the bus 
strike has left him stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, Clinton needs the courses to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried looking for rides as much as I could," Clinton said. "I even 
thought of borrowing a bike but I couldn't and it's too far. This is real 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who had been taking two buses to get to the North Hills campus, 
returned to Monroe on Wednesday after he persuaded his aunt to drive him. "I 
just wanted a ride one day to see what work I could make up," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he does not know when he will be able to return. "The longer the 
strike goes on, the less chance I'll be able to finish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials do not know the exact number of students who depend on MTA 
buses. But an informal district survey showed there are hundreds of students 
who cannot attend classes because of the strike, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said that in a single day about 200 students were absent 
from Fairfax High School, another 120 from Lincoln High and 50 pupils were 
missing from Van Nuys High because of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer school, which began July 5 and ends on Aug. 12, typically is attended 
by students taking remedial or enrichment courses. Many of the students need to 
earn the course credits for graduation. Under district policy, students can 
attend summer school at any campus, regardless of where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the program is just six weeks, officials said absences typically 
result in students being dropped from their courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year there have been so many disasters that have affected our children," 
Dillard said. "Earthquakes, fires . . . this is just another one of these 
things and it's not their fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel Lara, a 16-year-old Pacoima resident taking English at Monroe High, said 
he is concerned about losing the classwork he completed during the first three 
weeks of the program. "I brought my grade up from a fail to a 'C,' " Abel said. 
"Now I can't go and I won't get the credits." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel, who has been home since Monday, said he has no way of getting to the 
campus. His mother said the family has one car, and her husband -- who works 
nights -- does not get home until 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really has me upset," said Ruth Lara, Abel's mother. "It was his idea to 
go and make up a class he failed. Before you know it, graduation's going to 
come up and he won't be able to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel said he has enjoyed the ninth-grade English class, as well as the new 
students he has met at Monroe. "I miss going there," he said. "It was pretty 
fun. The teacher was nice -- if we had any problems, she helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Walker, the summer school assistant principal at Francis Polytechnic High 
in Sun Valley, said he is concerned that attendance could drop off more as the 
strike wears on. He said students who have managed to secure rides now might 
not be able to continue. "We're really concerned about it," Walker said. "We 
hope it gets resolved and soon."

BUS RIDERS GIVE METROLINK A TRY; TRANSIT: NEW PASSENGERS STRANDED BY STRIKE ARE 
ENAMORED WITH THE TRAINS. BUT FOR MANY, THE COMFORT IS A LUXURY THEY CAN HARDLY 
AFFORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Up and down Van Nuys Boulevard, the corners were knotted with people waiting 
for buses that never came, but aboard the quiet, almost antiseptic cars of 
Metrolink Line 104, the third day of a citywide bus strike passed Wednesday 
with hardly a mention. 
</P>
<P>
 To regular passengers -- with their crisp collars and Wall Street Journals, 
their knitting needles and Walkmans -- the bus strike meant simply a few new 
faces at the station, a few more people fumbling with the ticket machines. 
</P>
<P>
 But to dozens of stranded bus riders, a trip on the Downtown-bound Metrolink 
was a first glimpse at a transit system where the windows are not scratched by 
graffiti, the seats don't smell and the ride is not quite so bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rode the bus, but I am not going back," said John Stephens of Panorama City 
as he waited at the Van Nuys Metrolink station for the 7:23 a.m. train. "I am 
sick and tired of hitting every (bus) stop. Sometimes the air conditioner 
works, sometimes it doesn't. But this is slick. There are two stops between 
here and Downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens' employer pays for most of his bus pass and would put the same amount 
toward a train pass. The few extra dollars he would have to kick in might well 
be worth the cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for many of the regular bus riders, the comfort of a Metrolink ride is a 
luxury they can hardly afford. The round-trip ride between Van Nuys and 
Downtown, for instance, costs $8 -- compared to about $3 for the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it's wonderful, but the cost is prohibitive," said Jacqueline Spoonts of 
Panorama City, explaining that she will return to the buses when the strike is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials said ridership on the Ventura County-Los Angeles line has 
increased 20% since the bus strike began Monday. The Santa Clarita-Los Angeles 
line increased about 6%. Other lines from San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange 
County were not affected by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Metrolink will be able to maintain those gains after the strike 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographics of Metrolink ridership differ sharply from those of bus 
riders. Metrolink riders tend to be affluent suburban professionals while bus 
riders tend to be poorer workers, according to surveys conducted by the 
Southern California Regional Rail Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly all Metrolink riders, taking public transit is a choice. For most 
bus riders, it is a necessity. Metrolink riders praise the train's efficiency, 
but say they do not consider themselves dependent on transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those survey results were validated as Line 104 hurtled silently past the 
warehouses and factories north of Downtown, when several riders were asked what 
they would do if Metrolink locomotive engineers went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to drive in," said Steve Maggi, who lives in Oxnard and works in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I would just drive," said Melanie Polk, who also lives in Oxnard and 
works in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be miserable, but I guess I would drive," said Tim Trombly, who 
lives in Panorama City and works Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could call in sick," volunteered Stephens, the regular bus rider from 
Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Stephens and other bus riders, like Michael Taylor of South-Central 
Los Angeles, transit strikes are a real concern. "I've been stuck all week," 
said Taylor, riding a special train between Downtown and his job in Burbank, 
added during the strike. "It's been a problem, but you have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marta Rodriguez was trying to deal with it, but she kept shaking her head at 
the cost. "This is comfortable, but the price is too much," said Rodriguez, on 
her way to Van Nuys to visit a friend. "You would end up working just for train 
fare."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; DEAFNESS CENTER AT CSUN WINS GRANT 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education has awarded the National Center on Deafness 
at Cal State Northridge a $1-million grant to assist students who are deaf or 
hearing impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Center on Deafness is a component of CSUN's School of 
Communication, Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will cover instructional support services such as tutoring, 
note-taking and interpreting as well as enrichment classes and orientation for 
the 250 students at CSUN who are deaf and hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can breathe a little easier," said Nina Treiman, a counselor for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN was one of the first mainstream universities in the country to admit deaf 
and hard-of-hearing students, according to the center. In 1964, CSUN admitted 
two graduate students who were deaf. Today, CSUN has the largest enrollment of 
deaf and hearing-impaired students on a mainstream university campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has about 120 interpreters who assist students by taking notes, 
interpreting lectures and tutoring. In addition, the grant funds will augment 
the center's outreach program. As one of five such centers in the country, the 
CSUN-based program serves as a model for other universities in the Southwest 
that are trying to develop similar programs. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; PROGRAM HELPS SIGHT-IMPAIRED SENIOR CITIZENS

 "Anybody have to help you remember how to wash dishes?" memory and fitness 
expert Debbi Harper asked the 20 senior citizens attending the Braille 
Institute's weekly Senior Outreach program at the Reseda Valley Senior Service 
Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, but I wish they would," came the reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's laughter-filled presentation and a potluck lunch were all part of the 
institute's final meeting this summer. The free program, which is open to all 
sight-impaired senior citizens, offers arts and crafts, exercises and regular 
lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lectures are designed to increase independent living skills like mobility 
and the use of canes," said Lydia Matthews, Braille outreach activity 
coordinator. Senior citizens can also learn to use self-threading needles, 
Braille reading and other programs designed to help the sight-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arts and crafts we offer are not meant to keep people occupied, but 
rather to enhance awareness and physical dexterity," she added. Recently, 
Matthews said, one of the outreach classes learned how to stuff, sew and 
decorate pillows using a Japanese fish print technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who moved from teaching at fitness clubs to senior health issues two 
years ago, told those attending that memory impairment was not a sign of 
getting old. "It happens at all ages to all kinds of people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgetfulness, she says, can be overcome with organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember what Ben Franklin said?" she asked. "A place for everything and 
everything in its place." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said repetition, word association and verbalizing a task will help 
people remember things better. 
</P>
<P>
 "How we retrieve information has a lot to do with how we store it," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Reseda, the Braille Institute offers outreach programs in 
Burbank, Pasadena, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks. Sessions are scheduled to 
resume Sept. 7 at all centers. JIM CROGAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK, ENCINO; JEWELRY, CASH TAKEN IN 2 HOME ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two separate home robberies carried out Tuesday netted bandits more than 
$65,000 in cash and jewelry from homes in Canoga Park and Encino, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first robbery, three men and one woman burst into a home in the 7700 
block of DeSoto Avenue about 10:20 a.m. and threatened to kill the 41-year-old 
homeowner unless she opened a safe at the home, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Roland L'Heureux. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying semiautomatic weapons, the intruders terrorized the woman, her two 
children and an unidentified male who lives at the home, L'Heureux said. The 
woman, who sold jewelry from her home, was pistol-whipped and had a gun stuck 
inside her mouth before she opened the safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers took $12,000 from a recently cashed FEMA check, $30,000 in jewelry 
and escaped in the victim's gray 1990 Toyota Camry, L'Heureux said. All of the 
victims were tied up with either duct tape or phone cord, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the robbery was carried out by people who knew that the 
woman kept valuables at the home, L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second incident, a lone robber entered the grounds of a two-acre estate 
through an automatic gate that opened as the residents returned home, and 
confronted a woman as she stepped out of her car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery took place about 8:45 p.m. in the 5100 block of Louise Avenue when 
the 46-year-old woman and her 22-year-old daughter returned from a Van Nuys 
Boulevard restaurant, L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber trailed the car to the garage where he used bodily force to demand 
jewelry and money from the woman, L'Heureux said. He took cash and jewelry 
valued at $25,000, L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter locked herself in the vehicle during the robbery, L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been a crime of opportunity or a follow-home (robbery); we 
don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber was described as a black male, about 6 foot, 2 inches tall and 
weighing between 165 and 170 pounds. He wore a blue nylon jacket with a white 
stripe across the chest and dark pants during the robbery, L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects in either incident, L'Heureux said. CHIP JOHNSON

 In an effort to entice Valley employees back to the books, directors of the 
adult education program at Pierce College are mailing hundreds of flyers to 
local businesses and sponsoring orientation sessions at workplaces throughout 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-student Project for Adult College Education, PACE, which was 
established on the Pierce campus in 1986, offers working adults a chance to 
earn an associate in arts degree in five semesters of evening and weekend 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the program say the sluggish economy of the past few years has 
emphasized the need for workers to boost their education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, it was for career advancement that most people were coming," 
PACE Director Jeff Cooper said. "More and more they are coming for job 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which allows working adults to finish a degree program four times 
faster than through traditional night school classes, costs about $400 for a 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students who graduate from PACE go on to earn a bachelor's degree at a 
four-year college or university. For more information, call (818) 719-6455.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; SHOW GOES ON FOR QUAKE-HIT THEATER GROUP

<P>
 The last time tents were pitched in North Hollywood, the Northridge earthquake 
had rattled the laughter and tears out of many residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, a small group of actors is using a tent to uncover those feelings 
again in an impromptu playhouse pitched to replace a quake-ravaged theater 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are, sticking our stakes in the ground and saying, 'We're here for 
good,' " said Bob Caine, managing director of Actors Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of "Light Sensitive" last week, the theater group has been 
performing in a $13,000, green-and-white tent raised in an empty lot on 
Lankershim Boulevard, across the street from the El Portal Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which has a 30-year lease on the vintage theater, was expected to 
begin performing there in February, after finishing $250,000 worth of 
restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge earthquake changed the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's at least a million and a half dollars worth of repairs," Caine said. 
"The theater won't be reopened until June of next year." 
</P>
<P>
 While repairs are being executed, the actors wanted to find a way to stage 
shows. The first two performances scheduled for the El Portal were held at Los 
Angeles Valley College during the spring, but there were no plans for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Along came the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which offered the use of 
the land for the group. The tent, originally pitched during June's NoHo Arts 
Festival, was modified to house 99 audience members and a sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 And while staging a tent show may seem old-fashioned, most of the problems are 
modern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not cheap today," Caine confessed. "You don't just stick in a pole and 
get going. We've had costs we wouldn't have had if we were in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the start-up cost of the tent, production costs run about 
$2,000 per month. But sound problems are the worst, forcing the actors to 
switch to an amplified sound system, complete with body microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play has some very sensitive, subtle moments," said Carl Strano, 52, of 
Valley Village, one of the three actors in the play. "Outside the tent, there's 
traffic, police sirens, fire trucks, boom boxes, a bar down the street that 
gets rowdy and airplanes that come down so low the ground shakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those all tend to drown you out, and the body mikes keep you in balance." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no one has seemed to mind. Caine said the show, which is performed on 
Wednesdays through Sundays until Aug. 21, has been doing well, including 
sell-outs. And the Actors Alley Tent is slated to house two more plays through 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the group will have a new challenge: finding a new location or 
braving the wet weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Strano does not fear either. During his 30 years as a professional actor, he 
has played under far more hostile conditions than a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a nice place to perform," he said of the tent. "In Florida, 
the offshore breezes would blow your voice out to sea. Nobody would understand 
a word you were saying." JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WOMAN NAMED TO PANEL ON DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed an active member of 
a national advocacy organization, Little People of America, to serve on an 
advisory panel on disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Artran, 48, who lives in Simi Valley and works in a Chatsworth print 
shop she owns with her husband, will join the 17-member Commission on 
Disabilities, which advises the board on issues concerning people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to make people aware that a person with some type of disability 
has the same kinds of dreams and hopes as a person with no disability," Artran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Artran, who is a dwarf, has served on a similar advisory committee in Burbank. 
She is president of the Billy Barty Foundation, an organization founded by the 
actor Billy Barty to support education through scholarships and grants as well 
as promote research on dwarfism. 
</P>
<P>
 She has owned the printing business with her husband for 17 years, Artran 
said, but prior to that, she and her husband, who is also a dwarf, say they 
were denied jobs because of their size. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people with disabilities that, if given a chance, they can 
get out there and be useful," she said. "We need to change the environment 
because you can't change the person." Artran is a member of Little People of 
America, an advocacy organization founded in 1957 that has grown to 5,000 
members nationwide. According to the organization, there are about 200 types of 
dwarfism and an estimated 2.5 million dwarfs in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-member board-appointed panel was established in 1989. Its members, who 
have a variety of disabilities, meet once a month during their two-year tenure.

 The Los Angeles City Council moved Wednesday to eliminate spending 
restrictions on memorial plaques for police officers killed in the line of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, the city provides money only to mount the officer's badge 
on a plaque, which is given to the family at the officer's funeral.Fellow 
officers and family members must chip in to have the officer's gun, medals, 
pins, whistles and other personal items included on the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Councilman Joel Wachs responded to complaints from police 
officers by calling the law "an embarrassment to the city" and urging the 
council to revise it.  
</P>
<P>
 Without discussion, the council voted unanimously Wednesday to tentatively 
approve a new ordinance that would permit the city to pay to include the 
additional items on the plaque. Wachs has said the memorials would cost a 
maximum of $500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval is expected next month.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; BUS STOP ADS TO GET WORD OUT ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using bus stop bench ads, the Valley HIV/AIDS Clinic in Van Nuys next week 
will begin a Valleywide campaign to reach low-income neighborhoods with 
information about preventing and getting treatment for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 200 bench ads, in English and Spanish, will be put in northeast 
Valley areas such as Sylmar, Mission Hills, Panorama City and Pacoima, but will 
also go into Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Canoga Park and along Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 With the heading "Caring and Confidential," the bench ads will start Aug. 5, 
and run for at least three months along with a print campaign in gay and 
lesbian newspapers. Also on Aug. 5, the clinic will release of a 30-page 
booklet giving referrals to services for people with AIDS and HIV, prevention 
tips and a list of dentists who are willing to work with AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "HIV is taking over in the Valley every day," said Ana Vargas, client outreach 
coordinator at the clinic. "It's hitting hard in the Latino populations." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is geared toward reaching those low-income neighborhoods that do 
not have access to critical information about how HIV is spread. The exchange 
of bodily fluids through sex is one of the most common ways. The sharing of 
needles by intravenous drug users is another. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Vargas said that she has found that some Latino families -- 
especially first- and second-generation Mexican Americans -- do not realize 
that by sharing needles for other purposes, such as for vitamin or birth 
control injections, they were also putting themselves in the high-risk group to 
get AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are doing to try to stay healthy is actually much worse," Vargas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic also is trying to come up with the money to publish a 
Spanish-language version of the resource booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to reach the low-income communities is a natural goal for a group 
trying to fight AIDS, said Robert Berger of Healthier Solutions, the company 
hired by the clinic to run the media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traditionally considered an at-risk group," Berger said. "Those are the 
people in the health care system who fall through the cracks. Medical providers 
do outreach, but help only to those who have insurance or a means to pay." ED

<P>
 A Pacoima man was sentenced to 585 days in jail for his third drunk-driving 
conviction, Los Angeles city attorney officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Municipal Court Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt handed down the sentence 
to Vincente Jara, 39, on Monday.Jara was found guilty of drunk driving and 
driving with a suspended license after only 40 minutes of deliberation by 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completion of his sentence, Jara will also be placed on five years 
probation, during which he will attend 300 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and an 
18-month alcohol education program, according to Deputy City Atty. Victor 
Kalustian, who handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiatt also suspended Jara's driver license for three additional years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jara was arrested following a traffic accident May 8 at Paxton Street and 
Bradley Avenue in Pacoima. Tests revealed Jara had a blood-alcohol level of 
.20, well above California's legal limit of .08. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; HAYDEN PARTLY BACKS REDEVELOPMENT AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) has expressed tentative support for a 
proposal to create a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he can give his full blessings to the project, the legislator said, the 
community must be ensured a say over how the redevelopment money is spent. 
Hayden represents Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency suggested establishing 
a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks as a means of rebuilding quake-damaged 
structures, constructing new homes, and working on streets and sidewalks. 
Traditionally, a group of community representatives -- called a Project Area 
Committee -- advises the CRA on the execution, and sometimes development, of 
the revitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. could be the nucleus of a broad-based 
community coalition that could offer itself as a project area committee to the 
CRA, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The association has) leadership, expertise; they've worked on the Sherman 
Oaks Master Plan for some time and I would hope the CRA would recognize them as 
co-equals in the process along with the councilman, who is Zev Yaroslavsky," 
Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the revitalization project would come from the tax increment, or 
additional property tax generated by the plan's improvements to the area. 
Previously, it was thought that the earliest possible time that the money could 
become available was the fall of 1995, when the tax increment could begin to be 
used on a pay-as-you-go basis, or to back a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, for the first time, Hayden said a CRA board member told him that 
the agency could come up with the money sooner -- as early as December -- by 
borrowing money, possibly from a federal block grant for redevelopment and 
economic development activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even six months is too long to wait, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can borrow it, can't it be sooner rather than later?" he said. "Why 
can't that be today rather than December?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hayden, the CRA official, whom he declined to name, said the CRA 
does not have the capacity to issue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The politician said he wants to know how much money will be made available by 
the project, and whether expediting the funding mechanism would mean waiving an 
environmental study, which he believes is a normal part of the redevelopment 
project process. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he will speak about redevelopment and related issues at a Aug. 17 
meeting of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; BUYING A BRICK WILL HELP ARARAT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art Arutian has got bricks on his mind. About 4,500 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise funds for the Ararat Home of Los Angeles, the community center for 
the Armenian elderly that sustained more than $750,000 in quake damage, project 
director Arutian has devised a plan through which people can buy commemorative 
bricks in the home's Heritage Court for $100 each. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,500 bricks -- each of which will be imprinted with a personal message 
from the purchaser -- will make up a 1,000-square-foot court walk around a 
granite slab in the shape of Asia Minor, homeland to many of the 300,000 
Armenians in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea came to me about 10 years ago," said Arutian. "But the earthquake 
did it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Arutian himself is buying nine bricks, each dedicated to a member of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if this works, I'm going to start tearing up some more sidewalks," 
Arutian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ararat Home, one of three such facilities for Armenian American seniors in 
Los Angeles, provides board and care for 130 people, a 99-bed convalescent 
hospital, an interdenominational chapel and a museum. MAKI BECKER

TRASH HAULED TO RECYCLERS SENDS POLLUTION TO VALLEY AIR; ENVIRONMENT: CONCERN 
IS RAISED OVER ADDED SMOG AS RECYCLABLES CONTINUE TO BE TRUCKED IN WEEKLY FROM 
THE WESTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when residents of West Los Angeles had reason to feel virtuous about 
recycling, a San Fernando Valley councilwoman comes up with this complaint: 
</P>
<P>
 Saving Westside landfill space is having a lousy effect on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because 20 truckloads a week of the Westside's old cottage cheese 
containers, wine bottles and newspapers are being hauled all the way to the 
Valley and Downtown to be sorted, a rate that may eventually reach 150 
truckloads a week with the upcoming expansion of the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 All those truck trips generate a lot of exhaust emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we're doing wonderful things to reduce the waste stream, I'm concerned 
we're messing up the air," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose Valley district 
includes a recycling center in Reseda near the intersection of Oxnard Street 
and Reseda Boulevard, where about a third of the stuff is hauled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite five years of effort, the city government has failed to find a site 
for a recycling center in pricey West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people on the Westside want it to remain either residential or 
commercial," said Gyl Elliott, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Bureau of 
Sanitation. "Land is very valuable there, and almost none of it is zoned for 
manufacturing," the classification a recycling center needs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Wednesday that they hope to close a deal next month for a 
site in an industrial area of Palms near the corner of Robertson and Venice 
boulevards. Under the deal, a private contractor, Best Way Recycling, which 
runs the Reseda and Downtown centers, would develop the site by early next year 
and buy the city's recyclables for about $14 a ton to resell at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes the Westside, said 
several other proposals have failed because of opposition from business owners 
and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the (Palms) site in my district? No? Hallelujah," Galanter said. "I feel 
like I've dealt with this one too many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials will report back next month on the progress of the deal 
to the city's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25,000 homes on the Westside now participate in the recycling program. 
Beginning Sept. 6, about 4,000 homes will be added to the program each week, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' 5-year-old recycling plan calls for each of the city's five 
sanitation districts to contain at least one Materials Recovery Facility, or 
MRF, where recyclables are sorted, and a transfer station, where garbage and 
yard trimmings are collected before being hauled in larger trucks to a 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has achieved its goals in all but the Westside district, where the 
lack of both facilities has forced trucks to crisscross the smoggy Los Angeles 
Basin, at a cost to the city of at least $1 million in extra garbage collection 
expenses, said Drew Sones, assistant director of the Bureau of Sanitation.  
</P>
<P>
 Chick and Galanter, who sit on the waste management committee, urged the Los 
Angeles International Airport to allow the city to buy or use a 4.5-acre 
parking lot there for a transfer station. The city owns the airport, which is 
managed by an independent commission. Galanter said if they played host to the 
transfer station, the airport or airlines may be able to get tax credits or 
other benefits for helping to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 But airport officials have given many reasons for refusing to negotiate with 
the city to date, ranging from the aircraft-endangering birds that might be 
attracted by such a facility to a Federal Aviation Administration rule against 
using land for non-aviation purposes at airports that receive federal funds.

QUAKE VICTIMS, INSURANCE CARRIERS MEET HEAD-ON AT HEARING; AFTERMATH: MORE THAN 
300 TURN OUT FOR OFTEN HEATED TOWN HALL MEETING. DISGRUNTLED VICTIMS OF TEMBLOR 
AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVERAL COMPANIES STATE THEIR CASES. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a showdown between quake-weary homeowners and the insurance companies 
they are still battling six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people turned out for the confrontation Wednesday night, filling 
an auditorium at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys for a hearing presided over 
by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate insurance 
committee and the Democratic nominee for insurance commissioner in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides disgruntled victims of the Northridge quake, the speakers included 
representatives of State Farm, the state's largest carrier with 20% of the 
homeowners market, and No. 3 Farmers Insurance Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Nettie Hoge, head of consumer services for the California Department of 
Insurance, also participated in the often heated town hall meeting that Torres 
conducted as an official hearing of the insurance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge told the crowd that state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi had 
persuaded Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co. to restore homeowners 
coverage to about 14 of its customers whose policies the company recently 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century received so many quake claims that the state insurance department 
granted the company special permission to get out of the homeowners coverage 
business. One of the conditions, however, was that the company offer its 
customers two more annual renewals. Some of its policyholders have complained 
recently that the company was seizing on technical excuses to refuse 
immediately to renew their policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in the audience brandished signs such as "Boycott 20th Century" 
and "20th Century, What Did You Do With Our Premiums?" 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said 20th Century was invited to send a speaker to the meeting, but 
declined. However, when Torres asked if anyone from 20th Century was in the 
audience, two people raised their hands. Rick Dinon, a senior vice president, 
said the executives were there because they hoped to "correct some 
misinterpretations of the company's actions, motives and finances." 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," Dinon said of the homemade signs criticizing the company. "We hope 
we have the respect of our customers and we most assuredly respect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts a lot to be placed in an adversarial relationship with our 
customers. It is disappointing we can't continue to offer them the kind of 
protection we have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 When an earthquake hits, "much of the suffering is from the reprehensible 
conduct of the insurance industry adjusting the earthquake loss," said George 
Kehrer, executive director of Community Assistance Recovery, or CARE, a 
Northridge-based consumer group he said represents more than 5,000 property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adjusters swarm into the state like killer bees," Kehrer said, drawing a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres told the group that many of the complaints he has received have come 
from people who fear their company will abandon them. But he noted that 
Garamendi is proposing a statewide insurance industry pool as well as 
supporting proposals for national disaster insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to be patient," he said. "People in northern California are still 
dealing with insurance companies from the Loma Prieta quake" in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gausewitz, of Farmer's Insurance, said his company had resolved 27,241 
quake-related claims, about 90% of those it had received. Of those, 7,877 were 
dismissed without payment and the others received compensation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres asked Gausewitz if Farmers had received complaints that it refused to 
pay the true cost of earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that I know of," Gausewitz replied, drawing hoots and jeers from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge said the insurance department has received complaints of low payments by 
virtually all insurance companies hit by Northridge quake claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, whose committee is wrestling with many quake-caused problems, 
including a growing homeowners coverage crisis, said he arranged the meeting to 
give angry quake victims a chance to air their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 Disillusioned policyholders have inundated his Los Angeles and Sacramento 
offices with complaints, he said, ranging from switching adjusters in the 
middle of the claims process to "low-ball" offers to settle to delays receiving 
payoff checks. Some accused their insurance carriers of breaking promises or 
lying to avoid paying claims.

SHIFT OF FUNDS FOR SCHOOL QUAKE REPAIRS OKD; EDUCATION: STATE BOARD BACKS 
SPENDING $30 MILLION EARMARKED FOR ACADEMIES. OFFICIALS SAY RECOVERY WORK IS 
MORE IMPORTANT. 
</P>

<P>
 A state panel Wednesday approved shifting $30 million earmarked for a new Los 
Angeles high school program to pay for earthquake repairs, delaying for at 
least one year the creation of special high school academies. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval to use the state funds came the same day as release of a school 
district report that found major communications problems at district schools in 
the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board, in a meeting Wednesday, granted a Los Angeles 
Unified School District request to use the $30 million for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 State Finance Department officials had recommended that the state bond money 
be used for earthquake claims rather than new programs, said Wales Woodard, 
deputy director of the Office of Local Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had planned to set up five new schools for students interested in 
careers in medicine, science, business and entertainment. The so-called Career 
Development Partnership Academy Project -- which was to have campuses in Van 
Nuys, Hollywood, Downtown, Compton and Southeast Los Angeles -- was designed as 
a partnership among the city, state and private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to create the new schools could be reimbursed with the passage of a 
school construction bond on the November ballot, officials said. But the 
district might not receive all the money needed to create the five campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials said earthquake repairs are more important. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said release of the state money would also spur the federal 
government into funding its share of the repairs, which are estimated to cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars. The state is obligated to pay a portion of the 
earthquake repair bill that is being handed over to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-page earthquake response report, prepared at the request of Board of 
Education President Mark Slavkin in February, contained few surprises and 
underscored the need for updated equipment and an improved emergency plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of an emergency operations center -- equipped with a 
gasoline-powered generator -- that has ample space for employees, telephone 
lines and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase of five radio frequencies to ensure that workers can contact all 
district sites when telephones are not working. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improvement of emergency training, including annual refresher courses, for 
administrators and other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring that furniture, such as bookcases, be bolted to the walls to 
minimize injuries and damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board is expected to formally receive the report at a special 
meeting next month. Slavkin declined to comment until he could review the 
report with district Supt. Sid Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Helen Fallon, who chairs the 10th District Parent Teacher Student Assn.'s 
earthquake preparedness committee, blasted the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't answer the question: If you had an earthquake during school, how 
are you going to ensure the students' safety?" she said. "For having waited 
this long, I was rather disappointed. This is it?"

AIRPORT'S NEIGHBORS BLAST EXPANSION PLAN; TRANSPORTATION: CRITICISM IS LEVELED 
AT ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY DEALING WITH NEW TERMINAL AT BURBANK FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Burbank Airport's neighbors expressed skepticism Wednesday night of a recent 
environmental study concluding that expansion of the airport's terminal will 
not adversely affect them. 
</P>
<P>
 During a sometimes-contentious public hearing at the Burbank Airport Hilton, 
about 100 people from Burbank, North Hollywood, Studio City, Sun Valley and Van 
Nuys voiced angry opposition to plans to build a terminal more than four times 
larger than the present one. 
</P>
<P>
 Many complained that aircraft noise rattles their windows, triggers car 
alarms, makes telephone conversations difficult to hear and disrupts lessons at 
nearby elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some homeowners said their property values have dropped. Others 
said they worry about hearing loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Karam, president of the Toluca Terrace-Woods Homeowners Assn. in North 
Hollywood, compared airport officials to Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are currently observing a corporate psychopath in motion," she said. "The 
airport (officials are) acting as if the issues at hand are not significant." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority, which oversees the airport 
for the three cities that own it, was ordered last year to update a March, 
1993, environmental impact report on the proposed project, in response to a 
lawsuit by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials, acting on behalf of Los Angeles residents who live 
near the airport, charged the Airport Authority with failing to properly study 
the potential for increased noise, traffic and air pollution that a new 
terminal might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge agreed and required airport officials to address those 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials released an updated report last month that stood by the 
first report's primary conclusion: The number of passengers using the airport 
will be the same with or without a new terminal. Thus, any increase in aircraft 
traffic will occur regardless of whether the terminal is expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain people want to say that a new terminal induces growth. Our position 
is the market determines growth," said Victor Gill, an airport spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport executives say they must move the present 163,344-square-foot terminal 
away from the runways, under an order from the Federal Aviation Administration 
to meet current safety regulations, which were not in effect when the airport 
was built more than 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some $200 million or more is expected to be spent on a new building on about 
140 acres of Lockheed property near the present terminal. The new terminal will 
probably be completed in two stages by the year 2010, airport officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely disappointed in the document that the airport has produced," 
said Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker, who worked on the lawsuit 
against the Airport Authority. "They've still not gotten the picture. . . . No 
one builds a project that they don't anticipate growth for."

TAPE OF CONFESSION TO POLICE PLAYED FOR JURY IN VAN BUREN CASE; COURTS: FORMER 
NEWBURY PARK HIGH FOOTBALL PLAYER ADMITTED THAT HE FIRED GUNSHOT INTO HIS 
GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE. HE HAS SINCE CHANGED HIS STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In tapes played to a Ventura County jury Wednesday, former Newbury Park 
football star Leodes Van Buren admitted to investigators that he fired a 
gunshot into his girlfriend's house April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not denying it. I'm trying to prove a point. I want to be with this 
girl," Van Buren, 19, told a detective a few hours after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Van Buren has changed his story. He says that a companion, whom he 
cannot name for fear of retribution, actually fired the bullet through a glass 
door of the home of then-girlfriend Marcie James and her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which began Tuesday, is expected to go to the jury this morning 
following closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, the state's all-time leading high school pass receiver, is charged 
with shooting into an occupied dwelling -- a felony that carries a maximum 
sentence of seven years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors wrapped up their case Wednesday by playing two audio tapes of Van 
Buren confessing to the crime, first to a 911 emergency operator and then to a 
Sheriff's Department detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James Grunert also played a tape of James, who has since 
married Van Buren, saying that the couple concocted the story about Van Buren's 
companion. James, 20, also has recanted her original statement that Van Buren 
did the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren's attorney, John B. Miller, made a brief opening statement 
Wednesday, but did not call any defense witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Miller said James' testimony should be enough to exonerate his 
client. "I believe the jury will believe Marcie James' testimony," the lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Grunert's first witness was Jan Daly, the sheriff's 911 dispatcher whom Van 
Buren called minutes after the shooting. In a tape recording of that 
conversation, Van Buren confided that his problems with James arose after she 
learned of an affair he was having with a Westlake High School student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I was wrong because I have another girlfriend," Van Buren told Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 He also blamed his difficulties with James on her parents, whom he said have 
disapproved of their relationship since James gave birth to their daughter two 
years ago. Furthermore, Van Buren said the stress of the relationship had 
caused him to miss several weeks of school prior to the April shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the tape, he also bragged about being able to escape punishment for 
shooting into the James family house, saying at one point, "I'm smart." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a little bit about the law," he said. "I know that if you don't touch 
the bullet, your fingerprints won't be on the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the possible loss of a football scholarship to the University of 
Colorado because of the incident and his rocky relationship with James, Van 
Buren told the dispatcher: "We need help." 
</P>
<P>
 After being taken to the East Valley Sheriff's Station, Van Buren repeated 
much of his confession to Detective Ernest Montagna, admitting he fired the 
bullet from a black .380 pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went over and did what I was going to do," he told the detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what was that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoot her door." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Montagna asked Van Buren how many rounds he fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just one," he answered. "I didn't want to hurt anyone because, when you have 
a gun, it's kind of hard to stop you." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren said he did not mind spending a year or two behind bars. His mother 
and several other family members had survived jail time, he said. He also said 
that he was under so much pressure that he thought about suicide "all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't you realize when you shot that gun that the bullet could've 
ricocheted?" Montagna asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently surprised, Van Buren said, "It could've?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It could've bounced off and hit yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it would've hit myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Montagna acknowledged that he never ordered Van Buren 
to be tested for powder burns to determine whether he actually fired the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Van Buren told me he did it," the detective said. "I didn't think there 
was a reason I had to" have him tested.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 4 SUFFER MINOR INJURIES IN JAIL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four inmates are recovering from minor injuries received in a fight involving 
35 to 40 African-American and Latino prisoners at the Pitchess jail earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-minute brawl occurred at about 7 p.m. Monday at the Peter J. Pitchess 
Honor Rancho's North County Correctional Facility, according to Sheriff's 
Deputy Benita Hinojos.It broke out during an argument between inmates of the 
two groups but the exact cause was unknown, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years there have been frequent fights, sometimes several a week, 
between African-American and Latino inmates at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were able to break up the fight by yelling at the participants and 
confiscated three broken broom handles. Two inmates were treated for minor stab 
wounds and two for minor cuts and bruises.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY OKS BUDGET, DROPS DEPUTIES FROM KEY 
ANTI-CRIME PROGRAMS; FINANCES: THE PALMDALE COUNCIL DECIDES TO CUT COSTS BY 
USING CIVILIANS TO TEACH DRUG EDUCATION AND TO OVERSEE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost a month into the new fiscal year, the Palmdale City Council adopted its 
1994-95 budget after voting to replace sheriff's deputies with civilians in key 
anti-crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote, at Tuesday night's meeting, ended weeks of debate concerning the 
merits of using sheriff's deputies to teach children about drug abuse and to 
oversee crime prevention programs such as Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of council members decided that the cost -- about $100,000 a year 
for each deputy -- was too high and that civilians could do the same work for a 
lot less. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking for is a way to retain the programs in some form within 
the budget constraints," Councilman Jim Root said. 
</P>
<P>
 After deciding how to fund these and three other public safety programs, the 
council approved the remainder of its 1994-95 budget, which calls for $28.7 
million in General Fund spending. The fiscal year began July 1, but the council 
voted to continue spending at last year's level while debating how to balance 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the council boosted public safety funding by $1.2 million, including 
the addition of three one-deputy patrol cars and 16 more hours of patrol by a 
deputy in a fourth car. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council wrestled for several weeks over how to pay for other 
crime-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials urged the city to retain the 
current SANE (Substance Abuse Narcotics Education) program, in which two 
full-time deputies and one half-time deputy teach more than 6,100 local 
children in grades four through six. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale city staff members, however, said that civilian instructors, 
including retired officers, could teach a similar program costing far less 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Myers said he had to decide whether to pay for deputies in 
classrooms or in patrol cars. "We don't have the money to do both, so I'm 
saying: Put that deputy on the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Robert W. Toone Jr. said the Sheriff's Department requested 
$263,000 for the SANE program. The proposed city-operated program, he said, 
would cost $99,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, Root, Councilman Joe Davies and Mayor Jim Ledford voted to switch to 
drug education by civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 They also voted to use civilians instead of a deputy to oversee Neighborhood 
Watch, Business Watch and other programs. Using civilians dropped the annual 
cost from $104,000 to $65,000, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Terence Judge, a sheriff's deputy, cast the lone vote against using 
civilians. He argued that deputies are better role models and more qualified to 
run these programs. He also protested that the city did not look hard enough 
for other funds to keep deputies in the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was legal for Judge to vote on funding for his employer because the county 
is a nonprofit entity and because Judge does not work in the programs affected 
by the votes, City Atty. Angil P. Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending a third disagreement over sheriff's services, the council unanimously 
voted to pay $25,000 for a deputy to spend two hours a day supervising the 
VOICE program, in which civilian volunteers with cellular phones patrol the 
city and report illegal activity to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Tony Welch, commander of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station, said he 
would halt the VOICE program in Palmdale if the council did not provide the 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate 3-2 vote, the council cut its allocation to the United Community 
Action Network, UCAN, a counseling program for troubled teen-agers and their 
parents. The city has been giving $50,000 annually to UCAN, but Toone urged the 
council to cut the allocation this year to $5,000, a sum that is close to the 
$3,500 given by neighboring Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers and Judge recommended that UCAN receive $20,000, but the other three 
members supported the $5,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The council resolved a final disagreement by voting unanimously to split the 
$234,000 annual cost of school crossing guards with the Palmdale School 
District. Initially, Toone proposed that the city, which is no longer required 
to pay for crossing guards, hand the entire expense to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a separate agreement, the school district also will allow city 
recreation programs to use district gyms and sports fields at a value 
equivalent to $60,000 annually.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2,000 GALLONS OF GAS SPILL AFTER TRUCK 
OVERTURNS, SNARLING TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tanker truck overturned on the northbound Antelope Valley Freeway near Acton 
on Wednesday, spilling about 2,000 gallons of gasoline, a California Highway 
Patrol officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9:10 a.m. accident occurred north of Escondido Canyon Road and closed two 
of the freeway's three northbound lanes for about seven hours while Los Angeles 
County hazardous materials crews cleaned up the spill, CHP Officer Chuck Curtis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pumping the remaining gas out of the truck before they move (it)," 
Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-axle tanker truck, carrying 9,000 gallons of gas, struck an 
abandoned car and swerved off the freeway and overturned, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Clinzell Washington, 57, of La Puente, suffered minor injuries. He 
is an employee of Evans Dedicated Systems of Los Angeles, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was backed up for about three miles as the evening rush hour 
approached, CHP officers said.

HIGH-ALTITUDE HIGHWAY; FROM APPAREL TO ANIMALS, BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF AIR CARGO 
MOVES THROUGH LAX EACH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 David Hasenauer is in a hurry. He has to get to Los Angeles International 
Airport to meet a flying horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually Hasenauer is meeting five flying horses, all of them inbound to LAX 
from Auckland, New Zealand, aboard an Emery Worldwide Airlines DC-8 cargo 
plane. Their owners have paid something in the neighborhood of $5,000 each to 
have them shipped to the United States by air, instead of saving money by 
putting them on a ship for a two-week transpacific voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Hasenauer's job to pick them up at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hasenauer, president of an animal air-shipping company called Jet Pets 
Inc., hops in his pickup truck and heads for a dilapidated former Nike missile 
site in a remote corner of LAX. The DC-8 lands and then taxis onto the apron, 
and with Hasenauer carefully eyeing the cargo, handlers start unloading -- 
first some pallets piled high with bulk cargo and then the horses, which are in 
large open-topped wooden shipping boxes, three in one box, two in the other. 
They're accompanied by a New Zealander groom, Bernie Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett says the horses did just fine. Top shape. No problems. They didn't 
even get airsick, although he admits it's a little hard to tell if a horse is 
airsick, considering that horses can't throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handle about 700 or 800 horses a year," Hasenauer said. "A lot of horses 
get sent to Japan or Australia for races or shows. They're flying all the time. 
Some of them have more flying miles behind them than most people do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands more horses pass through LAX on domestic flights every 
year. So do sheep, goats, fish, cattle, parrots, chickens -- well, just about 
everything that walks, crawls or flies. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the living, breathing part of the LAX air cargo world. 
Although most people think of LAX as a place that moves people, it also moves 
an astonishing array and volume of freight -- about 2.8 billion pounds of cargo 
every year -- everything from horses to textiles and soup to nuts, a little 
more than half of it packed in the bellies of commercial airliners along with 
your luggage, the rest in cargo aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX is now the busiest air cargo center in the nation. Every day about 7 
million pounds of air cargo goes through LAX on 1,000 arriving and departing 
cargo and cargo-and-passenger flights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of like a flying warehouse in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. Department of Commerce figures on international imports and 
exports -- which account for just under half of all LAX air cargo -- the 
largest imported commodity coming through LAX was apparel, with 47,000 tons 
arriving in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. The biggest 
export from LAX was 33,000 tons of vegetables, fruits and nuts. In that same 
year, 18,000 tons of computer equipment and parts worth about $2.4 billion were 
exported through LAX, and 24,000 tons of computer equipment worth about $3.3 
billion were imported. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were 7,000 tons of taps, valves, bearings and gaskets imported and 
exported, along with 6,000 tons of live animals and meat, 550 tons of feathers, 
artificial flowers and wigs; 16,000 tons of fish and crustaceans; 1,400 tons of 
musical instruments; 1,100 tons of arms and munitions; 1,700 tons of beverages, 
spirits and vinegar; 2,600 tons of jewelry and coins; 208 tons of animal and 
vegetable fats and oils. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 There were even 57 tons of a category the Commerce Department describes, 
somewhat curiously, as "umbrellas, walking sticks and whips." 
</P>
<P>
 About 43% of LAX air cargo exports go to Asian countries, with Europe and 
Australia/Oceania following at 35% and 11%, respectively. About 70% of LAX 
imports come from Asia and about 17% from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also about 175,000 tons of mail, domestic and international, moves through LAX 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that's valuable and can fit in a plane, alive or dead, moving or not 
moving, comes through here," said Rick Wells, assistant chief of airport 
planning for the Los Angeles Department of Airports.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the air cargo is illicit. In May, U.S. Customs agents discovered a 
ton of Colombian cocaine hidden in a shipment of flexible rubber tubing inbound 
from Mexico aboard a chartered cargo plane. So far this year, customs agents 
have made four seizures of drug shipments hidden in air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 All imported cargo passing through LAX is subject to U.S. Customs inspection. 
But with so much cargo moving through, officials can only inspect a portion of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a daunting task," spokesman Michael Fleming said. "We have limited 
resources on what we can examine. The vast majority of cargo is legitimate, and 
we don't want to impede legitimate cargo, which could cause economic impacts. 
So we work selectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Air cargo is an important if little known -- to the public at least -- aspect 
of airport operations, Wells said. It doesn't have the glamour of passenger 
operations, and thus it traditionally hasn't gotten as much attention from 
airport officials as the passenger side of the flying business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as LAX air cargo tonnage has increased by about 50% in the last decade, 
LAX cargo facilities have expanded to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway Freight Services Inc., a contract cargo handler for 22 airlines that 
operate in and out of LAX, recently expanded its facilities. Federal Express, 
Japan Airlines and Qantas also plan to expand cargo handling facilities at LAX. 
Currently about 1.6 million square feet of air cargo terminal space is 
available at LAX, about two-thirds of it used for international import-export. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 people in Los Angeles are directly employed in air cargo-related 
jobs with airline and freight companies. That represents about 10% of the total 
number of people who work at LAX. Airport officials estimate the "economic 
impact" of LAX air freight in the Los Angeles region at about $11 billion per 
year, or about $9,000 for every ton of air cargo that passes through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single day it's something different," said Mark Wood, Gateway terminal 
manager. "We've had cars, reptiles from Africa, birds. Once we had a bear that 
was going to the Los Angeles Zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Human bodies -- dead human bodies -- also constitute part of LAX air cargo. 
Exact figures aren't available, but airport spokesmen and air shippers say that 
every year hundreds of human corpses pass through LAX, in coffins inside 
shipping boxes marked "human remains," bound for burial in other states and 
countries. They are handled like any other piece of air cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending goods by air freight isn't cheap, compared to sea or truck or rail 
shipping. Prices vary widely, depending on the weight and bulk of the shipment, 
but generally air freight costs three to 10 times more than shipping by sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Some items, such as sea urchins bound from California to the sushi restaurants 
of Japan, or prepared fugu fish from Japan bound for the Japanese restaurants 
of California, have to get from Point A to Point B fast or they'll spoil. At 
other times, market conditions, not perishability, make the difference.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT CALLED INNOCENT; MURDER: 
ATTORNEY BELIEVES THAT BLOODSTAIN ON CLOTHING OF VICTIM, ALSO A TAE KWON DO 
EXPERT, WILL EXONERATE HIS CLIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for a martial arts instructor accused of killing and sexually 
assaulting a co-worker as she walked home along a dark Santa Clarita road said 
Wednesday that he will prove during the trial that someone else committed the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Darryl Mounger said that he will rely on a scientific analysis of a 
small bloodstain found on the victim's clothing to prove Stuart Edward Milburn, 
27, did not kill Veronica Estrada, 29. Mounger said he believes the assailant 
was injured in a struggle with Estrada and bled on her workout pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that it's not Milburn's . . . it is probably the 
killer's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in Milburn's trial began Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. Prosecutors accuse him of killing Estrada out of professional jealousy 
because she earned competitive honors he felt he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have quite a number of people who will testify to the professional 
animosity between them," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz during a hearing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz dismissed the bloodstain on Estrada's pants, stating the stain could 
have resulted earlier that evening by sparring with another person at the tae 
kwon do studio where she taught. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the 
second-level black belt division and was named instructor of the year at 
Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, where she primarily taught 5- to 8-year-old 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 She was last seen leaving the studio the night of Dec. 15, 1993. Her 
partly-clothed body was found the next morning in bushes alongside Soledad 
Canyon Road about half a mile west of the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Estrada had died of strangulation at about 8:15 p.m., 
possibly during or after a sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn, also a black belt in tae kwon do, is charged with first-degree murder 
with three special circumstances -- lying in wait, forcible sodomy and 
attempted rape. He is in custody without bail at Men's Central Jail in Los 
Angeles and faces life in prison without parole if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys told Judge Charles Horan on Wednesday that they have more than 80 
potential witnesses who might be called to the stand during the trial, expected 
to take about four weeks. However, the attorneys later estimated that only 
about 60% of them will actually testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is expected to continue today and opening statements are 
expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the prosecution's case is three witnesses who said they saw a man 
near the murder site at the time Estrada was killed, including one who saw a 
struggle between a man and a woman. The witness later identified Milburn as the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said he will discredit Milburn's alibi -- that he was at a music store 
next to the studio between 8 and 9 p.m. the night of the murder -- by calling 
employees of the store and other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prosecution witnesses will testify that Milburn showed a lack of remorse 
after the murder and that he had previously boasted that his tae kwon do skills 
made him "able to 'take out' another person in six seconds," Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mounger emphasized that no physical evidence exists against his client. 
Scientific tests showed the bloodstain found on Estrada's pants was not 
Estrada's or Milburn's. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger said the eyewitness identifications of his client are questionable 
because none of them said the man they saw had a beard -- which Milburn has -- 
when first questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mounger said, a student at the studio will testify that she saw 
Milburn put a Christmas card in her gym bag at about the time of the murder.

GETTING O.C. A PIECE OF THE 'ACTION!'; CRISTI SILVERBERG WILL LEAD THE EFFORT 
TO GIVE THE COUNTY A BIGGER ROLE IN THE MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If your stick-em pads are in color-coded piles on your desk and you hate it 
when somebody throws you a curve ball and suddenly wants you to find a place to 
dry-clean 200 pounds of hockey uniforms, and somebody else calls frantic and 
says, "Oh, by the way, could you find us 200 hotel rooms tonight for our entire 
film crew because we forgot" . . . well, then, you would not want Cristi 
Silverberg's job. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County's director of the newly funded Orange County Film Office, 
Silverberg spends a lot of time reacting to assorted near-disasters. But now 
that the county has decided to spend some money to make some money off the 
movie business, Silverberg should have the time and funds to attract more film 
productions like "Clear and Present Danger" and "North," summer releases that 
were shot, in part, locally. 
</P>
<P>
 What all this means is that government leaders think such showcasing will put 
us on the map and bring more tourist dollars, besides the dough spent by film 
crews at hotels, restaurants, catering companies and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooing Hollywood, then, is Orange County's new game plan, and Silverberg will 
lead the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to bankroll a film 
office that will try attracting more television and motion picture productions 
to the county, budgeting $242,500 for the next three years. That includes 
Silverberg's salary and her office space at the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce, which will also throw in some funding. 
</P>
<P>
 No more sitting back and waiting for the lucky day when the phone rings with 
Buick on the line wanting help to find a big clean stretch of highway for a car 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverberg's job now is to actively court the entertainment industry by 
marketing the county's potential as a backdrop -- and its new willingness to be 
film-friendly. She will also be aiming to streamline the permit process for 
film crews by working closely with the county's city governments, starting with 
a workshop Wednesday at the Waterfront Hilton for city administrators called 
"Film Production in Your Community." 
</P>
<P>
 Every time Orange County is used as a backdrop to a car commercial or a TV 
movie it means money: permit fees and bed tax to the county or city, and other 
lodging and food bucks to businesses. In approving the new film office funding, 
the Board of Supervisors pointed to a county report showing that film crews 
spent $27 million in San Diego County last year, contrasted with a paltry 
$200,000 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing that couldn't be quick-changed by a blockbuster series, say 
Placentia 92670. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverberg laughs, but she knows well that a show like "Simon and Simon," with 
its San Diego Zoo plot lines and La Jolla backdrops, is money in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, she remains completely un-starstruck. On the set of the "Clear and 
Present Danger," a suspense making its debut next month and starring Harrison 
Ford and John Wayne Airport, Silverberg almost asked Harrison Ford how to find 
. . . Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was staring right at him, and I was about five feet away, and I said, 'Gee, 
I wonder what Harrison Ford looks like in this. Has anyone seen him?' " she 
says, laughing. "He did seem to get a kick out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for movies, she rarely sees anything but animated or Disney -- except those 
with Orange County scenery, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 A 32-year-old single mother, she has long but accommodating hours that start 
at 7:30 a.m. She usually leaves her office in The City shopping center in 
Orange by 5 p.m. and has an hour to exercise or ride at the stable before 
picking up her 4-year-old son at preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until now, if someone wanted to shoot a commercial or movie in Orange 
County, they would have to secure permits from each city involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick up a phone and call any city to just ask, who do you call? You can spend 
hours just trying to find that out, and then that person's gonna be on 
vacation," said Glen Everroad, revenue manager of Newport Beach, whose office 
handles the city's film permits. Last year, the city hosted 122 days of 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cities, I think, just don't see the benefit. But there is $4 billion 
in film dollars leaving the state of California because bureaucrats such as 
myself can't accommodate their needs. . . . We can turn around a permit some 
days in 30 minutes, but in (the city of) Orange, they want two weeks still." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Silverberg has been working for the county Environmental 
Management Agency, one of two people handling public relations matters for the 
director. When the county's public information office was eliminated, its tasks 
of coordinating with the film industry were turned over to the EMA; it made 
sense that EMA, which handles public property permits, would absorb the 
processing of applications by production companies for film permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think she's very competent and really has a love for film," said 
Kay Smoot, an EMA planner for whom Silverberg briefly worked, "so she really 
puts her all behind the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, that took up only about 10% of her time, Silverberg said. But 
eventually coordinating with the movie business came to take up the majority of 
her day. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits, though, seem pretty obvious: a $35,000 salary (her position 
actually costs the county a total of $61,000 counting benefits) and a lot of 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to meet a lot of different people, and there's always variety," she 
said. "It's always exciting to be on a movie set, but I've never been a person 
who really got excited about stars." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Lakewood, she moved with her parents, two brothers and two sisters to 
Los Alamitos, then later to San Jose, where she graduated from high school and 
then attended two years at San Jose State. She finished her degree in 
advertising/communications at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 After a modeling stint during college, Silverberg decided the limelight wasn't 
for her. She did an internship with an advertising agency that specialized in 
music industry clients -- although her first solo account was a Mexican 
restaurant in Cypress -- and then took a job after college with a landscape 
architecture firm. Bor-ing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I really wanted to be in corporate America," Silverberg said. 
"After nine months of doing packets and descriptions for bids, a newsletter and 
a few press releases," she quit to work in corporate marketing for a firm in 
banking and real estate. The company advertised in the Los Angeles Rams 
football game program but refused to allow ad copy writers to use any sports 
metaphors -- 'let us drive your investments to the goal line,' that sort of 
thing. They were so conservative, Silverberg's said, that her big feat was 
getting them to change the color of their lettered ad copy. After three months, 
she quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Her next job was more colorful: director of group sales for singer Bill 
Medley's nightclubs, called the Hop. All but one have since been sold, and that 
one is now called Music City, in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really fun job, a really good place to be," Silverberg said. But 
then came the bar mitzvah from hell. Seems the chef for a large party that day 
was very ill, should have gone home really, Silverberg said. But he didn't, and 
instead was constantly interrupted by bouts of nausea, making the bar mitzvah 
lunch 30 minutes late. The boy's mother was furious and threatened to sue 
Medley, who decided he'd had enough with that hassle and stopped the 
large-group end of the business. Hence, Silverberg's job was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three years she worked as a cocktail waitress at the Hop. She 
also worked as catering and convention services manager at the Anaheim Sheraton 
but eventually quit both to work for the county EMA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Silverberg says she has no interest in performing before the camera, and none 
of her friends or family even hit her up for bit parts, an introduction to Mr. 
Stallone, a "can't you just show him my script?" -- nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverberg does enjoy following the process of how a television ad or a movie 
is created, how all the scattered parts come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they were filming 'Clear and Present Danger' at John Wayne Airport, I 
watched them do the same scene over and over for two hours," she said. "They 
were at the luggage carousel, and the luggage comes down and Harrison Ford 
would pick up the luggage, look around -- in this movie he's being chased by a 
sniper -- and then he would walk away and they'd yell cut. Over and over they 
did it. The makeup man would keep running over and combing (Ford's) hair -- how 
could it move in that time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her marketing efforts will be ongoing, but her typical day involves constant 
phone work. She works mostly with location managers and producers, who seek her 
help in finding a certain spot to shoot this car chase or that helicopter 
landing, help in getting quick permits from cities, working out problems like 
not being able to shoot, say, a freeway, when they want to. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally Silverberg has about 72 hours notice for television shoots, a bit 
more for feature films. Sometimes, it's less. Sometimes the problems are not so 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Mighty Ducks II" was filming in Anaheim, someone from the crew realized 
-- at the last minute, natch -- that they had hockey uniforms and costumes and 
no place to clean them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, 'Mighty Ducks II' needed someone who could launder 200 pounds a day for 
14 days, and we didn't have anyone," Silverberg said. "I was finally able to 
convince a uniform company in Irvine that they should bring staff on for it. I 
felt pretty good about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the January filming here of the movie based on Tom Clancy's 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'Clear and Present Danger,' the crew called the afternoon of their first 
day of filming, saying they'd forgot to book hotel rooms," Silverberg recalls, 
like it was no big deal at all. Fortunately, she added, "I found the Radisson 
hotel right across the street from John Wayne Airport that was nearly empty," 
and it was $15,000 a day richer for the duration of the shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley is probably the most popular filming 
location in the county because there is a huge airfield the county purchased 
from the military that has lent itself to a weird variety of shoots. Buick 
filmed an anniversary commercial there with 60-foot-high candles ringing a big 
painted logo. Goodyear did a commercial there for this past Super Bowl in which 
water-skiers pulled by a car were filmed on the park's airfield, which had been 
rigged to hold a thin layer of water, Silverberg said. "Defending Your Life," 
starring Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep, also was filmed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first extensive involvement with a film came last year with "Demolition 
Man," which starred Sylvester Stallone and parts of Irvine and the Fluor Corp. 
tower. Still, she never made it down to the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercials are still the main kind of filming done in Orange County, and some 
of it Silverberg doesn't learn about until after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Star Trek IV' was shot at McDonnell Douglas," she says laughing, "and they 
were just hidden there the whole time. I didn't even know they were here. I 
guess that means they didn't have any problems."

FOR FAMILIES OF MISSING PERSONS, EVEN BAD NEWS CAN BE GOOD. NOW THEY CAN BEGIN 
. . . ; CLOSING DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dennis and Ione Huber had been searching for their missing daughter, 
23-year-old Denise, for three years. This month, her body was found in a 
freezer, and a suspect arrested in her slaying. Despite that heartbreaking 
news, some of the Hubers' tears were tears of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we will be able to close this chapter and move on," Ione Huber of Newport 
Beach told a reporter. "This will help us to have a fresh start." 
</P>
<P>
 That anyone would envy this family seems implausible. But for the growing 
number of people who must cope with the unexplained disappearance of a loved 
one, even a horrifying answer may be better than none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year in this country, thousands of kidnapings by strangers are reported, 
according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Another 130,000 reports are filed 
on runaway children. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond our borders, the fate of more than 200 U.S. soldiers missing in action 
in the Vietnam War remains unknown. And tens of thousands of people worldwide 
continue to track loved ones seemingly lost to World War II, according to the 
International Tracing Service in Arolsen, Germany. The number of children 
wrenched from their parents by ongoing conflicts in Africa, Haiti, Bosnia and 
El Salvador has yet to be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible problem, all kinds of people are affected," says Louis West, 
a psychiatry professor at UCLA School of Medicine who specializes in such 
traumas and has worked with Holocaust survivors and MIA families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not knowing what happened to someone you love is the hardest sort of loss," 
he says. "It keeps hope alive, or it keeps you from getting on with your life. 
There's never, really, closure." 
</P>
<P>
 In therapist-speak, closure can refer to any unresolved loss. In modern times, 
though, it often implies separation by random violence, West says. Among the 
debilitating effects are chronic depression, hastened physical aging, a 
fixation on searching for the missing person and divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the push for closure can also yield positive results. Activist groups 
formed by the families of kidnap victims and MIAs are examples of anger and 
pain turned to constructive energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula Redmond, a Tampa, Fla., family counselor, directs the Center for Crime 
Victims and Survivors. She and co-workers treated 2,300 people in 1993, she 
says. Their best hope of recovery starts with physical evidence of a death, 
however gruesome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a terrible need to see something -- a finger, a lock of hair," 
Redmond says. "Seeing the physical body, there's no way of denying that the 
person is really dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Without that proof, people tend to live with false hope, a form of denial that 
postpones grieving, Redmond explains. "The Hubers will be able to see their 
daughter's body," she says. "That will make their recovery so much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 When a loved one's fate is unknown, Redmond's counseling sessions may involve 
looking with patients at photos of the missing person and encouraging them to 
record their memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step may be more difficult. "I try to help them visualize the person 
as dead," she says. "I say, for example, 'What if the MIA's plane crashed, and 
he did not walk away?' " 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News correspondent Cokie Roberts lives with a version of that scenario. 
Her father, Hale Boggs, was House majority leader (D-La.) when his plane was 
lost over Alaska in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father would be 80 years old now," Roberts says. "For years I had visions 
of him with a long white beard coming out of the Alaska mountains. Part of you 
never gives up the theory that maybe he's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' family held a memorial service instead of a funeral mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no substitute for burying a body," she says. "But without that, it 
becomes terribly important to create your own ritual. Something is better than 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Boggs' disappearance had a particularly strong effect on one family member. 
"When my sister was dying, she insisted on an open casket at her wake," Roberts 
says. "She told me, 'I want people to know I'm in there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the need to know can became an obsession that pays off. Nina Hoeger 
and Wera Thorp were separated in 1941 from their brother, Victor Muzyka. He was 
sent to Poland with his grandmother while Nina and Wera went to a work camp in 
Germany. After the war, the sisters came to America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to dream I was in a cemetery looking for him," says Hoeger, who lives 
in Maryland. "I couldn't find him but I knew he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 After 51 years and ongoing inquiries, the American Red Cross finally reunited 
the family. Until that happened, Hoeger recalls, "I used to think even finding 
his skeleton would help me accept it. It's not knowing what happened that is so 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers are religious people who turned to their pastor, the Rev. Walter 
Shepherd of Aliso Creek Presbyterian Church in Aliso Viejo, for support during 
the search for Denise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've had anything like this," says Shepherd, who has 
also counseled the families of MIAs. "It was some comfort for Dennis and Ione, 
treating Denise as if she were missing in action," he says. "We prayed, 'Lord, 
is Denise alive or dead? We need to know.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the Hubers finally got their answer. "So much was left in 
suspense for so long," Shepherd says. "Now Dennis and Ione can be released."

CYBER SIZZLE; CREATIVITY IS TURNING BITS AND PIECES OF COMPUTER HARDWARE AND 
MUSICAL DISCARDS INTO WAREWEAR, THE LATEST IN ON-LINE FINERY

 Put fashion and computers together and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
 Pocket protectors? Adhesive tape on eyeglasses? An evening- wear line designed 
by Bill Gates? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. A small group of designers is using computer components in 
imaginative ways to create a variety of accessories and even entire outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking gaudy pins with blinking lights, calculator belt buckles or 
certainly anything that beeps on the hour. These designers aren't attracted to 
electronic parts for their utility or gimmickry. It's their beauty that 
inspires them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the first time I saw a circuit board from the back of a 
calculator," Melissa Panages said. It was the late 1970s, and she was studying 
art and ceramics at UC Berkeley. "It was this beautiful green. It looked like a 
piece of jade to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based Panages, by far the best-known designer working with 
electronic parts, took a mass of these shimmering, stamp-size circuit boards 
and hooked them together with tiny gold connectors (also electronic parts) to 
make a camisole, her first high-tech article of clothing. She also began making 
elegant necklaces and other pieces of jewelry using a variety of gold parts 
salvaged from aerospace companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at one of these pieces, and it is much more like gold-filled than 
anything that is just plated. People don't realize it, but the electronics 
industry is one of the leading buyers of gold in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Her circuit-board clothing, which is surprisingly sheer and flowing, attains a 
kind of Egyptian look from the angular, repetitive patterns of the 
fiberboard-based pieces imprinted with gold. The patterns are so eye-catching 
that only upon closer examination do you realize just what makes up the fabric 
of her vests, halter tops and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The handmade pieces are not for everyone. They're fairly adventurous and 
definitely expensive, ranging from about $800 for a top to about $5,000 for a 
dress. (Her jewelry pieces are far more accessible -- from $20 for a pair of 
earrings to about $2,000 for one of her signature necklaces.) 
</P>
<P>
 Famous Melissa, the name of Panages' line, can be reached at (415) 788-1866.

 Connie Perry of Somerville, Mass., was an art student in 1986 when she saw her 
first compact disc. "It was at a party," Perry said, "and as soon as I looked 
at one I thought, 'This would make great jewelry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She especially liked the way the surface of the CDs caught the light. "The 
colors, the way they were refracted on the metalized surface," she said, "were 
so beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry now makes elaborate earrings, pins and tie bars -- ranging in price from 
$5 to $10 -- out of pie-shaped sections cut from surplus CDs she gets mostly 
from companies that are updating their CD-ROM information disks. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't try this at home with an old Fleetwood Mac disc you are sick of 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I cut them with a kind of X-Acto knife, but the CDs gave off a smell 
that I was worried was toxic," Perry said. Not a surprising possibility, 
considering the high-tech materials and processes that go into manufacturing a 
CD. Perry never established if these odors were indeed toxic, but for her peace 
of mind she now uses more sophisticated high-tech cutting techniques that she 
did not want to divulge. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry sells the jewelry through her company, CEEDEEZ ((617) 666-0152), while 
working toward getting a national distributor. In the meantime, she supplements 
her income by teaching costuming and with occasional acting jobs. This fall she 
can be spotted in a commercial for the Dunkin' Donuts chain. "I'm the one 
holding the tray of Halloween doughnuts standing next to the star, Fred the 
Baker," Perry said. "It would have been nice if they had let me wear one of my 
pieces, but it wouldn't have fit the situation."

 Suzanne Bevan is a painter who, three years ago, started painting mythical 
cityscapes directly onto circuit boards that had been discarded by a high-tech 
manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grid on the board is very city-like, anyway," said Bevan, speaking from 
her studio loft in Chicago. "I thought they were so interesting looking, so 
colorful." 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend, Charles Weaver, thought so, too, although he had more 
utilitarian ideas. "We started talking about the possibility of laminating them 
and making them into furniture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weaver's experience was in the gift business, so they naturally started 
talking about smaller products for retail. Together, they designed 
circuit-board earrings and key chains, and more everyday items: place mats, 
clipboards, coasters and business-card wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they use whatever surplus circuit boards they can get at the time, the 
pieces vary tremendously in color and pattern. Some of the most stunning pieces 
they have made come from a pale yellow circuit board that recalls 
mother-of-pearl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things we make have an industrial look, but a little artier," Bevan said. 
"The address-card holders have been especially popular because it's the kind of 
thing a woman looking at our earrings will spot and then get to give as a gift 
to a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Their products, ranging in price from $3.50 for a key chain to $48.95 for a 
set of aluminum-backed coasters, were an instant hit at eco-type fairs across 
the county. They are gearing up to try to build an inventory and go for wider 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the eco people interested in us because it's all recycled, and that's 
big in the gift business now," Weaver said. "And it's something that is unique. 
I think it's our time." 
</P>
<P>
 Their company, Motherboard Enterprises, can be reached at (312) 842-6788.

BY DESIGN; OFF THE CUFF; BARGAINS, IF YOU CATCH HER THRIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A s any ex-hippie or fashion fringe-dweller knows, Goodwill stores have always 
meant cool clothes at low prices. But selling second-hand duds isn't what it 
used to be.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Goodwill Industries has been in Orange County for 70 years, Maria 
Guerrero, the retail sales merchandise coordinator, says it must now compete 
with thrift shops and discount stores. To do this, the Goodwill staff sorts 
through the donated tonnage, tosses aside the worn and torn, and culls out only 
"gently used" or new clothing to be sold at its retail outlets.  
</P>
<P>
 To make it easier for savvy consumers, Goodwill has created the Classic 
Closet, a bargain boutique in San Juan Capistrano, and the Collectible Corner 
inside the Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Westminster stores. Sales from 
clothing account for 65% of the funds Goodwill uses to provide vocational 
rehabilitation training programs for people with disabilities. More than 50 
people work for Goodwill's clothing division in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Our customers range from big families that need to clothe six to 10 people, to 
women who pull up in their Mercedes, wearing Ray Bans and designer jackets. We 
see a lot more men now than in the past, mostly single young men looking for 
discounts. They go directly to the shirts, jeans and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 We get daily shipments of merchandise, and we have people who come in every 
day. People line up a half-hour before we open to be first to look at the new 
items. Some are dealers who buy from us to sell at swap meets, antique shops or 
boutiques here and in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 We get merchandise from home pickups, donation centers and drop-offs at our 
stores. I see brand-new merchandise with $100 price tags still on it, and I 
can't understand who would give it away. A couple weeks ago I found a 1930s 
satin wedding dress that was in amazing condition. We may use it for a vintage 
fashion show that we hope to stage next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a customer sees an item in our stores, we sort it, identify its 
condition and price it according to quality. The average price is about $4.50 
for a blouse, shirt or skirt. The most expensive piece of clothing I've seen 
was a mink coat in mint condition that sold for $300 or $400. 
</P>
<P>
 What's hot now are the retro '70s wear, such as big cotton dresses, 
bell-bottom jeans, loud polyester synthetic shirts with big prints, denim hats 
with flowers and denim jackets with studding, beading and patches. These things 
used to stay in our stores forever, but now teens love them. 
</P>
<P>
 We have an "As Is" lot next to the main facility in Santa Ana, and if an 
item's not selling in the stores, even after it's been discounted to 
half-price, then it goes here. It's the last stop before it's sold as salvage 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lima, Peru, they don't have the resources to make an item, but they can 
repair one, which we no longer do, such as replace buttons and zippers. Also, 
heavy winter clothing that's not salable here can certainly be used and 
repaired there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stores, clothing is divided into groups for men, women and children, 
and then by categories: blouses, pants, et cetera are all together on the 
racks. We don't divide the garments by size but by color; all the white blouses 
are together. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Classic Closet, we have everything from casual wear from Liz Claiborne 
and Anne Klein to beaded formal dresses. Some of it has never been worn. The 
women in Mercedes come here looking for a good bargain. They know their labels, 
and if they come across a silk blouse, they grab it. Some women wear a leotard 
to the store so they can try things on in the aisle without having to wait to 
go into the dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people are pleasantly surprised that the Classic Closet is part of the 
Goodwill family because we have so many different kinds of items. Not only do 
people find values, but they feel good that their purchases are helping people 
be independent and productive.

BY DESIGN; FAB DUO IS, WELL, FABULOUS; BRITAIN'S EDINA AND PATSY ARE THE 
FASHION WORLD'S NEWEST SWEETIE DARLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cave dwellers and the cable-challenged might have missed the premiere of 
"Absolutely Fabulous" on Comedy Central on Sunday, but the fashion watchers 
didn't. Their fingers were poised on the record buttons of their VCRs to tape 
the daylong British sitcom's orgy of sex, drugs, dysfunctional families and 
eye-jarring fashion statements. 
</P>
<P>
 They were only too thrilled to vicariously roll in the gutter with Edina 
(Jennifer Saunders) -- the rebirthed, channeled, crystallized, 
"I'm-chanting-as-we-speak" Buddhist publicist and her best friend, Patsy 
(Joanna Lumley), a magazine fashion director whose talents include procuring 
casual sex, cocaine and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the drugs and stuff reminded me of the way past," Los Angeles fashion 
designer Gregory Poe says. "There was a time when I actually was in a 
trance-like state. The show had that same sort of a trance-like quality. The 
head trips reminded me of the fashion world, the ones people don't want to 
admit -- stuff like 'reschedule my rebirth for next Thursday.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are talking about it are the ones lampooned by the show," 
notes fashion writer and Newsday columnist Frank DeCaro. "Not only are we the 
target audience but we're also the target." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Absolutely Fabulous" gals smoke, they swear, they have serious 
substance-abuse problems. Edina is an unfit mother and Patsy is your mother's 
worst nightmare. Her anti-grav tower of blond hair, Chanel suits and garishly 
lipsticked leer have elevated her to the style pantheon: She is the latest 
specialty among drag queens. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the pair's bad influence wasn't felt in this country until 
this week, they already had loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken over my life," DeCaro admits. No kidding. He has all 12 shows on 
tape, a book that includes scripts and photographs, the "Absolutely Fabulous 
Sweetie Darling" T-shirt, the Pet Shop Boys' single "Absolutely Fabulous" -- 
which contains lines from the show -- and photographs of himself with Lumley 
and Saunders taken at a recent New York taping. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he circumspect when he met the divine duo? "Of course. I'm not a complete 
geek," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Hall, a Dallas stylist turned independent film producer, was desperate 
to see the show, even though her cable system deemed it too racy. "Two drunken 
women doing drugs? It's right up my alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of the first time I saw 'All in the Family' -- I was 
spellbound but sort of embarrassed. I kept looking around the room to see who 
was laughing. It's kind of like giggling in church. You know you shouldn't, but 
the harder you try to stifle, the worse it gets," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 References to the show are turning up in fashionable places. DeCaro reports 
overhearing them this week in New York at the menswear shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is calling everyone else 'sweetie darling.' I've heard 'Lacroix 
sweetie, Lacroix,' and 'I'm chanting as we speak.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "AbFab," as it's called by fans, appeals to the true fashion insider. " 
'Models Inc.' hasn't got a clue about fashion," DeCaro says. "With 'AbFab,' 
accuracy is its best feature." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Orsi, a Los Angeles publicist, definitely recognized Edina as a member 
of the flack sisterhood. "Oh, Edina, she's one of us. I loved the part where 
she's given a present and she says, 'Is it Lacroix, I love it -- if it's 
Lacroix. Is it Lacroix, sweetie?' That is right on the money. Only in the 
fashion world will you hear people say, 'Love your jacket, whose is it?' Any 
sane person would say, 'It's mine.' In the fashion world, you have to give its 
lineage." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the clothes, sweetie darling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought design-wise, they had it spot on," says British expatriate David 
Stamper, public relations director of the California Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edina was amazing, she was so badly dressed," gasps Tim Flannery, art 
director for a large national specialty store. "Oh, my God, that fake fur coat 
with Versace bell-bottoms and a brocade Lacroix vest." 
</P>
<P>
 Edina's ghastly, one-size-too-small, multilayered, designer-labeled get-ups 
impede her ability to walk a sidewalk, drive a car and sit in a chair. They 
also are a constant source of comment both on the show and in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that you're wearing?" Patsy sniffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lacroix." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Lacroix -- it's fabulous."

BY DESIGN; THE BUZZ OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seal did it. So did Tom Hanks for "Forrest Gump" and Keanu Reeves for "Speed." 
Now it seems every other guy in Los Angeles has shorn his scalp for summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they choose Gump's 1950s-inspired whitewalls (short on top, bald on 
the sides) or completely bald all the way around, most guys claim this season's 
crew cuts are more about being cool, rather than looking cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it to be in the KKK or to be thought of as a skinhead," says Juan 
Escobedo, 22, of Hawthorne. "I work in the sun all day, and it's just cooler to 
have it this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Micheal, owner of a Pasadena hair salon that bears his name, says he does 
about 20 to 30 buzz cuts a week at $15 each during the summer. "It's hot, it's 
summer and it's mod," Micheal says. "It started with the whole skateboarding 
thing, then it hit MTV and now everyone -- including women -- wants it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is looking to make a bold style statement, however. Rick 
Caldwell, 26, says he was after a "leave-me-alone" statement. "Normally I have 
longer hair and sideburns. But I live in West Hollywood and I'd get hit on by 
guys a lot so I shaved it." He grew to appreciate the cut's advantages: "It 
doesn't get messed up when the wind blows. And when you take a shower, you 
don't need conditioner." 
</P>
<P>
 You also don't need to carry around a comb. But a word of caution: Those going 
without nature's cranial shade provider risk sunburn. So swab your dome with a 
liberal dose of sunscreen. WILLIAM KISSEL

A PRETTIER PICTURE; UNDER JOHN LOTTES, THE ART INSTITUTE IS SHAPING UP 
FINANCIALLY AND AIMING TO RAISE ITS PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leafy view from John W. Lottes' office-cum-treehouse, nestled among the 
sycamores that line Laguna Canyon, often can take the edge off the most 
stressful day. The same view, however, can also spark fretful memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, firefighters were battling canyon-ravaging flames to 
keep them from reaching the Art Institute of Southern California, Orange 
County's only private four-year art college, where Lottes is president. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster twice forced the school to close for four days -- during the fire and 
again during subsequent mudslides -- and prompted a dozen students to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen is a lot when your total enrollment is 135 full- and part-time 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a party for firefighters on Thanksgiving," Lottes recalled recently, 
"and the kids for the first time sort of let their hair down and said they were 
afraid the place wasn't going to be here, that their school would be gone. . . 
. Some of the kids just said, 'I'll see ya,' and they bailed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students, however, stayed the course, and now, having graduated, have 
started their own firms or won admission to prestigious schools to pursue 
advanced degrees. (The institute this fall will complete its first 
"comprehensive report" tracking graduates, Lottes said.) 
</P>
<P>
 The school also met its budgeted enrollment minimum of 115 full-time students 
last year, scoring another point for Lottes' administration, which has managed 
to erase an inherited $68,000 deficit, finish the past two years in the black, 
give the faculty modest raises and edge enrollment up. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, the school was in survival mode," Lottes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenges persist. The head of similar arts institutes in Oregon, Minnesota 
and Missouri in the '60s, '70s and '80s, Lottes wants to heighten the school's 
visibility, which he admits is poor, increase salaries, restore programs cut 
before his tenure and get on with a long-stalled physical expansion, which may 
set off tenacious local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has to deal with the school's critics: One top local graphic design 
professional says that the school's curriculum is lightweight, and a former 
student complains that instructors are lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Such gripes didn't prevent the institute's board last month from renewing 
Lottes' three-year contract. "He's an excellent chief executive," says board 
chairman Leon Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The board isn't alone in its recent praise of Lottes and the 33-year-old 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's changed the whole atmosphere of the place," said Jim Lashley, an 
architect and member of the volunteer Arts Commission of Laguna Beach. "He's 
full of ideas, and his approach is one of getting things done." 
</P>
<P>
 "The institute is an unsung hero," said R. Dean Gerrie, president of Irvine's 
Dula Gerrie Design, a leading graphic design firm. Gerrie recently taught 
graphic design at the school and has employed its student interns. "The level 
of creativity is spectacular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottes already had set a recent record by completing his first three years at 
the art and design school. (No president in its last decade -- there have been 
eight -- stayed as long.) And that hasn't hurt the school's effort to win 
accreditation from the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges (WASC). 
</P>
<P>
 The institute was accredited in 1985 by the National Assn. of Schools of Art 
and Design, but WASC's imprimatur would increase the number of schools at which 
graduates of the Art Institute may pursue advanced degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 WASC staff members, who periodically visit and evaluate candidate schools, 
have been chiefly concerned about the institute's fiscal strength and 
"continuity of leadership," Lottes said. They have visited twice since 1989 and 
are scheduled to return in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Having "turned around our finances" and increased enrollment, "things are 
looking good," Lottes said. He is, however, loath to take the credit, 
preferring to hand that to his board of trustees. 
</P>

 "In my judgment, one of the most significant limitations of the mid- to late 
'80s was trustee interference with the institute's management," he said. "When 
I came, the board pledged that that was history, and they've been true to their 
word." 
</P>
<P>

 Lottes, 60, came to the Art Institute after four years as president of the 
Oregon School of Arts and Crafts in Portland. Before that, he was president of 
the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts (parent of the Minneapolis Institute of 
Arts, College of Art and Design and Children's Theater) and the Kansas City 
(Mo.) Art Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 A sleeves-rolled-up sort of man who quickly puts others at ease, Lottes said 
during a recent interview at the school that erasing its deficit was basically 
a matter of keeping enrollment up -- it hit a record 130 during his first year 
-- and expenditures down. 
</P>
<P>
 The same method was applied to end the two previous years with small budget 
surpluses, Lottes said. Last year's came to $13,000 on a total budget of $1.4 
million. While salaries increased 5% during each of Lottes' first two years, 
they'll go up by only 2% during the 1994-95 school year, which opens in August, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not so sure about our enrollment growth, and we want to make sure we 
have the money before we increase the salaries," he said, which may nonetheless 
go up again -- he hopes -- at midyear if enrollment is high enough.  
</P>
<P>
 (According to the Assn. of Independent Colleges of Art and Design, the average 
teacher salary at its 31 member schools last year was $34,800, which falls 
roughly in the middle of the $27,000-to-$40,000 compensation range at the 
Laguna institute, which also is a member.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the school's gallery exhibition program, cut under Lottes' 
immediate predecessor, Russell E. Lewis, is "creeping back" with a current 
budget of $21,000 and 10 shows scheduled for the upcoming year, Lottes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a curator instead of faculty members to oversee it, as before, must 
wait, however. First, Lottes wants to bring on an academic dean and, even 
before that, a public relations officer. (A new development director, Milly 
Muzzy, was hired a year ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get the word out about this place better," he said, both to entice 
new students and sources of private funding. "It's just not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really anxious as soon as we can to add back the sculpture major," which 
also was cut before he arrived, Lottes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Producing students who become major American artists -- something else on 
Lottes' long-term wish list when he arrived -- hasn't happened either. But 
several fine arts graduates have been accepted, many on scholarship, to 
graduate art programs at such competitive schools as Claremont College and UC 
Berkeley, he said. There also has been a slight rise, from roughly 30% to 40%, 
in the percentage of students majoring in fine arts rather than in design. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's partly because state schools are reducing their fine-arts curricula, he 
said, and because of the dour economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hard times, when jobs are not as available, or there are no jobs, people 
tend to pursue their dreams," he said. "We've seen students in increasing 
numbers saying, 'You know, I always thought maybe I should be a graphic 
designer, but what I really want to be is a painter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some art-world professionals believe more basic matters need 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine designer Gerrie, who will return to teach this fall, asserts that the 
history of graphic design has been "brushed over" at the institute -- indeed, 
at all such schools -- in the rush to give today's commercial-art graduates 
skills in computer-generated design skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something has had to give way," Gerrie said, "and that's been the contextual 
link between what's happened in the past and what you can do in the future. 
It's the MTV generation. Today's students see only what's apparent to them, and 
that doesn't necessarily hold principles that have been historically proven 
correct or to have staying power." 
</P>
<P>
 Jai Hall, now a partner in a Santa Monica design studio, left the school 
before graduating because he preferred to learn on the job. But he felt that 
its instructors weren't "rigorous" enough in evaluating student projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't get in there and tear people apart like they should," Hall said, 
"because that's what happens in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Gerrie's concern, Vito-Leonardo Scarola, chairman of the institute's 
visual communications department, notes that the school requires courses in 
graphic design. But he concedes that some students have taken Gerrie's 
upper-division classes before taking lower-division design history classes. 
While students are counseled to follow set curriculum sequences, "we can't 
control everything that every student does," Scarola said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Hall's complaint about lax scrutiny of students' projects, Scarola said "We 
have had a number of faculty meetings here, and that was a concern, that (such) 
standards needed to be implemented across the board." Nevertheless, Scarola 
stressed that the school's teachers "absolutely subject students' " projects to 
professional-level evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning the school's long-stalled expansion has yet to happen, Lottes said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A $3.4-million building campaign announced in 1990 by former president William 
Otton that would have doubled the school's size has been "shelved," he said. 
Now under consideration is a more restrained plan that targets an adjacent 
1.4-acre land parcel owned by the Irvine Co. Negotiations to buy the land are 
under way, and the school has so far raised $155,000 toward the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than one huge addition to this facility," the expansion probably will 
mean some expanded exhibition space and additional classrooms, plus rented 
off-campus satellite facilities if future enrollment goes beyond 250 students, 
Lottes said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have tried to keep environmentalists abreast of their 
progress, said board chairman Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a certain extent, I think when they get to know our people, like John and 
other trustees, we become more human to them," Lyon said. "They had a great 
concern that we wanted to expand the school to be much larger than what our 
plans call for." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending three years getting to know the institute, Lottes has mixed 
feelings about its progress. "On one hand, I think we're farther ahead than I 
thought we would be at this point; on the other hand, now I've learned a lot, 
and I see we have a ways to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm terribly happy to be here. I think we're turning out good graduates, 
and I think we fill an important place in the universe of art education." 
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 * The Art Institute of Southern California was founded in 1961 as the Laguna 
Beach School of Art and Design. It was the brainchild of members of the Laguna 
Beach Art Assn., which became the Laguna Art Museum. The school was renamed the 
Laguna Beach College of Art, then given its current title in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute is accredited by the National Assn. of Schools of Art and Design 
and is seeking accreditation by the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, 
anticipated in 1996. WASC accreditation may increase the number of schools at 
which graduates may pursue advanced study. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's current exhibit, "The enerative Spirit," contains works by 42 
artists who have taught at the institute during the past 30 years. Art 
Institute of Southern California, Ettinger and Reynolds Galleries, 2222 Laguna 
Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.; Saturday, 9

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELLFLOWER; NEW LAW HOLDS PARENTS LIABLE FOR KIDS' CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to reduce late-night gang activity, the City Council voted to 
sue parents whose children repeatedly violate the law, including the city's 10 
p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which passed on a 3-2 vote, allows the city to file civil suits 
asking for up to $2,500 from parents of chronic offenders, said Mike Egan, 
deputy city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are held accountable for failing to control the child," Egan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though directed at curfew breakers, the ordinance also can be used against the 
parents of children who violate laws forbidding graffiti, alcohol and drug 
possession and other misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 Egan said parents will receive a warning letter after the first offense. The 
city will take parents to court after the third offense in most cases, Egan 
said, adding that they have the authority to sue after the first violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Art Olivier and Ruth Gilson voted against the measure. Gilson 
said the penalties are too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they won't use it on first offenders, but they can," Gilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance goes into effect Aug. 11. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; SPURNED BY CITY, ASPHALT COMPANY FILES CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An asphalt-recycling company that was denied permission to build a new plant 
in North Long Beach has filed a $2.2-million claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim, a necessary precursor to a lawsuit, was denied Tuesday by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal documents, attorneys for EcoPave California accused at least 14 city 
employees, including City Manager James C. Hankla, of leading the company 
astray with promises of easy permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They romanced us to get us to come in, then ran into political problems and 
just dropped us," Steven Vance, EcoPave's president, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 EcoPave's application for permits to build a plant at 6150 Paramount Blvd. was 
denied by council members last month after nearby residents complained that the 
plant would create dust and attract heavy truck traffic. Another possible site, 
at 1642 E. 32nd St., is still being considered by city staff and EcoPave, but 
it has also run into permit snags. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the claim, EcoPave has lost $930,000 in possible revenues, had 
$240,000 in overhead and staff time, spent $51,614 on various permits, and 
purchased custom-made equipment. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; MISSED DEADLINE DOOMS COUNCIL RECALL EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recall effort against three City Council members has been dismissed after 
organizers missed a deadline to turn in recall documents to the city clerk's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers served recall papers recently on Mayor Paul H. Richards II and 
council members Louis Byrd and Louis J. Heine, but then failed to comply with a 
requirement that they deliver copies of the recall documents to the city 
clerk's office within a week, said Deputy City Clerk Rita Manibusan. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall documents listed a variety of accusations against the council 
members, ranging from mismanagement of funds to improperly making decisions in 
closed sessions. The councilmen denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
 The documents also questioned whether Richards lives in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall organizers distributed copies of a deed showing that Richards owns a 
home in Cerritos. Richards said he owns homes in Lynwood, Compton, Carson and 
Cerritos, but that he lives in Lynwood. Richards said his mother lives in the 
Cerritos home. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards said a key recall organizer, activist Benjamin Miranda, has had 
various business and legal disputes with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda has vowed to launch another recall effort. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SIGNAL HILL; COUNCIL RAISES WATER RATES A SECOND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a water-rate increase for Signal Hill residents 
-- the second in six months -- to cover higher costs from suppliers, adding 
employees and decreasing the city's water debt, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16% increase, set to begin in August, will raise about $200,000 a year and 
cost the average homeowner an additional $3.62 per month, public works director 
Richard P. Lundahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the council raised Signal Hill water fees by 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money will be used to eliminate the city's $400,000 water debt 
over the next five years, Lundahl said. Previously, city officials had 
subsidized water operations from the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to decide Aug. 2 whether to levy the city's first 
sewer fee. If the proposal is accepted, it will add $5.20 a month to the 
average homeowner's water bill.

POSITIVELY SPEAKING; HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET A WAKE-UP CALL ON HIV AND AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BETH MOTHNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Peraza learned he had HIV while he was an inmate at Chico State 
Prison in 1987. He decided to have the test done on a lark, as an excuse to get 
out of his cell for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had engaged in unprotected sex and IV drug use in the past -- two 
common ways that AIDS is transmitted -- he said he never imagined that the test 
would come back positive. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the 38-year-old former thief was asked to undergo a second test 10 
days later, he recalls his terrifying premonition of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't afraid of dying. But I wanted to die with the SWAT team after me. I 
didn't want this 'gay disease,' " Peraza recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the flashes of bravado, Peraza's story had a sobering effect on the 
California High School students who gathered recently to listen in the Whittier 
campus cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Peraza and Dora Gallagher, another speaker with HIV, visited the school as 
representatives of Positively Speaking. The program, run by the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education, attempts to reduce the spread of HIV among young 
people and give the AIDS epidemic a human face. Positively Speaking presenters 
spoke to more than 5,000 students in grades seven through 12 in Los Angeles 
County during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Gallagher told the California High students, she owned a flourishing 
Venice Beach beauty salon when she began to feel sick. Because diabetes runs in 
her family, she asked her doctor for a glucose-tolerance test. But she also 
suspected that promiscuity in her late teens and early 20s and drug abuse put 
her in the high-risk category for AIDS. So she also asked for an HIV test. It 
was positive. "I think hearing (about AIDS) from people whose lives are going 
to be affected forever is very, very important," said Amy Reinholtz, a science 
teacher at the school.  
</P>
<P>
 Three women spoke to the students last year, Reinholtz said. "They hadn't done 
drugs. They weren't gay. They had received (the virus) from husbands to whom 
they had been faithful their entire lives. It shows that it can happen to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Peraza stressed that point to the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS is not a gay disease. It doesn't care who you are, what you are, or 
where you come from," he told them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the four years after his release from prison, Peraza said, he lived in 
denial of his disease. Then after watching a late-night television commercial 
about an intravenous drug user, he contacted an HIV support group to ask for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the group's members were homosexual, Peraza said, "these guys 
were cool. They had jobs, cars. They motivated me to take my medication. They 
became my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Peraza, a Monterey Park roofer, has become an AIDS counselor. In 1992 he was 
named Volunteer of the Year by L.A. Shanti, an organization for people with 
life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that he technically has AIDS, based on his low immune-cell 
count. But, he said, "I don't accept it. I feel pretty good. I just hope they 
find a cure." 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers fielded questions from students. What were their plans? How did 
their families feel? In turn, the speakers asked a few questions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of you practice abstinence?" Gallagher asked. "How many practice 
safe sex?" Young people are one of the most at-risk groups for getting AIDS, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having the virus changes more than just health, she said. She told them her 
problems multiplied after she tested positive for HIV because her business 
dropped sharply and she eventually lost her beauty salon.  
</P>
<P>
 This occurred, she explained, when an acquaintance who accompanied her for 
AIDS testing spread the rumor of her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurts," Gallagher said. "I was a prominent businesswoman, and because 
one person had a big mouth, I don't have a business today."  
</P>
<P>
 A slender, striking woman with shoulder-length dark hair, Gallagher warned her 
audience not to be deceived by her seemingly healthy appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day is not a good day," she said. " Don't think, 'They seem fine. HIV 
isn't that bad.' It is bad. You don't want it."

DRIVE BEGINS TO BUILD AUTO-RACING COMPLEX; DEVELOPMENT: PLAN CALLS FOR A 
$200-MILLION TRACK AND RESEARCH CENTER ON THE BORDER OF LONG BEACH AND SIGNAL 
HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The founder and promoter of the Long Beach Grand Prix is seeking to build an 
auto-racing track and research complex at the Long Beach-Signal Hill border, 
and has received an enthusiastic response from the councils of both cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Christopher R. Pook's $200-million proposal, called Transwest Park, would 
bring a 1 1/4-mile oval racetrack, 110 acres of automotive research and 
development facilities, and a hotel to an area dotted by oil rigs and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The track would host four major auto races a year, some smaller events such as 
vintage car shows, and provide a test site for the research center. Pook said 
he hopes to lure former aerospace engineers to develop safer cars, stronger 
body compounds and cleaner fuels, and conduct other automotive research 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook said the complex would create 13,000 permanent jobs and bring more than 
$1 billion a year to the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pook unveiled his proposal last week, Long Beach City Council members 
directed the city's redevelopment agency to study his plan, and the Signal Hill 
City Council asked its city manager to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the proposal is pretty awesome," said Long Beach Councilman Les 
Robbins. "If we can create this many high-paying jobs, generate this much 
revenue and clean up what is probably the most blighted property in Long Beach 
and Signal Hill, it is something worth pursuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Signal Hill Councilwoman Sara Hanlon said the idea is exciting, but she 
expressed concerns about noise and traffic problems for nearby Signal Hill 
residents. The proposed track location is just south of the San Diego (405) 
Freeway, between Orange and Walnut avenues, on several parcels of land in Long 
Beach and Signal Hill.

<P>
 Pook said that the sunken land and bowl shape of the proposed track and 
strategic sound barriers will keep noise levels down. 
</P>
<P>
 from exceeding those of the nearby freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 He has enlisted seven companies to build, manage and finance the Transwest 
project, including the North Carolina-based J. A. Jones Construction Co., one 
of the nation's leading construction firms, with annual worldwide contracts of 
about $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's firm, Automotive Safety and Transportation Systems, would lead the 
development. According to the proposal, Transwest would be financed mostly by 
private investors, with city agencies providing some money to help buy the 
property and improve some of the infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing the ground for construction, including cleaning up the soil and 
consolidating the active oil wells, would take about two years, Pook said. 
Building the complex would then take about six to eight months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, Pook founded the Long Beach Grand Prix, the city's largest 
revenue-producing event. It attracts more than 200,000 racing fans each year 
and generates $40 million to $60 million for the local economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has begun a fund-raising drive to 
help the family of an 8-year-old girl who was raped earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, which includes eight children, moved after the incident, said 
Detective Dan Scott, who is coordinating the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to collect at least $1,500 to offset those costs," he said. "And 
whatever else we collect will also go to them."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; BOARD OKS EXEMPTIONS ON SCHOOL UNIFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN COX

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents may exempt their children from the Long Beach School District's 
mandatory uniform policy for elementary and middle schools, the school board 
decided recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines approved by the board rely mostly on incentives, such as pizza 
parties, to enforce the policy.They also ensure that no student will be 
suspended, expelled or receive a lower grade for refusing to wear a uniform. 
Students whose families cannot afford to buy uniforms and students who refuse 
to wear them for religious reasons also are exempt from the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said uniforms will instill academic pride and make schools safer 
by reducing gang attire. The board wanted to require all students to wear the 
uniforms, but said their hands were tied by a bill awaiting Gov. Pete Wilson's 
signature. The bill allows districts to require uniforms but also allows 
parents who object to uniforms to have their children exempted.  
</P>
<P>
 Students will begin wearing uniforms in September at the district's 70 
elementary and middle schools. Penalties for not wearing a uniform, if they are 
necessary, will begin Oct. 14. They may include detention and trash pickup, 
officials said. In the 19 schools that already have uniform policies, district 
officials say that 90% of the students wear uniforms even without the threat of 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents who consider mandatory school uniforms a violation of 
students' rights to free expression have insisted that the uniforms be 
voluntary. The group filed for an injunction against the policy in federal 
court in May, but it was denied until the district passed its guidelines for 
enforcing the policy. JOHN COX

<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting ABC Unified schools chief Ira Toibin resigned this week, adding his 
name to the growing list of top administrators who have departed in the past 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Toibin said he submitted his resignation to the school board Monday night 
after trustees called a special meeting to discuss his position.Toibin said he 
was leaving for personal reasons but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 He had served as acting superintendent since early March, when the school 
board placed embattled Supt. Larry L. Lucas on paid leave. Attorneys for Lucas 
and the school district still are attempting to work out a severance agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the school board hired a consultant to search for a new 
superintendent. Toibin, who will leave as of Sept. 1, said the search may take 
as long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC district has also lost administrators who headed the business, fiscal 
services and personnel offices, as well as the administrator who oversaw middle 
and elementary schools. None of the positions have been filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Toibin, 45, has been with the district five years. He had been deputy 
superintendent before becoming acting superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members could not be reached for comment. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; REPORT WEIGHS QUAKE RISK AT COLLEGE BUILDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Long Beach's tallest building should be strengthened to withstand a 
major earthquake, but does not pose an immediate safety risk, a state seismic 
review board has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in our judgment not an emergency condition," said Charles Thiel, 
chairman of the California State University review board. "But it does 
represent a substantial-enough risk . . . that something should be done about 
this building." 
</P>
<P>
 If the university does not strengthen the nine-story McIntosh Humanities 
Building, officials should consider evacuating the structure, the report said. 
The building, which was constructed in the mid-1960s, houses 130 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials requested the report after six employees who work in the 
building asked to be moved elsewhere until the structure is strengthened. The 
employees became concerned after learning that an engineering firm had warned 
in a report last year that the building might collapse during a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials have asked engineers to review the seismic board's report 
before deciding what to do with the building and the employees' request to 
relocate. -- JOHN COX

 Teamsters Picketing

<P>
 Cemetery Over Salaries 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters Union officials have set up picket lines at a newly unionized 
cemetery to try to break a contract impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of protesters have been picketing daily since Friday at various 
entrances to the 2,600-acre Rose Hills Memorial Park at 3900 S. Workman Mill 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the cemetery's 62 gravediggers and maintenance workers voted to 
be represented by the union last December. Union officials and Rose Hills 
managers have since been negotiating their first contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The union and Rose Hills managers have reached agreement on issues including 
grievance procedures, seniority, job retraining and health benefits but have 
deadlocked over pay and one other issue. The union is seeking across-the-board 
pay increases, while cemetery managers want to award raises based on merit. The 
union also has demanded that all eligible employees be required to join the 
union, a demand that Rose Hills management calls unfair. JOHN D. WAGNER

COVER STORY; FAITH IN FOLK REMEDIES; MANY IMMIGRANTS TRUST THEIR WELL-BEING TO 
SPIRITUAL HEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Sophal Kong's children burn with fever, he visits the Buddhist temple 
near his Long Beach apartment. There, he offers a meal to his Cambodian 
ancestors, whose spirits, he believes, can shield his family from sickness and 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles to the north, in Huntington Park, a distraught woman named Maria 
has just returned from the curandera -- or faith healer -- where she hoped to 
learn why her husband cheats on her. The answer: An evil mistress who dabbles 
in black magic has cast spells on the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sophal Kong and Maria, thousands of Asian and Latino immigrants across 
Southeast Los Angeles County seek folk remedies for their maladies -- from 
indigestion to lost love to AIDS. The faithful flock to botanicas and temples 
where air is sweet with incense and candles flicker atop altars devoted to 
Jesus or Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they arrived here from different parts of the globe, the newcomers 
share an unshakable faith in mystical worlds inhabited by spirits who, they 
believe, can wreak calamity, cause illness or bestow good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Those accustomed to Western medicine might frown on fortunetelling, herbal 
elixirs and blessings to cleanse the soul. Health officials, meanwhile, warn 
that some traditional medicines can even kill. But to people reared in other 
cultures, the cure-alls are often more trusted than any X-ray or antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have complete trust that the curandera is telling the truth," said Maria, 
38, who did not want her last name used. Her $10 visit to the faith healer 
revealed that a back injury, frequent headaches and fainting episodes have all 
been caused by the mistress' spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Many like Maria, who cannot speak English or afford frequent visits to the 
doctor, find an alternative source of care in trusted elders known for their 
home-grown herbs and celestial ties. People unaccustomed to fortress-like 
hospitals find comfort among these word-of-mouth shamans who can speak their 
language and fathom their demons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some disease cannot be treated by Western medicine," said Chhor Sok Lorn, 55, 
of Long Beach, who nurses her arthritis with a sour potion of white wine, 
ground porcupine jawbones and dried roots -- a mixture prepared by her uncle, a 
Kru Khmer or traditional Cambodian healer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to the Kru Khmer , you get well forever," Lorn said. "You will be 
cured." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such homespun sentiments -- and practices -- reach into the lives of 
illiterate and educated alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors at the Southeast Asian Health Project in Long Beach, who teach 
prenatal care to expectant mothers in the city's poorest neighborhoods, still 
"coin" themselves in the privacy of their offices -- rubbing balms and coins on 
their bodies in a ritual that bruises the skin but is said to relieve minor 
irritations such as muscle aches. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Lynwood school district's PTA ties raw potato slices to her 
children's necks overnight to reduce swelling from sore throats, a remedy she 
learned from her mother in a small town near Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president of the Long Beach Recreation Commission boils ginger root 
in a tea said to relieve headaches -- a simple remedy handed down through four 
generations of her family in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was a registered nurse, and yet every time I got sick, she pulled 
out the herbs," Gladys Gutierrez, the commissioner, recalled. "I don't know if 
it was the magic of her hands or the brew she was fixing, but I always felt 
better. Now I would rather take a tea than a pill." 
</P>
<P>
 Health educators predict that the traditional medical practices will continue 
to play an important role throughout Southeast Los Angeles because of the 
area's large immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities such as Compton and Lynwood, once predominantly African American, are 
now home to thousands of Spanish speakers from Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which is nearly a quarter Latino, also has several thousand 
Laotian and Vietnamese residents, and a Cambodian community that has grown from 
a few hundred people two decades ago to an estimated 45,000 today, the largest 
concentration outside Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the newcomers once lived in rural villages where doctors were scarce. 
In America, many of the first-generation residents live in tightly knit 
enclaves, often isolated culturally from the English-speaking world around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 They shop at corner groceries that carry familiar spices and ointments. They 
pray at churches or temples just steps from their front doors. And they cling 
to Old World beliefs, among them the view that hospitals are places where the 
sick go to die, according to doctors and health educators in both communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals are very cold, very impersonal -- a foreign establishment to 
individuals who didn't grow up with this kind of system," said Abel Martinez, 
health education coordinator for the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services. "They carry a negative connotation -- a lot of pain, grief and 
torment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodians, in particular, are reluctant to seek conventional care for fear 
they will die or lose part of their soul during surgery. And they are 
frightened of having blood drawn, believing the fluid is an irreplaceable life 
force, say Cambodian health counselors and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also object to routine examinations of the head, a sacred part of the 
body thought to contain an individual's primary soul and an area not to be 
disturbed, the health counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Many older residents in Long Beach who survived the bloody purges of the Khmer 
Rouge in the 1970s continue to suffer from war trauma and suspect they will be 
poisoned by doctors, said a respected Buddhist monk who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people refuse to see a doctor or go to the hospital, (and) they come to 
see me for a blessing," the monk said. "The patient is paranoid. They suspect 
that someone spies on them and has poisoned their food. Some people still think 
the Khmer Rouge are sending soldiers over to Long Beach to kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 Song Tan, a Cambodian pediatrician at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach, 
frequently encounters reluctant patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Tan said he pleaded with the father of a 5-year-old boy who 
needed surgery to correct a congenital eye problem. But the doctor failed to 
persuade the father, who instead said he would take his son to a Kru Khmer for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like throwing water on a duck. Nothing got into him," Tan said of his 
conversations with the father. "He distrusts the system so much. I explained 
that the mortality rate is virtually nothing for this operation, but he doesn't 
believe anything we say. He's afraid his son won't make it through. Time is 
running out. In one or two years, the boy will lose his sight in one eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all newcomers are so resistant. Some see the benefits of modern medicine 
and rely on a mixture of medications and Old World elixirs for their ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Guadalupe of Compton treats her diabetes with a combination of 
Glyburide, a drug prescribed by her doctor to maintain blood sugar levels, and 
herbs grown outside her home, including cactus paddles picked from a plant in 
her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Sliced and fried, the cactus has the consistency of green beans and is said to 
help combat diabetes because of its high water content. Guadalupe eats the 
slices in salads and with tacos and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a day, Guadalupe also drinks a tea made from avocado and 
eucalyptus leaves picked from potted plants outside her front door. The mixture 
helps cleanse her kidneys, which she said swell and ache from the Glyburide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use these herbs and teas because this is what my family used and what was 
taught to me," said Guadalupe, 54, a masagista, or therapeutic masseuse who 
treats family and friends for mild problems such as indigestion. "It's pure, 
and it works for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe also prays for good health. Like her, many residents from rural 
settings often believe that physical illness can be caused by spiritual 
imbalances. The solution often lies in heavenly devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Chhor Sok Lorn's arthritis or backaches return, she prays to her 
ancestors beneath a makeshift altar in her living room that includes thin 
sticks of incense, fruit and a black-and-white photograph of her father. 
</P>
<P>
 On holidays, such as the Cambodian new year in April, she prepares a favorite 
meal of her parents -- usually roast duck, stuffed chicken and rice -- and 
offers the food to their spirits. Lorn believes that her ancestors, if honored 
sufficiently, will protect her. 
</P>
<P>
 When Martha, a resident of South Gate, is troubled, she seeks a limpia, or 
spiritual cleansing, from a spiritualist at a nearby botanica. On one recent 
evening inside the shop, Martha, who did not want to be further identified, 
held a crucifix close to her heart. The spiritualist held Martha by the arm and 
chanted blessings in Spanish while holding a leafy twig over her head. White 
smoke from a silver bowl of incense billowed over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha has repeated the limpia several times in recent years and says the 
ritual has helped drive evil from her life. She believes the spiritualist has 
succeeded in breaking a spell that someone had cast on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I solved my problems," said Martha, 45, who sought help originally because 
she was fighting with her husband. "I was always angry, crying, depressed. I 
couldn't go out of the house. Now I have a better relationship with my husband. 
I feel very good." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop Martha visits, Botanica Andio de Oro in Bell, offers a variety of 
religious articles to help the sick and the lovelorn. 
</P>
<P>
 An entire wall is filled with brightly colored candles that feature pictures 
of saints said to protect against enemies and death. Oils to attract love or 
bring success in business are displayed in a cabinet across from a tiered altar 
with icons of saints, the Virgin Mary and Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spiritualist Cleofe Montesino, like many Latino folk healers, employs a 
mixture of Christian rites and ancient Indian folklore. On Fridays, Latino men 
and women crowd into the shop's white pews and sit silently in sweltering heat, 
waiting for Montesino to bless them or remove evil spells from their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors can cure (what) happens to the body, but they can't cure anything 
that happens to the soul," said Montesino, 52. "Prayer is the only thing that 
will soothe the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Health educators say that such folk remedies probably offer relief for minor 
problems, if only because people believe so strongly in their curative powers. 
But the experts criticize some practices as dangerous and even deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially lethal black-market drugs smuggled from Mexico and countries in 
Asia are readily available at swap meets, markets and other stores in Southeast 
L.A. communities, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 These "tailgate" or "swap meet" medications, as the authorities refer to them, 
expose people to unregulated contents and dosages, said Martinez of the health 
services department. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is prominent in Latino neighborhoods because of the accessibility 
of antibiotics, penicillin and other medications produced across the Mexican 
border, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 One popular item is Azarcon, a bright orange powder that contains large 
amounts of lead and is given to Latino children for empacho , or indigestion. 
Another dangerous medicine is Polvo de Vibora Cascabel -- capsules of dried 
rattlesnake meat used to treat arthritis, infections, cancer and AIDS, but also 
known to cause salmonella poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know what they are taking," said Dorothy Matthews, a supervising 
investigator with the state Department of Health Services' food and drug 
branch. "There are no warnings, no adequate directions for use. Children might 
be allergic to a drug like penicillin without even knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Health experts contend that some of the healers step over the legal line and 
practice medicine -- diagnosing ailments, giving injections, prescribing 
medication. Occasionally, their misdeeds surface when a patient is rushed to 
the hospital or dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a San Fernando Valley man died after a curandera gave him 
an injection of penicillin to treat flu-like symptoms. Although the county 
coroner listed the official cause of death as a severe throat infection, 
authorities believe the curandera may have played a role by failing to 
correctly diagnose the man's grave condition. Authorities said the curandera 
fled to Mexico after the April incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also say rip-off artists are ready to con the unwary with remedies 
that offer little real value. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariana Villalta, 24, agrees. The Downey woman speaks from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Villalta sought a curandera's advice about her future with a 
married man she was seeing. The faith healer instructed Villalta to buy three 
roses, bathe with the petals and return them in three bags, each stuffed with 
$250 cash. The ritual would bring good luck, Villalta recalled the curandera 
telling her. 
</P>
<P>
 The healer also took Villalta shopping for a dress, perfume, a baby crib and a 
suit for her would-be groom. Villalta said she gave the woman the merchandise 
and never saw it again. The love affair eventually fizzled. Villalta, 
meanwhile, figures she spent more than $1,000, charged on credit cards she is 
still paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never go back with that lady," said Villalta, who continues to seek 
spiritual counseling at least twice a week from other curanderos in the 
Southeast area. "These days, I don't trust nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Villalta's vigilance failed to shield her from trouble earlier this 
year. A curandero working out of a motel room in Lakewood tried to take 
advantage of her while supposedly reading her fortune, she recalled. The man 
told Villalta that she was having problems with her latest boyfriend because 
she "didn't know how to have sexual relations," Villalta said. "He offered to 
teach me and asked for my phone number," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional healers in the Latino community admit their field is rife with 
impostors. The crooks sully the reputation of otherwise honest practitioners, 
some healers complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are curanderos who abuse people. They use the Lord's name to get rich," 
said Montesino, the spiritualist, who says she charges $10 for a consultation 
but also sees those who can't pay. "It doesn't matter if people have money. I 
can help them find the right path in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Montesino and others said that true healers recognize when they are unable to 
treat a serious illness. In those cases, they refer patients to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Keo, a Cambodian traditional healer, says that illnesses such as cancer 
are beyond his power because he lacks roots that are available only in 
Cambodia. Keo, who worked alongside Western doctors in a Thai refugee camp in 
the late 1970s, said he recommends that some patients see doctors. "If I can 
find the medicine, I give it to (my patients) right away," said Keo, 79. "But 
I'm very frustrated. I know when spirits stay in your inside so long, you can 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a complete arsenal of herbs, Keo keeps busy. Ardent believers 
visit him each month in his tiny back-yard cottage in central Long Beach. He is 
just one of many Kru Khmer throughout the city who quietly continue their 
centuries-old healing craft. 
</P>
<P>
 The healers stay active because of people such as Sophal Kong, the Long Beach 
man who seeks spiritual guidance when his children are ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Kong says, he sees his parents in his dreams. They are angry 
because he is not missing them enough. Soon after, one of his children will

"A couple of hours after praying," he says, "the fever goes away and my child 
can walk without using medicine."

NOTEBOOK / KIRBY LEE; 49ERS GET NEW OPPONENT FOR PYRAMID OPENER

 ESPN will be on hand to christen the Pyramid, the $19-million athletic 
facility at Cal State Long Beach, when the 49er basketball team opens the 
season Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette University will not. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Deane, who replaced Kevin O'Neill as coach at Marquette in April, failed 
to return the game contract with Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The oversight forced the 49ers to scramble to replace the Warriors with 
Detroit-Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Solytis, ESPN director of communications, said that the cable television 
network plans to honor its commitment to televise the 49er opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette Athletic Director Bill Cords confirmed the school received the 
contract, but denied any direct negotiations with Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marquette has not released its schedule, Cords said the Warriors 
already had scheduled too many road games. Despite revenue from a televised 
road game, Marquette officials said another home game would be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad about the whole situation," Cords said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg expressed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was poor taste," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Defensive lineman Brandon Whiting and linebacker Danjuan Magee of Long Beach 
Poly played for the South team in the 43rd annual Shrine All-Star Classic 
Saturday night at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 The North and South battled to a 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal-bound Whiting had four tackles, three assists and a sack. Magee, who 
is headed for UCLA, had four tackles and an assist.

SPORTS; QUICKLY BECOMING KING OF THE HILL; BASEBALL: EL RANCHO HIGH GRAD FLORES 
SETS SIGHTS ON 1996 OLYMPICS AFTER STANDOUT FRESHMAN SEASON AT USC.

 Randy Flores had a modest goal last summer when he decided to begin his 
college baseball career as a walk-on pitcher at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, a 5-foot-11, 151-pound left-hander from Pico Rivera, was determined to 
make the traveling squad at a school that has won a record 11 NCAA 
championships. A year later, with that goal and then some achieved, he has 
begun a bid to make the country's ultimate amateur traveling team -- the one 
that will participate in the 1996 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, 19, was one of six soon-to-be-sophomores who were invited to join the 
U.S. National Team, which is playing a 39-game schedule this summer in 
preparation for the World Championships Aug. 3-14 in Nicaragua. The six young 
players are expected to form the nucleus of the Olympic squad that will compete 
for the gold medal in Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting a chance to possibly play in the Olympics is something you imagine 
you would like do, but it's not something I can say I expected," Flores said by 
phone from Team USA's training center in Millington, Tenn. "A lot is going to 
depend on how I do the next two seasons at USC and how I do next summer. It's 
an incredible opportunity for me, so I'm just going to try and take advantage 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If his first season at USC is any indication, Flores is likely to make the 
most of his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores arrived at USC otherwise unheralded after going 8-3 with a 1.12 
earned-run average during his senior year at El Rancho High. The numbers were 
good, but no one was expecting him to step right into the Trojans' starting 
rotation, let alone become of one of the nation's top pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, however, demonstrated uncanny control and poise and quickly 
established himself as the team's ace. He went on to have the best season ever 
by a USC freshman pitcher, finishing 11-1 with a 1.66 ERA with 26 walks and 63 
strikeouts in 103 innings. He was selected All-Pacific 10 Conference by the 
leagues coaches and was named Freshman All-American by several national 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the Trojans were eliminated by Louisiana State in the final of 
the South Regional at Baton Rouge, La., Flores reported to Millington for Team 
USA tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timing has a lot to do with the opportunities that you get," Flores said. "I 
was a freshman who had a good season and, of course, I'm left-handed. That is 
always a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores entered the week with a 1-0 record and 3.42 ERA in eight appearances 
for a U.S. National Team that was 17-7 and 12-0 at home. Flores had walked nine 
and struck out 13 in 23 2/3 innings. His best game came against Chinese-Taipei, 
when he gave up one run and six hits in seven innings to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing about pitching here and pitching in college is that different 
countries have different approaches," Flores said. "Japan has a lot of slap 
hitters -- all they want to do is punch the ball somewhere. You can't throw as 
much breaking stuff because that's all they see at home and they're used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Koreans just take their hacks. Every team is different so you have to be 
ready to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been pitching competitively since January and traveling 
extensively this summer with Team USA, Flores expects to take only a few weeks 
off after the world championships before beginning preparations for his 
sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were starting every fifth day, I'd think more about taking time off," 
Flores said. "We do enough to stay sharp, but not enough to really get tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through my experiences here, I realized that I have a lot of things to work 
on before the season starts at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores is hopeful of leading USC to Omaha for its first College World Series 
berth since 1978. He is one of several veteran players the Trojans will have 
back next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The questions always revolve around how the new recruits are going to do," 
Flores said. "But there's a lot of reasons to be excited about how we'll do 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm not going to have to really fight for a spot, but you're still out 
there to prove that last year wasn't a fluke, that there is no sophomore jinx. 
There are a lot of things I've learned and improved on this summer, and I think 
it's going to help me have another good year."
