BEYOND WEAPONS, THE WILL TO FIGHT; U.S. SUPPORT FOR SOUTH KOREA MUST BE 
UNAMBIGUOUS IN THE FACE OF PYONGYANG'S THREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Patriot missiles are arriving in South Korea. Other overdue improvements 
in the defensive capabilities of both American and South Korean forces are also 
under way, all in support of what Defense Secretary William J. Perry calls 
Washington's top priority of boosting military readiness in the face of North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program and threatening words. 
</P>
<P>
 The key purpose of this still relatively modest buildup is to dissuade the 
unpredictable Stalinist regime in Pyongyang from military adventurism based on 
miscalculation. But more than a simple augmentation of defensive weapons will 
be needed for that effort at deterrence to be effective. What's essential is 
that Kim Il Sung and his colleagues believe U.S. warnings that it will fight if 
aggression against South Korea recurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubts lately cast on Washington's will to act where military risk is 
involved -- in Haiti and Bosnia, most visibly -- have hurt American 
credibility. What has to be made unmistakably clear and believable now is that 
South Korea, whose independence the United States helped maintain more than 40 
years ago in a bitter and costly war, is not an area of peripheral interest but 
a major security concern. The United States is treaty-bound to defend it, and 
there must be no ambiguity about its resolve to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 No effort should be spared to give the 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea the 
best equipment and support available. But should it come to a North Korean 
invasion, the burden of fighting would fall most heavily on South Korea's 
650,000-man army. For some years Washington has been pressing for improvements 
in that force. Perry, on his current trip to South Korea, says he wants to 
review just what progress has been made. Meanwhile Kim, in an interview for his 
82nd birthday, has tried to pooh-pooh suspicions that he is building nuclear 
weapons. The easiest way to give credence to that assurance is, of course, by 
fully opening North Korea's nuclear facilities to international inspection. In 
the interim efforts to bolster South Korea's security should proceed at full 
speed.

A DEADLY MESSAGE IF SERBS ARE UNCHECKED; EUROPE, ASIAN SECURITY AT RISK; U.S. 
MUST SEIZE THE MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danger, in the post-Cold War era, is more likely to begin with an aroused 
nationalminority than with a hostile superpower. The message of an unchecked 
Serb victory in Bosnia-Herzegovina for any anxious minority in Europe or the 
former Soviet Union is: Kill before you are killed. It is security folly to 
stand by as Serb victory sends that message to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's abstention and the United Nation's de facto complicity in the Serb 
slaughter will do for collective European -- and even Central Asian security -- 
what police failure in the 1992 L.A. riots did for gun control. Russian 
neo-fascism will imitate Serbian neo-fascism in the Russian diaspora. 
Non-Russians, especially Muslims, may strike first rather than permit that to 
happen. Smaller struggles -- Slovaks against Hungarians, etc. -- would proceed 
by the same logic. Western Europe will try but fail to hold back a flood of 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than acquiesce as European collective security collapses, the Clinton 
Administration should bend every effort to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Administration should welcome Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
invitation to hold a summit conference with the United States and the European 
Union on the former Yugoslavia. Until just days ago, Russia was the Bosnian 
Serbs' protector. Now, Russia's own envoy recommends halting negotiations with 
them. The Administration should seize the moment and recommend that Bosnian 
Serb negotiations be suspended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, at the conference the Administration should seek Russian approval for 
a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia and for NATO air strikes aimed 
broadly at halting the Bosnian Serbs' aggression. In exchange, the 
Administration should, if necessary, agree to a face-saving lifting of the 
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. Lifting the sanctions would fuel the 
aggression less than lifting the embargo and engaging NATO would impede it. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the Administration should propose that the U.N. forces be evacuated 
from Bosnia lest they become hostages or targets in the aftermath of NATO air 
strikes and the lifting of the embargo. As Britain's Sir Michael Rose, 
commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, bitterly admitted on Monday, "the U.N. 
peacekeeping operation has been . . . blatantly used to cover the prosecution 
of the war by the Serbs." With the United Nations under direct Serb attack and 
on the verge of fleeing, the humanitarian argument for continued U.N. presence 
is eroding. Once no NATO member has U.N. troops on the ground, all may more 
easily agree to use air power freely. As soon as basic security is 
re-established, U.N. forces may return. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, the Administration should insist that the summit function as a 
historic peace conference, redrawing borders and addressing minority rights for 
all the former Yugoslav republics. If the independence claims of the Bosnian 
Serb Republic win a hearing, so should the parallel claims of ethnic Albanian 
separatists in Serbia's 90% Muslim province of Kosovo. But no mere redrawing of 
borders can yield either ethnic homogeneity or ethnic peace. There must also be 
the firm protection of minority rights. Serbian abuse of Albanians in Kosovo is 
chillingly documented in a just-released Human Rights Watch report, "Open 
Wounds: Human Rights Abuses in Kosovo." But clearly the Serbs dispersed in the 
Balkans also require protection. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO-Russian collaboration against aggression and on behalf of minority rights 
would send into the post-Cold War political world the very opposite of the 
kill-or-be-killed message that a Bosnian Serb victory would send. The Balkans 
War is not an isolated aberration but a small-scale model of large-scale 
security challenges to come. Taking it as that, the major powers can, if they 
choose, introduce themselves as well as the Serbs to a new world order.

THE FED DOES CALIFORNIA NO FAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is hard for a Californian to be enthusiastic about the Federal Reserve 
Board's decision to make the cost of borrowing money more expensive. This 
region's economy, mired so long, is finally showing signs of life. But the Fed, 
worrying more about the future ravages of inflation than economic problems 
here, raised to 3.75% the benchmark federal funds rate. That action had been 
expected, but not so soon. And while it may cool the national economy, in 
California the rate hike could feel more like a blast of Arctic air. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed calculates that a national recovery from the recent recession is well 
under way. Other economic indicators, it believes, are vigorous enough to 
overcome the dampening effect of making money more expensive by raising the 
floor on the cheapest money of all, the central banking system's money. The Fed 
believes that by cooling down the recovery now, post-recession inflation can be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Monetary prudence is a good thing, and no doubt the Fed acted only after 
taking various factors into account. Indeed, if the American recovery is as 
real as so many economic indicators suggest, at some point action would have to 
be taken to prevent inflation rates from reaching alarming levels, as they did 
in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But sound public policy depends not only on goals but on timing. And the Fed, 
having raised money rates two times already this year, may be stepping on the 
recovery -- at least in this region -- by tightening credit a third time. A 
Feb. 4 rate hike was the Fed's first in five years, and it moved it up again on 
March 22 -- less than a month ago. Perhaps Fed officials know or see something 
no one else does, but the March inflation figure for the consumer price index 
was less than 1%.  
</P>
<P>
 It's true that in other parts of the country the economy is really humming, 
but in California we are still trying to achieve liftoff. Fed officials quite 
rightly note that there is only one monetary system for all the United States, 
and argue that what is good for all of the country is good for each part of it. 
But in California defense cutbacks and the 1992 riots came on top of the 
recessionary slowdown, so this state will require a bit more tender loving care 
if it is to join the nation in full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very hard to see how this region -- where banking, financing and real 
estate are such crucial elements of the local economy -- will be helped by 
higher interest rates. It is also difficult to see how the United States will 
be able to enjoy a true economic recovery if California lags behind. This state 
is a large enough part of the total economic picture that it can become a dead 
weight, slowing everything else down. The Fed would have been better advised to 
wait before hiking rates yet again.

2 U.S. COPTERS DOWNED IN IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a former military officer, I find the shooting down of two American 
helicopters by U.S. fighters in Iraq outrageous (April 15). The pilots should 
be court-martialed for involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The excuse that the U.S. helicopters were similar to Iraqi helicopters does 
not wash. Warplanes from different nations are commonly similar. Since the 
helicopters presented no threat to anyone including the fighter aircraft, the 
fighter pilots should have taken every precaution to identify the helicopters 
before firing, including flying along side the helicopters. Obviously they did 
not. The pilots should have made efforts to force the helicopters to land 
before destroying them so that the passengers could escape rather than 
recklessly slaughtering them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other heads should fall too. Apparently, the helicopters had American flags 
painted on their sides but none painted on top where it could be seen by 
aircraft flying above. There was a breakdown in training and procedures 
throughout the command structure. The Airborne Warning and Control System 
aircraft failed to notify the fighter pilots but that alone was not the cause. 
When one part of the system fails, there are supposed to be other procedures 
available to correct the problem. Obviously there were not.

 * Friendly fire? We're a trigger-happy nation, that is our legacy and that is 
our curse. The shooting down of American helicopters by American fighter planes 
is a sad and tragic manifestation of that legacy. From a purely human point of 
view, what is really crazy about all this is that if Iraqi helicopters had been 
shot down, we would be rejoicing. Because they were our own we mourn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing it back home, should we be so surprised that our kids are shooting 
first and to hell with the questions later? Hey, that's the American way. John 
Wayne would be proud.

 * As a veteran, I am outraged by the "Friendly Fire" cartoon by Conrad (April 
15). The deaths of the 26 people were tragic enough without your paper showing 
extreme disrespect for the dead as well as for the others involved in this 
event. To imply that the fighter pilots would record the kills on the side of 
their aircraft is incomprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
 The military personnel you disparage are the same people that protect the 
nation and your First Amendment rights. You owe them a public apology.

</P>
<P>
 Is anyone surprised that our armed forces, operating under a commander in 
chief contemptuous of military strength, tradition, honor and values, have 
mistakenly dropped bombs that failed to detonate and tragically fired upon 
their own? Our honorable men and women deserve better.

'LAKE OF FIRE' LYRICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Bob Guccione Jr.'s article concerning the death of singer 
Kurt Cobain (Commentary, April 15): The lyrics attributed to Cobain as "a 
twisted version of his own eulogy" were in fact written by Curt Kirkwood of the 
Meat Puppets, whose song "Lake of Fire" Cobain performed with Kirkwood on the 
MTV "Unplugged" concert referred to in the article. Cobain's suicide is 
nonetheless tragic, but let's give credit where credit is due.

GATT TRADE PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Is anyone minding the store? It seems GATT is working to create a World 
Trade Organization. Imagine! A permanent bureaucracy that would have power over 
U.S. laws, yet be unaccountable, secretive and undemocratic.Under the WTO, 
panels of three unelected trade bureaucrats would hear challenges by other 
nations to U.S. laws. If a challenged U.S. law was found to violate its trade 
rules, the WTO could direct the United States to change the law or face 
automatic economic sanctions. This would put laws passed by Congress and state 
and local governments at risk to unelected, unaccountable trade bureaucrats. 
The process is closed to the press and public. Documents are kept secret and 
are not subject to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Trade Organization is wrong for a democracy like ours. Where are our 
representatives?

CHINESE DISSIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On April 1, Wei Jingsheng was rearrested by seven carloads of Chinese 
security agents for continuing to speak out about the need for democracy in 
China. Chinese officials advise that he is "living at home under surveillance," 
when, in fact, he is being held incommunicado at an unknown location. 
</P>
<P>
 After having served 14 1/2 years of a 15-year sentence, mostly in solitary 
confinement, for calling for true democracy in China, Wei was released last 
September and immediately resumed his advocacy of the necessity for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that it is essential that we as Americans defend Wei Jingsheng's right 
of free speech . . . and not solely because it is the bedrock of Western 
ideology. As Wei pointed out in his trial in October of 1979, Article 45 of the 
Chinese Constitution asserts that citizens "have the right to speak out freely, 
air their views fully." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights provides, "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression." 
As a founder and a member of its Security Council, China should certainly abide 
by its declarations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei Jingsheng's courage and commitment to a cause in which he fervently 
believes is an inspiration to people throughout the world. His battle against 
repression is one that affects us all. 
</P>
<P>
 If we believe in democracy and free speech, it is essential that each of usdo 
what we can to encourage our government to press for the release of Wei 
Jingsheng.

AQMD RULING IN TOXICS RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "AQMD Adopts Scaled-Back Pollution Rule," April 9: 
</P>
<P>
 In assessing the costs of environmental legislation, or for that matter any 
legislation that seeks to affect societal behavior, it seems to be a common 
error to ignore the action-forcing intent that underlies them. It would "cost" 
industry $10 million, or whatever, a year to meet certain emission mandates, 
but the benefits to society are not limited to actual reductions in pollution 
over the same time period as the economic expense.Ecological processes often 
work to their own time scale. But even more than this, there is another benefit 
which accrues to society. And that is innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 This points to another common error, that of blurring the distinction between 
technology and ingenuity. Technological solutions are bounded by scientific 
knowledge and by the economics of production. Human ingenuity is what, 
historically, has enabled us to push the boundaries of what is doable in the 
moment. It is when what needs doing, whether by choice or fiat, becomes 
undoable, that innovation happens. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that behind every worthwhile or good thing that has emerged from 
human society, somewhere in our past there lies a mandate. Norms do not 
magically appear. They emerge from the principles and rules of organizations 
and institutions. 
</P>
<P>

 * It is hard to believe that the AQMD and Los Angeles business can be so 
uncaring about the people they kill. To feel that it doesn't matter -- there 
will always be plenty to take their places -- is medieval, perhaps barbaric. 
This is the attitude we ascribe to the young kids running rampant on our 
streets these days.

 I'm happy to be leaving Los Angeles.

HAVE LATINOS MATURED POLITICALLY?; WHO CAN BEST REPRESENT ALL THE PEOPLE OF A 
DISTRICT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE COLOR OF A CANDIDATE'S SKIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADELA de la TORRE, Adela de la Torre is an economist at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few Angelenos outside of the 45th Assembly district in East L.A. had heard of 
Bill Mabie until a couple of months ago when Democratic Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco, now running for the state Senate, recommended Mabie for his Assembly 
seat. What should have passed as merely another political green light from one 
incumbent to his favorite son soon became an ugly brawl between those who deem 
the 45th District a "Chicano" seat and those who recognize ethnicity as only 
one variable in determining representation. Polanco said his endorsement of 
Mabie over other, Latino, candidates was due to Mabie's superior qualifications 
and his ability to best represent the district. But is Polanco's endorsement an 
honest appraisal? Or is he grandstanding in his state Senate bid? 
</P>
<P>
 As Polanco's district director for the past three years, Mabie has worked 
closely with the community. He has been involved in getting jobs for youth at 
the housing projects of Ramona Gardens and in revitalizing the Northeast Los 
Angeles Christmas parade. His success at this grass-roots level may very well 
come from his experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Central America, where 
he learned that greater social change can only occur when those in power listen 
to individual needs. Once this happens, an individual can garner the trust and 
commitment from the community to support needed change. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie has also gone beyond the 45th District in addressing major concerns of 
the Latino community with regard to both immigration and citizenship issues. He 
worked as Polanco's key adviser in developing the California Latino Legislative 
Caucus immigration policy. Mabie was also directly involved with bills that 
addressed the INS backlog of citizenship applications from legal permanent 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 So why are both Mabie and Polanco viewed as traitors by many Latino political 
brokers? First and foremost, there are still many Latinos who buy into a 
cultural nationalism that blinds them from issues of competency and character. 
In other words, they have internalized their own oppression to such a point 
that they have become racists toward non-Latinos.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, there are those who fail to recognize that even in so-called Chicano 
districts, there still is diversity. About two-thirds of the 45th District is 
Latino, for example, but only a little over 12% of the Latinos are registered 
to vote. The district is about 20% Asian American, 2.5% African American and 
the rest white. Thus, this "Chicano" district includes other segments of 
society whose needs must be met by whoever is elected to the Assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, many myopic Latino activists do not recognize that Latino elected 
officials are increasingly able to go beyond designated Latino districts to 
capture non-Latino districts as well as broader state offices. Assemblyman Joe 
Baca (D-San Bernardino) and Cruz Bustamante (D-Fresno) are embraced by the 
wider community because they are their districts' best representatives. 
Crossover votes will determine the outcome in both Polanco's race for the 24th 
state Senate district in Los Angeles and Sen. Art Torres' race for insurance 
commissioner. Many of these crossover Latino politicians are emerging as 
leaders of inter-ethnic coalition building. Their statements increasingly echo 
the move away from narrow, ethnicity-based politics. Thus Polanco is 
articulating the new boundaries of Latino politics in the state when he says 
that "the price of leadership is not knee-jerk responses simply based on skin 
color or ethnicity, rather now more than ever we need to define the content of 
a candidate's character and the qualities of the candidate." Latino districts 
are a beginning but not an end to Latino political empowerment.

 If Mabie replaces Polanco as representative of the 45th District, it will be a 
transition point for Latino districts that reflects the political maturation of 
this community. By unlocking our political borders to new people who represent 
our interests, we can relinquish the crudest measure of anyone's worth -- the 
color of their skin. We also can begin to participate in a broader political 
agenda that abandons reprisals for breaking ethnic ranks and celebrates 
individuals who share a common vision for social change.

BOND YIELDS EASE; DOW OFF 0.60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields retreated Tuesday from a sharp rise the day before, as 
the stock market struggled through a volatile session to close mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds were helped by new evidence of economic weakness and lessened anxiety 
about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields of the main, 30-year bond eased to 7.37% from Monday's 7.42%. The 
bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 17/32 point, or about 
$5.31 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average finished virtually flat at 3,619.82, off 0.60. It dipped 
below the 3,600-level before managing a comeback. However, declining issues 
outnumbered advancing ones about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big 
Board volume came to 323.75 million shares as of 4 p.m., up from 271.48 million 
shares Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond trading strategists saw a number of forces working in the bond market's 
favor on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department's report that the U.S. trade deficit ballooned to 
$9.71 billion in February, partly because of a surge in imports, raised some 
questions about the strength of the nationwide economy. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of economic forecasters indicated they would be revising downward 
their first-quarter growth assessments, which had generally been in the range 
of 4% to 3.5% or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is leakage out of the economy," Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at 
Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, said of the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market tends to rally on economic weakness because that implies less 
inflation, which preserves the value of fixed-income investments. Inflation 
makes those investments worth less over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the market also drew strength from falling commodity prices, 
another sign of low inflation. The Commodity Research Bureau index, a 
measurement of raw materials prices, dropped sharply on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, smaller stocks fared far worse. The Nasdaq composite index closed 
at an eight-month low that reflected selling of technology and medical issues. 
The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.60 to 712.85, its lowest close since Aug. 3, 
when it finished at 708.86. 
</P>
<P>
 Several broader market indicators ended lower or almost neutral. The New York 
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.33 to 245.37; Standard & Poor's 500 stock 
index edged up 0.08 to 442.54. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks sank to the depths of the session around the middle of the day, when 
selling intensified in the bond market. Buying picked up again in the stock 
market when the bond selloff subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany Corp., said the 
stock and bond markets seem convinced that the Federal Reserve will have to 
tighten credit policy another notch or so, to ward off inflation. But investors 
also fear that in the process, the Fed will choke off economic expansion and 
thereby curb corporate earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 With these concerns in mind, prices of economically sensitive stocks slumped 
and weighed down the overall market. The cyclicals had benefited from improving 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler failed to surprise Wall Street with its record results, and its 
stock tumbled 2 3/8 to 48 1/2. Other auto stocks also declined. General Motors 
dropped 1 5/8 to 55 1/4; Ford skidded 1 1/2 to 56 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor giant Intel reported strong earnings, but analysts voiced 
caution over its weakening profit margins. The stock fell 1 to 57 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among utilities, Houston Industries rose 3/4 to 35 7/8 and Peco Energy was 
up 1/4 to 27 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 With the corporate earnings season in full swing, stocks reflected reaction to 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris rose 1 3/4 to 51 7/8 after reporting first-quarter earnings 
that beat analysts' expectations. Philip Morris kept the Dow Jones industrial 
average from having a larger deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft rallied 5 1/8 to 88 1/8. Its quarterly earnings were better than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * GTE gained 1 1/2 to 31 5/8 after it posted sharply higher first-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health care stocks were hurt by anticipation about industrywide reforms. 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell made remarks on cost containment in a 
speech to the Independent Insurance Agents of America. U.S. Healthcare tumbled 
3 to 43 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merck fell 3/8 to 28 3/8 even though is posted sharply higher earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in stocks overseas reflected the slump Wall Street suffered Monday. 
Mexico City's Bolsa index plunged 72.85 points, or 3.41%, to 2,064.77, its 
lowest close this year, on expectations of further increases in already high 
interest rates. The 36-share index finished lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended down 85.02 points at 20,192.34. In 
Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average closed down 56.36 points to 2,172.42, while 
London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 10.2 points to 3,128.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's key Hang Seng index sank 202.93 points, or 2.13%, to close at 
9,303.91. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell against major foreign currencies for the second day, as 
markets reacted to the short-term interest rate increase imposed a day earlier 
by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices fell on the New York Comex to $371.50 an ounce, down $5.30. 
Silver closed at $5.206 an ounce, down 5.4 cents.

 Desktop Security: For all its ability to perform "smart" tasks, in one respect 
a computer is no different from a refrigerator or a television set: Anyone can 
use it when you're not around, with or without authorization. But what if your 
computer could tell who was sitting in front of it and block an intruder by 
refusing to turn on? 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers at Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group are working with some 
of the same software technologies that guide smart missiles to bring 
object-recognition capability to the desktop. Equipped with this special 
software, the computer would, in effect, "acquire a target" when you or someone 
else entered your office. Based on pattern-matching, it would decide whether 
the person was friend or foe. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

BOOK REVIEW / SHORT STORIES; TRAVAILS OF THE WEALTHY ENLIVEN TAWDRY TALES OF A 
STALE UPPER CRUST; TALES OF YESTERYEAR BY LOUIS AUCHINCLOSS ; HOUGHTON MIFFLIN, 
$21.95, 230 PAGES

<P>
 Louis Auchincloss is an ornament of American letters, an authentic patrician 
who has distinguished himself both as an attorney and as an author of novels, 
biographies and short stories for more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tales of Yesteryear," the author's 48th book, is vintage stuff, a collection 
of short stories about the hard bumps in the lives of the old-fashioned 
American aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At moments, the book comes across as a kind of subdued soap opera as 
Auchincloss gives us sex, scandal and suicide among the upper crust -- but the 
stories are invariably rendered in the refined, elegant, unfailingly tasteful 
prose for which Auchincloss is noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tales of Yesteryear" is populated with men and women whose names appear in 
the social register, whose standing is calculated not only by their net worth 
but also by the clubs to which they belong, and whose language is decorated 
with Latin and French phrases. They may face the same slings and arrows as the 
hoi polloi, but somehow they see it all so differently when they know that a 
trust-fund check is in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, when a 42-year-old magnate seeks refuge in a nervous breakdown after he 
is discovered making lewd telephone calls to "the debutantes of the season," he 
frets about how his kids will be treated at their private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Hughie Junior and Lisa! Will they be able to bear the sneers, hidden or 
open, at Buckley and Chapin?" Hugh Hammersly muses. "Thank god for my money, 
which can seal all my doors and provide me with private guards if it comes to 
that. Oh horror. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the pitiable rich folk in "Tales of Yesteryear" are forced to 
confront problems entirely unique to their stations in life. The pathetic 
millionaire in "The Renwick Steles" is all beat up because his wife is even 
richer than he is -- and when, at her suggestion, he collects a few rare Greek 
monuments, she still manages to one-up him by setting his collection in a 
garden that makes the stuff look downright shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what could you do, sir?" says Tim, described as the "faithful valet of 30 
years." "All the best ones were already in museums. . . . And certainly no 
Greek things anywhere have a finer setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Auchincloss -- or, at least, the characters he writes about -- always seem to 
approach life and love from odd angles. In "They That Have Power to Hurt," the 
story of a love affair between a minor art critic and a wealthy woman novelist 
who presides over an elite literary salon, what passes for intimacy is the fact 
that, "once admitted to her inner circle, one could relax and even indulge in 
an occasional bad pun." 
</P>
<P>
 And on the rare occasion when a man and a woman actually do it , there's still 
a highfalutin tone to the proceedings that masks a certain emotional numbness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas she may have made love to the remembered rhythms of 'Tristan,' " 
recalls the second-string art critic of his love affair with the lady novelist, 
"I enhanced my lust with images of a proud Roman dame submitting helplessly to 
the rape of a barbarian." 
</P>
<P>
 Something of the same cold-bloodedness is found in "The Man of Good Will," the 
first and longest of the eight stories collected in "Tales of Yesteryear." Seth 
Middleton, a retired New York attorney, visits his grandson at college to 
measure the seriousness of the young man's suicide threats; he ends up trying 
to persuade the troubled young man to do his duty in Vietnam -- a curious 
technique, I must say, to rally the spirits of a suicidal youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth, we are permitted to see, is curiously aloof, even slightly numb. He 
prefers his club to his Wall Street law office or to the rose garden at his 
place on Long Island because he finds himself "more in symbiotic relationship 
with the small portion of human society in which his lot had been cast." 
</P>
<P>
 He's a complacent Episcopalian who is "not ashamed to own that such faith as 
he had might not survive the least revision of the King James version." And 
he's an especially gracious sort of lawyer who insists that "the elegances of 
life were as little as possible to be neglected." 
</P>
<P>
 So the encounter between grandfather and grandson, which turns out to be an 
orgy of revelation in which the darkest family secrets are spilled in the most 
casual way, is somehow attenuated and hollow at the core. And when Middleton 
learns that his efforts were unavailing, and the grandson has taken his own 
life, the old bean is mildly bemused but not exactly grief-stricken: "There was 
a kind of macabre justice in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The characters in Auchincloss' stories are so preoccupied with good manners, 
good breeding and good form that I began to wonder if Auchincloss isn't 
engaging in an oblique form of satire, even a kind of self-satire. And yet, if 
Auchincloss is a satirist at all, he is so cool and even chilly that one can 
never sure if he isn't perfectly serious about the whole enterprise.  
</P>
<P>
 "All those silly gentlemanly standards of yours went out with gold stars and 
Little Lord Fauntleroy," says the doomed grandson in "The Man of Good Will," 
and I wondered if the same isn't true of the world that Auchincloss describes 
so intently and even lovingly in "Tales of Yesteryear."

THEATER REVIEW; 'MERLIN,' MINUS THE MAGIC; GERMAN PLAYWRIGHTS' LENGTHY TAKE ON 
ARTHURIAN TALES AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH MAKES MONTY PYTHON SEEM LIKE SERIOUS 
THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German playwright Tankred Dorst's epic about the Knights of the Round Table 
has been seeking an American premiere for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, "Merlin" has finally found a Camelot in California Repertory Company, 
thanks to director Ronald Allan-Lindblom and the Goethe Institut. During its 
mystifying six hours, "Merlin" casts a smell of disenchantment over Cal State 
Long Beach's Studio Theatre that pungently demonstrates why other American 
theaters avoided it like the Black Death. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it "Merlin the Merciless." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Puppets of the Square Table -- pretentious, preposterous and 
pathetic. Dorst and co-author Ursula Ehler's self-indulgent Clicheland makes 
Lerner and Loewe's musical "Camelot" seem like the cutting edge of 
post-modernism. By comparison, "Merlin" magically transforms "Monty Python and 
the Holy Grail" into serious art. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons, however, are odious and can't do justice to "Merlin." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Southern Californians should be grateful. The original version ran 9 
1/2 hours at the Dusseldorf Schauspielhaus. The Cal Rep interpretation only 
stretches audiences over its medieval rack for six hours, and can be endured in 
two parts over two nights, or in a single Saturday marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, Allan-Lindblom approached the 229-page script and its 265 roles 
with a child's innocence. Dorst's original title, "Merlin oder Das wuste Land" 
(Merlin; or, the Wasteland), implying that this must contain symbols from the 
Wagner school of Sturm und Drang. But what we see at Cal Rep is a bunch of boys 
playing knights, with occasional nods to contemporary theater. None of the 
provocative history lessons in the works of Dorst's contemporaries Heiner 
Muller or Peter Handke are in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than spectacle, Allan-Lindblom chose storybook minimalism. A metal 
scaffolding serves as the various castles. Lots of strobes and fog and music, 
but no knights in armor galloping on imaginary steeds, as in Ariane 
Mnouchkine's inventive Shakespearean histories for the Olympic Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 These knights wear black leather jackets as armor and sunglasses as helmets. 
But instead of behaving like a contemporary urban gang, the object of their 
obsession remains that elusive Holy Grail. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 An unseen storyteller narrates via loudspeakers, providing intrusive, 
irrelevant commentary, such as: "Merlin wrung his hands and groaned. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Merlin is potentially a fascinating guide for audiences, especially as 
realized by shaven-headed, intense Richard P. Gang, but he is gradually exiled 
offstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Born of a union between Satan and Woman (we witness the absurd birth, staged 
in the pit), Merlin defies his Dad's Faustian temptations. So our magician 
embarks on a Mission Impossible: Make humanity grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a problem: You gotta have a round table. Our sorcerer's apprentice 
becomes a kid named Arthur (an indefatigable Blake Steury). "This table has to 
be a representation of the world," the kid-King explains to a carpenter, "and 
it must seat over a hundred knights. No corners. No inferior seats." Alas, the 
carpenter can't deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 So Arthur marries a woman named Guinevere (Kimberly Seder as Valley Girl 
Queen). She accuses the King of wanting her only for her large round table. 
Guinevere stomps her foot and shouts, "I am not frigid! Exceptional people have 
exceptional feelings!" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, down by the queen's compost heap next to the moat (I'm not joking) 
pines a lovesick knight named Sir Lancelot (Armando Jose Duran, ridiculous in 
tight black jeans). What's a Queen gonna do? 
</P>
<P>
 The kicks in Part II come from watching Guinevere redecorate her new digs at 
Sir Lancelot's castle. Domestic bliss dissolves into acrimony when those 
petulant knights want revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come down and fight," a knight shouts at the light booth. Slow-motion 
sword fights proliferate, resembling Super Mario's struggles in a kid-vid 
dungeon. Satan triumphs, Merlin's bummed, and as for the audience caught in Cal 
Rep's headlights? 
</P>
<P>
 Prominently displayed in the theater's lobby are warning signs: "THERE WILL BE 
NO LATE SEATING AFTER 8:15." Want this reviewer's advice? Arrive at 8:16. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; A WELL-TUNED 'MUSIC MAN'; THE BREA CIVIC LIGHT OPERA DOES A 
PRETTY NICE JOB WITH THIS CHARMING WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Brea Civic Light Opera's version of River City, we've got, well, a 
little trouble. But not enough to indicate that the group can't do "The Music 
Man." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of civic light opera groups can't do it, but because they're civic light 
opera groups, they do it anyway. Meredith Willson's one brilliant success in 
the musical theater is that much of an institution, the CLO equivalent of "La 
Boheme" or "Rigoletto." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea folks do a fairly good job dusting off the almost 40-year-old 
institution, and there's never a sense in director Greg Hinrichsen's staging 
that this is an obligatory CLO assignment. It obviously is tough work for this 
company, but the show's timeless charm shows through. 
</P>
<P>
 That charm begins with Jack Stauffer as charismatic traveling con artist 
Harold Hill, the Music Man himself. Robert Preston may have owned the role, the 
way Yul Brynner owned the King of Siam, but Stauffer shrewdly makes no attempt 
to imitate Preston. Indeed, with Preston, there always was the shadow of deceit 
behind the wide smile; Stauffer injects the character with Midwestern nice-guy 
warmth. His anthem, "Seventy-Six Trombones," seems like a genuine call for the 
town to help fund an all-boys band. Stauffer's Harold is so nice that we almost 
forget that he's conning the town: Stauffer has conned us as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Cushing plays Marian, the spinster-in-training for whom Harold falls, as 
a tad older than she should be, but she compensates by brewing up real 
chemistry with Stauffer. They really bubble during such ultra-romantic tunes as 
"Till There Was You" and "Goodnight My Someone." Cushing stands as the best 
proof that Hill, con man or not, can bring out the best in people. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the main idea behind Willson's book, which actually celebrates 
salesmanship as an art right up there with lyric writing and composing -- 
Willson's other hats. If any musical amounts to a one-man creative band, this 
is it. Listen to the weaving of tune and lyric in a showstopper like "Marian 
the Librarian" (the word play begins with the title), or "Trouble," and you 
realize that Willson was not embarrassed to show off his genius. (It's still 
one of theater history's oddities, though, that he distilled the genius into 
this one hit.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea troupe is able to deal with the genius in fits and starts. The 
devilishly difficult all-rhythm, no-music opener "Rock Island" doesn't seem to 
faze Doug Goetz as salesman Charlie or the rest of his comrades. And as the 
blustery River City mayor, Dan Stroud immediately sets the right comedic tone 
for "Iowa Stubborn." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lee Martino's choreography appears so uncoordinated that dance 
numbers like "Shipoopi" seem like afterthoughts. The talent level among the 
dancers varies widely, starting with Tom O'Malley's Tommy and working down from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Set-wise, some key scenes are played in front of a grim, black curtain. 
Grimmer still is the under-miking of the actors and the over-amplification of 
musical director Douglas Austin's recorded orchestra -- a sure and fatal 
formula for wiping out some lovely, scintillating Willson lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the costumes (credited to the company) make the show a constant joy to 
watch. Harold in his resplendent yellow suit, handing Marian a bouquet of 
yellow flowers, is a particular joy to behold. Added joys include Beth Carey's 
deliciously bumbling mayor's wife, Rich Miller's jocular Marcellus and the 
finely tuned barbershop quartet, Drew McCreery, Radames Montes, Michael 
Eberhardt and Victor H. Hernandez. And there's the littlest joy of all: Adam 
Wylie as lisping Winthrop, making "Gary, Indiana" his own.

 Pearl Jam Tour Delayed: Pearl Jam will postpone its U.S. summer tour, in part 
because the suicide of fellow Seattle rocker Kurt Cobain "knocked the wind out 
of the band," the group's manager said Tuesday. The tour, which was scheduled 
to begin in July and was expected to be one of the summer's hottest tickets, 
could be delayed two months or more. Manager Kelly Curtis said the group also 
needed more time to work out details of an ambitious plan to ensure a maximum 
ticket price of $19.80 -- service fee included. Lead singer Eddie Vedder said 
in a separate interview that Cobain's death was the main reason for the delay. 
"I'm going to need some time to cope with what just happened," he said before 
an appearance last weekend on "Saturday Night Live," where Vedder displayed the 
letter K on his T-shirt and put his hand on his heart at the show's sign-off.

 Kids Stand by Michael: Allegations of child abuse apparently haven't harmed 
Michael Jackson's standing with a lot of kids. More than 75% of 100,000 8- to 
16-year-olds from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut picked Jackson as the 
celebrity who "cares for kids," citing reasons ranging from "he gives money to 
the children's foundations" to "he's a nice, caring person." Jackson will 
receive his Caring for Kids Award on April 28 at the second annual Children's 
Choice Awards in Manhattan. The awards are sponsored by Body Sculpt of New 
York, a nonprofit drug prevention program for at-risk youth. TELEVISION

 Taking Down the Shingle: After eight seasons and 15 Emmy Awards, "L.A. Law" 
will close its offices next month, NBC said Tuesday. The final original episode 
will air May 19 and will bring closure to the series, but no details were 
available on what turn the plot will take. "L.A. Law" won Emmys as TV's best 
drama series in 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991. Corbin Bernsen, who has starred 
throughout the run as attorney Arnie Becker, already is at work on a pilot for

 Kushnick Sues Over 'Late Shift': Helen Gorman Kushnick, Jay Leno's former 
longtime manager who was fired from her post as "The Tonight Show's" executive 
producer in late 1992, has sued Disney Book Publishing and New York Times 
reporter Bill Carter over her depiction in Carter's book "The Late Shift," 
which details the behind-the-scenes maneuverings between Leno and David 
Letterman to succeed Johnny Carson as late-night king. Kushnick seeks $30 
million for "damage to her reputation, shame, mortification and emotional 
distress," plus punitive damages. The suit charges that the book portrays 
Kushnick as "being mentally unfit and incompetent" and cites eight statements 
contained in the book that Kushnick claims are "false and defamatory." 
"Basically, (Kushnick) comes off very badly in the book, and most (depictions 
of her) are unequivocally, absolutely not true," Kushnick's attorney, Barry B. 
Langberg, said Tuesday. Langberg added that Carter interviewed Kushnick for the 
book, but "talked to her only about innocuous things" and "didn't give her a 
chance" to defend accusations against her. "The Late Shift" is scheduled to be 
made into a cable movie for HBO, which had no immediate comment.

 Menendez Movie Rates Third: Despite mostly pans from the critics, Fox 
Broadcasting's "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez 
Murders" pulled in enough viewers Monday night to make it the network's highest 
rated made-for-TV movie ever. The hastily produced film was watched in about 
9.6 million households, accounting for 17% of the total television audience, 
according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. But that wasn't 
enough to help Fox against the national competition, as the network finished 
third between 8-10 p.m., trailing CBS and NBC, which each drew nearly a million 
more viewing homes. "Honor Thy Father and Mother" did win its time slot in 
several markets, however, including Los Angeles, where it averaged about 23% of 
viewers, and New York City, San Francisco, Miami, Phoenix and Orlando.

MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; PACIFIC CHORALE GOES ON SENTIMENTAL FRENCH EXCURSION; THE 
PROGRAM SATURDAY WILL INCLUDE TWO OF THE DIRECTOR'S FAVORITES, FLORENT 
SCHMITT'S PSALM NO. 47 AND POULENC'S STABAT MATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Alexander's fascination with the music of Florent Schmitt dates back to 
his college days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discovered him when I was doing my doctoral studies in Illinois way back in 
the '60s," the Pacific Chorale's music director said in a phone interview 
Monday from his home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My major project was on the Berlioz Requiem. I found this guy and I thought, 
'This is just unbelievable music.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander will conduct Schmitt's Psalm No. 47, among works by other French 
composers, on the Pacific Chorale program Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander led the chorale in the West Coast premiere of the Schmitt Psalm ("O 
Clap Your Hands, All Ye People") in 1976, when the group was still giving 
concerts at the First Baptist Church of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paired it with the Mozart Requiem, but the audience went wild over the 
Schmitt," Alexander said. "We've had it requested more than any piece we've 
ever done. On our audience surveys, this piece continually comes up for a 
repeat." 
</P>
<P>
 But who is -- or, rather, was -- Schmitt? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to some of the orchestra players the other day, and they didn't 
know who he was either," Alexander said. "He's not performed a lot in this 
country, but in France, Florent Schmitt is considered one of their great, 
monumental composers." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitt was born in 1870 and died in 1958. He won the Prix de Rome in 1900 and 
wrote the Psalm when he was in Italy, fulfilling the resident obligations that 
go with the Rome prize. The piece premiered in Paris in 1904 and quickly 
established Schmitt's reputation as an important composer. "In France, it's 
still considered his monument, even though it's an early work," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schmitt was influenced a little bit by everybody," he continued. "He follows 
in the tradition of Faure and Debussy and Ravel, particularly Ravel, in his 
orchestration. But in the size and scope of the work -- the size of the forces 
-- he leans much more toward the way Mahler uses the orchestra. I don't know 
any work by Ravel that has everything going at the same time that the chorale 
is singing." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that volume of sound, the work is "very difficult because of the 
extreme tessitura for the choir." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said the French program has been in the works for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided about two years ago that I wanted to do an all-French program," he 
said. "We don't hear enough French choral music in this country. In orchestral 
programming, French literature holds a firm place. But in choral literature, we 
tend to ignore French music, compared with German and English music." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? For starters, "the French language is definitely harder to get across, 
and also singers are less trained in singing French," Alexander said. "They're 
immaculately trained in Italian and German and Latin. But as soon as you go to 
French, you have serious rehearsal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "French doesn't look on the page the way it sounds," he explained. "Classical 
French singing makes huge changes from the way French is spoken : The way you 
deal with 'r,' for instance, in the singing of popular music, which uses the 
way you normally speak. Spoken French 'r's' are quite guttural. How do you 
create that sound when singing and holding the vowels? You change it to an 
Italian 'r.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Some other sounds simply don't relate well to the voice . . . so the singer 
does a lot of things to revise the language so that it sings well. There is 
always that language barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also will include Alexander's "favorite French work of all time: 
Poulenc's Stabat Mater. We've done his Gloria several times," he said. "It's 
fairly well known. But the Stabat Mater is seldom done, and to my mind, it's 
the superior work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stabat Mater was written in 1950, the Gloria in 1959. The Stabat Mater is 
"sometimes called the a cappella work because of the way Poulenc orchestrated 
it. It uses a large orchestra, triple woodwinds and so on, but the choir does a 
lot of a cappella work. There are very few moments when you have the full 
orchestral force going all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "With some works, you have balance problems with huge sounds of the orchestra 
against the choir. That doesn't happen in the Poulenc." 
</P>
<P>
 The work's "greatest asset," however, is "a beautiful melody," Alexander said. 
"That's why I chose (soprano) Benita Valente as the soloist, because she is 
able to spin a melody in a beautiful way, which is the first thing you go 
looking for in the soprano soloist." 
</P>
<P>
 Faure's "Cantique de Jean Racine" also has "a wonderful lyric melody for the 
soprano soloist. Faure's Requiem is probably his best known choral work," 
Alexander said, "but the 'Cantique de Jean Racine,' which is seldom done, is 
absolutely beautiful. We will be opening the program with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally written with organ accompaniment, the chorale will give a premiere 
of an orchestration made by USC professor James Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier Messiaen's "O Sacrum Continuum," the remaining work on the program, 
dates to "just before the Second World War. What you see in it is Messiaen's 
desire not to have any recurring rhythms," Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has continually changing rhythm. Every bar in the piece has a different 
rhythmic value. But it's an early work, very much in the style of Debussy and 
his tone colors and harmonic fabric. Altogether, there is tremendous variety on 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
 * John Alexander will conduct the Pacific Chorale in works by Faure, Poulenc, 
Messiaen and Florent Schmitt on Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Benita Valente will 
be the soprano soloist. $15 to $40. (714) 252-1234.

MUSIC REVIEW; REVERBERANT FARE FROM THE ARDITTI STRING QUARTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Atrium at the L.A. County Museum of Art, a three-story high 
chimney of a space, lined with hard, polished surfaces, would be a perilous 
venue for many musical situations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the natural reverberation enhanced an evening of sonic explorations when 
the Arditti String Quartet arrived here Monday for a performance sponsored by 
the Independent Composers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arditti -- violinists Irvine Arditti and David Alberman, violist Garth 
Knox and cellist Rohan de Saram -- is recognized as that other string quartet 
on the scene specializing in contemporary music. Unlike the Kronos, its art is 
of a more sit-down, upright variety, less involved with trendy variants or 
crossover dreaming than with serious investigations of sonorities within the 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
 If not easy listening, its latest concert here made for highly rewarding 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The opening work, Schnittke's "Kanon in Memoriam Igor Stravinsky," involves a 
haunting, spacious canon effect. Long tones, passed around the group, 
punctuated by silences, create tense, undulant chords that floated up into the 
space. Russian composer Sophia Gubaidulina's mystical String Quartet No. 2 
expands on a one-note theme, contrasting fully articulated pitches and the 
ghostly presence of harmonics or chromatic flitting around the droning tonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Further sonic experimentation came in the program closer, Gyorgy Ligeti's 
fascinating String Quartet No. 2. Signature Ligeti effects are plentiful here 
-- soft swarming clusters and jarring tumults, and, to finish, a fleeting 
wistfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 ICA composers Burt Goldstein and Donald B. Davis were well-represented, 
respectively, by the "Aspen Quartet" and "Bleeding Particles." Goldstein's work 
has an implied rhythmic drive, with arpeggios laid out at an angle to a grid, 
while Davis' piece "bled" by virtue of swelling, gliding notes mixed in with 
Bartokian thorny thickets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The concert's apex came with the L.A. premiere of Harrison Birtwistle's Three 
Movements, a vivid and impulsive canvas, full of erratic sonic brush strokes 
with their own private logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephemeral by nature, the piece gives the listener the impression of having 
landed in the midst of a heated -- yet fundamentally absurd -- discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arditti delivered, with rigor and beauty of a deep, unsentimental kind.

TV REVIEW; 'BILLBOARDS' SUFFERS IN ABRIDGED VERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Joffrey Ballet's four-choreographer Prince extravaganza, "Billboards," 
comes to PBS tonight. However, not one word in the "Dance in America" teaser, 
credits or press kit reveals that this plotless, full-evening 1993 rock ballet 
has been cut by more than a fourth to bring its running time under an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the opening ensemble ("Sometimes It Snows in April") by Laura Dean 
(other parts of her suite remain), along with Charles Moulton's "Thunder" 
segment, which boasts the only new music that Prince composed for the ballet. 
Gone, too: a reprise in the final, Peter Pucci section. 
</P>
<P>
 Taped in August at the SUNY Performing Arts Center in Purchase, N.Y., this is 
also a "Billboards" without billboards: The scenic units that give the ballet 
its title are missing except during the curtain-call footage. Joffrey sources 
explain that the billboards were used during the one live performance taped for 
the telecast -- but not in the rest of the weeklong shoot that took place on 
the same stage, without an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But if much of the telecast was shot without an audience, what are all the 
oohs and ahhs and bursts of applause we constantly hear? Special effects? 
</P>
<P>
 Director Derek Bailey likes moving his camera every few seconds, but hasn't a 
clue how to capture the emphasis on repetition and formal group patterns in 
Dean's choreography. Indeed, from the incoherence of the result, you'd guess 
he'd never seen her work before he shot it. 
</P>
<P>
 When, however, solos or duets dominate the stage, Bailey knows where to point 
his lens -- so throughout the Margo Sappington sequence, Tom Mossbrucker gets 
close-ups that Garbo might have envied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey dancers remain spirited and accomplished, but so many wrong 
choreographers were chosen for the project that this isn't exactly the 
company's finest hour. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who like "Billboards" and want to see it complete, the same 
performance is available without cuts on Warner-Reprise home video. And the 
Joffrey will be performing it during an engagement at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, June 28-July 3.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOPRANO PATZAKIS IN AMBASSADOR RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soprano Michele Patzakis appeared in recital Monday at Ambassador Auditorium 
in Pasadena and showed that she is reasonably fluent and about equally 
uninvolved and uninvolving in six languages, which, in addition to English, 
included French, Italian, German, Spanish and some splendidly idiomatic Greek. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of Spanish songs best suited her usually smooth, dark-toned vocalism, 
although the high-bouncing ornaments in Rodrigo's "De los alamos vengo, madre" 
demonstrated the cutting quality that readily crept into her voice in the 
heights, especially under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The cante hondo excursions at the end of Turina's "Tu pupila es azul," 
however, typified her general lack of expressivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarity and dramatic interpretation of text were regularly sacrificed to 
produce beauty of sound -- a haunting frailness she was capable of when she was 
not pushing. Unfortunately, this was not always a reliable thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She worked her way cautiously through four pieces by Mozart, including "Chi sa 
qual sia," offered a bland "Gretchen am Spinnrade" amid a group of four 
Schubert-Goethe lieder and missed most opportunities for wry characterization 
in three songs by Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Ballad of the King of Thule and Marguerite's "Air des Bijoux" from 
Gounod's "Faust" emerged drowsily, although the attractive, petite Patzakis 
sported sparkling earrings that wouldn't have been out of place in 
Mephistopheles' tempting casket of jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 What she did not sport was an effective trill. She sounded more persuasive in 
Ravel's Five Greek Folk Songs and two encores -- "One Kiss" from Romberg's "The 
New Moon" and "O mio babbino caro" from Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi." 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Alan Smith provided attentive but uninspiring accompaniment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; 
POLICE IDENTIFY MAN SLAIN NEAR DAM PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities on Monday identified a San Fernando man as the motorist who was 
fatally shot during a car chase last weekend near Hansen Dam Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Herrera, 23, died after a bullet struck him in the back of the head 
Sunday as he was driving eastbound on Foothill Boulevard near Osborne Street, 
Los Angeles Police Lt. Gary Hallden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives are searching for two men in a light blue Nissan pickup 
truck who fired several shots at Herrera as they drove behind his El Camino, 
Hallden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera lost control of his car, which rolled over once before hitting several 
parked cars, police said. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know what happened," said Hallden. "But as far as we know, it had 
nothing to do with (a confrontation) in the park or was gang-related. . . . We 
do know the vehicles had probably been following each other a long time before 
the shooting."

 Last winter, Lee Smith told his children to prepare for a summer of Disneyland 
and Knott's Berry Farm. The old man just might be working for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know how much the Angels were preparing to pay, but everyone in 
baseball knew they needed a bullpen closer. Besides, his former St. Louis 
manager, Whitey Herzog, was in charge, wasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 But guess who turned out to be the one former Cardinal Herzog had no interest 
in acquiring? 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, reminding the Angels of yet another painful mistake, preserved the 
Baltimore Orioles' 4-3 victory Tuesday at Camden Yards for his record-setting 
seventh save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, baseball's all-time saves leader with 408, reached the save total in 
the Orioles' first 12 games. It's the quickest anyone has saved seven games in 
history, surpassing Bruce Sutter's previous record of seven in the first 14 
games of 1980. He also is the first Oriole to pitch seven games in April, with 
10 days remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad guy to have in the bullpen, considering he is costing the Orioles 
only $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought with Whitey there, something might happen," Smith, 36, said. "He 
was the whole reason I was in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess for some strange reason, my age scared people off, including Whitey. 
He told me they were going with young guys, but I bet if he knew I was signing 
for $1.5 million, they would have signed me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get teed off for people wanting to save money." 
</P>
<P>
 The money was never the issue, said Herzog, who resigned in January as the 
Angels' general manager. He simply thought that Smith, despite saving 136 games 
the last three seasons, no longer would be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We checked him out," Herzog recently said, "but we only had him throwing 
about 82 m.p.h. on the (radar) guns at the end of last season. We just thought 
he lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith isn't sure what guns the Angels were using, or from whom Herzog received 
his recommendation, but he's proving he has not lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in the history of this game has been this proficient," Oriole Manager 
Johnny Oates said. "He's on course to do something no one else has ever 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to have to find a way to not kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was supposed to be given the day off, found himself in his third 
consecutive game when three Oriole relievers couldn't close out the Angels. He 
entered with one out in the ninth, Dwight Smith on first base, and Greg Myers 
batting. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, the last pinch-hitter on the bench, struck out. Damion Easley then kept 
the rally alive with a single to left that advanced Smith to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Curtis, who had never faced Smith, kept waiting for a fastball. He 
instead lunged at a 1-and-1 slider, and although the ball was hit well, it fell 
short of the warning track into center fielder Mike Devereaux's glove for the 
final out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a long way in from the bullpen," Smith said, "my legs are going to 
blow out before my arm. My arm feels great, it's just the rest of me that feels 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels are making no secret that they could use a stopper, it is 
their starting rotation that continues to cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Leftwich, projected to be a solid No. 3 starter in the rotation, 
struggled again Tuesday in front of family and friends from his hometown of 
Lynchburg, Va. He lasted four innings, yielding eight hits and four earned 
runs, and has an 0-2 record and 7.02 earned-run average in his first three 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not terribly distressed," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "But I am 
disappointed so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich was in trouble from the outset, only to be rescued by the defense. 
Soon, no one could help him. He yielded a run-scoring single to rookie Jeffrey 
Hammonds in the third inning, run-scoring doubles to Cal Ripken and Chris Sabo 
in the fourth, and failed to survive the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Relievers Bob Patterson and Bill Sampen kept the Angels close by pitching four 
shutout innings.

BUTLER'S CATCH GIVES DODGERS REASON TO SMILE; BASEBALL: BACK-HANDED GRAB 
PRESERVES AN 8-7 COMEBACK VICTORY OVER THE PHILLIES AS DREIFORT EARNS FIRST 
SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John Kruk wasn't sure what Darren Dreifort was throwing, but he kept swinging 
anyway. The Philadelphia Phillies were down, 8-7, Tuesday in the bottom of the 
ninth, with one out and runners on first and second, and Kruk didn't care how 
much Dreifort's ball was sinking and cutting and running. 
</P>
<P>
 He battled Dreifort to a 3-and-2 count, fouling off a number of pitches before 
Dreifort threw a sinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk hit it well, and as the ball headed for the gap between right and center 
field, Brett Butler took off running. Butler thought it might be out of the 
park, but a crosswind helped slow the ball and he made a back-handed catch that 
helped preserve the Dodgers' comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitch I hit didn't run quite as much, and I thought it was good enough to 
get in the gap, but then that little . . . ran it down," Kruk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the mound, Dreifort still had a batter to face, so pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski went out to settle his young pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Dreifort says to me, 'That was a hell of a catch, dude,' " Perranoski 
said. "I started laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort said, "It was nice of him to come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort had a 1-and-2 count on pinch-hitter Ricky Jordan, then struck him out 
to earn his first save. Todd Worrell (1-1), pitched a perfect eighth inning 
with the score tied to earn the victory.  
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good," Dreifort said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory had the entire team smiling, even Dreifort, who stays so even-keel 
that his teammates notice when he smiles. It was a nice way to end a dismal 
trip. The Dodgers won only three of eight and return with a 5-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't won a game like this all season, even though we have had a good 
shot at several," said Eric Karros, who went two for five and scored two runs. 
"This game kept you on the edge of your seat but we finished it, something we 
haven't been able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On a sunny afternoon at Veterans Stadium, the Dodgers finally put it together. 
Trailing by 7-3 and having arrived there in a most humiliating way, they scored 
four runs in the eighth inning to tie it, then went ahead in the ninth when 
Mitch Webster drove in Karros with a single to center against Doug Jones (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 But things had looked bleak in the sixth inning, when Milt Thompson lined 
Pedro Astacio's changeup into the right field bullpen for a three-run homer and 
a 6-2 Phillie lead. And what followed proved far more disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kevin Stocker had singled to center, Curt Schilling, the Phillies' 
starting pitcher, hit a soft liner that dropped in short right field barely 
inside the foul line. Raul Mondesi ran it down, gloved it and held it. By then 
Stocker was already at third. Instead of throwing to catcher Mike Piazza, 
Mondesi continued holding the ball, and Stocker scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have thrown the ball immediately to the catcher," Manager Tom 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all for Astacio, who has given up 13 runs in his last two starts. 
Gary Wayne, the goat in Monday's game, came in and got Len Dykstra on a 
groundout to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodgers came back in the eighth. They sent sent nine batters to the 
plate, went through three relievers and capitalized on an error, three walks, a 
wild pitch and two singles for four runs. Butler was the most impressive, 
wearing down David West with the bases loaded to walk in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied at 7-7 and only Dreifort, Chan Ho Park and Worrell 
available, Lasorda had Worrell pitch the eighth inning. He wanted a reliever 
available who could go three or four innings if the game remained tied and that 
meant Dreifort. Park is considered a starter and long reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 The first batter Dreifort faced, Kim Batiste, drove a single to right field, 
but when he got to first base, he told Karros he didn't know how he'd hit that 
pitch. "(Dreifort) has a lot of movement on that ball," Batiste said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort then got Dykstra on a close play at first, one Dreifort handled well 
for the putout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good stuff, from what I saw," Dykstra said.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Mickey Morandini hit a sharp grounder. Third baseman Tim Wallach dived 
for it, but Morandini beat the throw. 
</P>
<P>
 So with one out and the tying and winning runs on base, Kruk stepped to the 
plate and hit the ball to right center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Butler ran a mile to get there," Dreifort said. "I was smiling when Butler 
made that catch."

BLUE-CHIPPER HAS OPTIONS; NFL DRAFT: ALCORN LINEBACKER THIERRY IS AN ACADEMIC 
STANDOUT, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Louise Duckless, mother of linebacker John Thierry, has her own style of 
assessing the National Football League draft. Call it depth perception; it's as 
if she's viewing a neon light of hope at the end of a 1,200-mile tunnel. "It's 
like a dream," she said. "You struggle your life with the children and 
everything. It's like you made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Making it is hearing your son's name called among the first 10 in the first 
round Sunday, when draft notices go out at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan. 
Making it is being proud of your son's efforts and desire to succeed -- 
athletically and academically. 
</P>
<P>
 Thierry is a 6-foot-4, 250-pound linebacker from Alcorn State, a predominantly 
black school located in Lorman, Miss. (enrollment 3,100). By last December, he 
had mastered enough chemistry and biology classes during his career -- 
"Analytical Chemistry is the toughest one, with the lab work and everything," 
Thierry said -- to be accepted into the Ph.D. program in biochemistry at 
Indiana University in Bloomington. By the end of November, he had recorded 119 
tackles, including 81 solos, and nine quarterback sacks. He can tackle, blitz, 
cover and run. He can sprint the 40-yard dash in 4.45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Thierry is indeed a man on the move. Early this past week he was in Detroit 
for a workout with the Lions, then it was off to Dallas for a workout with the 
Cowboys, then a track meet (Thierry runs the 100 meters in 10.6 seconds) this 
past weekend in New Orleans. He's a man in demand, and doing his best 
impersonation of O.J. Simpson running in airports in those old Hertz 
commercials. Except, Thierry is carrying a cellular phone instead of an attache 
case. "Hey, a lot of people wanted to get in touch with me," Thierry said from 
an airport in Louisiana the other day, "so I figured I'd better get one." 
</P>
<P>
 Thierry will make the 1,200-mile trek from Lorman to Manhattan, waiting to see 
if the New England Patriots call his name with the No. 4 overall pick Sunday. 
It is known the Patriots covet Thierry. Coach Bill Parcells loves those big, 
strong, fast outside linebackers. But there is speculation the Patriots may opt 
to draft USC defensive end Willie McGinest instead, and the Cleveland Browns 
would take Thierry with the ninth pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Patriots college scouting director Charlie Armey won't say. "No offense," he 
said, "but we don't do draft stories. I won't talk to you about the draft and 
Bill Parcells won't either." What does Thierry say? "A lot of people are 
assuming I'll be taken by the Patriots. I'm just waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Thierry and his mother have waited a long time for this impending moment. She 
was unmarried when she became pregnant with Thierry at age 19 in Opelousas, La. 
Times were often difficult. But if there is a message in this story for young 
people, it is that no matter how bad the struggles are as a youth and a family, 
hard work and hope can make the future better. 
</P>
<P>
 Thierry's mother had to work two or three jobs to survive. Nothing was 
plentiful -- even food. "Sometimes when I couldn't buy anything else," she 
said, "I fed him oatmeal three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
 But they survived together through resourcefulness and prayer. "We would kneel 
and pray together when I was a kid," said Thierry. When he went off to college, 
his mother gave him a Bible. Psalms are his preference. "I read them daily," he 
said. "My favorites are the 23rd, 51st and 91st." 
</P>
<P>
 Thierry also subscribes to the theory of search and destroy. "I enjoy it," he 
said. "I enjoy hitting people. You have action on every down at linebacker. 
It's about getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers pick 15th, so they have nothing to lose by talking 
about Thierry, who will be selected by the time they pick. Said their college 
scouting director Vinny Cerrato: "I think he's a good athlete. He's got great 
closing ability on the quarterback. He's got great speed. He's a raw talent, 
but he's got all the ability that you see in great players." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, he is as Lawrence Taylor-like as one can get. At Alcorn, Thierry 
played outside linebacker, inside linebacker and down lineman. He credits track 
with helping his versatility on the football field, as Thierry competes in the 
100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, discus, javelin, shot put, 4x100-meter relay 
and 4x400-meter relay. Maybe he should have been a decathlete. Thierry says, "I 
can't pole vault, though, but I am a lifeguard." 
</P>
<P>
 On the gridiron, he covered running backs out of the backfield and even fleet 
wide receivers, such as Gary "The Flea" Harrell of Howard University. Which is 
a very strange sight considering Harrell, who runs a 4.39 40, is 5-6 and 165 
pounds. "He's a freak of nature, I guess," the Flea said. "He's fast for his 
size, he's a great athlete, has great movement and he's physical." 
</P>
<P>
 If for some unforeseen reason, Thierry doesn't make it in the NFL, he can 
switch to the other segments of his personal triple option. He can attend 
graduate school at Indiana or work for chemical or pharmaceutical companies, 
which have offered him jobs. "I want to get my Ph.D. one day," Thierry said. 
"And I want to do research or teach." 
</P>
<P>
 But put that on hold for now. He wants to get on the top-hits list first.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; PITTSBURGH SCORES EARLY, HOLDS ON FOR 2-1 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Pittsburgh Penguins have the script down pat. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the playoff opener for the seventh time in their last 11 series, 
the Penguins on Tuesday night improved to 8-0 on home ice in Game 2 of a 
playoff series, edging the Washington Capitals, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 That tied their Eastern Conference quarterfinals series, 1-1. Game 3 will be 
held Thursday night in Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux and Rick Tocchet each scored in the first period and the 
Penguins rode Tom Barrasso's goaltending to victory as he stopped 34 of 35 
shots. Pittsburgh won despite managing only four shots on goal in the final two 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we continue to play at this level, we'll be out of the playoffs," Tocchet 
said. "We're trying to win games in the first period. You can't count on that, 
not the way they're playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Michal Pivonka scored Washington's lone goal 57 seconds into the second period 
on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Buffalo 1 -- Sometimes the only way to beat the NHL's best 
goaltender is to have a little luck, which is exactly what Scott Stevens and 
the Devils had against Dominik Hasek and the Sabres at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens' power-play goal with 6:21 to play on a shot deflected by Buffalo's 
Yuri Khmylev, who also had a hand in the Devils' first goal, proved the 
difference as the Devils won another defensive struggle against the Sabres to 
tie their best-of-seven series, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you need a fluky goal," Stevens said. "I don't think it's going to 
be a pretty goal because these goalies see the puck so well. They showed it 
during the season and they are showing it again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Conference quarterfinal moves to Buffalo for games Thursday and 
Saturday before returning to New Jersey for Game 5 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Mogilny scored for Buffalo early in the third period. Hasek had 30 
saves, Brodeur 23.

LATEST LOSS BY LAKERS A PAINFUL REMINDER; PRO BASKETBALL: BITTER REALITY OF 
MISSING PLAYOFFS BECOMES CLEAR AFTER 105-98 SETBACK AGAINST NUGGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The season ends for the Lakers in three more games. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1975-76, they are not going to the playoffs, ending 
the longest active string of appearances in the league and the third-longest in 
NBA history. After this weekend, they are done, meaning these last few outings 
-- including Tuesday night's 105-98 loss to the Denver Nuggets at McNichols 
Arena -- have been a cool down instead of the usual warmup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weird," Vlade Divac said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really weird," Coach Magic Johnson seconded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a damn shame," Kurt Rambis said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only the third time the Lakers have failed to make the playoffs since 
moving to Los Angeles in 1960. James Worthy is nearing the end of his 12th 
season and this is his first experience as a have-not. Likewise for Johnson, 
who arrived in 1979, and other Laker lifers like Divac, Elden Campbell and Tony 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual," Worthy said. "There's not a lot to say. It's something 
I'm not accustomed to, playing 82 games and not making the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "I know it's weird to everybody -- us and the NBA. The other 
teams, you know they love it. This is their payback for all those years. But it 
hurts. It hurts the league. People won't say it, but it hurts not having both 
the Lakers and Boston in it. That's so many of the fans across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, we're used to doing it. We're used to being there. Then one of 
the guys will see someone on TNT or whatever and say, 'Damn.' That's when it 
will really sink in. Then and when the playoff check isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the team that beat them out for the eighth and final Western Conference 
playoff spot, the Lakers played without Nick Van Exel, who had the flu, and 
with Campbell and Divac in foul trouble and still were in contention in the 
fourth quarter. They were down only 99-97 before Divac went out because of a 
sprained ankle with 2:22 left after scoring a team-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure makes you feel good," Johnson said. "We had gone so far south since 
Denver beat us the last time . . . . I've been on them and on them tough. It's 
nice to compliment them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers called Divac's sprain moderate. Precautionary X-rays will be taken 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I broke my foot," he said. "But a couple of minutes later, it was 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers have lost seven in a row, their longest skid since Feb. 13-22, 
1992. . . . . Tony Smith might have been replaced Saturday as the starting 
shooting guard after being in the opening lineup the previous 10 games, but he 
didn't lose the job. The distinction is important because the switch in favor 
of Doug Christie came because the Lakers wanted to get Christie some playing 
time, not because Smith struggled. He lost the same job to Sedale Threatt under 
Randy Pfund because of poor shooting, but Smith, the team's best defensive 
guard, averaged 14.5 points and shot 52.1% in the 10 recent starts.

 Followers of cricket compared it to breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of 
scoring 100 points in an NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Lara of India completed a cricket world-record, single-innings score of 
375 on Monday, breaking by 10 a mark that had stood for 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lara needed a little longer than Chamberlain to complete his feat. He batted 
for 12 hours and 46 minutes over three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Mike Hargrove, manager of the Cleveland Indians, who as a player 
stepped out of the batter's box so often that he became known as "the Human 
Rain Delay," could approach that record.

 National past-its-time? According to a poll co-sponsored by ESPN and Chilton 
Research Service, no baseball players are among the nation's 10 most popular 
professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 10, in order: Joe Montana, Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman, Charles Barkley, 
Shaquille O'Neal, Scottie Pippen, Dan Marino, Wayne Gretzky, John Elway and 
Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken Jr. was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan was not included because when the poll was taken, he was 
retired from the NBA and hadn't started playing baseball.

 Bull stuff: Running back LeShon Johnson of Northern Illinois, son of a 
professional rodeo bull rider and a probable first-round NFL draft choice, told 
Sport magazine: "My dad's seen a lot of people ride, and he said I had the 
(proper) balance and the heart. Really, it's the heart. A lot of people don't 
have the heart or the head to think that they can ride. That's all it takes."

 A high pain threshold probably wouldn't hurt.

 Vintage whine: Wrote Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe, after Mario 
Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins had complained about life in the NHL and 
hinted at retirement: "We're talking drivel, plain and simple nonsense from one 
more spoiled professional athlete who believes he is bigger than the game that 
has made him filthy rich and, in the process, turned him into a spoiled, 
petulant brat.

 Quotebook: Shaquille O'Neal of the Orlando Magic, discounting his chances of 
winning the most-valuable-player award this season: "I think I'm like the Ross

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two more victories will give the Atlanta Hawks the best season in franchise 
history and the homecourt advantage through the Eastern Conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite scoring 13 points in the first quarter, Atlanta bounced back to defeat 
the New York Knicks, 87-84, Tuesday night behind Kevin Willis' 23 points and 17 
rebounds at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks are one game in front of Chicago and 1 1/2 ahead of the Knicks with 
five days left in the regular season. New York has three games remaining, the 
Bulls and Hawks two each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep our intensity going," Willis said of the Hawks' games at 
Miami and home against Orlando. "It's important to finish first, because you're 
always more comfortable in your home environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing had 24 points and 15 rebounds and Charles Oakley 21 points and 
12 rebounds for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 132, Detroit 104 -- Isiah Thomas, the Pistons' all-time leader in 
points, assists, steals and games played, suffered a torn Achilles' tendon in 
what was probably the last game of his 13-season career in the Pistons' loss to 
the Magic at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who is expected to retire after this season, limped off the court with 
1:37 left in the third quarter. After the game, Thomas said the injury would 
also keep him off of the U.S. team in the upcoming World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 90, Houston 80 -- Negele Knight scored 11 of his 15 points in the 
fourth quarter to help the Spurs clinch homecourt advantage in the first round 
of the playoffs with a victory over the Rockets at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson led the Spurs with 22 points, while Dennis Rodman had 11 points 
and 21 rebounds. Hakeem Olajuwon paced Houston with 25 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 122, Seattle 116 -- Charles Barkley took over the game in the final 
two minutes to lead the Suns to victory at Phoenix in the final regular-season 
meeting of the Pacific Division's two top teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, who finished with 20 points and 17 rebounds, grabbed five rebounds 
and scored three points in the final two minutes for the Suns, who also got 29 
points from Dan Majerle. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 115, Philadelphia 110 -- Derrick Coleman had a triple double with 
31 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists as the Nets won their fourth game in a 
row with a victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson added 19 points and 11 assists, and Kevin Edwards and Armon 
Gilliam each scored 16 for the Nets. Jeff Malone had 26 and Clarence 
Weatherspoon 24 for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 111, Washington 110 -- Reggie Miller scored 34 points, including a 
winning basket with 2.8 seconds left, as the Pacers defeated the Bullets at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 115, Sacramento 108 -- Karl Malone scored 30 points and Jeff Hornacek 
added 28 to lead the Jazz to a victory at Sacramento. Spud Webb scored 28 and 
Wayman Tisdale 23 for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 126, Minnesota 99 -- The Heat moved within one victory of clinching a 
playoff spot behind 32 points by Glen Rice in their victory over the 
Timberwolves at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 120, Milwaukee 112 -- Ed Pinckney had a career-high 22 rebounds and a 
season-high 21 points, Robert Parrish added 25 points and 15 rebounds to lead 
the Celtics at Boston.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a year when the Raiders and Rams should draft for need on the first 
round. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That means a running back for the Raiders and, oh, an offensive lineman, wide 
receiver, defensive back, linebacker or understudy quarterback for the Rams. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Heath Shuler of Tennessee and Trent Dilfer of Fresno State will be the first 
two quarterbacks taken, but the best competitor might be Glen Foley of Boston 
College. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most improved teams in the league should be the New England Patriots and 
the Arizona Cardinals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The question about Willie McGinest, the outside linebacker from USC whose 
draft stock has soared during the off-season, is whether he will play as well 
as he projects. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon, a youthful 37, might have three productive years with the 
Minnesota Vikings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If I'm a passer, I don't look forward to playing Green Bay and having Reggie 
White coming at me from one side and Sean Jones from the other. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Heisman Trophy winner, Gino Torretta of Miami, was drafted on the 
seventh round by the Vikings. The 1993 winner, Charlie Ward of Florida State, 
might last until the fourth round. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Rome can probably get away with calling the Rams' new starting quarterback 
"Chris.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Red outfielder Reggie Sanders' five-day suspension for charging 
Montreal Expos pitcher Pedro Martinez should be appealed. It was too short. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a New York Met uniform tonight at Dodger Stadium will be pitcher Bobby 
Jones, who was selected between the first and second rounds in 1991 with the 
draft choice the Mets obtained from the Dodgers as compensation for Darryl 
Strawberry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Hansen is in the wrong league. He would be a fine designated hitter. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Souped-up baseballs and lousy pitching are the two best explanations for the 
home run explosion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sid Fernandez's behind is to the American League what Steve Johnson's used to 
be to the NBA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Note to Channel 5: Isn't it about time to start listing Dodger batting 
averages for this season rather than what the player did against the opposing 
pitcher last season? . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: There won't be a stakes race opening day Wednesday at 
Hollywood Park, but the $100,000 A Gleam Handicap is carded on the first Friday 
night program April 29. . . . The Kentucky Derby is shaping up as East vs. 
West, Holy Bull against Brocco, on May 7, but the Kentucky Oaks a day earlier 
has the look of a Western showdown between unbeaten Lakeway and Sardula. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The 14th annual "Swim With Mike" at USC raised a record $150,000 for 
physically challenged athletes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former athletic director Dick Perry has formed the Inland Empire Trojan Club. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Caltech men's cross-country team led the NCAA Division III with a 3.78 
grade-point average. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John Wooden will be the keynote speaker at the Cal State Fullerton 
fund-raising program and auction "A Bid of Excitement" April 30. Titan Coach 
Brad Holland was the last player Wooden recruited at UCLA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is there a more improved player in the NBA than Don MacLean? . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe is booked for HBO bouts in June, July and August. . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sugar Ray Leonard, who used to own the title, agrees with those who call 
Pernell Whitaker the best fighter pound-for-pound, but describes James Toney as 
a "little Sonny Liston." . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Norris never proved himself," Leonard said. "Who did he ever beat?" 
Yes, he beat Leonard, but that was the washed-up version. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Leonard's old rival Roberto Duran is scheduled to fight Vinny Pazienza June 
25, nine days after Duran's 43rd birthday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If three Southwest Conference schools move to the WAC as expected, Houston 
would be a cinch to win the 1996 SWC football title. Of course, it would be the 
only school left. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Southern California does have a team in the playoffs -- the San Diego Gulls of 
the International Hockey League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Demers on Montreal Canadien goaltender Patrick Roy: "Without him, I'm 
a very average coach.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the New York teams play a fifth game at Madison Square Garden, I like the 
Rangers to beat the Islanders, 6-0. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 News item: Pittsburgh Penguins announce that some ticket prices will be cut 
next season. Reaction: The Kings should cut all ticket prices.

 The Fab Five was reduced to two Tuesday as Jalen Rose, following in the 
footsteps of Chris Webber and Juwan Howard, announced that he, too, will leave 
Michigan early to try the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Jimmy King and Ray Jackson from the talented freshman class 
recruited three years ago. Webber is finishing his rookie season with the 
Golden State Warriors, and Howard announced Monday he was turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fab Five went to the NCAA final game in 1992 before losing to Duke. In 
1993, the team played again for the national championship, but lost to North 
Carolina. This season, without Webber, the Wolverines lost to Arkansas in the 
Midwest Regional final.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GIBSON'S HOMERS POWER TIGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kirk Gibson places winning over everything, including friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson ended a one-for-15 slump with two three-run homers Tuesday, powering 
the Detroit Tigers past the Kansas City Royals, 9-5, at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gibson, who scored three runs, the multi-homer game was the 13th of his 
career and gave him a career-high six runs batted in. Both homers came off Mark 
Gubicza (0-1), who he became good friends with while the two were Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is supposed to be my friend," Gubicza said. "I made two mistakes to him, 
and he hit them both out. You are supposed to avoid three-run homers, and I 
gave up two of them. That doesn't help your team." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Moore (2-1) allowed five runs and four hits in 7 1/3 innings for the 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7, Minnesota 6 -- Sandy Alomar Jr. singled in two runs to cap a 
three-run ninth inning in the Indians' comeback victory at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland tied the game, 5-5, in the ninth off Rick Aguilera (0-1), who blew 
his first save in five tries. Jose Mesa (1-0) got one out in the eighth for the 
win with Steve Farr picking up the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Vizquel had three hits, and Carlos Baerga and Albert Belle homered for 
the Indians, who ended a three-game losing streak. Dave Winfield had four of 
Minnesota's 16 hits and Kirby Puckett extended his hitting streak to a 
major-league high 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 13, Texas 3 -- Carlos Delgado and Joe Carter hit three-run homers and 
the Blue Jays got a season-high 17 hits at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Molitor and Roberto Alomar each had three hits, and John Olerud, Ed 
Sprague, Carter and Delgado each had two for Toronto, averaging almost eight 
runs a game this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a frightening thing to have to face a lineup that's as strong as 
ours from spots one through seven," Molitor said. "Even with two outs, this 
team is capable of breaking out." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto won its third in a row as Delgado hit his league-leading eighth homer 
in the fourth inning, capping a five-run burst that gave the Blue Jays an 11-2 
edge. Juan Guzman allowed two runs to improve to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Milwaukee 2 -- Frank Thomas, Julio Franco and Ron Karkovice each 
homered during a five-run eighth inning to rally the White Sox at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere (2-0) allowed two runs and three hits in seven innings to win his 
ninth consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your job is to keep them close and get a quality start," said Bere, who 
struck out seven and walked four. "Two earned runs could win a ballgame, but I 
think with the offense we have, no team feels comfortable with only two runs 
against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bere, who won his last seven starts in 1993, has not lost since Aug. 8. Kirk 
McCaskill pitched the final two innings. Ricky Bones (2-1) lost his first game 
of the season for Milwaukee after entering the game undefeated with a American 
League-leading 0.52 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 13, Oakland 5 -- Mo Vaughn and Tim Naehring twice hit back-to-back home 
runs and Scott Cooper added a grand slam as the Red Sox defeated the Athletics 
at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox, who have beaten the A's seven consecutive times, hit six home 
runs, their most in a game since Aug. 12, 1981. Vaughn and Naehring hit 
consecutive solo homers in the second and sixth innings.  
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 7, New York 1 -- Jay Buhner hit two home runs, leading Greg Hibbard 
and the Mariners to their first road victory of the season over the Yankees at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Buhner's homers traveled 430 and 439 feet off Jim Abbott (1-2). Hibbard (1-1) 
won for the first time since leaving the Chicago Cubs last year and signing 
with the Mariners.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL REMAINS THE NO. 1 CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Even though Darren Dreifort's future is as a closer, Todd Worrell is the 
closer of the present, Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can use Dreifort on days we don't use Worrell," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said he isn't worried about putting a young pitcher into a tough 
situation in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like I used to say with Steve Howe, when I call down to the bullpen, I 
don't ask how old the pitcher is, I just ask if he can pitch," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, 21, earned his first save Tuesday. "He has good stuff," the 
Phillies' John Kruk said. "It moves and cuts and runs and everything else. I'd 
take him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Worrell: "He has such good composure and has such good stuff. He was in a 
tough spot out there today and he handled himself so well. He's going to make a 
good closer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Thompson, who hit a three-run homer against Pedro Astacio in the sixth, 
said a statistic on the stadium video board surprised him. "It said my seven 
home runs against the Dodgers were the most by a Phillie against them," 
Thompson said. "I didn't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a costly gaffe in Tuesday night's game, Jose Offerman was benched 
Wednesday. He was originally in the lineup, but Lasorda talked to Offerman and 
took him out. Offerman pinch-hit in the eighth inning and walked. Cory Snyder, 
the only backup for shortstop, started. 
</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields also had the day off, his second this trip. He is suffering 
from a weak thigh muscle that has hurt his ability to hit. Jeff Treadway 
started at second base. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields also entered the game during the Dodgers' eighth-inning rally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Len Dykstra, who has played in 174 of the Phillies' last 175 games, is batting 
only .207 through 14 games, with 13 runs scored, eight walks and one home run. 
But he got off to a slow start last season, when he finished second to Barry 
Bonds in the MVP voting. Once he got through April, though, he batted .296 in 
May, .337 in June and .374 in July. He ended the season batting .305 with 194 
hits, 19 home runs and 143 runs scored. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; EASLEY REPLACES CURTIS AT LEADOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels never bothered to ask Damion Easley if he wanted to move back to 
third base this winter, so the way he figures it, why should anyone solicit his 
viewpoint now? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned not to ask any questions," Easley said, "I just show up, make 
sure my name's in the lineup, and try not to be surprised by anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since he has been in the major leagues, Easley is being 
presented with a unique responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the Angels' new leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said Easley will bat leadoff and Chad Curtis will 
be dropped to second against left-handers, and sixth against most right-handed 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that it will stay this way permanently," Rodgers said, "but I 
have to experiment, too. They're all young players who don't have a track 
record. I'm trying to find out where we are the best offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damion can hit any place, and Chad hit second most of last year and had a 
good year (.285, 48 stolen bases, 94 runs). I thought that he felt leading off, 
his hands were tied." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rod Carew, hitting coach: "Damion is going to be more consistent. It's 
tough for him to get into any bad slumps. Chad, right now, is trying to hit 
every ball nine miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who was batting .149 until he was dropped from the leadoff spot on 
Saturday, says that he has no problems with the change. And for Easley, well, 
what's another challenge? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what my role is," Easley said, "so it's hard to get 
excited because I don't know how long this will last. I know I'll have to be 
more disciplined because the leadoff guy has to set the tone for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Damion Easley can hurt another team and help our team by either 
hitting, playing defense or running, and hopefully I can do that in at least 
one category every night." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Mike Butcher reluctantly went into the bullpen before the game 
to work on his pitching mechanics, and after his 25-minute workout, pronounced 
himself a new man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was teed off when I went down there," Butcher said, "because it wasn't like 
I've been pitching that bad (1-0, 9.82 ERA). I wasn't going to sit here and 
panic, and I didn't want everybody else to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after I was done today, I felt it was the best thing that happened to me 
all year. I feel 100 times better. I know now that I was pitching like a robot. 
I've got to quit over-analyzing everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the third season that Rodgers has gone without smoking, he said, 
adding that he no longer even craves a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 His secret? 
</P>
<P>
 He was hypnotized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a cigarette for two years, and I don't even think about it 
anymore," Rodgers said. "It cost me $100, and it probably saved me $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I've also gained 20 pounds in the process." BOB NIGHTENGALE

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: AFTER ALL THOSE SHARKS, IT WAS A BITE FOR SORE 
EYES

 For George Castro, catching shark after shark was getting to be a drag. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castro isn't complaining today. Having persisted in the shovel-nose shark 
infested waters off El Segundo, after catching four or five, Castro made one 
more drop to the bottom with a live sardine, and came away with a halibut the 
size of a skiff, a 40.6-pound fish that earned him top honors in last weekend's 
eighth annual Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit like a halibut, but as soon as I hooked it I thought it was just 
another shark," said Castro, 41, a warehouse manager from Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 After dragging Castro up and down the rail of his boat, the fish surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it was a halibut and I couldn't believe it," Castro said. "I knew it 
was the winner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's halibut was the second largest in tournament history, the largest 
being a 45.1-pound fish caught in 1989. That one set a world record for 
16-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's wasn't the only big halibut taken last weekend. This year's derby was 
one of the best, with almost 1,430 fishermen aboard 400 boats vying for the top 
prize of a fishing trip to Alaska or the East Cape region of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 Second place went to Geoffrey Baur of Lakewood with a 32.2-pound catch -- his 
first legal-sized halibut -- taken from 90 feet deep just south of the Marina 
del Rey Breakwater. Third place went to Norman Wike of Santa Monica with a 
29.2-pound catch off Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament chairman John Bourget said 109 halibut were weighed in on Saturday 
and 114 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we had 72 halibut 10 pounds or more and 19 over 20 pounds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's winner, Glenn Smith of Santa Monica, was shut out this year, but 
Bourget and his crew may have had something to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year he found out the name of my boat and followed it around because I 
had told him I knew all the spots," Bourget said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one spot, Smith pulled in a 32.9-pound derby-winning fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we had some fun with him," Bourget said. "We had two boats this 
year and we'd move one outside and the guys would say (on the radio), 'We got 
'em,' and Glenn would come out there and follow so tight, but there would be 
nothing." 
</P>

<P>
 The Eastern Sierra general trout season opener on April 30 is shaping up to be 
a good one, thanks to a variety of factors, chief among them the Department of 
Fish and Game's having stocked more trout than it would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have stocked three times as many trout as normal," said Chris Boone, 
manager of the DFG's Hot Creek Hatchery in Mammoth Lakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Trout were stocked early to help the financially strapped DFG save money on 
raising the fish in hatcheries.  
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen should also benefit from the light snowpack and the absence of ice 
on many waters that are normally frozen at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley Lake, the most popular reservoir on opening day, has been ice-free for 
weeks, and the fish are expected to be a little more active than they were last 
year when the water was so cold the fish refused to fight.

 The Celebrity Sports Invitational, a fishing tournament run by Ted Danson and 
Robin Leech, was held last weekend at Cabo San Lucas, with proceeds going to 
Amigos De Los Ninos, a Baja California charity, and the American Oceans 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament was won by Cheech Marin of Cheech and Chong fame, and according 
to a report from the Pisces Fleet, Marin shouted, "Dave's Not Here!" upon 
landing the winning, 150-pound striped marlin. It's a phrase only Cheech and 
Chong fans will understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Marlin fishing remains slow in the Cabo San Lucas area, but a 
448-pound blue marlin was landed after a two-hour fight Tuesday by an angler 
from France at outer Gordo Banks, according to Juan Arce of the Pisces Fleet. 
Most of the effort is at Gordo, where yellowfin tuna from 20-40 pounds are 
actively feeding. Arce said the panga skippers are putting customers on roving 
schools of roosterfish just off the beach from the Solmar Hotel to the 
lighthouse.  
</P>
<P>
 East Cape: Striped marlin are not far off shore, and tuna are scattered, but 
both species are showing regularly at the scales. Dorado fishing is fair.  
</P>
<P>
 Ensenada: Four boats from two fleets combined for 62 small white sea bass on 
Sunday along the shore near the university and San Miguel. The fish, mixed in 
with schools of barracuda, were taken on live sardines, according to Dan 
Hernandez, who was in the area preparing to film a series for his television 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 INSTRUCTION -- A few spots remain for Eagle Claw Fishing Schools' monthly 
session at San Martin Island, which gets under way Friday at 1 p.m. Last month, 
anglers aboard the Holiday landed 125 yellowtail in a fast-paced three-hour 
bite. "These fish are not moving anywhere," instructor Ron Kovach said. "We 
think it's a resident population that only moves deeper. We've found them to 
130 feet in 58-degree, green water." Cost for the 2 1/2-day trip is $325. 
Details: (714) 840-6555. . . . A half-day fly-fishing clinic for women only, 
offered by the Fly Fishers' Club of Orange County, will be held April 30 at 
William R. Mason Regional Park in Irvine. Morning and afternoon sessions are 
available. Instructor is Janice Jeng. Details: (714) 673-3310.

FISH REPORT: WHAT'S UP? DOCK WILL BE CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some might say the decision to close the Silverwood Lake dock to fishing is, 
well, a crappie one.Lake management says it is a necessary one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting 50-60 people, even on weekdays, fishing for crappie," marina 
supervisor Kevin Howard said. "People were tripping over each other and hooking 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 But the last straw, Howard said, was when a smoker carelessly flicked a 
lighted cigarette last Thursday, setting fire to the dock. "That's when 
management said, 'No more crappie fishing,' " Howard said. The dock will remain 
closed to fishing indefinitely.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CARDINALS END BRAVES' STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of play that Terry Pendleton usually makes. This time, he 
didn't -- and the St. Louis Cardinals took advantage to rally for three runs in 
the seventh inning and defeat the Atlanta Braves, 5-4, Tuesday night at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves lost for only the second time in 15 games this season and saw their 
six-game winning streak end. Greg Maddux (3-1) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cardinals trailing, 4-2, Luis Alicea opened the seventh with a single 
against Maddux. Erik Pappas then bounced a potential double-play grounder to 
Pendleton at third base, but it skidded under his glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Gerald Perry then drove in two runs with a double and Bernard 
Gilkey singled in the winning run for the Cardinals to give Allen Watson (2-0) 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 8, Pittsburgh 2 -- Roberto Kelly hit a three-run homer and Jose 
Rijo gave up only two hits in seven innings as the Reds won at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's homer against Blas Minor completed a four-run rally in the fourth 
inning and gave him eight hits in his last 12 at-bats. Kevin Mitchell had four 
hits and drove in two runs with a solo homer and a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 3, Chicago 0 -- Greg Swindell won his third consecutive start and the 
Astros hit three solo homers to keep the Cubs the only major league team 
without a victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Swindell (3-0), who retired the first 12 batters, extended his scoreless 
streak to 17 innings, giving up four hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, San Francisco 3 -- Moises Alou homered against Dave Burba in the 
ninth inning to lift the Expos to a victory at San Francisco and end their 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Alou, who went three for four and scored twice, was the first batter to face 
Burba (0-1) and won the game with his third home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, San Diego 3 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched eight effective innings and 
Jeff Kent got three hits to lead the Mets at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (2-0) won despite giving up 11 hits, including five consecutive to 
start the game. He walked none and struck out five. John Franco pitched the 
ninth for his third save. Andy Benes (0-4) became the first four-game loser in 
the NL. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, Colorado 4 -- Bret Barberie and Gary Sheffield hit home runs and 
David Weathers weathered a rain delay in the Marlins' victory at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was stopped for 42 minutes because of rain in the top of the fourth 
inning with Florida ahead, 4-2, and Weathers (2-1) seemed to gain strength from 
the delay. He struck out the side in the fourth before retiring nine 
consecutive batters.

EXPOS HOLD ON TO BEAT GIANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Expos manager Felipe Alou didn't like the way the game was shaping up: bottom 
of the ninth, one out, Giants runners on first and second, Matt Williams at the 
plate and Barry Bonds in the on-deck circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal had taken a one-run lead on Moises Alou's homer, but the manager had 
seen his team lose five games in the final at-bat. This time, though, the Expos 
held on for a 4-3 win. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind 3-1 to Williams, reliever Mel Rojas got the San Francisco 
slugger to ground into a game-ending double play Tuesday, breaking the Expos' 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we kept playing, we knew eventually we'd win one," said Felipe Alou, whose 
team has lost four extra-inning games, including a 2-1 decision Monday night. 
"These guys were trying real hard through the losing streak." 
</P>
<P>
 And Alou was proud that his son and his nephew, Rojas, figured prominently in 
ending the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas (1-0), who got the final four outs for the victory, serving as the 
closer in the absence of John Wetteland, knew he had to pitch carefully to 
Williams, who leads the Giants with 13 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to throw a fastball," he said. "I threw a split-finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, the Expos had led in the game only to have San Francisco come back. 
They went ahead for good on Moises Alou's solo homer off Dave Burba in the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Alou, who went 3-for-4 and scored twice, was the first batter to face Burba 
(0-1) and drove a 2-2 pitch over the right-field fence for his third homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this one," the younger Alou said. "I got a pretty good pitch and 
went the other way with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Burba said he made the pitch he wanted to Alou, who's 13-for-29 in the last 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got beat with my best pitch," Burba said. "I can't feel bad about that. He 
got it pretty good, got the good part of the bat on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, last in the league in hitting with a .233 average, continued to 
struggle at the plate, getting only six hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of opportunities, but it was just hard getting that big hit," 
San Francisco manager Dusty Baker said. "Every time we'd get a lead, they'd 
come back. We had the right guys up in the right situation." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco took a 3-2 lead in the sixth without a hit. Reliever Gil Heredia 
started the inning with back-to-back walks to Williams and Bonds, and both 
runners moved up on Todd Benzinger's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 After Royce Clayton was intentionally walked to load the bases, Williams 
scored easily on a groundout by Kirt Manwaring that trickled to short. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Expos came right back in the seventh when Darrin Fletcher led off with 
a single and was lifted for pinch-runner Tim Spehr. Spehr went to second on 
Alou's single and scored on pinch-hitter Wil Cordero's double to tie the game.

CHATSWORTH SOARS ON LACOUR FLY; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: AFTER WALKING FOUR TIMES, 
SHORTSTOP DRIVES IN DECISIVE RUN IN 8-INNING VICTORY OVER GRANADA HILLS.

 Bryan LaCour of Chatsworth High walked four times in Tuesday's Northwest 
Valley Conference game against Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders, though, didn't have the luxury of walking LaCour a fifth time 
when the Stanford-bound shortstop came to the plate with the bases loaded and 
one out in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 An open base would have come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour drove in Mike Amado from third base with a sacrifice fly to shallow 
center field to give the Chancellors a 3-2 victory in a meeting between the 
conference's top two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour was behind in the count 0 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for a pitch out of the zone," he said. "I was real surprised 
they gave me something to hit. I really didn't think I hit it that well but it 
was enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (16-3, 7-0 in conference play) had only four hits, stranded 12 
baserunners and left the bases loaded in the fourth and fifth innings, but came 
away with its eighth consecutive victory with the help of starter Jim DiBiase 
(5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander threw a three-hitter and struck out 12 in pitching his 
fourth complete game. Granada Hills (8-4, 4-3) did not advance a runner past 
first base in the final four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I kept throwing strikes we were bound to score some runs," DiBiase 
said. "It was eight innings of pure battle. We had to earn the victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Amado reached base on a bobbled ground ball to start the eighth and advanced 
to second on a bunt by Jeremy Tayahua. Ray Daryabigi walked, and his twin, Rod, 
singled up the middle to load the bases for LaCour. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrod Penwarden gave Granada Hills a 2-0 lead with a two-run home run to 
left-center field in the third. The Chancellors, held hitless through five 
innings by Granada Hills starter John Bolyard, tied the score, 2-2, in the 
sixth on sacrifice flies by Dan Phillips and Ray Daryabigi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We squandered an opportunity or two and they squandered a few opportunities," 
Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "We just had the right man at the plate at 
the right time."

VARGAS OFFERS ENOUGH RELIEF TO EARN A START; COLLEGE BASEBALL: NORTHRIDGE 
RIGHT-HANDER IMPRESSIVE IN 15-6 LOSS TO LOYOLA, WILL JOIN ROTATION FOR KEY 
SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The hopefuls lined up for the audition and gave it their best shot. The mound 
was their stage. They wore eye black instead of grease paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Vargas won the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, a junior right-hander, pitched 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief 
Tuesday as Northridge was hammered by Loyola Marymount, 15-6, in a 
nonconference game at Page Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there is a bigger picture: Namely, who gets the ball for 
Northridge in Saturday's Western Athletic Conference game against Cal State 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, Vargas was the winner," Coach Bill Kernen said. "So he starts 
Saturday. He pitched the best of the bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 In what was essentially an open tryout for a spot in the team's three-man 
weekend rotation, Vargas stepped forward. Two others fell into the orchestra 
pit. First baseman Jason Shanahan, making his fourth pitching appearance, 
started and was shelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to hit," said Shanahan, who gave up nine runs and 11 hits in 1 2/3 
innings. "It's an emergency thing. I don't really want to be out there (on the 
hill), but if they want me to try it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan (0-2) gave up five runs -- including a grand slam by Andy Collett -- 
before he recorded an out. Vargas took over in the second, and allowed one hit 
during his middle-relief stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their 21-22 overall record, the Matadors are 9-6 in WAC games and 
trail West Division leader San Diego State by one-half game. Brian Vasey will 
start against Sacramento on Friday and Marco Contreras will start Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who had been banged around the past few weeks, was clearly pleased 
that he will be given another opportunity to fill the void created when 
starters Keven Kempton and John Najar were injured.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a more positive attitude," said Vargas, a transfer from Valley College. 
"I was (upset) at my past few performances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors closed to within 9-5 on a two-run single by Kevin Howard in the 
sixth, but reliever Aaron D'Aoust couldn't keep it close. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Aoust, who had been in the starting rotation, gave up six runs in 2 1/3 
innings to raise his earned-run average to 8.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge tied a record for most losses in Kernen's six-year tenure. The 
Matadors were 39-22 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount (18-26) turned four double plays to tie a school record.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: CAGEY MUSKETEERS HIT OLD-FASHIONED WAY -- ON THE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is widely known that Simi Valley High Coach Mike Scyphers operates a 
batting cage in Camarillo and lets his players use it as often as they want. So 
after Moorpark stunned the Pioneers, then ranked No. 1 by The Times, 9-5, in 
the Camarillo tournament championship game Saturday, Moorpark hitting star 
Jason Adamson was asked whether his team had used Scyphers' cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been there in our lives," said Adamson, who paced a 10-hit attack 
by going two for three with a triple and two runs batted in. "We just go to our 
own field to take (batting practice) and soft toss." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing soft about the hitting of Moorpark, which carries a .336 team 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another star for Moorpark (13-3) was pitcher Andy Huisenga, who took on Simi 
Valley (13-3) with no previous starts, 10 innings of work and a 5.13 earned-run 
average. Huisenga (1-0) turned in a complete game, scattering eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach David Rhoades had gotten by with two starters all season but was forced 
to use Huisenga after Brian Garrettson and Mike Vasquez pitched complete games 
the previous two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried," Rhoades said. "You don't know what to expect. But he just 
battled, battled, battled." 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga, a junior right-hander, was named most valuable player of the 
tournament for his pitching and hitting: seven for 10, a double and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since Calabasas power hitter Josh Morton was moved to the leadoff spot, he is 
10 for 18 with six walks and five RBIs. Morton, who is batting .488, hit 
leadoff home runs last week against Santa Barbara and San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was batting third and he's got such a reputation that (pitchers) don't 
throw him anything," said Morton's father, Keith. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton drove in five runs last week. Billy Hoover, who was moved to third in 
the order, was seven for 14 with eight RBIs. Six of his hits went for extra 
bases. CHANNEL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Two Out, Two In 
</P>
<P>
 Buena probably has lost its top two starting pitchers. Senior left-hander Mark 
Stehle suffered a herniated disk and junior right-hander Danny Rodriguez has 
tendinitis in his elbow. Rodriguez might return later this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs will use juniors J.C. Holt and Clint Pine, both recently promoted 
from the junior varsity. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Tubb Time 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important player for first-place Newbury Park in this 
three-league-game week is junior right-hander Dustin Tubb, who has spent most 
of the season on the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Tubb pitched six strong innings in the Panthers' 8-3 victory against Agoura on 
Monday, allowing Newbury Park to save Keith Smith and Ray Clinton for games 
against Royal and Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Tubb (2-0), who gave up three runs and struck out five against Agoura, shut 
out Birmingham, 3-0, on March 28 in his only other varsity start. GOLDEN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 The Return of Glick 
</P>
<P>
 Overpowering Palmdale pitcher David Glick returned last week after missing 
three weeks because of a twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad he's back," Coach Kent Bothwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glick, a 6-2, 185-pound senior left-hander, struck out 19 in 10 innings last 
week, including 13 in a two-hitter against Ridgecrest Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 That victory boosted Glick's record to 4-0 and further enhanced his 
eye-grabbing statistics. In 35 innings, he has struck out 52 and walked six. 
His ERA is 1.20. 
</P>
<P>
 Bothwell said that Glick's fastball has been consistently timed in the mid-80 
m.p.h. range, and Glick also possesses a good curveball and changeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been scouted a lot," Bothwell said. "There's a pack of them following 
him around, wondering when he's going to pitch." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Highland, which played two recent league games without eight of its starters, 
is back at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Van Cheri suspended 11 team members in early April for rules 
violations during a trip to the Las Vegas tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland lost to Antelope Valley, 18-4, in the first game the depleted team 
played. But Van Cheri reinstated all the suspended players for last Friday's 
game against Quartz Hill, a 12-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just been trying to weather the storm," Van Cheri said. "At least the 
storm is over." NORTHWEST VALLEY

 Underdog Day 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the underdogs jumped up and bit their handlers.

<P>
 San Fernando entered its game against defending City Section 4-A champion El 
Camino Real sporting an underwhelming 2-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda entered its contest against Granada Hills -- ranked third in area by 
The Times -- having won only two conference games since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando 4, El Camino Real 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda 5, Granada Hills 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Barrigan starred for San Fernando, pitching a five-hitter, and teammate 
Carlos Jimenez had a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 For Reseda, Carlos Nunez went four for four and drove in all five runs. 
Sophomore catcher Brian Menkin took the mound in the sixth and retired the 
final five batters.

CRESCENTA VALLEY MOURNS DEATH OF JUNIOR VARSITY VOLLEYBALL PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Crescenta Valley High junior varsity volleyball team said goodby to a 
friend Tuesday and today will try to carry on without him in a Pacific League 
match at Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach John Nelson won't blame the Falcons if they go through the motions 
one day after attending a funeral for Airn Dison, their 6-foot-3, 125-pound 
freshman middle blocker who left Friday's match because of dizziness and died 
early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volleyball is the most addictive game I've played," Nelson said. "The players 
eat, drink and sleep volleyball. All of a sudden, volleyball is not very 
important. All of a sudden the gym is empty because a big, tall, smiling kid is 
not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dison, 14, said he felt dizzy and weak late in the first game of a 15-10, 
15-10 loss to Brentwood Friday. He was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital 
and Nelson, Crescenta Valley's football trainer, saw his condition worsen. 
</P>

GYMNASTICS / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; SCHERBO, MILLER TAKE GOOD WITH BAD DURING 
PRELIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defending all-around champions Vitaly Scherbo and Shannon Miller had mixed 
fortune on the opening day of the world gymnastics championships Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo, winner of six gold medals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, was the 
leading qualifier for the final of the men's floor exercises, but was 
eliminated from the pommel horse event when he slipped and fell from the 
apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old from Belarus stormed angrily from the arena after making the 
error and finishing 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 17-year-old from Edmond, Okla., who won three gold medals at last 
year's world championship, was the fourth qualifier for the vault, but was only 
ninth in the uneven bars event in which she was defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller won't even be a reserve for the eight-woman final because two other 
Americans qualified and a nation is only allowed two competitors in any final. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo was in fine form during the floor exercise, in which he scored 9.637. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not compete on the rings, one of his gold medal events in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuri Chechi of Italy, the defending champion in the rings competition, headed 
the qualifiers for that event with 9.712 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Marius Urzica of Romania, Mark Sohn of Boca Raton, Fla., and Vitaly Marinich 
of Ukraine were the leading qualifiers in the pommel horse, tied with 9.662 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller unveiled a new move -- a 1 1/2 twisting three-quarter giant swing to a 
handstand on the low bar -- in her uneven bars routine, but was let down by a 
poor landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu Li of China scored a 9.900 to head the qualifiers in the uneven bars, ahead 
of Lavinia Milosovici of Romania (9.825) and Svetlana Chorkina of Russia 
(9.812). 
</P>
<P>
 Milosovici headed the qualifiers for the women's vault final with 9.731 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored 9.706 points to clinch her final spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying will continue through today, with the men's all-around competition 
on Thursday and the women's all-around on Friday. Individual finals are slated 
for Saturday and Sunday.

DANA PARSONS: FOR BETTER OR WORSE, BOOM TIMES ARE BACK IN DENVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite this column's other flaws, you must admit you get more news about 
Denver here than from any other California source. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you mean, you don't care? 
</P>
<P>
 Someone in California cares about Colorado, because lots of people have moved 
there in the last couple of years. Besides, I lived in Denver for nine years 
until the mid-'80s, just returned from a weekend visit and, doggone it, I love 
that town. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of weekend the Colorado tourism industry dreams of. 
Temperatures climbed from the 70s to the 80s, and snow from the weekend before 
ensured that the Rockies still sported their distinguished white peaks. Up 
above, it was another good year for the ski industry, while down below, the 
second-year National League baseball team, the Rockies, were averaging 
50,000-plus after the first six home games. In a lower downtown area, formerly 
the prime hangout of the homeless, a new ballpark is being built that will send 
home runs over the left field wall streaking toward majestic Long's Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver, with a boom-and-bust cycle that's embedded in the genes of all old 
Western mining and cow towns, clearly is booming again. 
</P>
<P>
 Something about that appeals to Californians. Colorado state demographer Reid 
Reynolds gave me statistics suggesting that Colorado inherited a net 
in-migration of about 24,000 Californians during the last half of 1993. That 
accounts for about one-third of the Colorado growth spurt during 1992-93, he 
said. As recently as 1989, Colorado lost about 10,000 people in migratory 
exchanges with California. The trend began reversing during 1992 and Colorado 
has drawn an ever-increasing number of Californians since. 
</P>
<P>
 I joked with Reynolds about the alleged impact of Californians on Colorado and 
he conceded that the in-migration "has taken on folkloric dimensions" around 
Denver and the rest of the state. The local stereotype, he said, depicts the 
Californian as having sold a $500,000 home in the L.A. area and moving to 
Colorado where they bought a four-bedroom home with a pool and lawn for around 
$200,000. With all the extra money from their California home sale, the newly 
arrived immigrants don't care if they take a pay cut or have driven up the 
local housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that actually describes the bulk of California immigrants gets lost in 
the shuffle, Reynolds noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But as long as we're talking about the revitalized Colorado, duty requires 
that I temper your enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado has been through this before. The current upturn was preceded by a 
paralyzing regional recession during the late 1980s that Reynolds says was the 
worst since the Depression. That followed a peak of much growth during the late 
1970s and early 1980s as the energy industry descended on the state. As 
recently as 1983, Colorado had an in-migration boost of 37,000; by 1988, 
out-migration reached 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just sterile demographic statistics. The local newspapers also 
reflected over the weekend what we in Southern California read every day. We 
sometimes forget that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Japanese father arrived in Denver on Sunday to visit his son, shot two 
days earlier during a carjacking. Police said the attack was random and not 
racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 14-year-old boy was given the maximum two-year juvenile jail sentence for 
his involvement in the shooting last Halloween of an 18-year-old who was 
protecting younger relatives as they trick-or-treated. Another 14-year-old is 
charged with being the triggerman. The judge in the case expressed shock that 
the boy she sentenced "feels nothing" over the death of the 18-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parker, a sleepy rural town with a population of 280 in 1981, is debating 
how fast it should grow. Now with a population of 8,400, planners say, the 
community about 20 miles south of Denver could top out at 70,000. The Denver 
Post quoted a resident as saying, "The town is getting crowded with homes that 
all look alike; the housing developments seem to be pushing in from all sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver psyche was severely damaged during the late 1980s. Now the city is 
back with a vengeance, yet I get the feeling from talking to friends and 
reading the papers that the city is wary of what the latest boom will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now more than ever, I can't help but think of Colorado as being California in 
short pants.

D. A. WANTS JUDGE OFF FELONY CASES; COURTS: BRADBURY USES RARE CHALLENGE TO BAN 
STORCH FROM ALL NEW CASES. JURIST REDUCED NEWBURY PARK MAN'S MURDER CONVICTION 
LAST MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Declaring war on a judge viewed as one of Ventura County's most lenient, Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury moved Tuesday to ban Superior Court Judge Lawrence 
Storch from hearing any new felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Storch won't be hearing criminal cases," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kevin J. McGee, a top Bradbury aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's use of a rare legal challenge to disqualify Storch from felony 
cases immediately follows a controversial murder ruling by the judge. It also 
caps years of bad feelings between the judge and the county's top prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch, 60, reduced a Newbury Park man's conviction from first-degree murder 
to second-degree murder last month, then gave the defendant the lowest sentence 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch and Bradbury declined to comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said their problems with the county's longest-serving Superior 
Court judge extend past any one ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not say that there was any single case that was determinative, the 
straw that broke the camel's back," McGee said. "It's just that we looked back 
over the last year in particular, and it's something we felt we needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers who have tried cases before Storch, as well as several 
colleagues, were quick to defend him. They described him as a thoughtful and 
evenhanded jurist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's respected not only in this county, but all over the state as an 
excellent judge," said Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr., felony 
division chief. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Storch is routinely assigned some of the court's most serious criminal 
cases, including those involving the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson said she expects to reassign 
Storch to civil cases, but downplayed the significance of such a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Judge Storch would love to go to civil. He likes it very much, and 
he's very good at it," Johnson said. "When it comes to that, it will be like, 
'Throw me to the briar patch. Please. Please.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said Storch should not be forced from the 
felony bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a fair and imminent jurist, and to just put him out of business because 
they don't get their way on everything is totally out of line," Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows attorneys to disqualify a judge from a case. Bradbury's 
office circulated a memorandum Tuesday to each of the more than 80 deputy 
prosecutors, ordering them to file affidavits removing Storch "in all new 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
 It further says deputy prosecutors are to notify their supervisors if they 
"experience any problems with the courts as a result of this new policy." 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran defense attorney said he believes that Bradbury is using Storch, a 
20-year jurist, to send a message to other judges not to reduce a verdict that 
has been won by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch reduced the verdict in the case against Todd Love, the Newbury Park man 
who shot his sister's boyfriend to death in June. A jury convicted Love of 
first-degree murder, ruling that he planned the boyfriend's death. Storch 
disagreed that the murder was premeditated and lowered the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to send a message to the rest of the judges . . . then it's not 
that hard to take on a judge who is the ex-presiding judge of the criminal 
court," Oxnard lawyer David Patrick Callahan said. "You send the message that, 
'Hey, if you do something like this, we may say you are soft on criminals,' 
which is the death knell for anyone who wants to be reelected." 
</P>
<P>
 Love's lawyer, Carlo A. Spiga, sharply criticized the district attorney's move 
to ban Storch from hearing felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D. A. in Ventura County is so used to winning everything that, God 
forbid, they lose anything. It's like the sky is falling," Spiga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley, who is running for an open Superior Court 
judgeship, called the prosecutor's action "a petulant child's move." 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't get what they wanted . . . so now they are going to do this," 
Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Ventura County Bar Assn. survey two years ago, Storch earned the 
third-highest rating on the Superior Court bench -- 8.05 on a scale of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the best judge you'll ever encounter," Superior Court Judge 
Steven Z. Perren said. "He is a model for which a quality jurist should be 
judged. . . . He is a scholar. He is a gentleman. He is a judge." 
</P>
<P>
 But one judge said it is within the right of any prosecutor or attorney to 
disqualify a judge. Superior Court Judge James McNally said there are times 
when lawyers need that power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smarts when it happens to you, but I'm absolutely committed to the idea 
that it's a good law," McNally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's ban of Storch revives an old dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch is a longtime critic of Bradbury's policy against plea bargaining, 
saying it bogs down the courts with unnecessary trials. Bradbury has described 
Storch as a whiny judge "who would be very happy if all of his cases went away 
through plea bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bradbury described Storch in a 1991 profile as "a fairly lenient 
sentencer, which on occasion has resulted in additional victimizations." He 
cited two cases in which Storch facilitated the release of defendants who 
promptly committed more crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, county judges selected Storch to be a Superior Court commissioner to 
try domestic relations cases. Former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. appointed 
him to a Superior Court judgeship in 1977. Storch has not been opposed in three 
election bids. But he has said he will retire at the end of his current 
six-year term in 1996.

PIROLI SUES L. A. CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE; LITIGATION: THE SUSPENDED PRIEST 
ALLEGES THAT THE CHURCH HAS ENGAGED IN MALICIOUS PROSECUTION AND DEFAMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Claiming that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles went out of its 
way to help prosecute him, Father David Dean Piroli -- as promised -- sued the 
church Tuesday for malicious prosecution and defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli said that after a Ventura County jury acquitted him of embezzlement and 
deadlocked on a grand theft charge, church representatives have continued to 
attack him in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one -- not even the Holy Father himself -- should put him or herself above 
the law," Piroli said at a news conference held across from the archdiocese 
headquarters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspended priest accused the archdiocese of concealing evidence that could 
have proved his innocence to charges that he stole more than $50,000 from his 
former parishes in Simi Valley and Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Archdiocesan officials declined to respond to the lawsuit, which seeks 
unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The archdiocese will comment at the appropriate place and time, which will 
probably be in court," spokeswoman Brenda Anaya-Eckdahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, is the latest 
development in Piroli's nearly two-year legal fight, which began on May 29, 
1992, when Los Angeles police found him and a Mexican national sitting in a 
church-owned car in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the car, police also found $10,000 in small bills, trace amounts of cocaine 
and church collection envelopes. Five days later, parishioners said they found 
more money stashed in Piroli's Simi Valley bedroom and office. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County authorities declined to prosecute him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County prosecutors filed a charge of grand theft in connection 
with the more than $50,000 they accused him of stealing from St. Peter Claver 
Church in Simi Valley. A jury deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal on the 
criminal count a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also filed a charge of embezzlement related to a small amount of 
money Piroli was accused of taking from Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy, where 
he was previously assistant pastor. The same jury acquitted him of that charge. 
</P>
<P>
 During his six-week trial, Piroli maintained that a senior pastor framed him 
by planting much of the money found in Piroli's rooms at the Simi Valley church 
and in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard attorney David Patrick Callahan, who represented the two parishes 
during Piroli's criminal trial, said that if the priest really wants to be 
vindicated, he should demand a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan, who has been critical of Piroli in news interviews, dismissed 
Tuesday's lawsuit as unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that my statements drew at least three votes of the jurors," he said, 
referring to the ones who voted in favor of convicting Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, flanked by his two attorneys, refused to answer questions during 
Tuesday's news conference but read a prepared statement. Piroli's attorneys had 
said earlier this week that he would sue the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the archdiocese acted immorally and unethically in actively 
supporting the criminal prosecution against me," he read from the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He also accused the church of not disclosing to authorities that it could not 
say definitively whether money was missing from either parish. Furthermore, he 
said the church withheld information about internal audits conducted at the 
parishes, audits that Piroli contended would have explained why collections 
increased after he left both places. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Piroli said the archdiocese had continued "to hound me" by making 
allegedly defaming comments about him in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli has refused to say whether he wanted his indefinite suspension lifted. 
He asked church officials to settle his charges of malicious prosecution and 
defamation privately, but he was denied that opportunity as long as he insisted 
on being accompanied by attorneys at such a meeting, Piroli's attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not attempting to get him back in good standing with the church," said 
attorney Douglas Brian Levinson of Los Angeles. "We're trying to heal his 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Through a civil trial, Levinson said, the entire truth regarding Piroli's 
arrest and the money found in his room would surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hopes that when this all comes out, he can prove he is innocent beyond a 
reasonable doubt," Levinson said.

CITY CLERK WON'T GET 'AUTOMATIC' PAY RAISE; OXNARD: COUNCIL VOTES AGAINST 5% 
SALARY BOOST FOR DANIEL MARTINEZ, SAYING HE HAS NOT SHOWN THAT HE DESERVES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A usually automatic pay raise for the Oxnard city clerk was denied Tuesday by 
a majority of City Council members, who ruled that Daniel Martinez has not 
shown he deserves the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez fails to grasp the complexities of his position and has befuddled an 
office that ran smoothly for years, the council decided in rejecting the salary 
increase by a vote of 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5% annual pay raise -- about $2,400 -- was delayed in November after the 
council asked the city manager to conduct a review of Martinez's performance. 
At the time, the council said it wanted to base all raises strictly on merit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez was not rebuffed entirely Tuesday. Included in the council's 
action was a decision to increase by $150 a month the compensation both the 
city clerk and city treasurer receive for performing their elected duties. 
</P>
<P>
 That increase was recommended for approval because of the increase in 
inflation since compensation for the clerk's elected duties was fixed at $300 a 
month in 1979. It amounts to a 3.75% raise for Martinez, who is paid $48,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a review of Martinez's work, City Manager Thomas Frutchey concluded in a 
report to the council that Martinez's job performance is substandard -- despite 
the support of a competent staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The council denied the merit pay raise based on Frutchey's recommendation 
while at the same time approving the elected-duties salary hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, the City Council recessed to closed-door discussions about the 
job performances of Frutchey and City Atty. Gary Gillig. The city attorney said 
he would also have preferred that the Martinez issue be dealt with privately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's public only because the district attorney and I disagree on this 
subject," Gillig told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Martinez performs the bulk of his duties as head of the city clerk's 
office, he answers to Frutchey, who concluded that Martinez has not earned the 
pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 But portions of the city clerk's job are regarded as independent 
elected-official duties and are not subject to the whims of particular City 
Council members. For those services, he will now receive $450 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is one of only three cities in the county -- including Ojai and 
Fillmore -- that elect city clerks. Each of the other cities in the county 
appoints the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel M. Lopez, who lost a bid to delay the Martinez issue until 
the city treasurer could also participate, cast the lone vote against the 
recommendation, saying the proposal before the council Tuesday was purely 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 In the often-bitter 1992 city clerk contest, Martinez defeated Mabi Plisky, 
the wife of Councilman Michael A. Plisky, who had served as clerk for more than 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabi Plisky was later given a job with the Oxnard Police Department, but left 
after public complaints that she was hired because of her husband's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a distant cousin of Martinez, said the city clerk has been undermined 
since he won election to the post in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a consistent attack on the office for political reasons," 
Lopez said before Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never should have surfaced," Lopez said of the controversy. "If there had 
never been a change in the clerk, this whole thing would never have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Plisky remained mostly quiet during the discussion. But the 
majority of the council, including Plisky, said they were adopting the changes 
only to tie pay increases to the quality of work performed by employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In tight economies, Councilman Thomas E. Holden said, "I don't think you're 
going to see any successful businesses where automatic pay raises are going to 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Andres Herrera said the council may want to review the ordinance 
that stipulates city clerks be elected instead of appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we're going to have to deal with," Herrera said about possibly 
appointing city clerks in the future. "The times have changed, and I think we 
need to have it looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Several audience members told the council during the public comment portion of 
Tuesday's meeting that they supported Frutchey's recommendation to deny 
Martinez the once-automatic pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own defense, Martinez said he was given virtually no assistance running 
the office from Frutchey or the former city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "My requests were made in the spirit of cooperation and the pursuit of 
excellence, which is made all the more difficult because of the lack of oral or 
written guidance over the past 17 months," Martinez said, reading from a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, today marks a turn in the management practices of the past."

FILLMORE CELEBRATES RECOVERY; AFTERMATH: GOVERNOR'S WIFE JOINS CEREMONY, SAYING 
SHE IS IMPRESSED WITH SPEEDY EFFORT AFTER QUAKE. BUT SOME BELIEVE WORK WON'T BE 
DONE FOR YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 A host of leaders, including California First Lady Gayle Wilson, gathered 
Tuesday in Fillmore to celebrate what they called the city's quick recovery 
from January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 200 people attended the afternoon ceremony at Central Park, which was 
highlighted by brief remarks by Wilson, wife of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's obviously a lot of civic pride here," she said. "I'm just here to say 
congratulations for getting back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as officials from Fillmore, Sacramento and Washington piled accolades 
on volunteers, private companies and each other for helping the tiny city 
regain momentum, others privately conceded that it would take years for the 
city to completely recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of nearly 100 houses and mobile homes demolished or damaged as a 
result of the 6.8-magnitude earthquake won't be completed until next month, 
City Planner Anthony Perez said. And 19 businesses operating out of a trailer 
or a fiberglass tent likely won't get permanent addresses for at least two 
years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The merchants need to find stable financing and figure out what they're going 
to do," said Dale Crockett, president of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they need to go through the planning and permitting process. It will 
take two years before we're all through," said Crockett, whose photography 
studio was damaged during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crockett, like nearly everyone interviewed during Tuesday's ceremony, said 
he is grateful for the quick response of state and federal officials after the 
Jan. 17 quake, which caused an estimated $250 million in damage in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they have been pleased with the help of Federal Emergency Management 
Agency officials and are proud that their city pulled together to start 
returning to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our merchants back in business before other cities who suffered damage 
from the earthquake," Councilman Roger Campbell said. "Northridge, Simi, those 
cities were still deciding what to do when we had our businesses open again in 
the trailers." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said she was impressed by the speedy recovery effort in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in a lot of the communities affected by the earthquake, and they 
are making progress," she told reporters after the ceremony. "But when you have 
a self-contained community like Fillmore, I think that gives you a leg up on 
the other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The city organized the ceremony to thank local volunteers, state and federal 
emergency workers, and corporate donors for their part in helping Fillmore get 
back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore has received $4.5 million in state and federal funds. In addition, 
several private companies have kicked in smaller donations to help rebuild. IBM 
Corp. donated 40 computers to City Hall and A. C. Green Youth Foundation and G. 
E. Modular Space helped underwrite the cost of trailers needed to house 
displaced merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Mayor Linda Brewster also thanked the Red Cross and scores of local 
philanthropic organizations that provided food, clothing and shelter 
immediately after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 During her visit, Wilson toured a trailer housing nine displaced businesses 
and chatted with business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hair stylist Esperanza Hurtado did not complain to Wilson, she later 
said she wishes that Fillmore's progress was quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado said she applied for a federal grant three weeks after the quake, but 
has yet to receive any money. "I cannot move or make any plans until I know I 
have the money to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she made the stop in Fillmore, population 12,800, because the 
damage it suffered was virtually ignored by some media, with attention focused 
on the quake's epicenter in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fillmore, being a rural community . . . didn't get a lot of the attention it 
deserved," she said. "I wanted to give it recognition."

COUNTY'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS SLIGHTLY IN MARCH; JOBS: MOST OF THE POSITIONS 
ARE IN AGRICULTURE. STATE REPORTS A DIP TO 8.4% FROM 8.9% IN FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County unemployment rates dropped slightly in March, with 5,300 more people 
joining the work force since February, according to new figures from the state 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of those jobs are in agricultural positions, however, and state 
officials and economists cautioned that the upward trend has more to do with 
seasonal planting and harvesting rather than a reviving economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agricultural employment usually starts picking up in February and March and 
continues through May," said Linda Reed, an analyst with the department. 
"That's the pattern historically. The unemployment rate declined last year 
between February and March as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce DeVine, chief economist with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, said he does not put too much stock in a surge of farm labor. 
"You're not going to see a turnaround in the economy through agriculture," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fields other than agriculture, 2,000 jobs were added, with unemployment 
rates dropping from 8.9% in February to 8.4% in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Avelina Villalobos, who manages the Oxnard unemployment office, warned that 
numbers for the seasonal workers are sometimes distorted by hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "People pick chilies for two weeks, then they get laid off," Villalobos said. 
"Then they get hired on to pick something else a week later, so it looks like 
two jobs when it's actually one person going from farm to farm." 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos suggested that these figures not be taken too seriously. "Those 
same people will get laid off again in July," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One apparently improving field, retail -- where 500 jobs were added throughout 
the county in March -- should get another boost in coming months with the new 
outlet mall in Oxnard, Villalobos said. At least 200 new jobs should be created 
by its opening, scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists usually measure unemployment rates against the same time period the 
year before, rather than against the previous month. But changes in the way the 
federal Bureau of Labor Statistics gathers unemployment data have made 
comparisons between past years unreliable, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 March figures also showed an increase of 500 new jobs in construction, which 
experts attributed to the Jan. 17 quake. Larry Kennedy, manager of the state 
unemployment office in Simi Valley, said he has seen an encouraging trend of 
more construction workers landing jobs over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he usually compares the state's figures with the numbers of 
people coming into the Simi Valley office to file unemployment claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a big drop in the number of claims coming into the office in March, 
which would correlate with the improvement the state's figures are showing," he 
said. "Things are looking better. It's gradual, but it's coming."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLICE INVESTIGATE WEEKEND GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police are investigating a weekend shooting spree in the Ventura 
Avenue area, an incident that residents call part of an ongoing spate of 
violence in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say unknown assailants shot about 20 rounds into houses, shops and cars 
parked near Olive Street and Harrison Avenue early Saturday.No one was hurt, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the gunfire, city officials say they are trying to arrange a 
meeting between council members and Avenue residents in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got gunfire going on; nobody's trying to deny that," City Manager John 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the weekend gunfire, neighbors say the area has been plagued in 
recent months by similar incidents of shots being fired and muggings related to 
gang and drug activity at a nearby apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something has to be done out here. This has gone too far," said Len Evans, 
who lives on Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said the city has been working with the Avenue community on 
several issues long before the weekend incident. "The Avenue has received a 
fair amount of attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the biggest problem is the community is without demonstrable leadership" 
that city officials can approach when they want to get something done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, however, say city and police officials did little about the problem 
until Monday, when fed-up residents began flooding the Police Department and 
City Hall with phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's finally getting back to the city that they can't ignore it anymore," 
Evans said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; BALANCING THE 
SCALES FOR THE SHOPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They don't carry guns. They don't get followed around by people toting cameras 
for reality-based TV shows. Their undercover operations are decidedly unsexy, 
low-key affairs that take place in supermarkets. And worse yet, hardly anyone 
besides produce managers ever talks about them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the inspectors at the county's Quality Control Division of the Weights and 
Measures Department didn't know it before, they certainly do now: checking the 
accuracy of supermarket price scanners -- in addition to meat, produce and 
bakery scales -- is not exactly the kind of crime busting that brings fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always worked in the shadows," says Joe Jamora, the boss of the 
somewhat obscure division, which is made up of 10 inspectors. "No notoriety. 
All we do is call it like we find it." 
</P>
<P>
 But anonymity sometimes leads toward extinction. This year's budget, for 
instance, is $800,000, down from a high of $1.2 million a few years ago, Jamora 
said. The division has resisted layoffs, but has been able to spend less time 
performing inspections.  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily though, the division's three-person undercover team became famous 
recently. Well, sort of famous. What happened is that one of their operations 
made it into the news. Here's the story: On April 7, as the result of the 
division's three-month investigation, the Los Angeles city attorney's office 
filed criminal charges against 10 Ralphs supermarkets for allegedly 
overcharging customers. Seven of the stores were located in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stem from inaccurate prices read by the supermarkets' computerized 
scanners. According to a three-month investigation, those prices were often 
higher than the items' posted shelf prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, the market managers and investigators agree, is a common one. It 
usually happens when the stores fail to reprogram their scanners to reflect the 
price of an item that has been placed on sale. Ralphs, which will be arraigned 
on the charges next month, has blamed the problem on store clerks' forgetting 
to remove sale tags from items that had reverted back to normal prices. Al 
Marasca, the chain's president, said the problem has been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in the city attorney's office said they do not believe the stores 
are intentionally trying to rip off their customers. The violations are often 
for less than $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly high stakes, but according to Jamora, significant nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overcharges appear small, but average out to be about 10% of the cost of 
each item," Jamora said. "That's substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to the investigation of Ralphs, the scanners are inaccurate 
almost 16% of the time and overcharge customers almost 15% of the time. But 
because the division has only three inspectors and the county has some 20,000 
markets, catching violators is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 During sting operations, the inspectors wear street clothes, grab a shopping 
cart and do what comes naturally. "They pick up the items that seem attractive 
to them, but we focus on the sale items because that's what the public focuses 
on too," Jamora said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the undercover shoppers choose 20 sample items, they wait in the 
check-out line like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamora said it is important for inspectors not to identify themselves, lest 
they be the unwitting victims of the store's chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they know you're an inspector, employees will go following you around, 
changing the prices after you go to the next aisle," he said. "And when you go 
back to verify the shelf prices, it looks like you've been imagining things." 
</P>
<P>
 Only after the items have been rung up do inspectors identify themselves. If 
there are variations between shelf prices and those on the scanner, they issue 
the supermarket a citation.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, the leader of the small division is hoping its fame -- however 
fleeting -- will help stave off job losses and possibly the elimination of the 
entire department. "Of course everybody is suffering from lack of funding, but 
I hope some of this publicity will help," Jamora said. After all, he said, "It 
would be easier for people to want to eliminate us if you didn't know what we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fame has its downside, and the new attention has led to at least one 
case of overexposure. "One of the TV stations decided to follow one of our 
undercover people around," said Jamora. "Now, when she goes into supermarkets, 
people tell her, 'I saw you on TV again last night."'

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CITY TAKES STEP TO BUY LAND NEXT TO 
AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An ordinance that would allow the city of Santa Paula to acquire two parcels 
of land that abut the airport was approved by the City Council, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution will be forwarded to the California Transportation Commission, 
which needs verification of the city's commitment to establish a safety zone 
around the airport before it disburses a $250,000 grant it approved for the 
project last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The $250,000 would be used to acquire two homes that were destroyed in 1992 
when two light planes collided in midair near the airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two families were inside the houses when the planes collided, no one 
on the ground was injured. One of the two pilots burned to death after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 After the collision, state officials ordered the city to establish a safety 
zone around Santa Paula airport, which has for decades been surrounded by 
dozens of modest homes. 
</P>
<P>
 New planning regulations adopted by the City Council after the state mandate 
do not allow the owners of the two destroyed homes to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state does not allow the people to move back in because they've now 
declared it open space," Councilman John Melton said. "It's a shame we have to 
relocate the people, but they will be duly compensated." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Garcia, whose home was destroyed in the crash, was not available for 
comment Tuesday. But he said last month that he doubted that he would get 
enough of the $250,000 grant to replace what he lost in the accident. JEFF

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: ANACAPA ISLAND; COAST GUARD RESCUES BOATLOAD OF 
STUDENTS 
</P>

<P>
 A boat loaded with schoolchildren narrowly escaped crashing on the rocks of 
Anacapa Island on Tuesday after it lost partial power while trying to dock, U. 
S. Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-foot boat, which was carrying 42 children ages 7 to 10 from Valley 
School in Van Nuys, bumped into the cliffs several times before a nearby Coast 
Guard utility boat was able to reach it and tow it into open water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have turned into a real serious case," said Petty Officer Thane 
Gallagher, who was the engineer on the Coast Guard vessel. "The surge kept 
pushing him into the cliff there, and he wasn't able to maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Galbraith, captain and owner of the Vanguard, said the incident occurred 
when a clogged fuel filter caused one of two engines to fail, limiting his 
ability to guide the vessel through the six- to eight-foot swells. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith called the incident minor and said the children were never in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a one-in-a-million situation," Galbraith said. "The kids ended 
up having a great time. We saw some whales and some dolphins. We just weren't 
able to dock on the island." MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PART OF POLI STREET TO REMAIN CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura hillside residents say they will push ahead with their drive to reopen 
Poli Street, even though the City Council has voted to keep a section of the 
road closed during daytime hours for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, teachers and administrators have lobbied for years to close the 
stretch of Poli that bisects the Ventura High School campus, warning city 
officials that the traffic could lead to anything from pedestrian injuries to 
drive-by shootings. In August, the City Council agreed and blocked off Poli 
during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But frustrated hillside residents say the school should be responsible for its 
own safety. By closing a swatch of the road, they say, the city moves traffic 
from a street equipped to handle it to their narrow, winding roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, the school coalition won again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so political," grumbled Hugh Oliver, a member of Concerned Citizens of 
Ventura, the residents group formed to fight the closure and push an initiative 
that would nullify the council's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Biller, another member of the group, vowed that this would not be the 
last time the city dealt with Poli Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken some blows before, and we're still plugging along full blast," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to voting to keep Poli Street closed, council members rejected 
speed humps for nearby streets; voted to install breakaway chains as barriers 
on nearby Palomar Avenue and Sunset Drive, also closed to through traffic 
during school hours, to alleviate concerns about vehicles being unable to pass 
through in emergencies, and voted to encourage the school to look into 
redesigning or relocating the campus as a long-term solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote on the Poli Street issue was 5 to 2. Councilman Jack Tingstrom 
opposed it because he wanted the council to order further study. Councilman Jim 
Monahan opposed it, saying he'd like the council to impose a time limit on the 
action. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL OKS CHANGES IN POLICE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five vacant crossing-guard positions were eliminated Tuesday by the Oxnard 
City Council, which then authorized the police chief to create two 
administrative positions and hire a street cop to counsel teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another four crossing guards will be let go before July, 1995, under the 
restructuring approved Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from two local schools told the council that they did not oppose the 
cutback in the number of crossing guards as long as the safety of students was 
not jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 But a union official chastised the council for agreeing to hire more 
administrators and let rank-and-file union employees go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow that doesn't seem to be going in the right direction," said Barry 
Hammitt, executive director of the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Harold Hurtt told the council that the positions, including the 
addition of a third assistant police chief, were needed to better administer 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael A. Plisky noted that the department did away with an 
assistant police chief position several years ago in a downsizing effort, but 
he voted for the change minutes later upon Hurtt's recommendation.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LANDFILL LEASE WILL NOT BE RECONSIDERED 
</P>

 Ventura County supervisors Tuesday declined to reconsider their decision to 
extend the lease of Bailard Landfill, saying they saw no reason to take up the 
issue again. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn had urged his fellow board members to rethink their 
March 1 vote, claiming that the board failed to address all his environmental 
concerns on the Oxnard dump. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn's appeal was resoundingly rejected by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what you are saying," Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk told Flynn at 
Tuesday's meeting. "I want to see Bailard closed, too. But I also have a 
responsibility to provide a place for our trash until we can find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk added that she believes that the county has adequately addressed 
the environmental impacts of continuing to use the landfill for three more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Flynn said he will appeal the matter to state water officials on 
the grounds that continued use of the dump -- situated above the Oxnard aquifer 
-- could contaminate area drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted this on the record," he said. TINA DAUNT

Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Scramble tournament was organized by Pete Burnes, 86, of Thousand 
Oaks, whose wife suffers from the debilitating disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are tough times to be doing fund-raising events," Burnes said. 
"Southern California has been hit hard. But this disease hits harder, and it 
affects all of the family."

 The Spring Golf Classic and Dinner begins at 11:30 a.m. Friday at the Mountain 
View Golf Course in Santa Paula, with dinner to follow at 5 p.m. at Logsdon 
Restaurant at the Santa Paula Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Texas Scramble tournament, all four members of a group tee off 
individually. But instead of playing their own balls where they lie, they take 
all subsequent shots from the point where the best ball landed.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STATE'S CLAS TEST COMES UNDER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 125 Simi Valley parents attended a meeting Tuesday night to hear 
criticism of a new state assessment test that will be given in the city's 
public schools the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting at the Clarion Hotel, two local elected officials attacked 
the California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS, for being too subjective 
and for questioning students about their personal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mildred Lynch, a member of the Conejo Valley school board, and Wendy 
Larner, a member of the Ventura County Board of Education, said some of the 
passages used in the test could be disturbing to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They broach intimate and possibly sore and sensitive subjects," Larner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of saying there is a right or wrong answer to the test, they want to 
know how much you feel about it or how deeply you think," parent Coleen Ary 
said in an interview before the meeting, sponsored by Citizens for Truth in 
Education. The group was formed in the fall to fight efforts to include 
information about birth control in the Simi district's curriculum on sex 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Ary said the group, which has about 25 active members, paid to rent the room 
at the Clarion and passed out 600 flyers to publicize the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one Simi Valley math teacher called Tuesday's presentation 
unbalanced. "I would have liked to have seen someone give out a 
well-thought-out second side to this issue," said the teacher, who declined to 
give her name. "Fifty-two percent of what they said I agree with, but there 
were a lot of fallacious arguments too." 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials have touted the CLAS exam as an innovation in 
testing methods that is intended to measure critical thinking skills. Unlike 
previous standardized tests with multiple choice questions, CLAS emphasizes 
writing and asks students to explain how they came up with their answer. The 
exam was given statewide for the first time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ary said organizers of the Simi Valley meeting are not trying to 
organize a boycott of the tests next week, she said a number of parents are 
already planning to keep their children home. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, about two dozen parents kept their children out of school 
Monday morning, the first day of the CLAS tests in several elementary schools, 
school officials and parents said. JULIE FIELDS

 More than three months after the Northridge earthquake rattled Ventura County, 
the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday publicly recognized nearly 500 county 
employees, residents and business owners who assisted after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of you did enormous things, outstanding things," Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee told a packed room of employees and residents."Some of you did very 
small things. Those things are what help people survive a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard told the group: "There was tremendous cooperation. . . 
. We are glad to have you here to say, 'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Among those honored at the ceremony were county social workers, Southern 
California Gas Co. employees and senior citizen advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Pace and his wife, DeLores, made the trek from Piru to pick up their 
certificate of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pace, who owns the community's tiny Warring Water Service, said he was out 
patching leaks in water pipes minutes after the shaking stopped Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out before the sun was up," Pace said. "We had to be." TINA DAUNT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : BUSINESS ACADEMY HONORS 1ST GRADS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first group of Ventura County small-business owners to complete an 
intensive business training course graduated Tuesday from Cal Lutheran 
University's Entrepreneur Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Entrepreneur Academy was set up two years ago to stimulate innovation and 
better management among small businesses countywide by providing them with free 
university-level business training. 
</P>
<P>
 A $290,000 state grant allowed the county to join forces with Cal Lutheran's 
Small Business Development Center and enroll more than 200 local business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great success," said Marcella McGee, director of the Small 
Business Development Center. "What's most dramatic is that they can take what 
they learn and use that information immediately in their work." 
</P>
<P>
 The only criteria for enrollment were that the businesses employ from five to 
50 people, that they pay unemployment insurance on each employee and that the 
business owner agree to attend all of the classes during the 12 weeks of 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants spent more than 100 hours in the classroom and an equal amount of 
time outside class writing business plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite that intensive time commitment, we had a fabulous completion rate," 
McGee said. "In this class, we had 55 enroll and all but three completed the 
program. The ones that dropped out left because the earthquake offered them 
tremendous business opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are unsure whether the program will continue after the last 
of the 200 business owners complete their studies in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would sure like it to continue," McGee said. "There are more than 14,000 
small businesses in the county. I think they need training like this." SCOTT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; TOWNHOME PROJECT RECEIVES PANEL'S OK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 13-townhome development planned for an overgrown Newbury Park property was 
approved by Thousand Oaks planners despite concerns that the complex would have 
no place for children to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which aims to attract middle-income families, will occupy a 
two-acre lot near Haigh Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing Monday night, planners spent several hours trying to 
decide whether the number of duplex and triplex buildings should be reduced to 
make room for a play area. 
</P>
<P>
 While planning commissioners expressed concern that the three- and 
four-bedroom townhomes needed more than a narrow grass strip for the 
development's estimated 25 children, they also had to weigh the pleas of 
neighbors who wanted to limit noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 After a vote to eliminate one of the 13 townhome units failed, Commissioners 
Forrest Frields, Mervyn Kopp and Irving Wasserman voted to approve the project 
without an expanded play area. Commissioners Linda Parks and Marilyn Carpenter 
voted against the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that a similar project was approved at the previous week's meeting, 
Parks said she believed the commission was not adequately looking at the needs 
of families. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had more mothers on this commission, I don't think the votes would be 
coming out like this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kopp said he believed Parks and Carpenter were looking for excuses to deny 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to ask the developer to come in and provide all kinds of 
things," Kopp said. "But at some point that just becomes unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the project is expected to begin at the end of the summer and 
will take about a year to complete, the developer said. MATTHEW MOSK

REPAIR

<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council has voted to proceed with the first phase of a 
plan to spend $500,000 to upgrade and repair four water tanks and a number of 
pipelines damaged by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will ask for bids for a consultant to determine the best way of 
repairing the water system, which was damaged during the quake, flooding many 
homes and leaving some without running water for days. 
</P>
<P>
 About $50,000 of the funds set aside for the repairs will be paid to the 
consultant, city officials said. The money had been budgeted last year to 
upgrade parts of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the city decided to focus on the most damaged areas, 
including three tanks at the top of Stow Street, near Barnard Street and 
Placerita Drive in Indian Hills. A fourth tank, on Walnut Street near Felix and 
Black avenues is also scheduled for repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said the tanks would be upgraded to higher seismic 
standards than most homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be in a situation where people are more likely to lose their house than 
have the water tank come down on top of them," he said. MARY F. POLS

<P>
 Simi Valley homeowners seeking loans to repair earthquake damage will not be 
charged a $25 fee by the city to research whether their property is in a flood 
zone, the council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-0 vote, the City Council agreed Monday night to drop the fee the city 
normally charges to provide a letter to property owners stating flood-zone 
status.The exemption, however, applies only to earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A notarized letter concerning flood-zone status is required by many banks and 
lenders, including the Small Business Administration, which is offering 
low-interest loans to those making earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's research fee covers the cost of looking up the property, confirming 
its status and producing the notarized letter for the resident. After the 
city's flood zone was reduced in size last month, about 1,200 residents were 
dropped from the flood area. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council resolution in January eliminated several other fees for 
earthquake victims, including those for building permits. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY EASES RULES FOR HOME-REPAIR LOANS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council has agreed to relax the city's lending criteria 
for low-income residents who need to make repairs on their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Home Rehabilitation Program, which began in 1981, provides low-interest 
loans through the city to residents in lower-income brackets.Council members 
unanimously agreed Monday night to ease the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Standards for loans typically change from year to year, said Dulce 
Conde-Sierra, deputy director for the city's Housing and Special Projects 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after an increase in defaults among recipients, the standards were 
tightened so that property owners could not take out loans exceeding 70% of the 
property's value. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new criteria forced 38% of the applicants to be turned away, prompting 
the Affordable Housing Subcommittee to rethink the policy.

THOUSAND OAKS BANKER PLEADS GUILTY TO 2 COUNTS OF FRAUD; COURTS: OLEN B. 
PHILLIPS COULD SERVE UP TO 24 MONTHS IN PRISON. HE HAD FACED 12 CHARGES IN 
FEDERAL INDICTMENT.

<P>
 Thousand Oaks banker Olen B. Phillips pleaded guilty to two counts of a 
12-count indictment for bank fraud and could face up to 24 months in prison, an 
assistant U. S. attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And Phillips' banking partner, Phillip L. Chase, will enter a guilty plea 
today to one charge of the indictment, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles accused the two men of 
understating their debts when applying for loans from banks in Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, jurors deadlocked over eight counts in the government fraud case 
and acquitted Chase on one count of filing false documents. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors renewed their case against Chase, 51, and Phillips, 53, in 
February, including additional charges that stemmed from an FBI investigation 
conducted since the mistrial, according to Assistant U. S. Atty. Brent 
Whittlesey. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who is scheduled to be sentenced June 13, pleaded guilty to making a 
false entry into the records of the federally insured United Community Bank of 
Thousand Oaks, Whittlesey said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Phillips admitted making a materially false statement to a federally 
insured bank in a loan application, according to Whittlesey. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' attorney, Steven D. Powell, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase is expected to plead guilty to "leaving off some liabilities on a 
financial statement," said his attorney, Richard Marmaro. That count was 
related to a $50,000 loan that Chase repaid, Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase agreed to enter his plea in exchange for unsupervised probation, Marmaro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not happy about pleading guilty, but the enormous costs of going to 
trial twice and the assurance of not having to serve time in prison convinced 
him," Marmaro said. Chase is scheduled to appear before U. S. District Court 
Judge William D. Keller this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Chase surrounding his activity with United Community Bank 
of Thousand Oaks, of which he was the chairman and Phillips a board member, are 
expected to be dropped as part of the plea, Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Community Bank was shut down for lack of funds in 1989 and has since 
cost taxpayers $9.5 million to cover federally insured accounts, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client was not guilty of any of the charges related to United Community 
Bank," Marmaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the December trial, which ended in a hung jury, Chase testified that he did 
not know that he was breaking banking laws when he and Phillips tried to save 
United Community Bank by lending $300,000 to customers and borrowing the same 
amount back in order to buy stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase told jurors in that trial that he and Phillips were merely trying to 
save the bank from faltering under a load of bad loans, an alleged fraud scheme 
by some customers and the demands of state banking regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated case, Phillips was convicted in a 1992 state court trial of 
one charge from a multi-count state indictment accusing him of bilking 21 
investors out of more than $3 million in complicated land deals. Phillips 
served a 60-day jail term in that case.

EMPLOYEE OF BOUTIQUE IS RAPED, ROBBED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks woman was raped and robbed at gunpoint Tuesday evening as she 
was closing up the boutique where she worked, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man entered the business in the 3900 block of Thousand Oaks Boulevard about 
6 p.m., just before closing, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed the woman a handgun, forced her into a back office, tied her hands 
behind her back and assaulted her, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then took money from her purse and the cash register and fled the store on 
foot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said they believe that the case may be linked to other 
robberies that have occurred in recent months in Thousand Oaks and in Los 
Angeles County, but the previous incidents have not included rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was described as white, about 40 years old, 5 feet 11 inches tall and 
weighing 170 pounds. He was wearing a dark baseball cap, sunglasses and a dark 
jacket. MATTHEW MOSK

BOBBY LEE BEEMAN, FORMER MUSICIAN AT KNOTT'S, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Lee Beeman, who serenaded visitors at Knott's Berry Farm with his 
popular Western music group, the Wagonmasters, died Sunday at his home here of 
heart failure. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeman, who was born in Pampa, Tex., first played rhythm guitar and sang with 
a family group, "Shirley and the Beeman Brothers." That group included a 
surviving sister, Shirley Pullen of Garden Grove, and brothers Billy Beeman of 
Hemet and Don Beeman of Leakey, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with older brother Billy, Bobby Beeman was part of the Wagonmasters 
in the late 1950s. The group played at Knott's from 1955 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Beeman's connection with Knott's Berry Farm predated its current theme 
park incarnation, according to his son, Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he wasn't singing, he helped build the Ghost Town part," Richard Beeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Richard, a Placentia resident, Beeman is survived by sons Robby, 
also of Placentia, and Randy of Woodland; and sisters Jean Wortley of Dana 
Point, Judy Zambella of Hemet and Rita Lakin of Mission Viejo, and one 
grandson.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: PASTOR PUTS BELIEF INTO PRACTICE IN HIS WORK WITH PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD; REV. STEPHEN J. MATHER OF ANAHEIM'S LEADERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION 
BRINGS CIVIL RIGHTS AWARD, AND CONTINUING PROTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN J. HUBBARD, Benjamin J. Hubbard is a professor of religious studies 
at Cal State Fullerton and a member of the board of directors of Planned 
Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 24, the Orange County Human Relations Commission will present the 
Rev. Stephen J. Mather of First Presbyterian Church in Anaheim one of its 1994 
awards for outstanding contributions in the area of human and civil rights. 
That might not seem very surprising at first. The clergy, after all, is often 
in the vanguard of the human rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the honoring of Mather may surprise the religious right because he's being 
cited for his volunteer work as president of the board of directors of Planned 
Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. It will come as no surprise 
to those who know that the organization provides health care services to 
thousands of women and men yearly. These services include contraceptive care, 
cancer screening, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS testing and 
counseling, prenatal health care and education, pregnancy prevention programs 
for teens and first-trimester abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mather was appointed 16 months ago, he caught the attention of some 
anti-choice people who believe that being pro-choice and Christian are 
incompatible. The religious right has attempted over the years to marginalize 
pro-choice Christians and Jews and to promote the view that all truly religious 
people share the same beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a significant number of religious organizations are officially 
pro-choice and believe a woman has the ultimate right to decide when and if she 
wishes to bear a child. In fact, the Religious Coalition for Reproductive 
Choice (formerly the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights) is supported 
nationally by some 34 religious organizations. In Southern California these 
include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the United Methodist 
Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Church of Christ and most 
non-Orthodox Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the clergy in these denominations are solidly pro-choice and some have 
been active and visible supporters of this position. However, the firm stand 
the Rev. Mather has taken is extraordinary. By his public involvement with 
Planned Parenthood, he has made a commitment to responsible family planning, to 
women's health and reproductive rights, and to curbing the burgeoning problem 
of teen pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has cost him. On most Sundays for the past 10 months, anywhere from 
five to 35 demonstrators have gathered outside Mather's church to protest his 
work as board president of Planned Parenthood. He has also received letters and 
telephone calls from people critical of his position.  
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, these individuals don't believe in a woman's right to 
control the most basic and intimate decisions about her reproductive life. Nor 
do they believe in the Rev. Mather's right to practice his religion or follow 
his conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so in spite of pressure, he stands in the tradition of people of 
conscience from the Hebrew prophets to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 
other civil rights activists of the 1960s and '70s.

 Sixth-ranked Villa Park relied on its doubles teams in a 13-8 victory over No. 
9 Canyon in a Century League boys' tennis match Tuesday at Villa Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doubles are our weakness," Villa Park Coach Dave Colville said before the 
match."We should win our singles 9-0, so we need a few wins from our doubles." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans got three, two from their No. 3 team of Brandon Louie and Julien 
Laussade, who won, 6-4, 6-4, to give Villa Park (11-2, 4-1 in league) an 8 
2/3-5 1/3 lead at the end of Round 2. The other victory came from Bryan Kim and 
Eric Wu, 7-6 (7-1).

PREP SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; KENNEDY'S PITT IS PERFECT IN HER FIFTH NO-HITTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after pitching 14 innings against eighth-ranked Pacifica, 
Lisa Pitt found the perfect way to stamp Kennedy as the Garden Grove League 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitt pitched a perfect game at second-place La Quinta as the fourth-ranked 
Fighting Irish scored a 4-0 victory Tuesday at Arnold Park.She struck out eight 
and got a gem-saving defensive play from shortstop Laurie Fritz in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz went over the middle to grab an apparent single and threw out Jaclyn 
Fredrickson. The only other threat was Barbara Holcomb's swinging bunt leading 
off the sixth that Pitt fielded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have got it without my defense," said Pitt, who dueled to a 2-2 
tie with Pacifica on Monday. "Warming up, I kinda felt like we would do well." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pitt (12-1), it was her third no-hitter over a five-game, eight-day 
stretch. She now has five no-hitters. Kennedy is 14-4-1, 6-0-1; La Quinta 
(12-5, 5-2) dropped to third place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, it seems like she steps to the rubber with a purpose," Kennedy Coach 
Sue Hall said of Pitt, a junior. "She's maturing." 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Hannifan, Fritz, Jamie Pietranowicz and Crystal Gerringer had RBI singles 
for Kennedy. MARTIN HENDERSON

 Whittier Christian's 47-match winning streak ended when Calvary Chapel, ranked 
eighth in Orange County, defeated the host Heralds, 9-15, 15-13, 15-6, 15-9, in 
an Olympic League boys' volleyball match Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Schildts had 24 kills and two blocks.His brother Robert had 14 kills 
and four blocks and Aaron Fountain had 12 kills for Calvary Chapel (9-0, 5-0 in 
league).  
</P>
<P>
 Tim Willey had 24 kills and six blocks for Whittier Christian (8-1, 4-1), a 
three-time defending Southern Section champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds fell two short of a Southern Section record for consecutive 
matches won. North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake won 49 consecutive matches from 
1986-'89. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streak is over, but there is a bigger prize out there," Whittier 
Christian Coach Dave Herron said. "We want to get back to the Southern Section 
finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel rallied from a 13-11 deficit to win Game 2 and draw even after 
losing Game 1. Setter Matt Wright had 54 assists as the Eagles improved their 
serving and passing to take control. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

MARINA RIPS HUNTINGTON BEACH; KEEPS SUNSET LEAGUE RACE CLOSE

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Craig Wilson's help, Marina muddled an already confusing Sunset League 
race with a 12-5 victory over Huntington Beach on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers had a chance to become an honest-to-goodness front-runner in a 
league where six teams started the day within 1 1/2 games of each other.But 
Wilson and the Vikings would have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson homered twice and drove in five runs at Marina, putting the Vikings 
(14-6, 4-3) in the thick of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this league, you just don't know what's going to happen," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (13-5, 4-2), ranked third in Orange County, weren't expecting to be 
slapped around. They came into the game in first place, a half-game ahead of 
Fountain Valley. They left as just another team in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers looked as good as billed for a while, but it didn't last. Marina 
scored nine runs in the fourth inning to take a 10-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson capped the outburst with a wind-aided three-run homer to right-center 
field. His second, a two-run homer to center in the sixth, needed no 
assistance, as he was already in his home-run trot by the time he reached first 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has three home runs this season, also doubled and scored three 
runs. Brad Smith had a two-run double and Travis Anderson a two-run single for 
the Vikings. CHRIS FOSTER

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: ADJUSTING TO CHANGE; RISING RATES SHIFT 
TREND AWAY FROM FIXED MORTGAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adjustable-rate mortgages are making a comeback, thanks to the recent sharp 
rise of rates on fixed-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Most new home loans being taken out now are adjustable-rate mortgages, a 
turnaround from a few months ago, when they were primarily fixed-rate, lenders 
say. Home Savings of America, one of the nation's biggest lenders, says 89% of 
its new mortgage applications are for adjustable loans, compared to 23% a year 
ago. There has also been a substantial surge in applications for adjustable 
loans at Great Western Bank, said Sam Lyons, a Great Western senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the switch is clear. The cost of fixed-rate mortgages has 
skyrocketed in the past two months, with rates jumping between 1 1/2 and two 
percentage points just since February. Adjustable loan rates have also risen, 
but not nearly as much. 
</P>
<P>
 The average rate nationally for 30-year fixed mortgages jumped to 8.6% in 
mid-April from a low of 6.8% in October, according to HSH Associates in Butler, 
N.J. Adjustable loans have risen by about one percentage point over the same 
period and now average 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an affordability issue," said John J. Lewis, managing editor of Inside 
Mortgage Finance, a Bethesda, Md., industry newsletter. "People are concerned 
about what their monthly payments are going to be. If you can get an adjustable 
loan at 4% or 5%, that's a big advantage over an 8% fixed rate." 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers need to realize that unlike fixed-rate loans, for which the main 
issues are interest rates and fees, several important variations exist between 
the different types of adjustable mortgages, including the index, adjustment 
periods and interest rate caps. And because it's difficult to keep an eye on 
all of these factors, there are some common misperceptions about the "best" 
adjustable loans to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many consumers believe that the best adjustable loan in today's 
rising rate environment is the one that's tied to the slowest-moving index, the 
11th District cost of funds index (COFI). It and the one-year Treasury bill 
index are, by far, the nation's most popular indexes for adjustable loans, 
accounting for 31.4% and 42.8% of the market, respectively, according to the 
Federal Housing Finance Board in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The COFI index moves slower largely because it is based on the borrowing costs 
of savings and loans in California, Nevada and Arizona; borrowing costs 
typically move slower than the one-year Treasury bill. The idea is that you'll 
feel interest rate hikes much more slowly with a COFI loan than with the 
faster-moving one-year Treasury bill index. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, COFI loans also typically come with lower start rates and lower 
"margins." The margin is the amount you must pay over the index. For instance, 
if the index is 3% and the margin is 2.5 percentage points, you would pay 5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of lower start rates and margins can make COFI loans look like 
a tremendous bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 But in reality, when interest rates are rising, COFI loans can cost you 
substantially more than adjustable loans tied to Treasury bill rates. Why? 
Adjustment periods and interest rate caps. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical T-bill loan adjusts just once a year, has a two-percentage-point 
annual interest rate cap and a six-percentage-point lifetime cap. In other 
words, a loan that starts at 4% can jump to a maximum of 6% in year two, 8% in 
year three and 10% in all subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical COFI loan, on the other hand, adjusts monthly and has a lifetime 
interest rate cap but no annual interest rate cap. Theoretically, at least, you 
could jump from a low introductory rate to a very high rate in a short period. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate how that works out in real money, let's look at two hypothetical 
borrowers, Sally and Mike, who took out $150,000 adjustable loans in mid-April 
at Great Western Bank. (Loan rates and fees change daily.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sally opts for the COFI loan, which offered an introductory rate of 3.55% for 
three months. After that, the loan rate would float 2.35 percentage points 
above COFI, which was at 3.69% when the loan was secured. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike takes the T-bill loan, which offered a 4% introductory rate for one year 
and would then float 2.75 percentage points above the one-year Treasury index, 
which was at 4.32%. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens to Sally and Mike if interest rates rise over the next five years 
at the same rate they fell during the previous five years? Even though Sally 
starts at a lower rate and her index is rising more slowly than Mike's, she 
pays $9,302, or about 14%, more over the five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse still, if interest rates stay high, she'll pay more every year for as 
long as she maintains the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Sally's rate is "fully phased in" -- banker jargon for the fact that the 
introductory rate is over and she's paying full-fare based on the index plus 
the margin -- in the fourth month of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike gets the low introductory rate for one full year. In the second year, he 
gets the benefit of the two-percentage-point interest rate cap. Mike's rate 
should have jumped to 6.25% in the second year, but because of the cap, it only 
rose to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 In years three and four, Mike gets locked in at the going rate at the 
anniversary date, which, in a steadily rising rate environment, is the lowest 
rate of that 12-month period. Meanwhile, Sally is paying somewhat more each and 
every month. 
</P>
<P>
 They both hit their interest rate caps in the fifth year, but Mike's cap is 
set at 10%, while Sally's is at 10.95%. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean the T-bill index is better? Not necessarily. A few lenders 
offer annual interest rate caps and longer adjustment periods on COFI loans. 
When these loans are offered at competitive interest rates and fees, they could 
prove the least expensive of all. A Call to ARMs 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers choose loans that are 
tied to the one-year Treasury bill index or to the 11th District cost of funds 
index (COFI), according to the Federal Housing Finance Board in Washington. 
Here are the pros and cons of ARMs tied to the one-year Treasury bill index 
versus the COFI: 
</P>
<P>
 ONE-YEAR TREASURY BILL 
</P>
<P>
 * Pro: Annual and lifetime interest rate caps of 2 percentage points and 6 
percentage points, respectively, provide some protection against rapid interest 
rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Con: A 2 percentage point hike can be substantial, subjecting borrowers to 
payment shock. On a $200,000 loan, the payments would rise by nearly $270 when 
going to 8% from 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pro: Terms of T-bill loans are usually fairly standard, which makes it easy 
to compare rates at several financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Con: These loans are frequently sold to other lenders or into the secondary 
market, which makes it difficult to alter the terms of the loan if you ever 
need to. 
</P>
<P>
 11TH DISTRICT COST OF FUNDS 
</P>
<P>
 * Pro: Lenders are often more flexible when qualifying COFI borrowers, 
allowing individuals to take out somewhat bigger loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Con: The interest rates on these loans typically adjust more frequently, 
which can be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pro: To guard against payment shock, some lenders have payment caps, meaning 
your monthly payment can't rise above a set amount regardless of what happens 
to interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Con: Payment caps lead to something called "negative amortization," meaning 
that your loan balance actually grows with each payment because you're not 
paying enough to cover the principal and interest expense each month. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW THE INDEXES PERFORM 
</P>
<P>
 The 11th District cost of funds index tends to move more slowly than the 
one-year Treasury bill index. Quarterly closes, except latest: 
</P>
<P>
 4th, 1993 Treasury bill index: 4.73% Cost of funds index: 3.69%

 What on earth is so worrying the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan 
Greenspan, that they keep raising interest rates, trying to slow a U.S. economy 
that is just getting healthy after years of recession -- and threatening a 
California economy that is still in the convalescent ward? 
</P>
<P>
 Savings, in a word, or lack of same. The real, underlying concern of Greenspan 
and the Fed is that the U.S. savings rate has fallen back again after a brief 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget all the ballyhoo about baby boomers saving for retirement. Americans 
are saving only 4% of their disposable, after-tax incomes these days, and 
that's as low as the savings rate has gone since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is we're spending more; consumer credit card debt is going up again. 
</P>
<P>
 And the federal budget deficit, having come down to less than $200 billion, 
has stopped falling and may turn up again as well -- if for no other reason 
than rising interest rates ratchet up government borrowing costs. The deficit 
makes a difference because it soaks up half of what limited private savings 
there are. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the specter of Americans living a rake's progress, consuming today 
and putting nothing away for a chilling tomorrow, looms again. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has consequences. "The reason interest rates are going up may be no 
mystery at all," says economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution in 
Washington. "We have a capital shortage." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosworth is saying publicly what Greenspan and the other Fed governors worry 
about privately: that the gigantic U.S. economy, which has now reached $7 
trillion in annual output of goods and services, doesn't have sufficient 
resources to allow for rapid creation of more goods and services, jobs and 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if we tried to raise American living standards dramatically, we would 
quickly stretch our resources to the limit and develop bottlenecks that in turn 
would wastefully increase costs, resulting in higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want growth of 4% or more per annum, you have to accept inflation of 
3.5% or more along with it," says John Wilson, chief economist of BankAmerica 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternatives for the Fed are to finance U.S. growth by borrowing overseas, 
as was done in the 1980s, or to throttle the economy back to a level of growth 
that can be sustained. Greenspan has chosen the throttle.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has lifted short-term interest rates three times since Feb. 4. and 
seems prepared to lift them again in May, apparently with the aim of slowing 
the economy to a growth pace of 2.5% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That level of growth would not stretch our resources or accelerate inflation, 
but neither would it do much to reduce 6.5% unemployment or lift U.S. living 
standards dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's why most Americans are mystified and frustrated. The economy went 
through a long, draining recession. Practically everybody's job is insecure 
these days; raises are history, incomes aren't rising. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet at the first signs of pep and drive in the economy, along comes a guy 
named Greenspan applying the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? Greenspan is facing facts: We aren't as rich as we used to 
be. In other times, savings were greater. In the 1950s -- and '60s and '70s -- 
Americans saved 6.7% to 7.7% of their annual incomes in bank accounts and trust 
funds, mutual funds and insurance policies. And much of that money went to 
finance industry because the country didn't have a big government deficit, and 
middle-class Americans didn't have a lot of entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
 But since 1981, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
Development, "the United States has saved remarkably little of its national 
income." In the 1980s, Americans saved 4.5% of their income on average, and now 
that has fallen to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, federal deficits have ballooned thanks to a river of benefits, from 
Medicare to student loans to welfare payments, that Washington sends through 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Other countries save more. The average savings rate for 24 industrial 
countries, including all of Europe, is 9%; Japan's savings rate, even in its 
current recession, is more than 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan created the modern model for savings. After World War II, its government 
spurred industry to create jobs and then urged people to deposit tax-exempt 
savings in post office accounts, which the government then funneled to industry 
to create more jobs and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Japanese postal accounts are no longer tax-exempt as the government 
tries -- however slowly -- to shift to a consumer economy. Still, savings 
remain high in Japan because the population is growing older and both 
government and people feel the need to save for old age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are also growing older," notes economist Bosworth, "but curiously 
they are not saving more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the United States attracted foreign savings to its Treasury 
bonds, and it could do so again today. But that would push up the dollar's 
exchange rate and undermine the hard-won competitiveness of U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, foreign savings may not be there. Europe and Japan may use their 
savings to revive their own economies -- or to invest in building new markets 
in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The inescapable fact is that we need to change. The quickest way to restore 
national saving is to cut the budget deficit. The White House estimates the 
deficit will be $175 billion in the next fiscal year, but it could come in 
higher because rising interest rates mean the Treasury will have to pay more on 
its bills and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, private savings could be encouraged by tax exemptions, and the money 
could be funneled to support new industries and education so more U.S. workers 
could earn the growing incomes that led to higher savings in former times. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving more and making do with fewer entitlements won't be easy for Americans. 
But it will be more useful than blaming Greenspan and the Fed for facing facts.

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT FOR FEBRUARY ZOOMS 46% TO $9.7 BILLION; COMMERCE: THE 
DETERIORATION IS LED BY BIG DROPS IN OVERSEAS SALES OF AIRPLANES, COMPUTER 
CHIPS AND PHARMACEUTICALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. trade balance deteriorated sharply in February as a big drop in the 
sale of airplanes, computer chips and pharmaceuticals contributed to the 
nation's worst merchandise trade deficit in six years, the government said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said the deficit in goods and services widened 
unexpectedly to $9.71 billion in February, 46% higher than January's revised 
deficit of $6.64 billion. Many analysts had been looking for the deficit to 
show a slight improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The deterioration came from weakness in exports and a big jump in imports. 
Merchandise exports fell by $1.36 billion as foreign demand weakened in a 
number of areas. At the same time, merchandise imports shot up by $1.17 
billion, reflecting higher shipments of oil and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the weakness in exports was the most troubling part of the 
report, noting that American manufacturers are going to have a tough time this 
year because of sluggishness in many overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. export growth came to a shuddering stop in February," said Stephen 
Cooney, senior policy director at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. He said 
a big drop in sales to Europe was "particularly frightening" because this area 
had been one of America's top export markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists blamed recessions in Germany and other European countries and Japan 
for the weakness and said significant improvement is unlikely until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said he was reducing his 
first-quarter estimate for U.S. economic growth, as measured by the gross 
domestic product, to a rate of 3.5%, down from 4% because of the surprisingly 
bad February trade performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a development would normally spur a rally on Wall Street, where investors 
have been worried that signs of too-strong an economy would force the Federal 
Reserve Board to tighten interest rates further. The Fed on Monday announced 
that it was boosting its target for short-term interest rates to 3.75%, the 
third quarter-point tightening this year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, trading for most of the day followed a zigzag pattern with little 
direction. The Dow Jones industrial average was up less than a point to close 
at 3619.82, regaining little of the ground lost in Monday's 41.05-point selloff 
following the Fed rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The February trade report marked the second month the government has included 
services in its monthly trade data. Services, including such things as tourism, 
movie rentals and insurance, was added to the report to draw attention to the 
fact that America runs surpluses in this area that help alleviate chronic 
deficits in the merchandise area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for February, the services surplus slipped 11.2% to $4.18 billion. 
The government blamed the deterioration in part on network television payments 
for broadcasting the Winter Olympics, as well as an increase in U.S. travel to 
Norway to see the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, America's deficit in goods alone totaled $132.4 billion, the 
worst showing since 1987. However, the total deficit in goods and services was 
a lower $76.76 billion, reflecting the fact that the United States ran a 
$55.68-billion surplus in services. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, said he expects the merchandise 
deficit to top $150 billion this year, reflecting economic weakness in major 
U.S. export markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the February trade report "illustrates 
the risk to the U.S. recovery posed by slow growth abroad." He said it 
highlights the need for Europe and Japan to do more to lift their economies out 
of recession.

MICROSOFT OFFERS A GOLD STAR FOR COPYING ITS LOOK; COMPUTERS: SOFTWARE GIANT 
WILL GIVE A 'SEAL OF APPROVAL' TO PRODUCTS THAT COMPLEMENT ITS OFFICE SUITE OF 
APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest example of its unabashed aggressiveness, Microsoft Corp. plans 
to give a special marketing seal of approval to software products that adopt 
the same look and feel as the company's own suite of applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Microsoft's dominance of personal computing software, many software 
developers doubtless will conform to Microsoft's specifications. But makers of 
competing word-processing and other applications will find themselves under 
further pressure as users opt for programs that integrate well with popular 
Microsoft products. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by Microsoft to strengthen its hold on the software market comes even 
as the company is the subject of a Justice Department antitrust investigation 
into claims that it has used its dominant role in personal computer software to 
quash competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, which is to be unveiled next week, software products that 
follow specifications designed to make them work well with Microsoft's Office 
software suite will be permitted to carry the logo Microsoft Office Compatible. 
Excluded from the program will be products that compete with key Microsoft 
applications, such as word processing and spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the pieces to work together is the key," said Judy Chase, product 
manager of Microsoft Office. She said recent Microsoft studies have shown that 
consumers place more importance on integration and consistency among 
applications than on new features. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will strengthen Microsoft's position in the rapidly growing market 
for software suites, which are sets of applications that work well together and 
sell for a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 "This strengthens their hand in a very important segment of the market," said 
Chuck Stegman, group director for software at the computer research firm 
Dataquest Inc. "If you are a world leader, the strategy is to get third parties 
to fill in holes in your product line." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft grabbed 90% of the $844-million market for personal computer 
software suites last year, according to Dataquest. The company has sold 1 
million copies of an upgraded version of Office since its release in November. 
The suites have helped sell word-processing and spreadsheet products that might 
have lost out in one-on-one combat to products such as Lotus 1-2-3 and 
WordPerfect. 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics worry that the polarization of software applications into two 
or three major camps, such as the Microsoft or Lotus suites, could slow 
innovation by restricting the flexibility of developers. Chase counters that 
the new program merely sets basic standards at the level of the interface with 
users and encourages developers to be innovative in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Calera Recognition Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., for example, will soon offer 
a version of its Wordscan optical character-recognition program customized to 
work with Microsoft Office. Since it uses many of the same commands and menus, 
new users can use the program without having to learn a lot of complex new 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Software vendors benefit by getting a chance to take advantage of Microsoft's 
substantial marketing muscle. Next fall, Microsoft will distribute compact 
discs that include demonstrations of compatible applications to each buyer of 
Microsoft Office. At the huge Comdex computer trade show, Microsoft will offer 
booths to the 25 software vendors that expect to display Office-compatible 
applications at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In a talk in Anaheim on Tuesday, Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates announced 
that the next-generation version of the company's hugely popular Windows 
software will include some form of built-in access to the Internet computer 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the Chicago version of the Windows operating system, due out by 
year-end, will include a single information manager interface that will allow 
users to scan their electronic mail or voice mail messages, access faxed 
documents and connect to the Internet and other on-line systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft shares surged $5.13 to $88.13 on Tuesday in response to earnings, 
released Monday, that exceeded analysts' expectations.

BIG CALIFORNIA BANKS REPORT STRONG GAINS; FINANCE: THE STATE'S FLEDGLING 
RECOVERY LENDS A HAND. RESULTS ARE MIXED FOR LARGE MONEY-CENTER BANKS BASED IN 
NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four large California financial companies -- Wells Fargo, First Interstate, 
Great Western Financial and H.F. Ahmanson -- reported strong first-quarter 
earnings Tuesday as the state's fledgling recovery boosted business and firming 
property values allowed them to reduce their provisions for bad real estate 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo said its first-quarter earnings jumped 87% from a year ago, while 
First Interstate said its net income surged 54%. Earnings at Great Western grew 
10%, while H.F. Ahmanson -- parent of mortgage giant Home Savings of America -- 
said its net income climbed 68% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Results reported by large money-center banks headquartered in New York were 
mixed -- and all of them suffered from poor results from their trading 
operations, which were damaged by turmoil in the stock, bond and derivatives 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust reported a modest 6% gain in its first-quarter net income, but 
operating earnings dropped 29% from a year ago. Citicorp and Chemical Bank also 
said their first-quarter trading profits fell, but stronger performances from 
their lending operations sent their overall net income higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big national banks did OK, but they were blown out of the water" by the 
earnings posted by financial institutions with strong ties to California, said 
James McDermott, an analyst at investment banker Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent pickup in California's economy boosted loan demand at many of the 
state's financial institutions in the quarter, analysts said. Real estate 
values have stabilized in most parts of the state, and the number of borrowers 
behind on their payments has dropped sharply, allowing most lenders to reduce 
their provisions for loan losses: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wells Fargo's net income of $202 million, or $3.41 a share, was up 87% from 
the $108 million, or $1.72 a share, it earned in the first quarter of 1993. The 
San Francisco-based bank set aside $60 million in provisions for loan losses, 
compared to $210 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Interstate Bancorp, parent of Los Angeles-based First Interstate, 
reported first-quarter earnings of $184.1 million, or $2.21 a share. That was 
54% higher than the $119.5 million, or $1.38 a share, in operating net income 
it recorded a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * H.F. Ahmanson's 68% jump in earnings raised its first-quarter net income to 
$55.4 million, or 36 cents a share. It earned $32.9 million, or 23 cents a 
share, in the first three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irwindale-based parent of Home Savings added $75.5 million for possible 
loan losses in the first quarter of this year, including $30 million in 
reserves for losses it may sustain from borrowers whose properties were damaged 
by the Northridge earthquake. It added $67 million in reserves in the first 
quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings gains were less spectacular at Chatsworth-based Great Western 
Financial, parent of Great Western Bank. The company's first-quarter earnings 
climbed 10% to $49.5 million, or 32 cents a share, from the $45.2 million, or 
30 cents a share, it posted a year ago. The company set aside $54.8 million in 
new provisions for loan and real estate losses, down from $88 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the money-center banks, Bankers Trust New York Corp. saw its 
first-quarter earnings from operations drop 29%, but Citicorp's net climbed 65% 
and Chemical Bank's rose 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's trading income crashed, and that hurt the bottom line," said 
George Salem, an analyst at Prudential Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust -- one of the biggest players in the market for derivatives, the 
complex investments designed to hedge against fluctuations in the price of 
everything from cattle to currency -- said its trading revenue plummeted to 
just $14 million in the first quarter from $346 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
 It said overall earnings fell to $164 million, or $1.90 a share, from $230 
million, or $2.64 a share, in the first three months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Citicorp also said it suffered poor trading results but that 
those setbacks were offset by improvements in lending operations. First-quarter 
income from operations at the nation's largest banking company jumped 65% to 
$609 million, or $1.12 a share, from $370 million, 67 cents a share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's fourth-largest bank holding company, 
reported net income of $319 million, or $1.13 a share. That was 16% higher than 
its operating profit of $276 million, 95 cents a share, in the first quarter of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * HIGH GEAR: Chrysler posted record quarterly results, reflecting the boom in 
the U.S. auto industry this year. D2

PROFITS CLIMB FOR LOCKHEED, PACTEL AND PHILIP MORRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stealth fighter builder Lockheed Corp. reported 21% higher profits Tuesday, 
citing cost cutting that has sharply reduced employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs with strong first-quarter results included F-16 fighters, a program 
the company bought from General Dynamics Corp. last year; C-130 military cargo 
jets, and the F-22 next-generation stealth fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas-based aerospace contractor earned $92 million, or $1.45 a share, 
during its first quarter, compared to $76 million, or $1.22 a share, during the 
January-March period in 1993. Sales totaled $3 billion, up from $2.5 billion, 
boosted by revenue from the F-16 business. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis Group reported improved first-quarter results, bolstered by 
rising demand for telecommunications services, a stronger economy and efforts 
to restrain costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based parent of Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell earned $305 
million, or 72 cents a share, on revenue of $2.29 billion. It lost $1.73 
billion, or $4.25 a share, on revenue of $2.29 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The results for both quarters were influenced by onetime adjustments. Earnings 
last year were reduced by the adoption of new accounting standards and the 
establishment of a reserve fund for restructuring expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings this year include results from cellular, paging and international 
business units that were spun off April 1 into a new company, AirTouch 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the results of the underlying business showed some improvement 
and reflected what the company characterized as longstanding efforts to reduce 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris Cos. reported a better first-quarter performance than analysts 
had expected: 59% higher profit than last year, when results were hurt by an 
accounting rule change. The tobacco and food conglomerate said profit was off 
3.5% if the rule change is excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 That was largely because Philip Morris was charging more a year ago for 
premium cigarettes. A price war later erupted, and though the conflict has 
since cooled, prices for brands such as Marlboro are still below those of a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter ended March 31, Philip Morris earned $1.17 billion, or $1.34 a 
share, compared to $737 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts 
had expected earnings of $1.25 a share, the company said. Revenue for the 
quarter edged up 2% to $15.50 billion, from $15.19 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 results were depressed by $477 million, or 54 cents per share, due to 
required changes in accounting for retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber Group Inc. said its first-quarter profit dropped 22%, partly 
because of a decline in fixed-income revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment company earned $55.6 million, or 71 cents a share, in the 
quarter ended March 31. A year ago, it earned $70.9 million, or 89 cents a 
share. Revenue was $752.1 million, up 8% from $696.8 million in the same period 
last year.

CHRYSLER'S QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE SETS RECORD; AUTOS: THE $938-MILLION PROFIT 
MIRRORS THE BOOM THE U.S. INDUSTRY HAS ENJOYED THIS YEAR.

 Chrysler Corp. reported record quarterly sales and earnings Tuesday, a 
reflection of the fact that the U.S. auto industry is running at full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's No. 3 auto maker posted first-quarter earnings of $938 million, 
or $2.55 a share, contrasted with a loss of $4.44 billion, or $13.68 a share, 
in the first three months of 1993. Last year's results were skewed by a onetime 
charge of $4.97 billion for future retiree health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly profit is the best ever for Chrysler. The previous best 
three-month period was 1984's second quarter, when the company earned $801 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Chrysler's stock -- like those of other auto makers -- was dragged down 
Tuesday by fears that higher interest rates will curb auto sales. Chrysler 
closed $2.375 lower at $48.50, after trading as low as $47.25 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's first-quarter sales totaled $13.22 billion, surpassing the previous 
record of $12 billion set the previous quarter. Sales reached $10.90 billion in 
1993's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a profit standpoint, Chrysler is going like gangbusters," said David 
Healy, an analyst with S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's strong financial performance mirrors the boom that the U.S. auto 
industry has enjoyed this year. Both domestic and foreign manufacturers are 
enjoying double-digit sales gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the steady improvement in industry sales continuing," Chrysler 
Chairman Robert Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales demand is so strong that the company said it is having trouble meeting 
dealer orders for its Dodge Ram pickup, Neon subcompact, Jeep Grand Cherokee 
and minivans. Minivan sales were boosted by incentives designed to dissuade 
customers from buying Ford's new Windstar. The program raised Chrysler's 
average incentive to $710 per vehicle from $650 the previous quarter but 
succeeded in increasing its share of the minivan market 4 points to 48.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Chrysler's plants are running at full capacity. The company is 
spending $1.8 billion over the next three years to increase production by 
adding new shifts, expanding plants and removing bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler is also strengthening its balance sheet. The firm contributed $684 
million in the quarter to its pension fund, which had a $2.2-billion shortfall 
as of Dec. 31. It has also accumulated a cash cushion of $6.5 billion, a 
reserve it can tap during the next economic downturn.

UTILITY REGULATION PLAN IS DUE OUT TODAY; ENERGY: USERS MAY GET TO CHOOSE A 
POWER SUPPLIER. THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS THAT COMPETITION IS COMING. 
</P>

<P>
 As the California Public Utility Commission today unveils its closely guarded 
proposals for changing the way electric utilities do business, four broad 
options are on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 All are designed to accommodate the competition -- and potentially cheaper 
electricity -- that most believe is inevitable in this once-monopolistic field, 
as new technology and federal deregulation make alternative sources of power 
available: 
</P>
<P>
 * Price caps: One scenario would place caps on utility company revenue similar 
to those used in the regulation of telecommunications firms. Efficiency gains 
in one area could be used to offset unseen expenses in another; PUC hearings 
would be greatly simplified. 
</P>
<P>
 * Performance-based rate setting: This approach is favored by the utilities. 
Power companies would be rewarded in the rate-setting process for efficiency 
gains. Rates would be capped based on projected costs of operation; if costs 
were reduced below the projections, the savings would be split between 
shareholders and ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limited retail market: The PUC might call for treating different classes of 
customers in different ways. Big users could shop for their own electricity, 
while residential and commercial customers would still deal with a conventional 
utility. This approach mirrors the regulation of natural gas utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail wheeling: At the extreme is broader retail deregulation -- known as 
retail wheeling in the trade -- that could leave the utilities no more than 
transporters, rather than producers, of electricity. Users could buy power from 
independent producers -- even out-of-state utilities -- and simply arrange for 
their local utility to deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of these scenarios could be mixed and matched, and each mix would 
have different implications for customers' utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether some form of retail wheeling is part of the commission's proposal "is 
really the $64,000 question," said John L. Jurewitz, Edison's manager of 
regulatory policy. California would be embarking on an uncharted path, 
departing from known regulatory principles in setting the price for billions of 
dollars' worth of electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, these scenarios have been making the rounds of utility 
executives worldwide in a PUC document known as the Yellow Report (for the 
color of its cover). 
</P>
<P>
 The report, titled "California's Electric Services Industry: Perspectives on 
the Past, Strategies for the Future," amounts to a concise rundown of the basic 
challenges and options that regulators, electric companies and their customers 
face today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the single most widely circulated and read document on the 
future of electric generation on the face of the earth," PUC President Daniel 
W. Fessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually no one involved wants to leave the regulatory structure unchanged, 
but neither is there wide agreement on any of the solutions -- except for the 
broad notion that some sort of competition is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Deregulation has had varying results in different industries, but the one most 
often looked at as a model for electric utilities has been the market in 
natural gas. And there, many observers see success. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rough rule of thumb, natural gas deregulation is considered to be 10 
years ahead of electricity deregulation in California. And the California 
Energy Commission reports that consumers have saved billions of dollars on 
natural gas since 1983, though a more exact figure has not been calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very, very significant," said Charles R. Imbrecht, the commission's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying market forces to retail electricity sales has attracted attention in 
disparate parts of the world, from Chile and Scandinavia to Michigan and Ohio. 
When Britain began to privatize its government-owned electric utilities in 1990 
and gave them a clean slate to restructure the business, it too set up retail 
wheeling. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the largest industrial customers could choose their power supplier, 
much as one picks a long-distance phone service. By 1998, every Briton will be 
able to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The big winners so far? Mid-sized commercial and industrial users, whose rates 
have dropped 30% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no reason to think rates will drop that much in California, but, 
Fessler said, "a utility will behave in an economically rational mode." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will cater to the customers that are able to make alternative 
arrangements, and it will be far less sensitive to the needs and concerns of 
customers it regards as captive," he said. Deconstructing Deregulation 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission today will unveil proposed changes 
to the rules that govern the state's big investor-owned electric power 
companies, including Southern California Edison. Here is a short history of 
regulatory trends in the utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Traditional Electric Utility: In the 19th Century, utilities -- viewed 
as "natural monopolies" -- were granted exclusive territorial franchises. The 
assumption was that big generating plants were the most efficient, and no one 
wanted overlapping power lines from rival companies. The utility sold power at 
cost plus a regulated rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wholesale Deregulation: A 1978 federal law allowed the first non-utility 
production of energy, in part to encourage the use of non-fossil fuels. A 1992 
law opened the utilities' transmission lines to these independent producers. 
Low-cost natural gas, efficient gas-fired turbines and cogeneration plants 
allow other companies to compete with utilities. Utilities must buy electricity 
from this new market of independent producers if it is cheaper than their own 
power. They still sell at cost plus a regulated return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail Deregulation: Among the options under consideration by the PUC is 
"retail wheeling," which would allow big industrial customers -- and perhaps 
others, eventually -- to shop for power among various generators. The utility's 
only job would be transmitting the electricity. Proponents say this could apply 
market forces that would drastically cut electric rates. The utilities say 
price caps on their revenue would do the same thing without disrupting the 
utility system. Environmentalists say the lower power bills might come at the 
cost of environmental and social benefits.

 More Banks Raise Prime Lending Rates: A second wave of banks raised their 
prime lending rates by half a percentage point, following the lead of some of 
the largest banks. Monday, the nation's largest banks, led by Citibank and 
Chemical Banking Corp., raised their base lending rates to 6.75% from 6.25% 
after the Fed boosted short-term interest rates. Tuesday, BankAmerica Corp. and 
Chase Manhattan raised their prime rates correspondingly, as did San 
Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., City National Bank of Beverly Hills and 
others. The prime rate is generally what banks charge their best commercial 
customers. It also serves as a benchmark for credit card and other consumer 
rates.

 Teamsters, Trucking Firms Continue Talks: The union and hauling companies said 
they will form subcommittees to review and discuss the major issues that 
triggered a nationwide strike two weeks ago.Truck Management Inc., which 
represents the 20 firms that remain in the strike, said that "there are still 
wide gaps dividing the parties" but agreed to keep talks open. The strike began 
over management proposals to add part-time workers in truck terminals, ship 
more freight on trains and use binding arbitration to settle contract disputes. 
More than 70,000 Teamsters are still on the picket lines.

 SBA Made Quake Disaster Loans Totaling $1 Billion: The figure is a new record 
for SBA assistance in a single disaster, said Mike Howland, acting regional 
administrator for the federal Small Business Administration. He said the agency 
is getting faster at processing the flood of applications it received, taking 
two months to reach the first $500 million in approvals and only one month to 
reach the second $500 million. Still, the SBA, which has approved more than 
35,000 low-interest loans to homeowners, renters and business owners, has many 
thousands more applications to process.

 Earthquake Leads to Ratings Cut for 20th Century: Standard & Poor's Corp. 
reduced its ratings of 20th Century Industries' two insurance units, citing an 
expected $325 million in claims due to the Northridge earthquake.S&P's ratings 
of the claims-paying abilities of 20th Century Insurance Co. and 21st Century 
Casualty Co. fell to A from AA. The insurers continue to be on CreditWatch with 
negative implications, the rating agency said. Payment of the claims will 
result in a $161.7-million charge against 20th Century's first-quarter 
earnings, which S&P said will wipe out 26% of its surplus.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to require investment advisers 
that run "wrap-fee" programs to provide better information on the cost of the 
accounts and how they are managed.Wrap-fee programs sponsored by brokerage 
firms combine asset-management and transaction costs in one flat fee, typically 
about 3% a year, based on a percentage of assets under management. By Oct. 1, 
brokerage firms will have to give investors separate brochures when they open 
wrap-fee accounts. Currently, an investor opening such an account receives a 
thick disclosure statement called Form ADV, which is like a prospectus on the 
investment adviser.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: UTILITY INDEX'S STRENGTH COULD SIGNAL A BOTTOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the stock market trying to make a stand here? 
</P>
<P>
 It may not have looked like it on Monday, when the Federal Reserve Board 
tightened credit again and the Dow industrials dove 41 points. Yet some Wall 
Streeters saw indications of a bottom -- at least a near-term bottom -- that 
day, and more such signs on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow rebounded from a loss of more than 30 points at midday Tuesday to 
close down only 0.60 point at 3,619.82. As during the April 4 selling frenzy 
(that memorable Monday after Easter), buyers appeared to swarm as soon as the 
Dow dipped below 3,600. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, there has been surprising strength lately in electric utility 
and financial stocks, whose declines last fall were a foreshock to this year's 
broad market slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow utility index fell only marginally Monday, despite the industrials' 
plunge. And on Tuesday, the utility index rose 1.45 points, or 0.8%, to 195.56, 
making it the only major stock index to post a meaningful gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulls believe there's a powerful message here if the rebound in the 
beaten-down utilities, banks, brokerages and other interest-rate- sensitive 
stocks can be sustained: Because those groups' collective plunge had so 
accurately predicted the recent rise in rates, a turnaround in the stocks could 
mean the market believes rates are ready to plateau, if not decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The financial stocks are acting as if the worst is over for interest rates," 
says Andrew Addison, publisher of the Addison Report investment newsletter and 
a veteran technical market analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Eakle, head of money manager Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J., 
agrees. Anyone smart enough to recognize the implications of the Dow utilities' 
peak last Aug. 31 -- five months before the Dow industrials peaked -- should 
also realize that the utilities' early-warning system often works in both 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The utilities tend to bottom before the rest of the market and signal a 
change in direction" of stock prices in general, Eakle says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it may be early to be calling a bottom in financial stocks. The Fed 
is expected to raise short-term money market rates, now at 3.75%, to at least 
4% before summer in an effort to keep the economy from overheating. And if the 
expansion keeps rolling along, Wall Street may conclude that 5% short-term 
rates are likely by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that level of rates is priced into financial stocks is far from 
certain. If not, the utilities and banks could take another bad spill this 
summer or fall, even though they have already plunged 20% or more from their 
'93 peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's worth noting that many bank stocks have responded positively this 
week to their quarterly earnings reports, while technology and auto stocks -- 
the market's leaders until recently -- have mostly been bludgeoned by profit 
takers despite strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, First Interstate Bancorp shares rose 37.5 cents to $77.375 after 
reporting first-quarter earnings. Bankers Trust added 50 cents to $70 on its 
profit report, and NationsBank leaped $1.125 to $53.375, a 1994 high. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Chrysler plunged $2.375 to $48.50 on Tuesday even though it 
reported a record quarter. And computer chip giant Intel fell $1 to $57.50, a 
1994 low, after its earnings failed to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 What the nibbling at bank, utility and other such stocks could indicate is 
that investors are turning sharply "defensive" -- meaning they're factoring in 
the chance of a significant slowdown in the economy this summer and fall 
because of the surge in interest rates. A weaker economy would be a negative 
for industrial and technology companies, but it would help financial and 
utility stocks if the end result is another decline in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors' defensive mind-set has been evident throughout the market's recent 
slide. Most of the stock groups that have held up best have been classic 
defensive plays such as grocery and drugstore chains -- businesses that tend to 
enjoy stable demand rather than boom-and-bust cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 If more investors shift to a "hunker-down" mentality, selling of industrial 
and tech issues could accelerate, while groups such as drug companies, food 
makers and energy firms could revive along with financial and utility issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Wall Streeters still believe that defensive stocks are at best a 
short-term play and that the real market leadership over the next two years 
will remain the industrial and tech issues -- assuming global growth isn't 
completely derailed. You can sell those stocks now, some pros say, but only if 
you think you'll be quick enough to buy them back before they blast off again. 
The Best Defense? 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest stock groups since the Fed's initial credit-tightening move Feb. 
4 have mostly been classic "defensive" consumer products industries, while the 
housing sector has taken the biggest hits.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; PEACHTREE OFFERS A STEP UP FROM CHECKBOOK SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the dawn of the personal computer era, the name Peachtree has been 
synonymous with small-business accounting software. Now, for the fifth time in 
its 19-year history, Peachtree and its five separate accounting packages have a 
new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In early April, Automatic Data Processing Inc. acquired the Norcross, 
Ga.-based software publisher and plans soon to offer ADP electronic payroll and 
banking services to Peachtree users. 
</P>
<P>
 The most powerful member of the lineup is Peachtree Complete Accounting, 
version seven, a program that runs on IBM-compatible computers with the DOS 
operating system. It has a suggested price of $249 for a single user or $399 
for a multi-user network version. Peachtree Complete is also the most difficult 
of the versions to set up and use, for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Peachtree Accounting for Windows (release 2.0, $169) is easier to use both 
because it is a Windows program and because it takes a less rigid approach to 
double-entry accounting than the DOS version. 
</P>
<P>
 A better buy, for people with a CD-ROM drive attached to their computers, is 
the just-released $169 CD-ROM version of Peachtree Accounting for Windows. You 
give up printed manuals for on-screen versions (which can be printed). But in 
return you get a collection of other software, including the complete text of 
12 popular books in the Business Library by Allegro; Label Pro by Avery for 
label printing; WinCim, the Windows program for using CompuServe, and TaxCut, a 
program that probably became obsolete for everyone who filed their tax return 
on time earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Macintosh users have not been ignored by Peachtree. The more powerful of its 
two Mac programs is Peachtree Insight for Macintosh, with a price of $395. The 
less powerful version is Peachtree Accounting for Macintosh ($169). Peachtree 
says its typical customer is a firm with seven employees, and all its versions 
are aimed at small to medium-sized businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 They offer a step up from checkbook management software, which many very small 
businesses start out using, because they are based on true double-entry 
accounting. In other words, every transaction is accounted for with offsetting 
entries in separate accounts so that the books are always balanced. You can't 
spend money without the source of the funds and the financial consequence of 
the expenditure being accounted for in a double-entry system. The same is true 
for income. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs come with an excellent primer on accounting that explains these 
principles in simple terms. The programs already have the double-entry and 
offsetting accounts built in, although you have to supply the actual account 
names for your business. Charts of accounts for a dozen sample companies help 
you get started. 
</P>
<P>
 One feature of the Windows and lower-priced Macintosh versions is that they 
can be used in "real-time" mode, while the more powerful DOS and Macintosh 
Insight versions can run only in "batch" mode. 
</P>
<P>
 In real-time mode, transactions are posted to the general ledger as soon as 
they are entered. In batch mode, they are saved in a temporary journal and then 
posted as a group at the end of a reporting period. It is easier to change a 
transaction in real-time mode. Changing a transaction in the DOS version 
requires entering a separate reversing transaction, which ensures that the 
audit trail is more complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Another accounting difference is that the cheaper versions allow cash-basis 
accounting, whereas the more powerful versions allow only the more common 
accrual accounting method. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need to do job costing, the DOS version is the only one that fully 
implements that feature. What is called job costing in the Windows version is 
more of a job-tracking feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Other advanced features exclusive to the DOS version include tracking partial 
receipt of purchase orders; full order entry with support for back orders; 
picking and packing slips for orders, with printing in the shipping department 
on networked systems; custom discount rates for each customer; warning when 
sales exceed inventory; payroll commission and draw pay types in addition to 
the salary and hourly methods in the other versions, and five methods of 
computing cost of inventory.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES; 
PATENT SUIT JURY TRIALS ARE THE RAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patent litigation is booming, and more patent disputes are being decided by 
jury trials -- often for astronomical sums. Therein lies the reason for a 
change in how these lawsuits are handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surveys of real and surrogate jurors indicate they strongly favor patentees," 
patent attorney Timothy L. Swabb wrote in the newsletter Intellectual Property 
Report. "Jurors have a high regard for the U.S. Patent Office and for the 
patent system, although generally they know little about their actual 
workings." 
</P>
<P>
 Swabb found that in the 12 months ended June 30, 1972, 121 patent suits were 
tried, but only two involved juries. The figures for the comparable period 20 
years later: 100 trials, 51 of which had juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart lawyers for patent holders want juries because jurors tend to favor 
independent inventors and small companies over large or foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Swabb said jury awards also tend to be larger. He cited a $1.2-billion jury 
award to Litton Industries Inc. last year in its patent infringement suit 
against Honeywell; the jury also found the infringement to be willful, "raising 
the specter of additional damages and attorneys' fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, jury verdicts in favor of patent holders are likely to be upheld on 
appeal, said Swabb, whose law firm, Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson, 
publishes the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In patent cases, Swabb said, winning the jury's sympathy is crucial. "The 
demeanor of the inventor and the corporate representative may be more important 
than the analyses offered by the battling experts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juries may soon lose some of their influence in this arena; federal appeals 
panels "have shown an inclination to take some important issues away from the 
jury and put them into the hands of the trial judge," Swabb said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that there is no going back; now that patent holders -- and their 
lawyers -- know juries give them an edge, "jury-tried patent cases seem here to 
stay." DANIEL AKST

WHAT EVERY BUYER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When choosing an adjustable-rate mortgage, weigh the loan terms carefully. 
Here is a guide to the important terms of an ARM. 
</P>
<P>
 * Introductory rate: Most adjustable loans have a low starting rate, typically 
called an intro rate. A recent survey of lenders found introductory rates as 
low as 2.95%. However, you also need to know how long this bargain-basement 
rate will last. Sometimes it's set for just three months. In other cases, you 
get the introductory rate for as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Index: After the introductory period, the cost of an ARM is based on an 
interest rate index. The most popular are the one-year Treasury index and the 
11th District cost of funds index (COFI), which is based on borrowing costs for 
West Coast savings and loans. Some loans are also tied to the London Interbank 
Offered Rate or the banks' prime rate. Generally speaking, indexes based on a 
lender's cost of funds, such as COFI, move the slowest. The others move fairly 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Margin: To determine your interest rate, add the current index number to the 
"margin" -- the amount above the index that you pay. For instance, if the 
margin on your loan is 2.5 percentage points and the index is 4%, you'll pay 
6.5%. Commonly, the margins on COFI loans range between 2.35 and 2.75 
percentage points, while the margins on T-bill loans are somewhat higher -- 
usually between 2.75 and 2.875 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Annual interest rate caps: Many ARMs offer annual interest rate caps of two 
percentage points. That's the most your loan rate could rise in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 If your loan rate starts at 4%, for example, the rate couldn't exceed 6% in 
year two, 8% in year three or 10% in year four -- no matter what happened to 
interest rates during those years. Annual rate caps are an important fail-safe 
measure if you happen to secure an ARM when interest rates are rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lifetime rate caps: Almost all ARMs have lifetime interest rate caps that 
limit the topmost rate you could potentially pay on the loan. A standard 
lifetime interest rate cap is six percentage points above the introductory rate 
-- so if the intro rate is 4%, the loan could never go higher than 10%. 
However, some loans cap at five percentage points above the start rate and 
others cap at eight points (or more) above the introductory rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adjustment periods: ARMs can adjust annually, semiannually or monthly. 
Annual adjustments are generally better when rates are rising, while monthly 
adjustments are preferable when rates are coming down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Payment caps: To avoid "payment shock," some lenders offer to cap increases 
in your monthly payments. Great Western and Home Savings, for example, have 
7.5% annual payment caps on their COFI loans. If interest rates boost your 
payment by more than 7.5%, the difference is added to the loan amount -- a 
phenomenon called negative amortization. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you were paying $1,000 monthly on your $100,000 mortgage and 
rates popped up to the point where you would owe $1,200 monthly, the payment 
cap would kick in. You could opt to pay just $1,075, or 7.5% more than before, 
and add the $125 monthly difference to the balance due on the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Negative amortization: If negative amortization kicks in, your loan balance 
rises with each mortgage payment because your payment isn't enough to cover the 
principal and interest due. KATHY M. KRISTOF

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; A BETTER PATH TO POWER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most electric power is produced by burning fuel to boil water into steam, 
which turns the fan-like blades of a turbine, generating electricity. The steam 
is then condensed back into water for reuse in what is known as a thermodynamic 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional power generation relies on the Rankine cycle, which uses ordinary 
water. But the proposed new Kalina cycle appears to be much more efficient, 
thanks to a mixture that starts out in the boiler as 70% ammonia, 30% water. 
Such mixes are more efficient in boilers but have been difficult to condense. 
The Kalina technology uses a new process that takes advantage of efficiencies 
obtained by varying the ratio of ammonia to water at successive stages during 
condensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The invention of Alexander Kalina, an engineer who emigrated to the United 
States from Russia in 1978, the Kalina technology is billed by proponents as 
the first new electricity-generating thermodynamic cycle in a century. It could 
dramatically increase the generating efficiency -- by 20% or more -- of the 
immense utility steam-turbines that produce 70% of the nation's electric power, 
using virtually any fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The cycle's principles have already been successfully demonstrated by 
researchers at the Energy Technology Engineering Center, a Department of Energy 
facility near Simi Valley that is operated by the Rocketdyne unit of Rockwell 
International. The center has the sole operating model in the world. How the 
Kalina Cycle Works: 
</P>
<P>
 A 70% ammonia solution is first boiled (1) to produce steam to turn the 
generator (2). Then the used steam is condensed back to liquid in a complex 
system that replaces the single condenser in conventional power plants. Energy 
is saved as parts of the stream are split off and remixed at different 
temperatures, pressures and ammonia mixtures. Finally, the separate streams are 
reformed as a 70% solution (3) to return to the boiler.

 A Superglue for Gums: A problem for millions of people who suffer from gum 
disease is that as supporting gum tissue recedes from teeth, it leaves pockets 
that can trap infectious bacteria. Unless the pockets are closed, often through 
painful and expensive surgery, the bacteria can attack the supporting bone 
under the teeth and eventually cause tooth loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Biochemists at the University of California, San Francisco, have discovered a 
synthetic collagen that can reverse the damage caused by gum disease. When 
tooth surfaces are coated with the substance, called P-15, the gum tissue's 
cells bind with the collagen to fill the pocket. "We can actually replace bone 
tissue lost as the result of gum disease," said Rajendra S. Bhatnagar, a 
biochemist and professor of somatology in UCSF's School of Dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
 New Energy for Batteries: The time-worn chemistry of batteries is getting an 
update to meet the demands of portable computer users who want a battery that 
really does keep going and going and going. As a result, nickel cadmium (NiCad) 
batteries, once the only rechargeables on the market, are being replaced by 
newer technologies, mainly nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickel-metal hydride batteries solve many of the problems associated with 
NiCads. They offer longer battery life and far less toxicity. Duracell has 
chosen NiMH for its entry into the rechargeable market. Virtually all the 
leading notebook computer makers use NiMH batteries in the latest versions of 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Lithium-ion batteries supply up to seven hours of continuous running time. 
Lithium has presented problems in the past because the metal can become 
unstable and explode, but today's batteries use a lithium compound rather than 
the pure metal. For now, Toshiba is the only company using a lithium-ion 
battery in a notebook PC. The other company making these batteries is Sony, 
which makes only small cells for its camcorders and compact disc players. 
</P>
<P>
 May I See Your Fingerprint, Please?: Until recently, the primary market for 
fingerprint identification systems has been law enforcement agencies. But 
Printrak International Inc., based in Anaheim, believes new technologies make 
it possible to use fingerprints to identify everyone from applicants for a 
driver's license to welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Messy ink pads have been replaced by a technology called "live scan." The unit 
performs sophisticated analysis of an individual's fingerprint ridge 
information and transmits the data digitally to a central database for 
matching. 
</P>
<P>
 The scan unit can compress the data for each fingerprint so transmission is 
almost instantaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 The public isn't the only sector interested in knowing who's who. Current 
estimates are that worldwide credit card fraud is costing card issuers $1.4 
billion annually. Photo ID cards and holograms have not deterred skilled 
counterfeiters, so MasterCard International is experimenting with live scan 
fingerprint technology. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

 Last September, just when it was becoming hip to have an Internet address, 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. bought Delphi Internet Services, the nation's 
largest provider of access to the globe-spanning web of computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for the executives and engineers tinkering away at Delphi's 
Cambridge, Mass.-based headquarters has been to transform the somewhat obscure 
firm into a user-friendly, entertainment-oriented service capable of competing 
with better known rivals in the field -- such as America Online and Prodigy -- 
without alienating its techie base. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan is to develop electronic versions of News Corp.'s media properties, 
such as TV Guide, and distribute them on-line. Subscriptions have doubled to 
100,000 in the last six months, but that's still a long way from the 1-million 
mark News Corp. executives hope to reach by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's new territory for the media conglomerate, whose extensive holdings 
include newspapers, the Fox television network, book publisher HarperCollins, 
and Star TV, an Asian satellite television service. Stanley Honey, who heads 
News Corp.'s technology group, talked recently about the firm's plans to 
capitalize on its on-line acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why does News Corp. want to own an on-line computer service? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a couple of different reasons. One of them is that News Corp. has 
been active in all other forms of advanced media, and this was the one 
omission. The other reason is that we're starting to realize that interactivity 
really means something a little different than we thought. We're not sure that 
interactivity means people interacting with a computer because, other than boys 
playing video games, not many people find that compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 News Corp.'s view of new media is that something very interesting is 
happening, where it's becoming real clear that people are very interested in 
interacting with one another and yet, due to the richness of media, as things 
evolve, people's interests are getting narrower and narrower. And the on-line 
area provides a great environment for people to pursue their narrow interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your vision for Delphi's future? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Today Delphi is really a service that's focusing on the computer 
enthusiast, and it has the most, the broadest and most powerful access to the 
Internet of any of the on-line services. But it's still a text-only service. 
We're going to evolve that into an extremely flexible and powerful graphic 
interface. But the objective is to not lose any of the current subscriber 
devotion, which is really the computer enthusiasts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the fact that the Internet is still pretty much unintelligible to 
non-nerds make it difficult for Delphi to expand its appeal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. The Internet is just sort of one place on Delphi that holds a lot of 
interest for people, and today Delphi's interface to the Internet actually 
makes the Internet reasonably accessible to the non-propeller head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do people find so compelling about on-line interaction? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For me, the thing that's most interesting is to find people with closely 
held opinions that either agree or disagree violently with mine in fairly 
narrow areas. You know, some years ago people all kind of read the paper and 
you could sort of characterize your interests as you're a Republican or a 
Democrat, and you could go to a bar and you could find people to discuss those 
closely held opinions. Nowadays, the diversity of media is such that people 
characterize themselves as environmental activists or feminists, and the issues 
that people feel strongly about are much more numerous and much narrower. And 
the on-line environment gives people a way of sort of finding a bar that has 
those 12 people in it from around the country that are most interested in much 
narrower fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's another part, which is the interaction with other humans, even 
though it may be anonymous, trying out different points of view or personality 
traits and just sort of exploring that interaction. And I'm really defining 
interaction as being where you do something and you get a reaction back that 
has incorporated genuine human intelligence and is unexpected. As opposed to a 
video game or something where you're interacting with it, or an encyclopedia on 
CD-ROM, where in principle you're interacting with it but, nevertheless, the 
answer you get back is mostly what you expected the thing to do. So there's no 
real human intellect involved in the interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, but in that case, why would someone go to an on-line service to do 
something like read TV Guide?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They wouldn't. And nobody really expects you to be sitting on your couch 
and then you finish a TV show and you wonder what's on next, so you get up out 
of the couch, walk into the office, boot up the computer, log in and see what's 
on next. What we would expect to happen is that if you see an episode of "Star 
Trek" and you're a Trekkie and this is particularly interesting to you and you 
think that this is an issue where they have violated ("Star Trek" creator Gene) 
Roddenberry's ethics on this thing and they're undermining the whole concept of 
the show, you are going to be able to go to the TV Guide forum on-line, and 
there you're going to find access to the discussion at large on this topic. And 
so the TV Guide on-line will be the place you go to talk about and find out 
more about TV. Now, there would also be in the TV Guide on-line forum much more 
in-depth information about TV shows than the print product would have. You 
could do things like search for the next Bogart movie or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are you using Delphi to exploit News Corp.'s other media assets? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think it's so much Delphi exploiting other media assets as it is 
the other media companies using Delphi to allow them to promote a new service 
to these new customers that own PCs. The TV Guide on-line and the Fox football 
and HarperCollins assets and reference and education and children's and so 
forth on Delphi -- this isn't a matter of Delphi exploiting those content 
items. It's really a matter of Delphi helping those companies to bring their 
products into additional media forms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will Delphi include content that isn't owned by News Corp.? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, we're aggressively recruiting other content providers.

<TEXT>
<P>
 John McLiam, a Broadway character actor who also worked extensively in films 
and television from "My Fair Lady" to "Dynasty," has died. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 McLiam died Saturday in Woodland Hills after suffering from Parkinson's 
disease and melanoma, his wife, Roberta, said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known for a remarkable facility with speaking in various accents --

 Born John Williams, the actor later assumed the Gaelic version of his surname, 
McLiam, as his stage name. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied English at St. Mary's College in Northern California and earned a 
master's degree from UC Berkeley. During World War II, McLiam served as an 
intelligence officer in the Navy, earning a Bronze Star. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief stint as a reporter for the San Francisco Examiner, he appeared 
in a couple of plays and did so well that he moved to New York to go into 
theater. After studying playwriting, acting and directing, he made his Broadway 
debut as an actor in "Barefoot in Athens" in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, McLiam appeared in several Broadway plays and scores of

J. VAN DER ZEE; MORTGAGE LOAN EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John R. Van der Zee, Southern California banking executive for 35 years and 
former president of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce, has died. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Van der Zee died Sunday at his home in Rolling Hills, his son, James, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage loan expert was named 1971 Man of the Year by the City of Hope 
for his charitable work for that medical center, which specializes in treating 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Educated at Loyola University and the Rutgers University Graduate School of 
Banking, Van der Zee began his banking career with United California Bank in 
1945 and retired from its successor, First Interstate Bank, in 1980. He left 
the bank briefly in 1959 to serve as president of Western Mortgage Corp., at 
that time the largest mortgage banking firm in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Van der Zee became executive vice president at California Bank in 
charge of its statewide mortgage lending and its 361 statewide branches with 
about 8,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Van der Zee also served as president of the International Student Center at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, James, of Torrance, Van der Zee is survived by two 
other sons, John, of Glendale, and Peter, of Rolling Hills Estates; a daughter, 
Virginia, of Rolling Hills Estates, and five sisters. His wife, Pat, preceded 
him in death.

ASSEMBLY PANEL SUPPORTS LAWS BACKED BY INSURERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for the insurance industry, the Assembly Insurance Committee on 
Tuesday rejected legislation that would have repealed a series of 
industry-sponsored laws that critics say have watered down provisions of 
Proposition 103, the initiative designed to reduce premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one vote for the measure, AB 3445 by Assemblyman Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles), and three against, with several abstentions.Margolin promised 
to have the bill reconsidered at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 was approved by voters in 1988. Among other things, it 
required insurance rate rollbacks of 20%. It also required the state insurance 
commissioner to review proposed rate increases before they take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, a candidate for insurance commissioner, maintains that his bill 
would close loopholes that have eroded the proposition's intent. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, Jeff Fuller, 
called Margolin's bill a "plainly pitiful attempt to preclude the Legislature 
from perfectly valid attempts to interpret and implement the fundamental will 
of the electorate expressed through the initiative process."

PANEL TO PROBE HARASSMENT IN LAPD URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg is prepared to recommend sweeping changes in the 
way the Los Angeles Police Department deals with complaints of sexual 
harassment by police officers, according to a memo by Goldberg to two of her 
colleagues on the City Council's Personnel Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's proposals would make significant changes in the way the department 
investigates complaints, trains officers and punishes those who violate sexual 
harassment rules. As she has in the past, Goldberg also recommended that the 
LAPD set a goal of 43.4% women in its ranks -- a percentage that matches the 
representation of women in the work force generally. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's most revolutionary suggestion is that a special civilian unit be 
created to investigate harassment and discrimination complaints. The unit would 
report directly to the civilian Board of Police Commissioners rather than to 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Personnel Committee, which Goldberg heads, is scheduled to address LAPD 
sexual harassment at its meeting this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes such as those proposed by Goldberg would ultimately require approval 
of the full City Council, which controls the department's budget, and the 
Police Commission, which oversees the LAPD's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's recommendations -- which, the councilwoman emphasized in her memo, 
are not final proposals but instead are offered "as a way to begin the 
discussion of solutions to the problem of sexual harassment in the LAPD" -- 
grow out of news reports documenting widespread allegations of harassment, as 
well as two hearings the Personnel Committee held on the subject last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear from the testimony that the LAPD culture has a much higher 
tolerance for sexual harassment than do most other work cultures," Goldberg 
said in her April 18 memo, which is addressed to her two Personnel Committee 
colleagues, Councilmen Mike Hernandez and Mark Ridley-Thomas. "By insulating 
the investigative process within that culture, we are denying ourselves the 
perspective of civilians who may more accurately reflect the views of what is 
tolerable. Not incidentally, those views may be closer to those of a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with mounting numbers of harassment complaints and lawsuits, Williams 
has already proposed the creation of a special unit to investigate harassment 
and discrimination. Under the current system, those complaints are investigated 
by the LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, but some female officers have 
complained about the Internal Affairs Division and have expressed reluctance to 
make complaints as long as the unit is in charge of investigating them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has expressed support for the new unit, Williams has not spelled 
out how it would function or to whom it would report. Some department insiders 
have suggested that it would probably be made up of police officers and would 
report to the chief.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's suggestion more closely parallels a recommendation by Danny L. 
Staggs, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League. Staggs testified 
at one of the Personnel Committee hearings on harassment and recommended that 
the special unit report to the commission rather than the chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Deirdre Hill, vice president of the Police Commission, said Goldberg's 
proposal "certainly merits examination," but added that she has some concerns 
about how it is structured. 
</P>
<P>
 "One concern would be that you'd have to make sure a civilian unit would have 
insight into what's going on with sworn officers," Hill said. She added, "If 
the unit is going to be assigned to the commission, certainly the chief would 
still need to be very involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her recommendations regarding the special unit, Goldberg 
proposed that the city hire an outside consultant to review the LAPD's sexual 
harassment policies and procedures.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg also urged that the LAPD appoint someone to counsel and represent 
officers who complain of discrimination, and that the department bring 
administrative charges against officers who retaliate against those who lodge 
harassment or discrimination complaints.

BLACK, POOR MEDICARE PATIENTS GET WORSE CARE; HOSPITALS: MORE AFFLUENT ELDERLY 
PATIENTS RECEIVED BETTER TREATMENT, RAND STUDY FINDS. BUT HIGHER-QUALITY 
TEACHING FACILITIES MINIMIZED SOME SHORTCOMINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Adding to the evidence showing that race and income may determine the quality 
of health care Americans receive, a new study shows that black and poor 
patients with Medicare cards receive worse hospital care than other acutely ill 
elderly patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, to be published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., 
analyzed nearly 10,000 patients' records at 297 hospitals in five states. The 
researchers at RAND, the Santa Monica think tank, found that the black and 
low-income elderly people fared worse than other Medicare patients whether they 
were treated at small rural hospitals or urban teaching hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 47% of the black and poor Medicare patients considered to be seriously 
ill when they were admitted were put into intensive care units, compared to 70% 
of the more affluent Medicare patients, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also said that nurses checked more frequently for breathing 
difficulties in new pneumonia patients who were affluent than those who were 
poor and black, and that doctors were less likely to find out what kinds of 
medicines the poor and black patients were using before hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other findings of the study, the researchers said that 19% of black 
and poor patients were discharged from hospitals in unstable condition, meaning 
they were still suffering from at least one serious health problem, compared to 
14% of the rest of the group. At the same time, the poorer care received by 
black and low-income patients tended to be minimized because they were nearly 
twice as likely to be treated at higher-quality urban teaching hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said these teaching hospitals, usually located in urban 
centers, were so extraordinary that they often compensated for the poorer 
quality of care given to the patients who were black or from low-income 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because these patients receive more of their care in better-quality 
hospitals, there are no overall differences in quality by race and poverty 
status," the authors said, while taking care to note that this was not the case 
within individual hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that death rates were about the same for all the patients 
surveyed. That finding runs counter to several earlier studies that found that 
blacks and the poor have higher mortality rates for certain diseases.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Katherine Kahn, the study's lead author, said it was possible that her 
study, even though it examined 9,932 Medicare patients, may not have been broad 
enough to develop meaningful data on death rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey has some clear implications for national health care reform because 
much of the debate is being driven by a belief that giving everyone a health 
insurance card will solve many of the nation's health care ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, funded by two federal health agencies, clearly shows that simply 
possessing a Medicare card does not create an equal health status in the 
nation's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that health reformers have to pay attention to improving the 
quality of care blacks and the poor receive as well as to expanding their 
access," said Kahn, an internist who teaches at UCLA Medical School in addition 
to her research work at RAND. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn said she felt that racism clearly was a contributing factor in the 
differences in medical care, but said that it would take a different study to 
explore that issue. "Doctors and nurses have to be aware of these kinds of 
differences," she said. "There clearly could be stereotyping, discrimination or 
bias going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, a spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
said the study's findings were further evidence that color and economic status 
make a difference in obtaining care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any question that color and economic status has made a 
difference in the past," he said. "I think slowly the health care system has 
come to terms with that and is lowering the gap. Yes, we have had care that has 
been unequal, and yes, it is slowly becoming more equal." 
</P>
<P>
 His association represents 230 health care institutions in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Langness said that one of the problems with today's health system, something 
he hopes will be rectified if Congress and President Clinton can reach an 
agreement on a health reform plan, is that there is no set standard or minimum 
threshold for care. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals included in the study were not identified. The 297 hospitals 
were in 30 urban and rural areas in California, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida 
and Indiana, Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers analyzed the medical records, notes, and documents filed by 
physicians, nurses and others -- for patients who were admitted to hospitals 
for congestive heart failure, a heart attack, pneumonia or a stroke.

QUAKE CLEANUP GETS A SECOND WIND; RECOVERY: OFFICIALS SHIFT FUNDS FROM OTHER 
PROGRAMS AND HIRE MORE CONTRACTORS TO COVER FREE REMOVAL. MORE FEDERAL MONEY IS 
ALSO EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 More than three months after the Northridge earthquake, many streets in the 
San Fernando Valley still look like scenes from the town of Bedrock -- with 
piles of concrete rubble heaped at curbs waiting for city crews to haul them 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning up after January's 6.8 temblor has proved far more difficult and 
vastly more expensive than anyone figured in the days immediately after the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of debris created by this earthquake is phenomenal," said Andres 
Santamaria, head of the city's Earthquake Recovery Division. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Los Angeles residents can expect to wait as long as a month or 
more for quake debris to be hauled away. City officials estimate that cleanup 
costs in the city could balloon from $30 million to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To help quicken the pace, the City Council on Tuesday gave preliminary 
approval to a private company to haul debris by railroad car from Van Nuys to 
Utah, preserving space in local landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners, mostly from the Valley, are flooding City Hall with telephone 
calls, as many as 600 a day, to get rid of the debris. Already, about 200,000 
tons of junk has been scooped up and trucked off. 
</P>
<P>
 And city officials predict that they will haul away at least that much more 
before the end of the summer because many residents are only now beginning 
repairs as insurance checks begin to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of debris caught the city off guard, Santamaria said. By the 
beginning of April, the city had spent most of its money allocated for debris 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is good news for neighbors who must maneuver their cars through 
streets made narrow by the piles of rubble: More money is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget shortfall caused a two-week slowdown in cleanup this month. The 
number of contractors hired to haul debris was slashed from 30 to three. But 
the city has hired 20 more contractors by shifting money from other programs 
and there are plans to hire another 20 firms as soon as more federal money 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 City cleanup efforts began within days of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Residents 
were promised free removal of quake-related debris such as wood, bricks or 
chunks of concrete. The free service saved residents as much as $500 per 
truckload, the cost of hauling the debris to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 With that kind of savings, many residents said they are willing to put up with 
the mess in front of their houses for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks resident Heather Bertini was told that it may be four weeks until 
the concrete pile that was once her pool deck is hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the four-foot high pile juts into narrow Greenleaf Street, causing 
bottlenecks when Sherman Oaks Elementary School lets out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind waiting," Bertini said. Shortly after the quake, Bertini hired a 
contractor to haul away about half as much debris for $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the quake, most of the debris consisted of bricks from 
toppled chimneys and smaller household items broken during the temblor, 
Santamaria said. But as federal disaster agencies and private insurance 
companies begin issuing checks to begin rebuilding, the debris has grown to 
include large pieces of buildings undergoing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the big bulky items are coming forth," Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials originally estimated that cleanup efforts would cost $30 
million, most of which would be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. By comparison, cleaning up after the 1992 riots cost just under $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the course of three months, city officials realized that their 
estimates were too low, said Pat Bonino, who is overseeing the spending of 
disaster aid for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By April, debris removal was estimated to cost almost as much as the total 
allocated for cleanup and the demolition of unsafe buildings. The demolition of 
about 350 buildings has yet to start. 
</P>
<P>
 So the city has asked, and is expected to get, more FEMA money to fund 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The checks are on the way, Bonino said.

RIVER RESCUE; ENVIRONMENT: CONSERVATIONISTS' EFFORT TO HAVE L.A. WATERWAY 
LISTED AS ENDANGERED IS SUCCESSFUL. HOWEVER, CONCERN IS HIGH OVER AN ARMY CORPS 
OF ENGINEERS PLAN TO ADD CONCRETE TO 13 MILES OF THE CHANNEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Its 58 miles are paved with 3 million barrels of concrete. Its 25-foot-deep 
channel carries mostly sewage effluent, oily street runoff and illegally dumped 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 But when local conservationists asked a national environmental group to 
designate the Los Angeles River one of North America's most endangered 
waterways, officials decided to go with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how Los Angeles' best-known storm drain landed Tuesday on a list of 30 
endangered or threatened rivers compiled by the Washington-based American 
Rivers organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was put in as a concrete conduit. It's a popular scene in movie car chases 
and most people back East who see it have no idea it's a river," said Kevin 
Coyle, president of American Rivers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't concerned about being laughed at. There's a chance that a lot of 
the Los Angeles River can be restored to its natural state." 
</P>
<P>
 Fat chance that's going to happen anytime soon, say leaders of Friends of the 
Los Angeles River. They worry that flood control engineers are poised to pour 
new concrete along 13 miles of the channel that will further urbanize it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-member group is the organization that twice has nominated the river 
for inclusion on the annual threatened rivers list. It now has its hands full 
trying to persuade the Army Corps of Engineers and the Los Angeles County 
Department of Public Works to scale down the river project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The river is the spine of Los Angeles," the group's nomination stated. The 
river links rural foothills with wealthy neighborhoods, working-class 
communities and industrial areas, giving it the potential to be a "textbook 
example of urban revitalization and environmental justice." 
</P>
<P>
 But a proposal to build a flood wall up to eight feet high on top of the 
channel's existing walls between South Gate and Long Beach threatens a wildlife 
habitat and the public's enjoyment of the river, said Martin Schlageter, 
executive director of Friends of the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walls will become graffiti canvases and hide illicit activity," 
Schlageter said Tuesday as he stood next to the river at Pacific Coast Highway. 
At the water's edge behind him, a thick stand of bushes and trees softened the 
look of the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is one of several segments -- totaling 13 miles -- where the river 
bottom is unpaved. That is because a high water table in those areas makes it 
impossible to cover the bottom without ground water pressure pushing the 
channel out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may say we're 50 years late trying to save the river," Schlageter 
said. "But I don't want people to say 50 years from now that we're another 50 
years too late trying to save it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlageter said river supporters have asked flood control officials to find 
ways of dealing with storm runoff upstream, "where it comes from, not where it 
spits out into the ocean." Only 15% of rainfall in the river's watershed is 
conserved -- contrasted with conservation efforts totaling up to 85% in other 
areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But flood control officials say heavy upstream development has eliminated 
places for dams, percolation ponds and other devices that could store winter 
rainwater. Thousands of street drains between West Hills and Long Beach funnel 
increasing amounts of runoff into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers were jolted in 1980 when a storm sent the Los Angeles River surging 
to the top of its concrete banks -- depositing floating debris on the lip of 
the channel's levee near Wardlow Road in Long Beach, said Jean Granucci, a 
spokeswoman for the Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Corps of Engineers study discovered that a 100-year flood could flood 82 
square miles and cause over $2 billion in damage and affect over 600,000 
people," Granucci said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have built a scale model of the lower Los Angeles River and 
are testing the new levee flood wall design at a lab in Vicksburg, Miss., she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If things go according to plan, construction of the $346-million wall project 
is expected to start next summer, Granucci said. Higher walls will also be 
installed on portions of the connecting Rio Hondo Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Los Angeles River, the future of the waterway was being viewed 
with skepticism Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a desert area and this is basically our only river," said Joan 
Hemphill, secretary of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, a community group. 
"And we treat it like a garbage dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the river's Pacific Coast Highway bridge, transients Lorenzo Vasquez 
and Danny Mason were splitting a six-pack of beer as they worried about the 
fate of their riverside encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water's contaminated. You don't even dare eat the fish in there," Vasquez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they put up new walls, it's gonna be like kicking people like us out of 
their houses," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Washington, American Rivers' Coyle said his group plans to continue 
taking a hard look at "rivers the cities have historically turned their backs 
on . . . rivers that some people think are too far gone." 
</P>
<P>

CITY BACKS PLAN TO SHIP QUAKE RUBBLE TO UTAH; RECOVERY: OFFICIALS WERE CAUGHT 
OFF GUARD BY VOLUME. RAIL PROPOSAL TO EXPEDITE CLEANUP WINS PRELIMINARY OK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than three months after the Northridge earthquake, many streets in the 
San Fernando Valley still look like scenes from the town of Bedrock -- with 
piles of concrete rubble heaped at curbs waiting for city crews to haul them 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning up after January's 6.8 temblor has proven far more difficult, and 
vastly more expensive, than anyone figured in the days immediately following 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of debris created by this earthquake is phenomenal," said Andres 
Santamaria, head of the city's Earthquake Recovery Division. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Los Angeles residents can expect to wait as long as a month or 
more for quake debris to be hauled away. City officials estimate that cleanup 
costs in the city could balloon from $30 million to about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To help quicken the pace, the City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday 
to a private company to haul debris by rail from Van Nuys to Utah, preserving 
space in local landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners, mostly from the Valley, are flooding City Hall with telephone 
calls, as many as 600 a day, to get rid of the debris. Already, 200,000 tons of 
junk has been scooped up and trucked off. 
</P>
<P>
 And city officials predict they will haul away at least that much more before 
the end of summer because many residents are only now beginning to make repairs 
as their insurance checks begin to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of debris caught the city off guard, Santamaria said. By the 
beginning of this month, the city had spent most of the money it had allocated 
for debris removal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there is good news for neighbors who must maneuver their cars through 
residential streets made narrow by the piles of rubble: More money is on the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget shortfall caused a two-week slowdown in cleanup earlier this month. 
The number of contractors hired to haul debris was slashed from 30 to three. 
The city has since hired 20 more contractors by shifting money from other 
programs, and there are plans to hire another 20 firms as soon as more federal 
money arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary cutbacks have delayed the rubble clearing by about a week, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City cleanup efforts began within days of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Residents 
were promised free removal of quake-related debris such as wood, bricks and 
chunks of concrete. The free service saved residents as much as $500 per 
truckload, the cost of hauling the debris to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 With that kind of savings, many residents said they are willing to put up with 
the mess in front of their houses for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks resident Heather Bertini was told it may be four weeks until the 
concrete pile that was once her pool deck is hauled away. Until then, the 
four-foot-high pile juts out into narrow Greenleaf Street, causing bottlenecks 
when nearby Sherman Oaks Elementary School lets out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind waiting," Bertini said. Shortly after the quake, Bertini hired a 
contractor to haul away about half as much debris for $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the quake, most of the debris consisted of bricks from 
toppled chimneys and smaller household items broken during the shaking, 
Santamaria said. But as federal disaster agencies and private insurance 
companies start issuing checks to begin rebuilding, the debris has grown to 
include large pieces of buildings undergoing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the big, bulky items are coming forth," Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials originally estimated cleanup efforts would cost about $30 
million, most of which would be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. By comparison, cleaning up after the 1992 riots cost just under $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But over the course of three months, city officials realized their original 
estimates were too low, said Pat Bonino, who is overseeing disaster aid 
spending for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of April, debris removal alone was estimated to cost almost 
as much as the total allocated for the cleanup and for demolition of unsafe 
buildings. The demolition of about 350 such structures has yet to start. 
</P>
<P>
 So the city has asked for, and is expected to get, more FEMA money to fund the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The checks, Bonino said, are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen six declared disasters in the last two years," Bonino said, 
referring to riots, fires, earthquakes and floods. "This one was so much bigger 
than all the other ones combined."

CITY COUNCIL EXTENDS WINTER WATER RATES; UTILITIES: HEAVY USERS WILL 
TEMPORARILY PAY 22% LESS THAN UNDER TWO-TIER SUMMER SYSTEM, WHICH VALLEY 
RESIDENTS PROTESTED LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers will not pay the higher 
summer water rates that sparked a flood of complaints from San Fernando Valley 
residents last year, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council voted unanimously to extend winter water rates, which are 
22% lower for heavy water users, until a citizens panel can draft a permanent 
and more equitable system. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate structure that was imposed last year to promote conservation imposed 
two tiers, a high rate for customers who use more than twice the median amount 
of water, and a lower rate for smaller users. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Valley, where lots tend to be larger and summers tend to be hotter, 
residents deluged City Hall with complaints after they began to receive 
bimonthly summer bills ranging from $500 to $900. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council agreed unanimously to impose the temporary lower rates 
while a more equitable permanent system is devised, they were bitterly divided 
over how that permanent system will work. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the northwest Valley, proposed that the 
city do away with the two-tier system and instead adopt a flat-rate structure 
that charges the same amount for each gallon, regardless of how much water is 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should pay the same rate, if they can afford it," Bernson said. He 
said the two-tier system forces Valley residents to pay more than their fair 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was defeated on a 10-4 vote, with a majority arguing that a flat 
rate system does not provide an incentive for water conservation. Voting in 
favor of the flat-rate system were Councilmen Bernson, Joel Wachs, Zev 
Yaroslavsky and John Ferraro, all of whom represent parts of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For some council members, the debate turned on the question of whether heavy 
water users, particularly those in the Valley, should pay the same rate as 
residents who use little. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the Hollywood area, said a 
flat-rate system would force those who use less water to subsidize those who 
use more. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we begin subsidizing the largest users who have shown in a drought that 
they are capable of conservation, we remove any incentives for them to 
conserve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson reacted angrily to suggestions that Valley water users would be 
subsidized by the rest of the city's residents under a flat-rate system. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, let's cut the B.S. about subsidizing the Valley," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The water rate structure that was imposed in February, 1993, was the result of 
many public hearings and hours of study by the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee on 
Water Rates, a citizens panel created by former Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials estimate that the city will lose $7 million in revenues by 
imposing the lower winter rates through the summer. But part of that loss will 
be offset by a $4-million surplus that DWP collected under the two-tier rate 
system, including the higher summer rates that ran from June through October. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old summer rates, customers who used more than twice the median paid 
$2.98 per billing unit. A unit is 100 cubic feet or 748 gallons. Those who used 
less paid $1.80 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under winter rates, which remain in effect indefinitely, those using more than 
twice the median pay $2.33 per billing unit. Those using less pay $1.80. The 
median customer in Los Angeles uses about 10,500 gallons every month during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Brown, co-chairwoman of the mayor's water rates committee, said the 
panel is close to proposing a permanent rate system that will be based on a 
two-tier system, but will also take into consideration the size of a resident's 
lot, the number of occupants in a home, the climate of a community and whether 
a house is built on a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be equitable and continue to encourage conservation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is expected to propose a permanent rate structure next month.

CRA WORKERS RETURN TO A LESS-OPEN OFFICE; SECURITY: MEASURES ARE INSTALLED 
BECAUSE OF DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE AGENCY'S PROJECT MANAGER. WORKPLACE HAD 
CLOSED MARCH 25. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Community Redevelopment Agency employees returned Tuesday to their workplace, 
an office that has been remodeled to include a bullet-resistant window and a 
new intercom system that will require all visitors to identify themselves 
before being allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new security measures were installed because of death threats 
against Lillian Burkenheim, the CRA North Hollywood project manager, Burkenheim 
was concerned that they might change the character of the office, which has had 
an open-door policy for the 14 years it has been at its current location. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an office that likes to be open to anyone who wants to walk in, and 
unfortunately, we now have to screen everyone at the door," Burkenheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday morning, with the smell of fresh paint lingering and the recently 
installed security door still not working, it appeared her concerns might be 
for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 The office was not even officially open yet, and already visitors were 
dropping by to welcome back -- and bend the ears of -- the four-member staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "An intercom system is not going to stop me from coming here," said Jim 
Jackson, a North Hollywood apartment building owner who stopped by to update 
Burkenheim on his efforts to combat crime in his area. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA closed the doors to its North Hollywood office on Vineland Avenue on 
March 25 after a series of telephone calls from a man who criticized the agency 
for erecting "tall buildings" and then threatened to kill Burkenheim, who 
manages the 740-acre project. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkenheim also received mail brochures offering burial plots and services. On 
another occasion, a taxi and limousine had been called in Burkenheim's name to 
take her to Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary, and on another a hearse 
pulled up in front of the office to "pick up her body." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of concern for the safety of the four city employees, CRA Administrator Ed 
Avila decided to temporarily close the office to make it more secure. In 
addition to the intercom system and the bullet-resistant window, a wall was 
erected to create a separate waiting room for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The man making the threats has not been caught, but Burkenheim said the 
threats have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Rick Wahler of the Police Department's North Hollywood Division 
said the case remains open, though inactive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had very few leads," Wahler said. "If the occurrences reappear, we'll 
activate the case. We've briefed the staff to take measures that will help us 
better identify the person if the threats start up again." 
</P>
<P>
 When the threats began, there was speculation that they arose out of last 
month's bitter election battle for 14 seats on a residents' advisory panel, 
known as the Project Advisory Committee, or PAC. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAC has had a long history of confrontations, which has resulted in 
rancorous meetings and at least once erupted into a fistfight at a public 
meeting. Supporters of the agency say it has provided housing and new jobs, 
while anti-redevelopment forces on the panel have accused the CRA of catering 
to developers and wasting taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents and supporters of the redevelopment project condemned the death 
threats as the act of an irrational person. Police have not connected the 
threats to anyone associated with the project.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONROVIA; MAN HELD IN 
BOMB BLAST UNDER EX-WIFE'S PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Monrovia man was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of placing a pipe bomb that 
exploded under his ex-wife's pickup truck outside a house in Lancaster, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, but investigators were trying to determine 
whether the suspect, Charles Edwin Smith, 70, was also connected to a March 26 
explosion that damaged his ex-wife's motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was taken into custody at his Monrovia residence about 1:30 a.m. and 
jailed at the Sheriff's Temple City station on suspicion of exploding a 
destructive device, Deputy George Ducoulombier said. Smith was being held in 
lieu of $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest occurred about 90 minutes after an explosion rocked the 1100 block 
of Herzel Avenue in Lancaster, where Smith's former wife, Rini uzanne, 51, was 
staying. The home belonged to Duzanne's daughter from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Duzanne said she left her husband in September, 1988, and became embroiled in 
a bitter divorce that became final in November.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GARRETT 
MORRIS HOSPITALIZED 3 WEEKS AFTER BEING SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Garrett Morris was back in the hospital Tuesday after a 3-week-old 
gunshot wound apparently became infected, his publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris walked into Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital on Monday night 
complaining of pain in his back, publicist Rita Tateel said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some complications and we don't know what kind of procedure 
will be done," she said. "There is some speculation that he has had some 
inflammation and infection in the area where the bullet was." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris was wounded once in the chest and once in the arm during a botched 
holdup in South-Central Los Angeles. He told the two robbers he had no money. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old actor was a member of the original cast of "Saturday Night 
Live" in the 1970s, and plays Stan in the current TV comedy "Martin."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDIO CITY; $25,000 
REWARD OFFERED IN SLAYING OF MAN, 73 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $25,000 reward was posted for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of suspects in the slaying of an elderly Studio City man, Los 
Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Thompson, 73, was severely beaten before he was shot during a nighttime 
burglary at his home Jan. 26.His wife, Dorothy, 70, survived a gunshot wound to 
the chest. She tearfully told reporters that she woke up to the sound of 
breaking glass shortly after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When she switched on the light, she found a gunman at the foot of the bed she 
shared with her husband. "I remember falling, but I did not hear my husband get 
shot," she said, her voice cracking. "(The gunman) thought I was dead. I feel 
like half of a pair, and my life has been nothing but doctors and therapists."  
</P>
<P>
 The council offered the reward at Ferraro's request.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has been happening on this case," Ferraro said. "(The police) felt (a 
reward) would get it some attention."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; CHARTER SCHOOLS PUSH TO RUN MEAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost membership in the clean-plate club on their campuses, the San 
Fernando Valley's two charter schools have asked the school district for 
freedom to run their own breakfast and lunch programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators from the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center and Fenton Avenue 
Elementary School will meet with Los Angeles Unified School District officials 
today to discuss proposals they say would improve menus, serve students more 
quickly, reduce waste and offer more culturally sensitive food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many children who don't eat their lunch," said Joseph Lucente, 
principal of Fenton. "They just throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Charter schools receive public funding but are free from state and local 
education regulations to write their own rules. Most of the 33 charter schools 
in the state use district food services, but Lucente and Vaughn Principal 
Yvonne Chan believe the fare could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it is cooked somewhere else, wrapped, shipped, frozen and reheated," 
Chan said. "For many of my kids, this is the only meal they have all day." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to encourage students to eat more, the charter schools propose to 
hire private food service companies and work with them to include fresher, more 
culturally sensitive fare in the menus. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the schools would change the way lunch is served. About 98% of 
Vaughn students and more than 90% of Fenton students qualify to receive free 
lunch at school under a federal nutrition program. But because so many students 
use the free tickets at mealtime, the ticket line is often long and 
slow-moving. Sometimes, it takes longer to stand in line than eat lunch. Chan 
said a faster system, such as a turnstile or bar code to count students, would 
allow children more time to sit down and enjoy their lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has asked the state to allow the charter schools to 
receive their nutrition funding directly -- bypassing the district -- as 
private schools do. Warren Lund, director of the district's food services 
branch, said if the request is denied, the district is willing to negotiate 
with the charter schools about the amount of flexibility, and liability, they 
will have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not just going to pass through funds to them and keep the 
responsibility for operating the district program," Lund said. "If they want 
that complete flexibility, they have to have responsibility at the same time."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 4 MOTELS AGAIN TOLD TO HIRE SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city zoning panel Tuesday denied the appeals of four Van Nuys motel owners 
who were ordered to hire security to curb prostitution, but the panel amended 
some of the conditions it imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Zoning Appeals decision was a mixed victory for the owners and 
managers of the motels, which include the Bali Hi, the Town House, the El 
Cortez and the Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had accused the four motels plus a fifth -- the Chateau Motel -- with 
being magnets for prostitution and other crimes. That resulted in a city zoning 
decision last month to impose 27 conditions on each motel. All but the Chateau, 
which is closed, filed an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The key conditions appealed were a $4,052 payment to cover the cost of the 
city's investigation into the motels' activities, and the security provision, 
which ordered each motel to have a security guard on site for eight hours a day 
and to have 24-hour on-call security service. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates for the security service ranged between $45,000 and $60,000 a year, 
a cost each motel said it could not afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to stay in business," said Richard Cohen, the owner of the Cinema 
Motel, who said the cost of on-site security would drive his nine-unit motel, 
which he has owned for 19 years, out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents, such as Van Nuys Homeowner's Assn. President Don Schultz, who 
complained about prostitution along Sepulveda Boulevard cautioned the board to 
take the owners' plight with a grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want you being snookered," Schultz told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents, like Neighborhood Watch activist Romana Catton, supported the 
24-hour security patrol plan. It was also endorsed by City Councilman Marvin 
Braude, who initiated the actions against the motels. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to reach a compromise between the residents and motel owners, the 
board denied the appeal but amended several of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prostitution is an age-old problem," said board member James Acevedo. "It's 
not the fault of business owners who happen to be in a particular area, and 
it's not the fault of people who live in the area."  
</P>
<P>
 The Cinema, El Cortez and the Town House were told to adopt either the 
original security condition or the 24-hour patrol, which would cost about 
$10,000 a month and would be shared by the motels. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrol car would make periodic stops at the motels along a 2.9-mile stretch 
of Sepulveda Boulevard, from Camarillo Street to Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The board suggested that the affected motels ask other motels along the 
boulevard to share the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Levine, owner of the Cabana Motel, said he would be inclined to join the 
security effort, even though his motel was not targeted by the city as a 
problem spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bali Hi was ordered to retain an eight-hour daily security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The board excused both the El Cortez and the Town House from the $4,052 fee. 
The Bali Hi was ordered to pay the full fee, and the Cinema was ordered to pay 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 If no other appeals are filed, the four motels would have up to 100 days to 
implement the security patrol, pay the fees and comply with the other 
conditions, including not renting rooms for less than 24 hours. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; WOMAN SENTENCED IN HIGH-SPEED CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood woman has been sentenced to four months in jail for leading 
police on a high-speed chase while her 5-year-old son sat screaming in the 
passenger seat without a seat belt, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Ann Weidenfeller, 33, was sentenced Monday after pleading no contest in 
Van Nuys Municipal Court to misdemeanor charges of child endangerment and 
hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving a 1985 Pontiac Firebird and reaching speeds up to 70 m.p.h., 
Weidenfeller ran a stop sign and five red lights during the Feb. 24 pursuit, 
Deputy City Atty. Kjehl T. Johansen said, adding that Weidenfeller hit two 
other cars during the chase, injuring two motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially pulled over Weidenfeller on Van Nuys Boulevard -- almost in 
front of the criminal courthouse -- after observing her speeding and making 
unsafe lane changes. But when she handed officers her passport and an 
identification card, she sped off and the chase began, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was captured when police trapped her vehicle in a parking lot near Victory 
Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 During a search after her arrest, police said they found a cocaine pipe in 
Weidenfeller's purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidenfeller's son was not injured during the incident. The boy was turned 
over to his father's custody, police said. Commissioner Mitchell Block ordered 
Weidenfeller to attend parenting classes as part of a two-year probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidenfeller was originally scheduled for a trial March 21, but did not 
appear. She was considered a fugitive until April 12, when she was arrested for 
petty theft. She pleaded no contest to that charge Thursday and was sentenced 
to 10 days in jail for that offense. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; NEW REDEVELOPMENT ZONE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has hired a consultant to consider setting up a 
new redevelopment zone for an area of the city damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 GRC Redevelopment Consultants of Diamond Bar will study two sections of San 
Fernando -- between Celis Street and the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
railroad tracks from Workman Street to the city limits, and a smaller area 
along 1st Street between Harding and Workman streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment zone would be created under a special redevelopment law 
which -- because of damage from the earthquake -- allows a city to set up a 
zone bypassing several time-consuming steps. The initial studies for the zone 
have to be completed by mid-June, said Ernie Glover, head of the consulting 
firm, which is being hired for $37,300. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Monday night also voted to buy a $1,590 hearing aid for a 
60-year-old street sweeper whose hearing had been damaged because of the noise 
of the equipment. Councilman Doude Wysbeek rejected a proposal that the man pay 
back the hearing aid at $20 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our employees are not in a safe environment, we should accept the 
responsibility," Wysbeek said, adding that the man had suffered the damage to 
his ears because the equipment he was using in the 1970s did not meet today's 
safety standards. "Let's face the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the council meeting, Councilwoman Rosa Chacon recommended that the 
city consider setting term limits for elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the community feel this is a good safeguard so that a politician 
does not become entrenched," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek said such a matter should ultimately be decided by a ballot measure. 
City staff members will put together a report on the issue to present to the 
council at a future meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think elections themselves have a way of limiting our terms," said Raymond 
Ojeda, the mayor pro tem. ED BOND

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WHITTIER; TEAMSTER 
PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO ATTEMPTED MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Teamsters Union picket pleaded not guilty Tuesday to attempted premeditated 
murder for allegedly using a metal pipe to beat an independent trucker who 
crossed a Teamsters picket line in Pico Rivera.  
</P>
<P>
 "This goes well beyond the usual sort of anger you see in these strikes," 
Deputy Dist. Atty.Richard Chrystie said. "Here a man was beaten horribly."  
</P>
<P>
 Jesus (Jesse) Manuel Acuna, 37, was arraigned in Whittier Municipal Court on 
one count of attempted willful, deliberate, premeditated murder for Friday's 
beating of 55-year-old Glen Yeatts.  
</P>
<P>
 Acuna, who was arrested soon after the attack at Telegraph Road and Paramount 
Boulevard, is also accused of causing great bodily injury with a deadly weapon. 
Municipal Judge Larry Knupp set Acuna's bail at $500,000. If convicted, the 
defendant faces life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Yeatts pulled his tractor-trailer rig into a truck 
yard near where the attack occurred, crossing a Teamsters picket line. He later 
pulled the truck back out through the line and stopped for a traffic signal 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna allegedly pulled a pin that separated the tractor cab from the trailer 
of Yeatts' rig. When the man got out to see what was wrong, he was dazed with a 
blow to his head by a rock, then beaten with a two-foot metal pipe that 
truckers use to check tires, Chrystie said. Yeatts' elbow was shattered when he 
put up his arm to deflect the blows. He is in stable condition.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RETRIAL 
ORDERED FOR WIFE WHO CUT OFF MAN'S TESTICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman acquitted of mayhem for cutting off her husband's testicles with a 
pair of scissors should be retried on a battery charge, a judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury acquitted Aurelia Macias, 36, of mayhem and assault with a deadly 
weapon last month for the Sept. 20, 1992, attack.The jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in 
favor of acquittal on a charge of battery with serious bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society has a great interest" in seeing the case resolved, Superior Court 
Judge Robert O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurelia Macias testified that her 39-year-old husband, Jaime, was drunk and 
tried to force her to have sex while she was trying to give milk to their 
6-month-old baby. She said she attacked him after he grabbed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Aurelia Macias attacked her husband while he slept. She was 
in a jealous rage, they said, because he had drunkenly flirted with another 
woman at a party that day. Only one of the man's testicles was recovered, and 
not until the day after the attack, so doctors were unable to reattach it. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have reconciled and Macias did not want to press charges, but the 
state pursued the case anyway. Macias, who has recovered, can have normal 
sexual relations but can no longer father children.

JOSHUA TREES; CELEBRATING A 'CURIOUS LOOKING PLANT...' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Researched by SHARON MOESER / For The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the high desert, the Joshua tree is among the most prominent and enduring 
forms of native vegetation. Large specimens average 30 feet tall, with one 
giant in Lancaster measured at 58 feet and estimated to be 1,000 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 In some areas of the Antelope Valley, where many residents are fond of the 
gawky trees, they can be found in dense clusters spread over several acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua trees thrive in arid regions of Southern California, Arizona, Nevada 
and Utah, generally at elevations of 2,000 to 6,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joshua tree is not a cactus, but is actually a member of the lily family. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been called "the most imposing yuccas in the Southwest and rank with 
the giant cactus (saguaro) as a symbol of the desert," according to a U.S. 
Department of Agriculture researcher. Early Encounters 
</P>
<P>
 The name for the desert tree is believed to have come from Mormons traveling 
to Utah in the mid 1800s. The Joshua tree's "rigid, angular, grotesquely 
pointing branches struck the imagination of the Mormons who likened the trees 
to Joshua pointing the way and leading them to the promised land," an author 
wrote in a 1938 book on California plants.  
</P>
<P>
 Some have seen Joshuas as the splendor of the desert - tall and stately, each 
one unique. Others have found them grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first references to the plant was by the explorer, Lt. John C. 
Fremont, who was definitely among the latter group. In 1844 he wrote that the 
Joshua tree "gave a strange and southern character to the country .... 
Associated with the idea of barren sands, their stiff and ungraceful form makes 
them to the traveler the most repulsive tree in the vegetable kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, a writer said, "It is indeed a curious looking plant, 
suggesting, in its oldest forms especially, another age; one would not be 
surprised to see a huge prehistoric monster standing by and feeding upon the 
fruit on its upper branches...." Preservation Efforts 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 200,000 Joshua trees in the Antelope Valley were bulldozed and 
discarded in landfills during the residential development boom in the mid- to 
late-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based efforts to ensure the continued existence of the Joshua tree 
in north Los Angeles County have had mixed results, with some saying the 
protection has come too late. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale, a two-year-old ordinance requires that a minimum of two Joshua 
trees per acre be preserved on land proposed for development. The measure, 
which also applies to other native vegetation such as California junipers, 
allows developers additional destruction, but only as a last result and on 
payment of a fee of $200 per tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's efforts to preserve Joshua trees date back to 1980. The city has 
designated four vegetation management districts, totaling about 2,200 acres. 
Developers who want to build within the districts must pay a fee of $6,200 to 
$7,500 per acre, based on the quality of the native vegetation on the site. The 
money the city collects is to be used for the purchase of a 90-acre prime 
desert woodland, about half of which the city now owns. The fee provisions were 
adopted in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, Joshua trees lack protection 
except for a small tract west of Lancaster that has been designated as a 
significant ecological area. Any development proposals there are subject to a 
more stringent review. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, county planners drafted an ordinance that would have 
provided some protection to Joshua trees, but it was never enacted. Their 
Desert Environment 
</P>
<P>
 With its stiff, lance-like leaves, the Joshua forms branches for the first 
time after producing its greenish-white flower clusters. Once a branch flowers, 
it does not continue to grow from the end but instead sends off a side branch. 
This process continues over the years to produce the tree-like top seen on the 
most stunning Joshua trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides propagating from seed, Joshua trees spread by underground stems that 
sprout a short distance from the parent tree. 
</P>
<P>
 To animals, Joshua trees are an important part of the desert environment. 
Lizards, rodents and birds seek shelter in the spiny trees. There is a variety 
of a butterfly as well as a moth, which pollinates the tree and lays eggs on 
the Joshua. The fruit of the Joshua tree is eaten by birds and rodents. 
Commercial Uses 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1800s there were attempts to produce paper pulp from the stems and 
leaves. "After shipping large quantities of both white and brown paper, the 
mill was closed, and has been started up only once or twice since," according 
to an 1891 article. "The time for yucca paper has not yet come...."  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, the light, strong wood of the Joshua was used in the manufacture 
of splints.

NASA GIVES $400,000 GRANT FOR QUAKE STUDY; SCIENCE: MONEY WILL HELP EXPAND 
NETWORK OF MEASURING STATIONS TO DETERMINE HOW SEISMIC SLIP IS SPREAD 
THROUGHOUT THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California earthquake scientists have won a $400,000 grant from NASA 
to double the size of a network of measuring stations to determine whether 
there has really been, as some scientists surmise, a deficit of large 
earthquakes in the area over the last 150 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will allow the installation of 15 stations from the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula to the Antelope Valley. The additional devices will facilitate 
precise measurements by the Global Positioning System of satellites on how the 
seismic slip is distributed through the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope that the measurements will show whether a significant part of 
the annual average movement of seven or eight millimeters a year is by a 
seismic creep, or slip, or by means other than the jolts of big earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 This would mean that the stress built up over the years has been relieved 
somewhat by these smaller creeping motions and that consequently the risk of a 
great quake -- to catch up with the amount of slip considered normal -- may not 
be as great as some suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before a congressional committee on March 2, Lucile M. Jones, a 
geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said that scientists who had 
studied 150 years of quake data in the Southland were concerned that there had 
not been enough quakes to explain all the movements noted along faults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only one-third the number of large and major earthquakes" that might have 
been expected had occurred, Jones said, leading to fears of a "deficit" of 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new stations will be ready by the end of the year, and are the first of 
what scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Geological Survey, the 
Scripps Oceanographic Institution and the Southern California Earthquake Center 
hope will eventually be a $10-million network of 250 stations to measure 
strains throughout the Southland.  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Hudnut of the Geological Survey said Tuesday that the first conclusions 
drawn from data provided by the new stations should be available at the end of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to measure within a millimeter what is happening in terms of 
movement between these stations," Hudnut said. "If we find evidence of creep 
within the upper 10 to 15 kilometers beneath the surface, it will be taken as 
an indication that some of the strain is being relieved."  
</P>
<P>
 However, he cautioned, findings of creep at lower levels could mean a loading 
of strain and an increase in the probability of large deep quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yehuda Bock of Scripps added that other key parts of the study will be to 
ascertain how the slip is distributed -- geographically and over time.

FORGERY ALLEGATIONS SUBJECT OF U.S. PROBE; INQUIRY: THE ACCUSATIONS INVOLVE A 
FORMER OFFICIAL OF AN AGENCY PLANNING TO SET UP A HOMELESS CENTER IN SAN PEDRO. 
RESIDENTS OPPOSE THE SHELTER ON NAVY SURPLUS LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal Department of Health and Human Services is looking into 
allegations of forgery against a recently resigned official of an organization 
planning to set up a controversial homeless center on surplus Navy property in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayford Kytle, a spokesman for the department, said Tuesday that officials in 
Washington will respond to inquiries from local officials about the alleged 
forgery and the qualifications of Turner's Technical Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that Turner's Institute -- the proposed operator of a center housing 
up to 600 people on a 27-acre site on Taper Avenue -- lacks the credentials to 
do the job, San Pedro residents have been fighting the planned shelter for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James A. Mays, a cardiologist who was asked to support the project, now 
says that Johnathon C. Marzet, the former assistant director of the institute, 
forged the doctor's name on a letter of endorsement sent to the Department of 
Health and Human Services last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays said he later signed a different letter endorsing the institute's 
application. But Mays said that after learning of the forgery and concluding 
that the institute is incapable of running the project, he has withdrawn his 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 No one from the institute could be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released Monday, Marzet said he was resigning as treasurer, 
assistant director and board member of the institute "due to personal reasons 
and alleged unethical behavior on my part, beyond my control." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged false claims of college degrees, admitting that he never 
graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, officials from Health and Human Services approved the institute's 
application to open a shelter in 144 apartment units on Taper Avenue under the 
auspices of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which gives homeless advocacy groups priority on federal 
lands declared surplus, has caused an uproar in the harbor community because it 
does not allow for public input. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest meetings have attracted crowds of more than 1,000 residents, virtually 
all of whom have been strongly opposed to the plan to house and educate 
homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations against Marzet reinforce "exactly what people thought after 
the first meeting when representatives from Turner's appeared and didn't have 
any answers to our questions," said Barbara Ferraro, vice chairwoman of the San 
Pedro Area Reuse Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays said that when "all hell broke loose" in the San Pedro community, he 
advised Marzet to look for an alternative site because the community had some 
justifiable concerns about the impact on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays said he now believes that the institute is incapable of running the 
program because Marzet tried to "become an expert overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the institute's) participants (at the public meetings) were not 
longtime involved with TTI. They were just a response team put together, rather 
than working with people who were experienced with the homeless," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first meeting, it seems Marzet found some 'expert' people," the 
doctor said. "There was no real team prior to the crisis (with the community)." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's experience is limited to running a small training school in Compton 
and some welfare housing in South-Central, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor, who said he has extensive experience with programs for the 
homeless, estimated that the Taper Avenue program would cost $3 million to $5 
million per year, far exceeding the $500,000 to $700,000 Marzet claimed it 
would cost at meetings with San Pedro residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services Department has been criticized by several 
officials -- including Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who 
represents San Pedro, and San Diego Mayor Susan Golding -- for giving the 
institute the site without checking the information in its application. 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks at HHS just don't seem to delve into these things in any detail," 
said Barry Glickman, a spokesman for Svorinich. "It's not required (under the 
act) and they don't have much time . . . so why bother?"  
</P>
<P>
 Golding, who headed the California Military Base Reuse Task Force that 
reported to Gov. Pete Wilson, said the task force recommended giving 
communities the power to choose options for surplus federal land because they 
were more likely than the federal government to ensure the credibility of 
plans.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unconscionable that homeless providers can go directly to the federal 
government and undermine the whole community's reuse plan, and this is a 
perfect example of what happens," Golding said.

DWP WON'T RAISE RATES IN SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers will not be charged the 
higher summer water rates that sparked a flood of complaints last year, the 
City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council voted unanimously to extend winter rates until a citizens 
panel can draft a permanent and more equitable system. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate structure adopted last year to promote conservation imposed two 
tiers: a high rate for customers who use more than twice the median amount of 
water, and a lower rate for users of smaller amounts. The rate does not change 
from winter to summer for lesser users, but it increases 28% for heavy users. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, City Hall was deluged by complaints from heavy water users after 
they began to receive bimonthly summer bills ranging from $500 to $900. The 
most calls and letters came from the San Fernando Valley, where lots tend to be 
larger and summers hotter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council agreed unanimously to extend the winter rates while a 
more equitable system is devised, they were bitterly divided over how that 
system will work. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the northwest Valley, proposed that the 
city do away with the two-tier system and instead adopt a flat-rate structure 
that charges the same amount for each gallon, regardless of how much water is 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should pay the same rate, if they can afford it," Bernson said. He 
said that the two-tier system forces Valley residents to pay more than their 
fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was defeated 10 to 4, with a majority arguing that a flat-rate 
system does not provide an incentive for water conservation. Voting in favor of 
a flat-rate system were Councilmen Bernson, Joel Wachs, Zev Yaroslavsky and 
John Ferraro, all of whom represent parts of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents the Hollywood area, said that a 
flat-rate system would force those who use less water to subsidize those who 
use more. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials estimate that the city will lose $7 million in revenues by 
extending the lower winter rates through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old summer rates, customers who used more than twice the median paid 
$2.98 per billing unit. A unit is 100 cubic feet, or 748 gallons. Those who 
used less paid $1.80 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current winter rates, those using more than twice the median pay $2.33 
per billing unit. Those using less pay $1.80. The median customer in Los 
Angeles uses about 10,500 gallons a month during the summer.

SUSPENDED PRIEST FILES SUIT; LITIGATION: FATHER DAVID PIROLI CHARGES CHURCH 
WITH DEFAMATION AND MALICIOUS PROSECUTION OVER EMBEZZLEMENT CASE, IN WHICH HE 
WAS ACQUITTED. ARCHDIOCESE CONCEALED EVIDENCE, HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Claiming that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles went out of its 
way to help prosecute him, a suspended Ventura County priest sued the church 
Tuesday for malicious prosecution and defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli said that after a Ventura County jury acquitted him 
of embezzlement and deadlocked on a grand theft charge, church representatives 
have continued to attack him in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the archdiocese of concealing evidence that could have proved his 
innocence to charges that he stole more than $50,000 from his former parishes 
in Simi Valley and Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one -- not even the Holy Father himself -- should put him or herself above 
the law," Piroli said at a Los Angeles news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Archdiocesan officials declined to respond to the lawsuit, which seeks 
unspecified damages. "The archdiocese will comment at the appropriate place and 
time, which will probably be in court," spokeswoman Brenda Anaya-Eckdahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's lawsuit is the latest development in Piroli's nearly two-year legal 
fight, which began May 29, 1992, when Los Angeles police found him and a 
Mexican national sitting in a church-owned car in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they found $10,000 in small bills, trace amounts of cocaine and 
church collection envelopes in the car. Five days later, parishioners said they 
found more money stashed in Piroli's Simi Valley bedroom and office. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County authorities declined to prosecute him. Ventura County 
prosecutors filed a charge of grand theft in connection with more than $50,000 
that they accused him of stealing from St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley. 
On March 19, a jury deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also filed a charge of embezzlement related to a small amount of 
money Piroli was accused of taking from a church in Saticoy. The same jury 
acquitted him of that charge.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; ENGINEER PICKED FOR TOP POST AT WATER DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James E. Colbaugh has been named general manager of the Las Virgenes Municipal 
Water District, where he is expected to bring a more outgoing and meticulous 
style to the job than did his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbaugh, 47, an engineer, was picked to head operations at the district 
earlier this month. He takes over as the district attempts to balance the cost 
of its progressive conservation efforts with a slowdown in fees from new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 That will require keeping the board of directors informed of possible 
cost-cutting measures as well as explaining new projects to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our customers want us to build facilities that are not ugly and they 
like the idea of reusing the water and solid waste," Colbaugh said. "But it's 
important to let them know what we're doing and why." 
</P>
<P>
 Colbaugh will also have to balance watching every penny with his theory that 
managers should step back and let their staffs make decisions whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm not micromanaging and worrying about every paper clip that gets 
used," Colbaugh said. "But I hope our management is worrying about paper 
clips." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 17-year district veteran in unscuffed keltie loafers, the plan is to 
lead by example. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I am very organized in my personal life," he said, chuckling. "The 
dollars in my wallet are all in ascending order. I think things need to look 
right and be in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
 Colbaugh served as the district's director of planning and engineering before 
taking his current post. He lives in Westlake Village with his wife, Andrea, a 
teacher at Camarillo High School, and relaxes by golfing and puttering in his 
garden.  
</P>
<P>
 He replaces Charles McClain, whose contract was terminated after two years in 
March by a board seeking a different management style. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain conceded that he is not "externally oriented." He left the district on 
good terms, said district spokeswoman Bobbe Wymer. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbaugh "gives people at the district a sense of security," Wymer said. "They 
know there is going to be structure and an attention to detail." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SCHOOL BOARD WON'T PUT BOND ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Unified School District officials have decided against putting a 
multimillion-dollar school bond proposal before voters in 1995 in the wake of 
the recent defeat of a similar measure in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the continuing recession and subsequent anti-tax sentiment among 
voters, board of education members said they favored putting on hold a bond 
issue that would be used to make improvements to many of the district's aging 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can see from the world around us and from communication with board members 
in other communities that a bond is not timely right now," board President Jane 
Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bond is needed to computerize Glendale schools, district spokesman Vic 
Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Glendale's 28 schools were built in the 1920s and haven't been 
retrofitted to meet today's basic electrical needs. Some classrooms have only 
one electrical outlet, Pallos said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $100-million school bond initiative in Burbank -- intended to provide money 
to renovate buildings in the Burbank Unified School District -- was rejected by 
voters April 12.  
</P>
<P>
 About 53% of Burbank voters approved the measure, while 47% were opposed. The 
election required a two-thirds majority, or 66.7% of voters favoring the bond 
issue, to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale school district officials are hopeful that bills lowering the 
percentage of votes needed to pass a bond measure will be approved, allowing 
the district to proceed. The bills are now in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easier to pass a bond measure in trying economic times if the 
district were only required to obtain a 50% majority vote on an initiative, 
board member Blanch Greenwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 A school bond proposal last appeared before Glendale voters in 1964, when 67% 
of the electorate approved a $20-million measure to rebuild Glendale and Hoover 
high schools and to build Mountain Avenue Elementary School. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY BRACES FOR HEALTH CLUB APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a four-month moratorium on health clubs lifts in Burbank next week, 
officials expect as many as a dozen wanna-be clubs to make an application for 
business licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of inquiries," said Terre Hirsch, the license and code 
supervisor for Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council imposed a moratorium on new fitness clubs in December 
after residents accused clubs of closing down without providing services or 
refunds. During the freeze on new health clubs, the city established 
requirements for the businesses that include posting a bond of at least $75,000 
-- or 5% of the clubs' gross receipts from its previous year -- to ensure that 
membership fees can be returned if a club closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the (health club) industry, the imposition of a bond is not as 
onerous as one may think," Hirsch said, adding that several other Southern 
California municipalities had already established a bond requirement, including 
Santa Monica, Thousand Oaks and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become a standard for the industry," Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium is to be lifted at the end of this week, Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one health club had been caught during the moratorium, the Family Workout 
fitness center, which is trying to reopen under new ownership after its closure 
last fall had prompted the city to investigate how to regulate the health club 
industry. It had applied for a permit just before the moratorium went into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of health clubs that have shown an interest in Burbank since the 
moratorium went into effect did not surprise Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of health clubs come and go in town," he said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; MORE FUNDS SOUGHT FOR YMCA EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $2-million campaign to finance a second phase in the expansion of the 
Burbank Family YMCA will get under way May 1, even as the organization waits 
for the city to approve the start of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The two phases of the expansion are expected to cost about $4 million, said 
Randy Lewis, executive director of the Burbank Family YMCA.The first $2 million 
for the project had been raised through a private campaign fund completed in 
early January. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA plans to tear down an old Baptist church and parsonage, which have 
belonged to the group since the 1920s and are now used for administrative 
offices and multipurpose rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 They are to be replaced by a new three-story, 30,000-square-foot building 
which will be attached to the main YMCA building at the corner of Magnolia 
Boulevard and 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The first $2 million will be used to construct the exterior of the building 
and complete the interior of the first floor. The remaining $2 million would 
complete the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The new campaign will seek large private donations from supporters of the 
YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion project will end the competition for space between the 
gymnastics and basketball programs. It will also end the juggling of schedules 
for the use of the one pool among the aquatics programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition will include a new pool and extra room for the gymnastics 
programs, as well as an indoor Jacuzzi and a weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA has a total membership of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council is tentatively scheduled to approve the expansion 
plans at its May 10 meeting. "We are hoping we are going to be able to break 
ground within 30 days of the City Council approval," Lewis said. ED BOND

 Police were seeking witnesses Tuesday to a traffic accident on Olive Avenue 
where an 82-year-old Burbank woman crossing the street was struck and killed by 
a van. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no witnesses wh came forward," said Burbank Police Detective Richard 
Bison. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgiana Hutchinson, 82, of Burbank was pronounced dead at the scene by 
Burbank Fire Department paramedics after the 10:52 a.m. accident. Bison said 
the woman had been crossing Olive Avenue northbound at Beachwood Drive in an 
unmarked crosswalk when she was struck by a van driven by Anthony Ivancich, 51, 
of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed against Ivancich, who had been driving east on 
Olive Avenue just after turning off of Verdugo Avenue when the accident 
happened, Bison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The questions are: 'Was she legally and safely in the intersection?' and 'If 
she was, then why didn't he yield to her?' " Bison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bison said Ivancich was questioned at the scene and not taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Police diverted traffic off Olive Avenue between Verdugo and Virginia avenues 
near the Izay Park until about 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bison asked that any witnesses to the accident, which occurred in front of 
Genio's Restaurant, call him at 818-953-8650. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; ARCHITECTS NAMED FOR 2 DAMAGED SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Camino Real and Kennedy high school administrators were relieved Tuesday to 
learn that architects have been selected to begin repairing the 
earthquake-damaged campuses -- the hardest-hit high schools in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education on Monday swiftly approved $5.3 million for two 
architecture firms to conduct studies and supervise construction at the two 
West Valley schools.The schools, closed for six weeks after the Jan. 17 quake, 
received structural, architectural and cosmetic damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy in Granada Hills sustained the worst structural damage in its 
administration building, which might need to be razed and rebuilt. Classroom 
buildings also received serious damage and need to be upgraded to meet current 
seismic safety codes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino in Woodland Hills sustained architectural damage to its classrooms, 
in which walls shook loose. Ceiling tiles and light fixtures also were broken 
and need to be replaced. While the school did not sustain structural damage, 
officials said the walls were in danger of collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most classes at the two schools are still being held in portable classrooms. 
Classroom buildings remain cordoned off and Kennedy's three-story 
administration building cannot be entered, leaving administrators without some 
records, including those of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's coping, but it's hard to be out of your regular element," said 
Nancy Park, assistant principal at El Camino. "I think we would really like to 
be back in our regular environment. I'm glad to hear that (the board action) 
has happened." BETH SHUSTER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE GETS GRANT FROM KAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting in the fall, Pierce College nursing students will use interactive 
computer programs to test their skills on simulated patients before joining 
hospitals for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 About $20,000 worth of computer hardware, software and audiovisual equipment 
provided by a grant from Kaiser Permanente's Woodland Hills Medical Center will 
come on line during the summer, said Sharon Hall, chairwoman of Pierce's 
Department of Nursing and Allied Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't begin to describe how helpful this grant will be," Hall said. "Our 
community colleges are so destitute for funding, we would probably never have 
gotten this without Kaiser's support." 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment will be used largely to pose hypothetical situations to the 158 
students in the Pierce program, then give them several options from which to 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will allow students to track a patient throughout the emergency room, 
decide when to call the doctor and other situations they will see in the 
hospital every time they go to work," Hall said. "It gives them the opportunity 
to make decisions without worrying about hurting anybody." KURT PITZER

VALLEY BRIEFING: BUILDING THE CITY ; A GUIDE TO PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How a city develops is a complicated process that evolves over many years and 
is guided by many layers of local, state and federal regulations. Most land-use 
fights tend to focus on these regulations and how they are interpreted by 
landowners, local officials and citizen groups. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of most of these disputes, however, are fundamental differences 
in the way land is viewed. Some consider land a resource to be protected. 
Others say it is a commodity, like automobiles, toothpaste or pork bellies. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have considerable legal validity. 
</P>
<P>
 Land is protected by state and federal laws and can be regulated further by 
local rules, such as zoning. But even more deeply rooted is the notion that an 
individual can derive profit from a piece of property. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing those views is the realm of the political arena. It's no wonder then 
that disputes over a proposed golf course in Topanga Canyon, or whether a large 
office complex can be built near homes in Woodland Hills can drag on for years, 
fueling the emotions of all involved. PRINCIPLES OF PRIVATE PROPERTY  
</P>
<P>
 The notion of private property has three basic elements: 
</P>
<P>
 The right to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to exclude others from it. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to buy and sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 But these rights are not absolute. English Common Law established the idea 
that public nuisances can be restricted. And even before the Magna Carta in 
1215, the idea that the state could seize private land for public good was 
generally accepted. The Fifth and the 14th Amendments guarantee due process and 
just compensation if a person's land is seized by the government. PUBLIC GOALS 
VERSUS PRIVATE WANTS  
</P>
<P>
 The use of eminent domain by governments for everything from freeway 
overpasses to parks is well established. Other instances are less clear-cut, 
such as when a government agency creates regulations that restrict use of a 
property owner's land. 
</P>
<P>
 Such regulations might include zone changes that allow less development or 
halt it altogether. If those regulations deprive a land owner of all viable use 
of the property, it is considered a "regulatory taking" and is viewed the same 
as an eminent domain action. Deciding the "viable use" of the land, however, is 
subject to interpretation. UNEASY BALANCE  
</P>
<P>
 Two local cases -- Soka University and Warner Ridge -- demonstrate the 
difficult relationship between the rights of private property owners and 
responsibilities of public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Warner Ridge case, the city of Los Angeles changed the zoning on land 
proposed for an office complex in Woodland Hills so only single-family houses 
were allowed. The developer sued, claiming the action deprived him of 
economically viable use of the land. Several judges agreed and forced the city 
to change the zoning back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Soka University case, public parks officials are trying to condemn the 
school's Calabasas campus to use it as a visitors center to the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. That case is pending in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. EVOLUTION OF LAND LAWS  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some landmark cases governing how property, from a giant office 
complex to a single-family home, can be used or protected: 
</P>
<P>
 Village of Euclid vs Ambler Realty Co.: In 1927, the Supreme Court upheld the 
constitutionality of zoning -- a new concept at the time -- rejecting a realty 
company's claim that the Ohio city of Euclid's zoning ordinance took property 
without due process. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn Central Transportation Co. vs New York City: In 1978, the Supreme Court 
legitimized historic preservation efforts. It rejected claims by the owners of 
New York's Grand Central Terminal -- who wanted to build an office tower over 
the historic station -- that the city's rejection of the project devalued their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Agins vs City of Tiburon: In 1979, the California Supreme Court ruled that 
landowners are not entitled to compensation from the government if a zoning or 
other law reduces the value of their property. Instead, it ruled, the property 
owner could sue only to have the restrictive ordinance overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 First English Evangelical Lutheran Church vs County of Los Angeles: In 1987, 
the Supreme Court essentially overturned the Agins case by ruling that property 
owners could indeed collect compensation from the government if their land is 
devalued through such "regulatory takings." The case involved a church camp in 
Tujunga Canyon that was not allowed to rebuild after a flood.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNTY ADVISED TO SETTLE JAIL BUILDER'S SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles County claims board on Tuesday recommended paying $4 million to 
settle a longstanding lawsuit brought by the construction company that built 
the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho's newest facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider the recommendation on May 10.Board 
approval of the $4-million award will mark the end of a 6-year-old lawsuit 
brought by J.A. Jones Inc., the firm awarded the $99-million contract to build 
the North County Correctional Facility in Castaic, said Nancy Singer, 
chairwoman of the three-member claims board. 
</P>
<P>
 The total settlement is about $6 million because the design firm contracted by 
the county has agreed to accept a portion of the financial responsibility, 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction company had agreed to complete the work in about 23 months, 
but contended that changes in the design and design errors caused delays that 
added 15 months to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charlotte, N.C.-based construction firm had originally asked for $22.3 
million to cover the costs it incurred because of increased work 
responsibilities and man hours. 
</P>
<P>
 County attorneys acknowledged that plans for the jail facility were not 
perfect, but said they did not cause the construction delay. They said the 
$22.3 million sought by the firm was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said the $3-million settlement recommendation was made after the claims 
board, which includes representatives from the offices of the auditor 
controller, chief administrative officer and county counsel, reviewed the costs 
and unpredictable outcome of a court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 All parties except the Board of Supervisors have agreed to the settlement, 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the complexity of discovery in construction case lawsuits, the 
county incurred $3 million in legal expenses preparing for trial and estimated 
it would cost an additional $1 million to take the case to court, Singer said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ELECTIONS / SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL; KLAJIC 
WILL ASK FOR RECOUNT IF SHE CAN RAISE $500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the City Council race here isn't over after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Klajic, ousted from her council seat by 16 votes, now says she will call 
for an electronic recount if her supporters can raise the $500 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic, 47, originally said she didn't want a recount of the close tallies. 
But she said Tuesday she was persuaded by campaign supporters who complained 
they'd always wonder who really won if a second count wasn't conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Clyde Smyth, who at last count had edged Klajic by 3,804 to 3,788 votes, 
was sworn in Tuesday night, along with returning incumbents Jo Anne Darcy and 
Carl Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having to wait 36 hours beyond election night for the counting of 
outstanding absentee ballots to see if his slim lead held, Smyth, who now faces 
the possibility of having the seat yanked out from under him, said he doesn't 
oppose a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no difficulty with this," said Smyth, 62. "I've spent my whole life 
touting the democratic process. I believe in the system and the system provides 
the recount mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone seeking a recount has five days from when election results are 
certified -- in this case Tuesday night -- to request a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic's supporters say they'll be able to raise $500 in the next four days 
without difficulty. "Oh, yeah, that would be easy," said Skip Newhall, Klajic's 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic is more skeptical about raising the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'You couldn't raise enough money for me to get elected, how are 
you going to raise enough for a recount?' " Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Smyth keeps his newly acquired seat, he is expected to have a less 
confrontational style that his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic often represented a different viewpoint from the other council members 
-- most notably she supported a growth-control initiative that would have 
allowed a maximum of 475 new housing units a year for the next decade. The 
other four council members opposed the measure, largely because it took the 
decision-making out of council hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Smyth retired from the William S. Hart Union High School District 
in 1992, after more than 16 years as its superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is concerned about Santa Clarita's budget and believes public 
safety, transportation and keeping businesses healthy are important challenges 
for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "(I hope to) be a part of a group of five people who can disagree without 
being disagreeable and who can work together to move forward, and with that we 
can solve problems," Smyth said. GOVERNMENT OFF

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN ARRESTED IN PIPE BOMB EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Monrovia man was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of placing a pipe bomb that 
exploded under his ex-wife's pickup truck outside a house in Lancaster, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, but investigators were trying to determine 
whether the suspect, Charles Edwin Smith, 70, was also connected to a March 26 
explosion that damaged his ex-wife's motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was taken into custody at his Monrovia residence at 1:30 a.m. and jailed 
at the sheriff's Temple City Station on suspicion of exploding a destructive 
device, Deputy George Ducoulombier said. He was being held in lieu of $500,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest occurred about 90 minutes after an explosion rocked the 1100 block 
of Herzel Avenue in Lancaster, where Smith's ex-wife, Rini Duzanne, 51, was 
staying. The home belonged to Duzanne's daughter from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house shook so badly that we thought it was a bomb inside the house," 
Duzanne, a Lancaster city building inspector, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast awoke Marty Bailey, who lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't wake up for earthquakes or anything, but this woke me up," he said. 
"I thought it was a plane crash." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said he stepped outside and saw the damage to Duzanne's pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hood was blown up, and the fender on the driver's right side was gone," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies estimated damage to the vehicle at $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Duzanne said she left her husband in September, 1988, and became embroiled in 
a bitter divorce that became final last November. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she moved into a motor home after her house in Chatsworth was gutted 
by an arson fire in December. After the fire, she parked her motor home out of 
sight behind a Lancaster restaurant because she was concerned about her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies investigated a pipe bomb explosion last month that caused 
an estimated $5,000 damage to the motor home. No immediate arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducoulombier said Duzanne and Smith have been engaged in a long-running 
dispute. He confirmed that investigators are trying to determine whether last 
month's motor home bombing was linked to this week's pickup explosion.

MURDER DEFENDANT WAS SEEING THERAPIST; TRIAL: ROBERT CHAN'S MOTHER TELLS OF HER 
SON'S BIZARRE BEHAVIOR, FEAR OF STRANGERS IN WEEKS PRECEDING THE SLAYING OF 
HONOR STUDENT STUART TAY. PSYCHOTHERAPIST SAYS YOUTH'S PROBLEMS WERE 'SEVERE.' 
</P>

 Robert Chan refused to bathe, slept with the lights on and became convinced 
strangers were out to hurt him in the weeks before he allegedly plotted the 
1992 New Year's Eve slaying of honors student Stuart A. Tay, the defendant's 
mother testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shu Chan said she and her husband were so worried about their 18-year-old son 
that they forced him to see a psychotherapist in November, 1992. The couple met 
with the counselor the day before the killing to discuss their teen-ager's 
problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt no more hope for his life," the former schoolteacher told an Orange 
County Superior Court jury. "I was so scared and worried about my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Shu Chan appeared to swoon on the witness stand and fought back tears as she 
testified that her son had been scheduled to return to the psychotherapist on 
Jan. 7, 1993 -- one week after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by then . . ." she said, unable to finish her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too late?" prompted defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Shu Chan whispered. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton psychotherapist Keith Golay followed Shu Chan on the witness stand 
and told jurors that after four sessions with Robert Chan, he realized a 
psychiatrist would be better equipped than he to address the Fullerton 
teen-ager's problems, which he said included a desire to give up living. But 
Chan was later arrested for Tay's slaying and no referral was ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Golay conceded Tuesday that he underestimated Robert Chan's fragile mental 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "His problems were severe, rather than moderate, as I earlier believed," Golay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, now 19, faces life in prison if convicted of masterminding the slaying 
of Tay, 17, of Orange, who was an honors student at Foothill High School in 
Santa Ana. The prosecution contends that Chan plotted the killing because he 
feared Tay was going to double-cross him in a planned computer heist. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense contends that Chan is a paranoid schizophrenic who turned on 
Tay because he believed his own life was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other youths charged in the case -- Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, 
and Mun Bong Kang, 19, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, both of Fullerton -- will go on 
trial after Chan's case concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness was a fifth youth, Charles Choe, 18, of Fullerton, 
who pleaded guilty to his role in the killing and testified against Chan.  
</P>
<P>
 Chan and the four youths attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Robert Chan and the others beat Tay, forced rubbing 
alcohol down his throat and then taped his mouth and nose shut. He was then 
buried in Acosta's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first three years in high school, Robert Chan had done well in 
school, was a sharp dresser and a contender for class valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed in early 1992, his mother said. His grades began slipping, he 
refused to shower or brush his teeth, wore filthy clothing and became distant 
and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I did not think it was a serious problem; I thought depression 
was a common thing for teen-agers," she said. She sought professional help when 
his symptoms persisted -- and worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the slaying, mother and son were walking near a homeless man 
when the teen-ager became convinced the man might hurt them, his mother 
testified. Another time, he became terrified of a woman who was walking near 
the family's home and ran indoors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golay told jurors that Chan's refusal to take care of himself indicated a 
"splitting in his personality," as did Chan's admission that he had begun to 
feel like a "spectator" in his own life and experienced severe feelings of 
hopelessness and despair about life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go to school, you work and then you die," Golay recalled Chan saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan was also consumed with random thoughts on such subjects as death, evil, 
Smurfs characters and former President Theodore Roosevelt, Golay said.

PULLING FOR NIXON; LEADERSHIP: ADMIRERS GATHER AT YORBA LINDA LIBRARY & 
BIRTHPLACE TO SEND FORMER PRESIDENT BEST WISHES, URGE HIM TO 'KEEP FIGHTING.' 
</P>

<P>
 Tim Fisher was in the middle of his daily water-delivery route Tuesday morning 
when he heard the news that former President Richard Nixon lay partially 
paralyzed by a serious stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 So the deliveryman interrupted his work and drove straight to the Nixon 
Library & Birthplace. "The man has done a lot for the country," said Fisher, 
49, "and now he needs our support." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Roberts brought her two sons, age 4 and 6, to the library immediately 
upon learning of the former President's condition. "Our thoughts and prayers 
are with him," she said. "We wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
 And Dave Peters, a professor at La Mirada's Biola University, began a 
previously scheduled tour of the facility with his American history class by 
pausing on the front steps long enough to lead the group in prayer for the 
ex-President's recovery. "I'm very saddened," Peters said. "I've always been 
pleased that he's been so active and animated." 
</P>
<P>
 The three well-wishers were among the hundreds who stood in line at Nixon's 
presidential library Tuesday to scrawl their thoughts in a get-well book 
prominently displayed in the lobby. Hundreds of others called to offer hope and 
encouragement. And dozens more inquired about -- in many cases, purchased -- 
autographs of the former head of state that were on sale in the gift shop for 
$100 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood is one of concern, but confidence," said John H. Taylor, the 
museum's director. "There is no fatalism in these calls; we know he can beat 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it almost seemed like business as usual at the museum as visitors 
alternated between standing in line to sign the get-well book, viewing a 
documentary in which the 81-year-old former chief executive speaks of the 
"evening" of his life, and strolling out past the garden in which Nixon's wife, 
Pat, was buried last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who accompanied Nixon on a trip to the former Soviet Union a month 
ago, said there was much cause for optimism regarding the former President's 
condition. "I am worried about this development," he said, "but also greatly 
encouraged because I know of the reservoirs of strength that President Nixon 
has to call upon. I can tell you from personal observation that, until this 
illness struck yesterday, he was at the top of his form; as vigorous as a man 
could be, with strength and fortitude and will in abundance." 
</P>
<P>
 That view seemed to be shared by most of the well-wishers -- many of them 
longtime Nixon supporters -- as they stood in line reminiscing about the man 
most said they greatly admired. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a real trooper," one wrote in the get-well book, "and I know you'll 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote another: "You have always been a fighter; keep on fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 As in most discussions of Nixon, however, the subject of Watergate -- the 
scandal that forced him from office in 1974 -- inevitably came up. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Mocciaro, a dentist from Downey, said he thought that history would be 
kind to the only President to resign his office. "I just hope he can survive 
this," he said of Nixon's condition. "I happen to feel that he was a great 
President who's been very unfairly treated." 
</P>
<P>
 John Bardgette, a retired petroleum company employee from Thousand Oaks, 
expressed similar sentiments. "I've always felt that Nixon was one of our 
country's real statesmen," he said. "I think the only thing he did wrong was 
not burn the (Watergate) tapes." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in attendance were some who had not yet been born when Nixon was 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Bayless, a 19-year-old student at Biola, said that she had felt 
"overwhelmed" earlier in the day upon hearing of the Nixon's condition while 
getting ready for her class field trip to the presidential library. "I've 
always looked up to President Nixon," the student said. "I'm very excited to be 
here today, but it's kind of bittersweet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Anderson, 20, said he was struck by the irony of visiting Nixon's 
library on the same day that news of his stroke was released. "We're getting to 
see his past life in the museum and present life in the news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And 13-year-old Erin Oshea, on a field trip with members of her class at 
Covenant Christian School in Orange, said that she had gotten her first 
impression of Nixon by visiting the library that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what had she learned? 
</P>
<P>
 "That he's an OK guy," Oshea said. "I hope he gets better and doesn't have any 
more problems."NIXON, RICHARD

TOP-LEVEL UCI ADMINISTRATOR RESIGNS POST; EDUCATION: M. ANNE SPENCE, VICE

<P>
 Adding her name to a growing list of high-level administrators who have 
stepped down from their posts at UC Irvine, Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Programs M. Anne Spence has announced she is resigning to resume teaching and 
research in genetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence's position will be eliminated when she leaves her post May 1, 
university officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence was the first and will be the only vice chancellor of academic 
programs, a position created in early 1992 to help shape student affairs during 
lean budget years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two university task forces studying cost-cutting measures recently 
recommended eliminating Spence's job and two other vice chancellor posts -- a 
factor in Spence's decision to resign, but not the overwhelming one, UCI 
officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The uncertainty about the position was taken into consideration," UCI 
spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said. "She is eager to return to research full 
time, but it's also clear that both task forces recommended that the position 
be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing worked out this way because of commitments Anne Spence was facing 
in terms of meeting grant proposal deadlines" in genetics research, Young said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The university said Spence will resume teaching and research full time in the 
pediatrics department at the UCI College of Medicine.  
</P>
<P>
 Spence, who did not return telephone calls Tuesday, said in a prepared 
statement: 
</P>
<P>
 "My interest is and always has been in human genetics. I have enjoyed my 
sojourn into administration immensely, but I now have a number of exciting 
opportunities to expand my work with UCI's outstanding genetics research team." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Spence, an accomplished genetic counselor working in 
pediatrics, conducted research that looked for the genetic origins of 
pre-adolescent schizophrenia, said UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young said that Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening and Executive Vice Chancellor 
Spencer Olin decided after Spence submitted her resignation that eliminating 
her position "was the best decision at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Wilkening took over the helm of UCI, three other high-level 
administrators have stepped down, left for other jobs or were let go.  
</P>
<P>
 In March, engineering dean William A. Sirignano was ousted after a review. Dr. 
Walter L. Henry, vice chancellor of health sciences and dean of the College of 
Medicine, resigned in December. And L. Dennis Smith left UCI and his executive 
vice chancellor position to become president at University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 When Spence leaves her post, one female vice chancellor -- Kathleen Jones, in 
charge of university advancement -- will remain. Granell said UCI still has 
several other women in top positions, including police chief, head librarian 
and dean of biological sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have some women who are vice chancellors -- and now there's 
going to be one less," commented Paula L. Goldsmid, director of the Women's 
Resource Center on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Granell downplayed the drain of top administrators. "A few changes do not 
necessarily influence the day-to-day activities of this campus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The departures come at a time when upper management is also dealing with 
budget strains. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's Academic Planning Council, during the next two months, will discuss 
cost-cutting proposals by two university task forces and the campus community's 
response to them. Wilkening will announce which programs, departments and 
managers will be eliminated after June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the task forces suggested that the six current vice chancellors be cut 
to three. New positions would address education, administration and research 
and advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Granell said officials would have decided what to do about Spence's position 
during the review process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's $10 million to cut from the budget next year," Granell said. "The 
timing wasn't ideal, but the chancellor and Spence Olin have determined it was 
a decision that probably would have been made." 
</P>
<P>
 As vice chancellor, Spence supervises academic programs -- parts of the 
university that don't fall into specific schools, such as University Extension, 
the library and interdisciplinary programs such as Asian American studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of her vice chancellor's position in 1992 brought opposition from 
several deans, said sources who did not want to be named. Some saw her as an 
additional, unnecessary manager meant to be "politically correct" and filling a 
job that was not well-defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Granell declined to comment on Spence's standing among her peers but noted 
that she was responsible for many internal faculty recruitment and retention 
matters. Those included promising Asian American students in 1993 that the 
university would hire four professors to teach Asian American studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Others believe her position was set up with too many demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the position was created, a number of women faculty were somewhat 
skeptical," said Judy Rosener, senior lecturer in the Graduate School of 
Management. "We felt it was going to be given a lot of very difficult 
responsibilities, and a woman was definitely going to be slotted, and it was 
set up to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosener said Spence came in with a professional and businesslike demeanor at 
"a time of great chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 An Oklahoma native, Spence earned a bachelor's degree in biology from Grinnell 
College in Iowa in 1966 and a Ph.D. in human genetics from the University of 
Hawaii. She joined UCLA in 1970. Those Who Have Left

CITY EXTENDS RAMS' LEASE FOR PRACTICE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Putting to rest an issue that has strained relations between the city and Los 
Angeles Rams, the City Council on Tuesday approved an agreement to extend the 
ballclub's practice facility lease. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the contentious negotiations, the council vote was not without 
dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler, who could not attend the meeting because he is still 
recuperating in a hospital from a car accident earlier this month, criticized 
the agreement in a letter to his colleagues for carelessly throwing taxpayer 
money at the Rams at a time when the city is strapped for cash and the 
franchise has indicated it may soon move. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Pickler criticized the agreement for a clause that requires the 
city to subsidize as much as $3.3 million in rent payments over the lifetime of 
the 10-year lease with a five-year extension option. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a time when we're closing libraries early and scrambling to pay for more 
police officers, (the lease subsidy) does not seem prudent," Pickler wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The council noted Pickler's objection, but went on to approve the lease 3-0, 
with Pickler and Councilman Frank Feldhaus absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members seemed pleased that the matter had finally been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't view it as a subsidy," Councilman Bob D. Simpson said after the vote. 
"If that helps to keep them here, then I'm certainly in favor of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly agreed: "It's good to have this problem resolved. Now we can 
focus on the larger issue of whether the Rams will continue to play here." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the Rams have said they will exercise an escape clause in their 
stadium lease and seek to relocate the team to a city where they can receive a 
better financial package. Although city officials are trying to keep the team 
from leaving, they have been sidetracked by the controversy over the lease for 
the practice facility, the former Juliette Low Elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The team's previous lease expired Dec. 31. Since then, the city and the owner 
of the site -- the Magnolia School District -- have tried to come to terms with 
the Rams to extend it. Under both the old and new pacts, the city leases the 
former school site from the school district and then sublets it to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the Rams faced eviction proceedings, which were initiated by 
district officials who grew weary of the team's negotiating tactics, that Ram 
officials reluctantly relented and signed the lease extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has final approval of the lease agreement, but district 
officials have indicated that they would accept the agreement once the city and 
Rams came to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul S. Mercier, the school district's superintendent, said Tuesday that he 
will recommend that the Board of Trustees approve the lease document at their 
meeting Monday. Furthermore, he said he will recommend that the district drop 
its eviction lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the agreement approved by the city Tuesday, the team can 
break the lease at any time, provided that it gives six months notice and pay a 
penalty of about $220,000. In addition to the city's rental subsidy, which is 
$130,000 during the first year of the lease, the city has agreed to pay half of 
the estimated $1.2 million to $1.5 million in restoration costs the Rams will 
be required to pay whenever they move out. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the Rams are required to make annual rental payments of 
$120,000 for the practice site, the city -- as it has in the past -- will 
offset that amount with a $120,000 reduction in "game-day expenses" that the 
team is required to pay the city. As a result, the team will continue to use 
the practice site virtually rent free, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those incentives, the Rams have repeatedly have said they are unhappy 
with the terms of the lease because of their financial liability in connection 
with the possible $220,000 penalty and site restoration-expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kirch, a 10-year resident of Anaheim, told the council Tuesday that he 
felt the same way about the city's financial commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we, the taxpayers, shoulder the burden for the Rams' rent," Kirch 
said. "It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Martin Miller contributed to this report. Fine Print of 
Rams Lease 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the terms of the lease extension for the Rams practice 
facility at the former Juliette Low Elementary School. The extension was 
approved by the Anaheim City Council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The lease is for 10 years, and the Rams have an option to extend it by five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rams can break the lease at any time, provided they give at least six 
months' notice and pay a penalty of about $220,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city subsidizes about $3.3 million of the rental payments over the 
course of the entire 15 years. The city's first-year payment will be about 
$130,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city agreed to pick up about half of the estimated $1.2 million to $1.5 
million in restoration costs that the Rams will be required to pay if they move 
out of the former school facility.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NONVIOLENCE IS FOCUS OF WEEK'S ACTIVITIES

 A local group is asking young people to shun violence and to put pressure on 
elected officials and community leaders to do something about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest resident Karen Lott, founder of the Green Ribbon campaign, is 
urging students and families to write letters this week to their elected 
representatives, asking them to get tough on young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott is also calling on parents to turn off the television today and for them 
to ask their pastors to speak out Sunday about the problem of youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to encourage kids to be good citizens and speak up," Lott said. "If 
they know something bad is going to happen, they have to speak up and tell 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Lott founded the Green Ribbon campaign after her son, Philip, now 18, was shot 
four times by fellow students in a drive-by shooting nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, she spread her message of nonviolence to sixth-graders at Cielo 
Vista Elementary School in Rancho Santa Margarita. The students will send "stop 
youth violence" cards to representatives in their district, teacher Paul Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also making posters to hang in their windows at home and will try not 
to watch television today, Hart said.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone needs to realize that violence among youths "is not only in North 
Orange County or L.A.," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the letter-writing and poster campaigns, the Green Ribbon 
campaign is also sponsoring a writing contest. Students from grades one through 
12 are encouraged to write essays on teen violence and how they can make their 
community a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories can be essays, poetry, fiction or nonfiction and can be typed or 
printed. A $100 prize will go to the first-place winner. The second-place 
student will receive $50, with $25 going to the third-place student, Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries must be received by 5 p.m. on May 6. They should be sent to Karen 
Lott, P.O. Box 848, Lake Forest, Calif. 92630.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; GUN RANGE LEASE PROPOSAL REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority on the City Council and the politically powerful Huntington Beach 
Police Officers Assn. are at loggerheads over a proposed lease for a gun range. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 3 Monday to reject the association's proposal for a 
20-year lease for the existing gun range in Central Park. The range is used to 
train police in firing weapons, and private gun owners are also permitted to 
use the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of negotiating with the police association, city officials drafted 
a proposed long-term lease for the range. The item was placed on the City 
Council's "consent calendar," among non-controversial items that are normally 
approved unanimously, without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gun range proposal was taken off the consent calendar and debated 
during Monday night's council meeting. Council members opposed to the proposed 
lease argued that the police association was not being required to specify when 
it would improve and upgrade the range. 
</P>
<P>
 The council opponents also argued that the lease did not clarify how profits 
from the range would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the proposed lease contended that the city was getting a good 
deal in having the police association maintain and operate the range. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva, who supported the proposal, noted that gun owners use 
the range for training and instruction. "Gun sales today are at an all-time 
high," said Silva. "We need a facility here in Huntington Beach where people 
can be trained under professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell, who opposed the proposal, contended that the 
police association has given "no assurances that improvements (to the gun 
range) will ever occur." Councilman Dave Sullivan, another opponent of the 
lease, said the lease is not clear about disposition of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson and Councilman Earle Robitaille voted in 
favor of the lease. Winchell, Sullivan and Councilmen Ralph Bauer and Victor 
Leipzig opposed the lease and voted to return the proposal for more 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach Police Officers Assn. has a political arm that usually 
endorses candidates in city elections. The association's political work has 
often been the deciding factor in close races.BILL BILLITER

 Carnations, orchids, poinsettias and a garden of other flowers will blossom 
along Corona del Mar's business strip this summer because to the efforts of 
some artists and the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorful depictions of more than a dozen flowers -- for which many of Corona 
del Mar's street are named -- have been painted onto canvas banners and will be 
attached to light posts high above Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 banners will be hung -- each one designed to coordinate with a 
street's name. A banner displaying marigolds will be displayed at East Coast 
Highway and Marigold Avenue. A dahlia banner will adorn the highway's 
intersection with Dahlia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of a campaign by merchants to boost the business district's 
recession-bruised economy as well as highlight the "village" atmosphere of the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this gives us some hope for the future and pride in our community," 
said Patty McDonald, a real estate agent and member of the Corona del Mar 
Chamber of Commerce. "We hope this adds beauty to the community and lets people 
know we are here." 
</P>
<P>
 The business district runs along East Coast Highway roughly from Avocado 
Avenue to Poppy Avenue. It is marked by a variety of restaurants, furniture 
stores, specialty shops and the historic Port movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Local artists volunteered their time to design and draw the banners. Each 
banner measures 60 inches tall by 30 inches wide and was hand-painted. Corona 
del Mar merchants and residents donated money to purchase the supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Newport Beach Fire Department hook-and-ladder truck hoisted one 
of the banners onto a light post so that merchants could see how it looked. 
Under Caltrans rules, the banners must be placed at least 18 feet above the 
ground if they face the road or 14 feet high if they face the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining both options, chamber officials decided the banners will face 
the road, McDonald said. They will be permanently installed within the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The banners are the second phase of a revitalization effort that has already 
seen the planting of 12 evergreen topiaries in the East Coast Highway median 
near Marguerite Avenue. The trees are cut in the shape of dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber officials also have been encouraging retail business owners to 
consider sprucing up their storefronts. The row of shops is far from blighted, 
but McDonald said the area could look even better if some facades are cleaned 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move would better highlight the street's varied architectural styles, 
including Cape Cod, Victorian, English Tudor and Mediterranean. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COSTS OF COUNTY FIRE CONTRACT ANALYZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city finance department analysis shows that Buena Park would save about 
$354,000 the first year if Orange County Fire Department provides fire services 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the analysis revealed that by 1998-99, based on a five-year historical 
average of county and city cost increases, there may be no savings to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, the county contract would cost more than if the city 
maintained its own department," said Finance Director Greg Beaubien. "In the 
beginning you save money, but at some point in time, the savings are no longer 
there on an annual basis, and you begin to have cost increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaubien said on Monday that the estimated $353,790 in savings is based on a 
proposed budget of $5.35 million for the city's Fire Department in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaubien, who explained the analysis to the more than 80 people who attended 
Monday's public information meeting on the county's proposal, said the city 
could also face cost increases for fire services in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to predict the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Schulman, a 31-year resident and outspoken opponent of merging fire 
services with the county, criticized the proposal based on the analysis. "It 
becomes a loser in a short period of time," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is being considered as a cost-cutting measure since the city will 
continue to face a budget deficit this fiscal year, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the city's Fire Department is merged with the county, all 61 employees 
would be absorbed and would not lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing and council decision is tentatively scheduled for May 16.  
</P>
<P>
 At Monday night's meeting, which lasted five hours, 23 people addressed the 
council. They raised concerns, asked questions, and some voiced opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 City firefighters gave their support and urged the council to vote in favor of 
the county taking over fire services. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; GOLF COURSE PROPOSAL WON'T BE ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a parade of angry residents protested the plan, the City Council on 
Monday decided against putting a park-conversion proposal on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's invitation, a commercial company had drafted preliminary plans 
for converting undeveloped Bartlett Park into a nine-hole golf course.City 
staff had then recommended that the council begin the process of placing the 
proposal on a citywide ballot this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal came under heavy criticism at the council's board meeting. 
During public comments, 13 residents castigated the golf course concept for 
Bartlett Park. Many urged the council not to develop the land at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is on 30 undeveloped acres behind the Newland Shopping Center at 
Beach Boulevard and Adams Avenue. The city's concept was to get a commercial 
operator to landscape, develop and maintain the land at no expense to the 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan is seriously flawed, and it's inappropriate to put a golf course in 
this location," said Ed Kerins, representing the citizens' organization, 
Huntington Beach Tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva said most of the critics appeared to be neighbors of the 
park and he wondered whether others, including senior citizens, might welcome a 
new golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were critics on the council as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (Bartlett Park) is a neighborhood-oriented park," said Councilman Ralph 
Bauer. "The people who ought to be supporting this (proposed conversion of the 
park) are opposed to it. If you put this on the ballot, it will virtually 
fail." 
</P>
<P>
 The council by a 6-1 vote endorsed Bauer's suggestion that the city staff meet 
with neighborhood residents to find an acceptable park plan. Silva voted 
against the idea. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BEACH REOPENS AFTER WATER SAFETY 
VERIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A half-mile portion of beach reopened Tuesday afternoon after test results 
following a weekend sewage spill showed that the water is safe, county health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done the monitoring and reviewed data and it indicates that the water 
meets state standards," said Larry Honeybourne, program chief of the water 
quality section for the Orange County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Honeybourne said the stretch of beach near the mouth of the Santa Ana River -- 
at both Huntington State Beach and Newport Beach -- was reopened at 4 p.m. 
Tuesday after being closed since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The treated sewage water is normally discharged about four miles into the 
ocean. But sewage leaked from a pipeline and dumped waste water -- between 
5,000 and 7,500 gallons -- into the Santa River.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CARPENTER SUES CITY FOR $10,774 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A carpenter has filed a lawsuit against the city for $10,774 he says is owed 
him for helping build the city's newest fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit by Thomas W. Merrick seeks payment for framing work done at the 
station at 3350 Sakioka Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The station, which cost $3.4 million to build and equip, opened in August. The 
station was designed in consultation with firefighters and features a blue 
glass atrium and white tilewalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick says in his suit, filed last week, that he was not fully paid by 
Edwards Group, the lead contractor, and now wants payment from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards Group went bankrupt and did not pay all the subcontractors, according 
to Jim Richey, the Fire Department division chief who oversaw the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Thomas Kathe called Merrick's lawsuit "meritless" and said the city 
has already settled with the subcontractors. Merrick said he received only half 
the money owed him. WILLSON CUMMER

<P>
 Work crews today will begin the city's annual concrete repair and replacement 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest-based Lambaren Contractors Corp. was recently awarded the $106,000 
job and will repair damaged sidewalks, curbs, gutters and driveways in the 
public right of way, starting at the north end of the city, said Dennis Jue, a 
city spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jue said the job will be broken into four phases, starting with the area north 
of Crown Valley Parkway. On April 27, the crews will start the central portion 
of the city north of Selva Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the Lantern and Doheny village areas will begin about May 9, and crews 
will move to Capistrano Beach on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 About $50,000 of the project's cost has been funded by federal community 
development money, with the remainder coming from the city's general fund, Jue 
said.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; SCHOOL BOUNDARY CHANGES OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kimberly Redman, a fourth-grader at Arovista Elementary School, does not want 
to be transferred to another school next year, and this week she told her 
school board just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot at Arovista School the past years I've been here and I've 
been looking forward to graduating at Arovista in sixth grade," the 10-year-old 
girl told the Brea-Olinda Unified School District Board of Education. "My 
bubble will burst if I have to leave Arovista." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members are considering forcing about 100 students, who are 
currently attending the overcrowded Arovista and Mariposa elementary schools, 
to attend schools with smaller student populations come September. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed boundary changes, the students who would be transferred do 
not live in the attendance areas for Mariposa and Arovista, school officials 
said. Some live outside Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the proposal, the students who do not live in the city 
will be transferred to Laurel, Fanning, Country Hills and Olinda elementary 
schools, which are not overcrowded. Students who are residents of the city and 
are going to Arovista or Mariposa will be sent to their neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 690 students attend Arovista and 615 attend Mariposa. The maximum 
recommended numbers are 650 at Arovista and 600 at Mariposa. School officials 
said they expect the two schools' student population to grow in the next few 
years because of housing projects being developed in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 parents spoke against the proposed boundary changes at Monday's 
school board meeting, saying their children would be devastated if they had to 
enroll at other schools. None mentioned the concerns that were brought up at 
the first public hearing last month, when parents complained that they did not 
want their children to have to go to Laurel, where half the students are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, administrators and community members have charged that parents 
who refuse to send their children to Laurel are racist. Parents have denied the 
accusations, saying they are merely concerned with their children's safety and 
quality of education. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents asked trustees to consider making exceptions for their children 
so they can graduate from the schools they are currently attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Cannon, an Anaheim resident whose son attends Arovista, pleaded with 
the board to allow her son to stay there because she will move to Arovista's 
attendance area in December. "It would just be a crime to move him and then 
move him back again," she said. "It doesn't make a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members will conduct a study session May 9 to consider public testimony 
and letters written to the district about the proposed boundary changes. A 
decision is expected sometime before June, officials said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; INTERIM SCHOOL CHIEF INTERESTED IN STAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The revolving door that seems to be affixed to the superintendent's office in 
the Orange Unified School District may yet sweep interim head Marilyn Corey 
back into office. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey, who submitted her resignation Thursday night after clashing with board 
members in closed session, said in her first interview since then that she 
would consider staying on in the troubled district if board members request it. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey is the eighth superintendent to occupy the district's top administrative 
post since 1989. She submitted her resignation, effective May 1. The district 
has been without a permanent school superintendent for nearly two years and is 
in the midst of a search for a superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the sudden withdrawal last week of a highly touted candidate for 
superintendent, district officials now have no idea when a permanent 
superintendent might be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of fires to put out," board member James Fearns said. "Marilyn 
is a proven quantity. We know she can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey said in the interview on Tuesday that "if the board said it needed me, I 
would say I'd be happy to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Maureen Aschoff said she has already met with Corey about her 
status, and said Corey might be asked to stay on past May 1 until a permanent 
superintendent can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in conversation with Ms. Corey," Aschoff said. "So nothing has 
been finalized yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Aschoff said she will encourage other board members to talk to Corey, and 
hopes Corey's status can be determined in a closed session hearing on April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey was appointed interim superintendent in July, coming here from a school 
district in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The imminent departure of Corey, who has been in office since July, would add 
to the district's many problems. The threat of a strike by 1,160 non-teaching 
employees hangs over the sprawling, 26,000-student system. The employees are 
working under a board-imposed contract that they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the district remains embroiled in costly disciplinary hearings in 
which three top school administrators are accused of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey described as the "last straw" sharp differences she had with board 
members Thursday night concerning paying the district's attorneys in the sexual 
harassment hearings. The board delayed her request that the attorney's current 
bill be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, a heavy workload, continuing frustration with some 
board members and an apparent successor waiting in the wings had already 
prompted her to prepare her resignation before Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you sustain a workload of 12 to 20 hours a day in an often stressful, 
often negative atmosphere, it's a real personal sacrifice," Corey said. "I just 
came to the conclusion that I wasting my time and the board's." 
</P>
<P>
 If Corey stays, she said she will need "clear direction" from the school 
board, but she will understand if she is not asked to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the job as an interim, that means a substitute. You know you're not 
going to be around forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had the distinct pleasure of having around me a team of professionals 
that I could trust and who bought into the concept of teamwork," she added. "We 
were pulling the same wagon, and we were getting the job done."MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; HOST FAMILIES SOUGHT FOR 2 THAI VISITORS

 Emergency cancellations have forced a student exchange program to scramble to 
find temporary homes in South County for two visiting students from Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are among 17 youths visiting the Southland for three 
weeks.International Education Forum organizers had homes lined up for all of 
the students until two host families were forced to cancel their participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiting host families for the 17 participants has been difficult," said 
Lila Brumback, the forum's Orange County representative. "That fact, plus a 
couple of emergency cancellations, has me still looking this late for two more 
host families for two girls" in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 During their stay, the group will, among other things, tour major 
entertainment attractions and examine high-tech education programs at Aliso 
Viejo Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of the Thai program, we have scheduled a visit to this new and 
beautifully equipped school," Brumback said. She added that language 
instructors at the school will lead groups of Aliso Viejo children on a tour of 
Europe next year, where they will stay with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I came (to the United States) as an exchange student myself many 
years ago," Brumback said, "it is still overwhelming at times to see how 
interested youngsters from all over the world are to come here and learn 
firsthand about our ways and make American friends."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ORDINANCE FURTHER RESTRICTS SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a restrictive anti-smoking ordinance that 
prohibits smoking at most places of employment and permits cigarette vending 
machines only in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants with a capacity of 50 or more people must set aside 75% of their 
floor space for no-smoking sections, according to the ordinance.Smoking would 
be permitted in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the measure on Monday, and it will go into 
effect in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy. The council has, I think, served the city well," said 
anti-smoking activist Jim Walker, adding that the decision is especially 
important for the city's children, because the average smoker begins smoking at 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 adults and schoolchildren attended the meeting to support the 
ordinance. While no smokers or business owners spoke against the ordinance at 
the meeting, a few critics suggested that the council reject the ban because it 
did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, city statutes banned smoking only in public buildings. The new 
ordinance bans smoking in all public areas of private buildings, such as 
elevators, meeting rooms, lobbies, waiting rooms and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, smoking is prohibited in all enclosed areas within all places of 
employment, including common work areas, classrooms, auditoriums, private 
offices, cafeterias and restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to bars, smoking is still permissible in hotel and motel guest 
rooms, at businesses devoted to tobacco sales, at private parties and in 
private residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Several restaurant and hotel managers reached Tuesday said the ordinance would 
have little or no effect on their businesses.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ALTERNATE PLAN FOR SCHOOL TO BE AIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of Santa Ana Unified School District tonight are expected to hear a 
potentially less expensive alternative to building its controversial 
"space-saver school" at the rear of the Bristol Market Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial developer Jim Righeimer said he will propose to the Board of 
Education during a special meeting that the school be built at a different 
site, possibly saving the district as much as $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the district approved a plan to build an 11-acre space-saver 
school at the rear of Bristol Market Place, at Bristol and 17th streets. The 
district is prepared to spend as much as $22 million to purchase that property. 
</P>
<P>
 Space-saver schools are built vertically, with several stories, instead of 
taking up large areas with single-story buildings. The idea, officials said, is 
to add schools without condemning private property in dense cities with little 
room for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Righeimer's proposal, the district could purchase a site at 2828 N. 
Bristol St. for $6.9 million and build the school there. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which contains a defunct 180-unit apartment complex, is not 
located within the school district's boundaries. It is a few hundred feet 
within the Orange Unified School District's area, Righeimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Righeimer, who stands to earn a commission from the owner of the property if 
the proposal is approved, downplayed potential problems with the site as 
"non-issues," and emphasized the proposal's potential savings to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 5:30 p.m. in the boardroom of the Administration 
Building, 1405 N. French St. JON NALICK

EX-WIFE LAYS CLAIM TO PROCEEDS OF SEQUEL TO BESTSELLER; ENTITLEMENT: LAGUNA 
BEACH AUTHOR CONTENDS THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN AFTER THEIR DIVORCE IN 1977 AND 
BELONGS TO HIM ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gweneth Goodwin Taylor and Laguna Beach author Theodore L. Taylor divorced 17 
years ago, but they are still fighting over what might be community property -- 
in this case, not china or silver but a book Theodore Taylor published just 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Taylor is author of "The Cay," the 1969 acclaimed young adult novel 
that has sold nearly 3 million copies worldwide. Last year, he published a 
sequel called "Timothy of the Cay." 
</P>
<P>
 Gweneth Goodwin Taylor alleges that the new book, which was promoted with a 
three-month, 40-city book tour, is based on the original mega-seller, thereby 
entitling her to a share of the proceeds. The author contends that because the 
new book was written after the divorce, it belongs to him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When Theodore Taylor, 73, and Gweneth Taylor, 70, were divorced in 1977, they 
agreed to share proceeds and royalties from any works Taylor completed before 
the breakup, including "The Cay," said attorneys for both Taylors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cay" tells the story of a bigoted white boy named Philip who sheds his 
prejudices after being shipwrecked on a deserted island with a black sailor 
named Timothy. It is by far Taylor's most lucrative book, and is still required 
reading in junior high schools around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was made into a television movie in 1973 starring James Earl Jones as 
Timothy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the later book, "Timothy of the Cay," uses a character from "The Cay," 
it is considered a "derivative product" under federal copyright laws, contends 
Gweneth Taylor's attorney, Rodney C. Miles of Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Gweneth Taylor was given half-ownership rights to "The Cay" in the 1977 
divorce, "she is entitled to part of the proceeds from any derivative work," 
Miles contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said he did not know how much money Theodore Taylor has made from the 
new book. Publishers Weekly reported last year that Taylor's deal for the 
paperback rights to "Timothy of the Cay" was in the mid-six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Theodore Taylor's attorney contends copyright laws do not apply to this 
case. Gweneth Taylor is entitled to nothing from the sequel because "Timothy of 
the Cay" was written after the marriage had ended, he said. "The new book is a 
work of art that Mr. Taylor created and prepared long after they separated," 
said Alan I. White of Costa Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 "The divorce judgment provides that anything Mr. Taylor produces or prepares 
after the divorce is his separate property," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 From his Laguna Beach home, Theodore Taylor said, " 'Timothy of the Cay' is a 
new book. She has nothing to with the writing of it, the characters or the 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Gweneth Taylor could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, a family court judge will hear evidence on the issue. 
Attorneys for both parties said they would go to trial if the issue cannot be 
solved with the help of a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Western State University law professor Sherman Winnick, the 
"derivative work" clause within copyright laws applies when a new book uses

REPEAT MOLESTER JAILED UPON PAROLE; CRIME: BUENA PARK MAN WITH LONG HISTORY OF 
CHILD SEX ABUSE FAILS PSYCHIATRIC EXAM IMMEDIATELY AFTER RELEASE. HE ALLEGEDLY 
BOASTED OF VIOLATING MORE THAN 150 CHILDREN.

<P>
 A Buena Park man with a long history of convictions for child molestation was 
released on parole early Tuesday, then immediately imprisoned again after he 
failed a psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Keith Donelson, 48, who was sentenced in 1988 to 11 years in jail for 
sexually abusing a 4-year-old boy, has boasted to other prison inmates of 
molesting more than 150 children, said California Department of Corrections 
spokesman Bill Gengler. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelson was scheduled for release in Orange County on Tuesday, but a state 
psychiatrist who examined him immediately after his release "felt that Donelson 
was not suitable to be returned to his community and should go back to prison 
for further psychiatric evaluation," said Tip Kindel, assistant director for 
the Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the psychiatrist's examination, Donelson "suffers from a mental 
disorder that requires further institutional treatment not available in the 
community," according to a statement issued by the Department of Corrections. 
The law allows the state to send such a parolee back to prison if he is deemed 
a threat to the community, Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelson, who had spent the past six years in the California Rehabilitation 
Center in Norco, was sent to the state Institution for Men in Chino. A hearing 
will be conducted by the Corrections Department's Parole Hearing Division 
within 30 days to determine whether Donelson should have his parole revoked and 
be returned to prison, Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindel said earlier news reports that Donelson would be released in Anaheim on 
Tuesday were "erroneous." He said the original plan called for Donelson's 
release in another Orange County city, which he declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Police Department in that community had been informed in 
advance and Donelson would have been under parole supervision. Donelson would 
have worn an electronic monitoring device, been subject to a curfew, undergone 
therapy and been prohibited from contact with anyone younger than 18 without 
written permission from a parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim city officials, who were alarmed by Tuesday's news reports, said they 
were relieved to hear that Donelson remained in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, the state is following its own procedures and is being extra 
cautious about releasing this person," said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly. "Clearly, 
(his release) would not have been of any benefit to the community based on his 
past record. In this case, at least as of today, it appears that the system is 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 Donelson, who has been convicted of child molestation charges four times since 
1966, was on parole in 1988 after serving six years of an 11-year, eight-month 
sentence for child molestation and oral copulation with children when he 
pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a Buena Park boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Margaret Anderson sentenced Donelson to 11 
years in prison. At the time, Gengler said, Donelson was in custody for 
violating his parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Gengler said Donelson seems a prime candidate for the "three strikes" law 
recently passed by the state Legislature that makes anyone convicted of three 
serious or violent felonies eligible for life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has Donelson indicated that "he . . . will molest again" if set free, 
said Gengler, but he has "stated or boasted he molested more than 150 children 
over the years, and as far as I know, he was not apologizing for (his deeds)." 
</P>
<P>
 Gengler said that if Donelson's parole is revoked, "we'll only be able to keep 
him one more year. That's the amount of time we can keep him (according to the 
law). We have no option but to release him when his term is up."

HOMELESS GROUP SERVED SECOND EVICTION; SHELTER: TRANSIENTS RECENTLY OUSTED FROM 
CAMP NEAR FREEWAY ARE ORDERED TO LEAVE AN ABANDONED FIRE STATION. 
</P>

<P>
 The trials of a group of homeless people evicted from an encampment beneath 
the San Diego Freeway last month continued Tuesday when city officials ordered 
them to vacate an abandoned fire station where they had taken up residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like everywhere you go, they are hounding you and pushing you," said 
Frank Murphy, 40, an unemployed apartment maintenance man. "No sooner do I get 
situated and, bam! I gotta move again." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was among the 20 or so transients who had been living in an elaborate 
encampment built among the thick bushes near the Beach Boulevard exit of the 
San Diego Freeway in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the California Department of Transportation razed the encampment, 
which had been dubbed "Club Homeless" by those who lived there. This climaxed 
weeks of legal maneuvers, during which residents of the encampment filed legal 
appeals to halt Caltrans' removal efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But about a dozen or so of the residents had already moved to the abandoned 
fire station in the 14000 block of Golden West Street, a few blocks from 
Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been invited to stay there by 32-year-old Chuck Ross, a Riverside 
resident who said he leases the building from its owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been helping them out by the freeway for a few years, hauling their 
trash and buying them tents," said Ross. "I almost ended up homeless myself 
once. You gotta help people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said he had hoped to make the 5,200-square-foot building a permanent 
homeless shelter. But an afternoon visit by a Westminster code enforcement 
officer effectively put an end to those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city code enforcement officials said they received complaints from 
neighbors about people coming and going from the building, which they said is 
uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a problem with people living in buildings that are not safe for 
occupancy," said Mike Bouvier, director of building and planning. "That 
building has been known to be in bad shape for awhile. It needs a lot of work 
before it's suitable for any occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although code enforcement officials ordered the group to vacate the property 
immediately, Westminster City Manager Robert H. Huntley said the homeless will 
be given some time to try to make other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not our intent to throw them out into the street," he said. "We are 
attempting to garner as many potential resources as we can and provide housing 
or shelter referrals. But, we will ultimately have to have them move out." 
</P>
<P>
 For many former "Club Homeless" residents, the old fire station had become a 
haven -- a place to take a shower, shave, receive mail and make telephone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who had spent Tuesday picking up job applications, said he was 
devastated by the news that the group would have to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting set up like a dorm, a place to settle down at," he said. "You 
don't have to worry about pulling your clothes out of the bushes when you go on 
a job interview."

GIONIS' ATTORNEY ASSAILS REHEARING ATTEMPT; COURTS: LAWYER SAYS THE STATE IS 
ATTACKING THE APPELLATE PANEL'S INTEGRITY. PROSECUTORS WANT THE SUPREME COURT 
TO REVIEW THE DISMISSAL OF CHARGES IN THE AISSA WAYNE ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State lawyers have tried to "smear" the local appellate court in their request 
for a new hearing in the case of Dr. Thomas Gionis, whose conviction on charges 
of plotting an attack on John Wayne's daughter was overturned on appeal, 
Gionis' attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 In dismissing the 1992 conviction earlier this year, the 4th District Court of 
Appeal in Santa Ana cited prosecutorial misconduct and found that an Orange 
County Superior Court jury heard improper evidence before finding Gionis guilty 
of hiring two henchmen to attack his estranged wife, Aissa Wayne, and her 
boyfriend, Roger Luby. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office last month asked the California Supreme 
Court to review the appellate court's decision. State prosecutors said the 
appellate court improperly recast facts to "achieve a desired result" and 
unfairly criticized former Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. 
Robinson for his handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a response filed Monday, defense attorney William J. Kopeny labeled the 
request for the high court's review a "scandalous" attack that accuses the 
appellate court of conspiring to act dishonestly and comes "perilously close" 
to contempt of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unquestionably, this petition for review goes beyond vigorous advocacy, and 
unabashedly "impugns the integrity" of the Court of Appeal," Kopeny wrote in a 
22-page response. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Atty. Gen. Rhonda Cartwright-Ladendorf said the request for review 
was proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strongly worded opinion that required a strong response to it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's highest court has 60 days to decide whether it will review the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court's 3-0 decision found that trial judge, Superior Court 
Judge Theodore E. Millard, improperly allowed jurors to hear incriminating 
testimony from a family law attorney who once represented Gionis -- a violation 
of attorney-client confidentiality, Kopeny said in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court also criticized Robinson for his "vitriolic rebuttal and 
personal attacks" on Gionis' trial attorney Bruce Cutler, known for his defense 
of New York mobster John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 The request should ultimately be denied, Kopeny argued in court records, 
because the appellate court's findings were accurate and his client did not get 
a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis' first trial ended in a mistrial. During a second trial, he was 
convicted of arranging the attack outside Luby's Newport Beach estate in the 
midst of a bitter custody battle over the estranged couple's young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne was tied up and thrown onto a garage floor and suffered head injuries. 
The two attackers pistol-whipped Luby and slashed his Achilles' tendons before 
fleeing.

ATTORNEY TESTIFIES ABOUT '77 DOCUMENT IN PALIMONY TRIAL; LITIGATION: FIRED BY 
CLAIRE MAGLICA, HE STATES SHE WAS AWARE A DECADE AGO SHE DID NOT OWN ANY PART 
OF THE LUCRATIVE FLASHLIGHT EMPIRE SHE NOW SAYS IS HALF HERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney who once handled Anthony Maglica's wills testified Tuesday that 
Claire Maglica was well aware a decade ago that she did not own any part of the 
multimillion-dollar flashlight empire she now says is half hers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bernard P. Simons said that Claire Maglica talked to him in the early 
1980s about an agreement that the Anaheim Hills couple signed in 1977 vowing 
never to merge their assets, and told him that she had sought legal advice 
about the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony came as the defense presented its case to refute Claire 
Maglica's contention that she is entitled to half the $300-million flashlight 
business she says she helped Anthony Maglica build. 
</P>
<P>
 Simons, who was fired by Claire Maglica, contradicted a key portion of her 
testimony in the palimony case against her live-in lover of 23 years -- that 
she believed the 1977 document she signed after a romantic dinner said they 
would someday marry. 
</P>
<P>
 The document only reinforced her understanding of an oral agreement they made 
when they met to always share everything, says Claire Maglica, the 60-year-old 
executive vice president of Mag Instrument Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simons testified Tuesday that Claire Maglica told him more than a decade 
ago that she had sought legal advice about the 1977 agreement from Marvin M. 
Mitchelson, the attorney who won a landmark settlement for actor Lee Marvin's 
girlfriend, in the case that coined the term "palimony." 
</P>
<P>
 "Claire told me that she had met with Marvin Mitchelson and had taken him a 
copy of the separate property agreement, and Claire said he had told her it 
would not preclude her from suing Tony for a piece of Mag Instrument," Simons 
told an Orange County Superior Court jury Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in 1984 or 1985, Simons said, he discussed the agreement and Claire's 
visit to Mitchelson again in a dinner meeting with Claire, Anthony and Claire's 
daughter, where they also talked about Anthony's 1983 will and the fact that it 
granted Claire only one-fifth of Anthony's estate and gave nothing to Claire's 
children from her first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did Claire ever tell you that Tony had promised her a piece of the company?" 
Anthony Maglica's attorney, Dennis M. Wasser, asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite to the contrary," Simons said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to handling Anthony Maglica's wills and other matters related to 
his property, Simons said he also handled litigation for Mag Instrument until 
Claire Maglica fired him in 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, Claire's attorney, John W. Keker, sought to indicate 
that Simons was biased against Claire Maglica, because he denied repeatedly in 
his deposition and on the witness stand that he ever heard her referred to as 
Claire Maglica in his years of working closely with the couple, but knew her 
only as "Claire." Though they never married, Claire had taken Anthony Maglica's 
name and many people knew them as a married couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Keker also questioned other elements of Simons' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never met with Marvin Mitchelson, did she?" Keker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me she did," Simons countered. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Zecchini, corporate vice president of Mag, testified Tuesday that Claire 
Maglica was never an owner and had far fewer responsibilities than Anthony 
Maglica. He also said that several documents harmful to Claire's contention 
that she is part-owner of Mag disappeared from his office after she filed the 
palimony lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica's attorneys say that she played a strong role in the company, 
heading several departments and coming up with ideas to market the Mini Mag 
flashlights in many colors.  
</P>
<P>
 Zecchini testified that Anthony is the "key man" at Mag, working weekends and 
making major decisions. Zecchini also said that he supervises more people than 
Claire Maglica does.  
</P>
<P>
 "Does that make you an owner of the company?" Wasser asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "No," Zecchini replied.  
</P>
<P>
 Zecchini testified that Claire Maglica came into his office before the trial 
and told him she would change her image before she appeared in court.  
</P>
<P>
 "She said she would dress down and not wear any makeup," Zecchini said, "and 
that she would know how to play the part of the 'old lady.' "

SILO TO PAY PENALTY IN CREDIT CARD SETTLEMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the few cases of its kind, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi announced 
a $100,000 fine and settlement Tuesday in a lawsuit brought against Silo Inc. 
under a state consumer protection statute that covers credit card use. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in December, alleges that Silo Inc. and Silo California 
Inc., which sell consumer electronics, violated a state statute by asking 
customers to "provide their name, address and telephone number in writing as a 
condition (of) accepting a credit card as payment for goods or services," 
according to a statement from Capizzi's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Silo, without admitting liability, will pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and 
agreed to follow the terms of a statewide injunction prohibiting the company 
from requesting or requiring personal identification information in writing 
from its California credit card customers, the district attorney's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The state statute, effective since 1990, prohibits merchants from requiring 
customers to write their home addresses or telephone numbers on the front of 
credit card slips.

O.C. SOFTWARE FIRM ATTEMPTS DAMAGE CONTROL; SHAKE-UP: PLATINUM HIRES OUTSIDE 
LEGAL COUNSEL, BEGINS SEARCH FOR NEW EXECUTIVES AND TRIES TO REASSURE CUSTOMERS 
OF ITS VIABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Platinum Software Corp. fought for its life Tuesday after revealing a day 
earlier that its top four executives had resigned and that its financial 
statements for the past 15 months were flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's interim management team scrambled to begin the search for new 
executives and to persuade investors, employees, the news media and customers 
that Platinum, Orange County's largest software company, can survive on the 
strength of its accounting software technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating shareholder lawsuits -- the company's stock lost 64% of its value 
Monday -- the team also hired outside legal counsel and met with officials from 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Carmelo J. Santoro, a Platinum 
board member who took over Monday as acting chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum's stock rebounded slightly Tuesday to $4.125 a share, up 56.3 cents a 
share in Nasdaq trading. But stabilizing the stock price is only one of many 
challenges the company faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fine line to walk," Santoro said. "We have a viable company, and 
we have to convince our customers and employees of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers questioned the very survival of Platinum, which said it expects to 
revise its financial statements going back five quarters, could lose another 
$20 million in equity, and may be forced to lay off some of its 820 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tightrope," said Steve DeLuca, analyst for Cruttenden & Co., an 
investment bank in Irvine. "They have to keep key employees like the traveling 
sales force in order to keep their customers and revenues up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fast-changing high-tech world, anything that distracts a company from 
constantly upgrading its product can severely damage its prospects, said 
Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Softletter, a software industry newsletter based 
in Watertown, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a little behind technically is not fatal, but if Platinum is out of the 
running for a year or two, that's a problem," Tarter said. "The real concern 
for the company would be a loss of confidence in its resellers' market." 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting software usually is developed in stages, which makes the stability 
of its manufacturer critical to distributors. "Resellers don't want to leave 
clients with an orphan product line that cannot be expanded on," Tarter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers were struck by the irony of Platinum's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can an accounting software company have such a problem with accounting?" 
asked one former accounting executive. "Someone was asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Overaggressive accounting practices at Platinum were revealed in a routine 
internal investigation of a shareholder lawsuit alleging that the company had 
violated securities laws, including overstating its revenue by booking software 
license sales before they actually closed, Santoro said. He said he anticipates 
an SEC investigation as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Bowers, a spokesman for the SEC, would not comment Tuesday on whether 
the agency is investigating Platinum or plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders, however, will likely file lawsuits seeking to recover the money 
lost in Monday's stock plunge, the company and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to assume there are a lot of angry shareholders out there, judging by 
the calls we are getting," Platinum spokesman David Downing said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has hired the Washington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering to 
handle its legal affairs. Platinum's corporate directors and officers have 
liability insurance to help pay legal costs, Santoro said. But insurers often 
refuse to pay if the company is found to have defrauded investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest potential blow to financial stability, though, would be if 
customers stop buying Platinum's software. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously our software customers are concerned because each software sale 
creates a relationship, and they're concerned about the viability of the 
company," Downing said. "As far as we can tell, we haven't had cancellations 
and don't appear to be losing customers right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Riegelsberger, who gave up his title as executive vice president Monday 
but is staying on as an employee, said, "It's going to be a long-term process 
with the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring that customer confidence is crucial if Platinum is to survive, said 
David Samuels, former chief executive of State of the Art Inc., an Irvine-based 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put yourself in the shoes of a corporate information systems officer," 
Samuels asked, "would you take a gamble with Platinum?"

SUITS AGAINST 3RD PARTIES HALTED; LAW: THE SUPREME COURT RULING WILL MAKE IT 
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR INVESTORS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED IN STOCK SCHEMES TO 
RECOVER SIGNIFICANT SUMS OF MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court, overturning nearly a half-century of legal precedents, 
ruled Tuesday that defrauded investors may not sue lawyers, accountants, 
bankers and other third parties who "aided and abetted" a stock scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-4 decision reinterprets the landmark Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to 
limit liability to those who directly perpetrated a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise decision, unless reversed by Congress, will make it virtually 
impossible in many instances for defrauded investors to recover significant 
sums of money when they have been cheated by a deceptive investment scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the crooked promoter of the investment is penniless, having spent 
or squandered the funds gained through fraud. For example, California investors 
won a $1.5-billion judgment against former savings and loan mogul Charles H. 
Keating Jr., but it was uncollectible because he had no money left. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial recoveries have usually been obtained by lawsuits against others 
who have deep pockets, most often lawyers and accountants hired by the 
perpetrator of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very dark day. It means untold thousands of investors in cases 
around the country will lose their day in court," said Joseph W. Cotchett Jr., 
a Burlingame lawyer who was the lead counsel for a class-action suit on behalf 
of 23,000 California investors who purchased the bonds fraudulently sold by 
Keating's American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will not affect settlements already concluded, lawyers said. That 
will be good news for investors in Keating's company, which owned Lincoln 
Savings & Loan in Irvine, the nation's costliest failure. Both the company and 
the thrift collapsed five years ago under the weight of bad investments and 
outright fraud, for which Keating was sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors received $260 million in settlements from lawyers, accountants, 
appraisers and others who worked as advisers to Keating. So far, investors have 
received nearly 50 cents on the dollar and will be getting about 10.5 cents on 
the dollar more within three weeks, said Leonard B. Simon, one of their 
lawyers. He said a final payment amounting to about 5 cents on the dollar will 
likely be paid late this year or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those settlements are not affected by Tuesday's decision, the Supreme 
Court ruling would make it almost impossible to effectively pursue future cases 
in federal court, Cotchett said. Neither plaintiffs' nor defense lawyers 
believe that the decision will end most pending litigation, though it will 
likely cause numerous cases on appeal to be sent back to lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers will have to sort out case-by-case whether professionals participated 
in frauds and are still liable or whether they will be dropped from pending 
suits because they were so-called secondary wrongdoers as aiders and abettors 
under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in two years that the high court has moved to shield 
accountants, lawyers and investment bankers from damage verdicts in cases of 
massive fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, on a 7-2 vote, the high court said defrauded investors cannot bring 
a civil anti-racketeering suit against outside advisers on the theory that the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, known as RICO, applies only 
to people who are involved in the "operation or management" of a fraudulent 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most securities fraud claims are filed under the Securities Exchange 
Act. In the wake of the stock market crash of 1929, Congress made it unlawful 
"for any person, directly or indirectly . . . to use or employ, in connection 
with the purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive 
device," such as a misleading stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Private investors were given the right to sue to seek monetary recoveries. 
Without further guidance from Congress, securities law has been developed 
almost entirely in the lower federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In decisions dating from the mid-1940s, judges have upheld private lawsuits 
against not only the principal parties in a failed investment scheme, but also 
those who aided and abetted the schemes. For example, an accountant who 
endorsed a misleading prospectus or an appraiser who put a phony value on 
property could be sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, judges said it was important to demand that all those who knowingly 
participated in a fraudulent scheme join in paying damages to those who were 
cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 This wide-net approach to securities law gained public attention in the late 
1980s when hundreds of lawsuits were filed against lawyers, accountants and 
bankers after the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry. Plaintiffs said 
these white-collar professionals played key roles in the failure of the 
institutions and should pay for the losses they caused. 
</P>
<P>
 But the leaders of accounting and law firms decried this "explosion" of 
litigation. They said they should not be handed a "virtually limitless 
liability" simply because they have "deep pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, their complaints found a sympathetic ear at the high court. Last 
year, after squelching the civil RICO suits against accountants and lawyers, 
the justices agreed to hear an obscure case involving $15 million in housing 
bonds sold by a Denver bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rule on the issue raised in the appeal, the justices said they 
wanted to consider whether the 1934 law creates "an implied private right to 
action for aiding and abetting violations," as everyone had assumed for 
decades. The answer Tuesday was "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it covers only those who engage in 
manipulation or deception, not those who "aid" or "abet" their efforts. Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia 
and Clarence Thomas joined the opinion in Central Bank of Denver vs. First 
Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens faulted the majority for conservative 
"activism" by first rewriting an appeal and then using it to overturn decades 
of settled law. "We should leave it to Congress to alter" the law if 
legislators disagree with the prevailing legal standard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Tuesday's decision was welcomed by the securities industry 
and the accounting profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors "will have their day in court, but they will have to sue wrongdoers, 
not simply people who have insurers, or a large bank account," said Theodore B. 
Olson, who represents the Securities Industry Assn. "Many times the accountants 
or underwriters are named in the suits when they really did not engage in the 
practice. But they are listed simply because they are the deep pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants applauded the ruling as 
"important progress in curbing abuses of the federal securities laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who represent defrauded investors say they will be able to seek 
damages from accountants and lawyers only if they can show they played a 
principal role in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, they are the primary violators. But this is a major change in 
the law. It adds a real hurdle," said Jonathan Cuneo, general counsel for the 
National Assn. of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates the need for Congress to strengthen the law to protect 
investors," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others noted that state courts have also been moving to limit the 
liability for third parties in failed investment schemes. Plaintiffs' lawyers, 
knowing the issue had been on appeal, have been alleging other wrongdoing by 
professionals as a way to get around a possible ruling like the one the court 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Cohelan, a San Diego lawyer who filed a class action suit against Hill 
Williams Corp. on behalf of the home builder's 5,000 investors, said the 
lawsuit will not be directly affected by the Supreme Court's decision. The suit 
does not allege that professionals aided and abetted a fraud, he said. Instead, 
it relies on state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the ruling could have an indirect effect, Cohelan said. "Supreme 
Court decisions have a persuasive influence on state judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill Williams collapsed last year after collecting $90 million from the 
public, allegedly to build houses. Only about 50 homes actually were 
constructed by the Anaheim Hills developer during the three years that it 
raised money, mostly from elderly investors.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; NON-JAPANESE ASIAN INVESTORS ENTERING THE HOUSING 
MARKET 
</P>

 After being badly burned in the real estate downturn, many Japanese investors 
are pulling out of the U.S. real estate market. But in Orange County, at least, 
other Asian investors are entering the market, investing mostly in housing 
projects, according to Mike Meyer, managing partner of the Newport Beach office 
of Kenneth Leventhal & Co., the accounting firm.In 1990, Japanese companies had 
invested about $656 million in Orange County. There were no new investments in 
1992, however, and nothing last year either. 
</P>
<P>
 But now investors from Taiwan, South Korea and other parts of Asia are showing 
up. A wealthy Hong Kong investor is actively purchasing residential housing 
lots in the county, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have met with some of these other Asian investors, and they are seeking 
mainly joint venture opportunities in residential projects in Orange County and 
the Inland Empire," Meyer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County will see more non-Japanese Asian real estate investors, he said. 
They "are anxious to purchase residential lots at the bottom of the cycle and 
watch the value increase as the local housing market improves." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Leventhal released a study this week showing that the Japanese are 
trying to sell or lower their debt in U.S. real estate.

MANUFACTURERS ON THE UPSWING; ECONOMY: EMPLOYMENT, OUTPUT HAVE RISEN, CHAPMAN 
UNIVERSITY SURVEY SHOWS. RESULTS BACK REPORTS THAT COUNTY HAS BEGUN SLOW 
RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County manufacturers started the year on the upswing with employment, 
new orders and production all rising in the first quarter from the previous 
three months, a new report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers' business improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, according 
to the Orange County Purchasing Managers Survey released Monday by Chapman 
University's economic research center. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which included 81 companies, supports economists' reports that 
Orange County has begun a slow recovery from nearly three years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Total manufacturing output increased in the first quarter," said Chapman 
economist Raymond Sfeir. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that stockpiles of raw materials had increased for the 
first time in two years and that deliveries of raw materials by suppliers had 
slowed down. Slower deliveries show that business is picking up: A factory's 
suppliers tend to deliver rapidly when they don't have many orders and to slow 
down as increasing volume ties up their delivery fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Sfeir uses five such factors to develop a purchasing managers index -- 
a measurement of growth and of confidence in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first quarter, the purchasing index stood at 56.5 -- the 
second-highest level in more than five years after a reading of 62 in the 
fourth quarter of 1993. Levels of 50 and above show degrees of growth, while 
levels below 50 indicate constriction. The previous high levels were recorded 
in the first three quarters of 1988 -- the year Sfeir began reporting the 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 The economist modeled the Orange County survey on a nationwide purchasing 
survey conducted by the National Assn. of Production Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing managers are interviewed because they are manufacturing's 
front-line troops. Their jobs require them to be able to forecast economic 
conditions so they can buy sufficient material to produce the goods needed to 
satisfy customer demands without making the expensive mistake of over-ordering. 
Gains in Manufacturing

 Orange County's manufacturing industries reported moderate growth in the first 
quarter compared to the same period a year earlier.*

SENSORMEDICS IS SUED BY COMPETITOR; LITIGATION: MAKER OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC 
SYSTEMS DENIES STEALING PRODUCT DESIGNS, SELLING DEVICES WITHOUT U.S. APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Minnesota medical-device maker said Tuesday it has filed a lawsuit against 
SensorMedics Corp., alleging that the Yorba Linda maker of medical diagnostic 
systems stole product designs and sold devices without proper federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota, Medical Graphics Corp. 
of St. Paul said privately held SensorMedics is in violation of a patent that 
Medical Graphics holds on a device that analyzes oxygen in the breath of 
patients suffering from heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that SensorMedics marketed and sold the device from 
November, 1990, to June, 1992, even though it knew that it had not received 
permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 SensorMedics strongly denied the allegations, saying that the lawsuit came as 
a shock to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the complaint is totally without merit and intend to vigorously 
defend ourselves," said Chief Executive George D. Homes, adding that he knew of 
no incident that might have triggered the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 SensorMedics and Medical Graphics have been strong competitors for the past 10 
years, selling nearly identical products to the medical industry both in the 
United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes said he has met with executives of the rival firm at trade shows and 
never suspected that a disagreement might arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say, I am totally surprised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit centers on a device that measures so-called "breath-by-breath" 
evaluations of patients. Such analyses measure how strong a patient's breathing 
is, how much oxygen is being absorbed into the bloodstream and how much carbon 
dioxide is being exhaled. Such systems cost about $30,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies make such a measuring device. In its lawsuit, however, Medical 
Graphics argues that it invented the process first and carries the patent on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Graphics also alleges that its business was unfairly hampered because 
SensorMedics, which is larger and sells more of the machines, was selling 
without proper federal authority. 
</P>
<P>
 It also alleges that SensorMedics interfered with contracts between Medical 
Graphics and customers, distributed a letter to potential customers that 
dissuaded them from doing business with the smaller firm, and unfairly slashed 
prices "to prevent Medical Graphics from obtaining a sale," according to the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Graphics spokeswoman Tana DeBoer said her firm stands by its 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our position that Medical Graphics has a strong case," she said.

DEL MAR AVIONICS TAKES NEW DIRECTION; TECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY, ROOTED IN 
MILITARY CONTRACTING, TURNS TO MANUFACTURING COMPACT DISKS AS DEFENSE INDUSTRY 
SLUMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Del Mar has experienced a lifetime of change. An aviation pioneer -- he 
co-invented the pressurized airplane cabin -- this Orange County inventor is 
credited with dozens of technological innovations. And at 81, Del Mar said, he 
is ready to undergo another conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense and medical equipment company that bears his name, Del Mar 
Avionics, is again shifting focus away from its military-contracting roots -- 
this time to profit from the fast-moving compact disk manufacturing industry. 
It's like turning swords into plowshares with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're like a polar bear on a floating iceberg and it's melting, you 
jump to another iceberg," said Del Mar. "We move our technology to where the 
market is." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Avionics was on its way toward becoming yet another victim of the 
defense downturn. But its chairman and founder decided to join the revolution 
of multimedia -- the use of text, video, sound and graphics to create dazzling 
animation and movie-like effects on personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 By modifying the technology it uses for the medical monitors it makes, the 
company has devised a cheaper way to create compact disk masters, which are 
used as templates to mass-produce thousands of copies of compact disks for 
audio and computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 With a name to rival that of any weapons program, Del Mar Avionics' Fire Trac 
master system is the company's latest shot at diversification. It uses a laser, 
or "fire," to burn soundtracks onto CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a market for Fire Trac -- nearly 100 million software CDs were 
manufactured in 1993, based on estimates by the Optical Publishing Assn., a 
trade group based in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Avionics invested $1.5 million last year in its 30-person optical 
division and expects a sales boost in 1994. Since January, the company has sold 
five Fire Trac systems, which generate about $500,000 from each customer. This 
is about a quarter of the $2 million that record companies spend for 
conventional mastering equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for success isn't necessarily over, though. Defense companies often 
fail when seeking commercial applications for their products. The usual 
culprit, says Santa Ana defense conversion consultant M.L. (Bud) Warrick, is 
failure to master the skills of marketing to a variety of customers rather than 
just one -- the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys think they know what they're doing," Warrick said. "Sometimes 
they have luck if they go into a specialized market where there is a limited 
number of customers and distribution isn't as difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an adjustment to move into the entertainment world," Del Mar admits. "We 
went to one trade show dressed in suits and a lot of people there were showing 
a lot of bare skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were a lot different when Del Mar began working in 1937 for Douglas 
Aircraft Co., where he and other Douglas scientists designed the pressurized 
cabin. Using money he got from royalties on his inventions, he started his own 
company, Del Mar Engineering Laboratories, in 1952, making training systems for 
aircraft weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, the company -- by then renamed Del Mar Avionics -- moved to a 10-acre 
site in Orange County that was surrounded by orchards and places where Del Mar 
could go duck hunting. These days, the location is part of Irvine's industrial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk through Del Mar Avionics' lobby, which includes a museum of products 
from the company's past, reveals Del Mar's history of iceberg-hopping. In one 
area are weapons-training systems that look like big bombs, and a bright 
orange, helicopter-size freight carrier that was never delivered.  
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a chance to expand into the medical business, the company more than 30 
years ago started making magnetic tape recorders that monitor the vital signs 
of hospital patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s those monitors were housed in 50-pound boxes. Today the same 
functions are performed by a hand-held device. A stair-climbing exercise 
machine that was supposed to ride aboard the space shuttle is now gathering 
dust. The machine broke down before its scheduled trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Avionics peaked in the early years of the Reagan Administration's 
military buildup. It employed 600 people and had revenue of $35 million in 
1982. The numbers were down to about 200 employees and revenue of $20 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Military contracts were a declining part of Del Mar's sales in the last 
decade. The company lost a contract for making weapons-range instruments, which 
tell pilots whether they hit dummy targets. It shed some workers and shifted 
other workers to new divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 About six years ago, the company decided to invest in optical storage, a 
system that uses lasers to record information on spinning disks similar to but 
larger than the CDs used in the home. Optical methods could store more 
information than magnetic tape and so were a natural choice for the hospital 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Using optical technology combines research in chemistry, physics, optics, 
electronics, software and high-tech manufacturing. That doesn't come cheap, 
said David Johnson, vice president and general manager of the company's laser 
optics division. Over the last 10 years, the company has invested more than $30 
million in research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Fire Trac system uses a laser to embed data -- which later becomes music, 
moving picture or text -- on a light-sensitive disk in patterns that can be 
interpreted as the 1s and 0s of computerese. Once recorded, the disk is encased 
in metal and processed to function as a "stamper," or mold for disk 
replication. 
</P>
<P>
 The patented Del Mar system helps smaller publishers and manufacturers of CDs 
stay competitive with and less dependent on a limited number of mastering 
companies, such as Sony Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Taylor, a manager at Better Quality Cassettes Inc. in Council Bluffs, 
Iowa, said Fire Trac allowed his company to cut its costs of producing master 
CDs by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrick, the defense consultant, said Del Mar will have to be ready to deal 
with a competitive backlash -- including price cuts by Sony and other players 
in the mastering market -- as part of the daily routine of commercial sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't just be a one-trick pony and come up with only one product," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With new sales from Fire Trac and some luck, Del Mar Avionics expects 1994 
sales to hit $30 million and employment to grow to 240 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're envisioning this as our major growth for the year," Johnson said.

 Lobbyists Unite: A pair of real estate trade groups -- Institute of Real 
Estate Management and the Commercial Industrial Development Assn. -- have 
united to create Orange County's largest real estate lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Institute of Real Estate Management, representing 500 property 
managers, and Commercial Industrial Development Assn., with 200 members, hope 
their combined strength will give them more clout in addressing the local real 
estate market's key legislative and political concerns. Issues include 
streamlining the permits process; air and water quality; regional government 
cooperation; commercial use of the soon-to-be vacated El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, and the planned Disneyland expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to focus on local issues impacting commercial real estate," said 
Irvine property manager John Combs, president of the institute in Orange 
County. "You're going to see us out there on these local issues. Between their 
membership size and ours, we will be much more influential together. You talk 
about letter-writing campaigns!"

IRVINE SPECTRUM ICE RINK COMPLEX RUNS INTO TROUBLE; RECREATION: IRVINE CO. 
OFFICIAL SAYS THE $10-MILLION PROJECT IS OUT OF ESCROW BECAUSE OF FINANCING 
DELAYS, BUT ITS DEVELOPER SAYS NEW FINANCING HAS BEEN FOUND.

 A $10-million ice rink complex scheduled to open this spring in the Irvine 
Spectrum is on hold, a top executive with the Irvine Co. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fallen out of escrow," said Robert E. Williams, president of commercial 
property at the company, which owns the Spectrum. "There have been some 
financing delays on the part of the buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Burns(, chief executive officer of Irvine-based World Ice Inc., unveiled 
plans last year to buy 4.8 acres from the Irvine Co. to build a two-rink 
skating complex that would be Orange County's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at Alton Parkway and Ada Drive, World Ice and Sport Center would be 
84,000 square feet housing the two rinks, a restaurant and a bar overlooking 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 World Ice received a conditional use permit for the project from the city of 
Irvine in October, but the company still has not paid all the necessary permit 
fees, which total about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our understanding that they were unable to retain financing," said 
Sheri Vander Dussen, manager of planning and development for the city. "We are 
attempting to recover the costs of the fees they have not paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Tuesday, however, that he recently received financing from a 
private company that he would not identify. The rink will be under construction 
in 60 days, he said, and will open in December.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've just had a bunch of delays, a whole magnitude of delays," Burns said. 
He would not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has been planning for the past 18 years on an ice skating rink 
for its retail center in the Spectrum, but has not been able to complete a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the company has been approached by "other operators interested 
in doing a skating rink down there." But if Burns is prepared to move forward, 
he said, "we are prepared also."

BRITISH COLA BOASTS 'ORIGINAL AMERICAN TASTE,' BUT IS IT REAL THING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain's biggest supermarket chain this week took on Coca-Cola Co., the 
world's most famous trademark, by launching its own brand of soft drink in what 
the country's media have dubbed a cola war. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Sainsbury unveiled the look-alike Classic Cola in its 341 stores nationwide 
alongside familiar Coca-Cola cans from the U.S. soft-drinks giant. Sainsbury's 
brand boasts of "original American taste." 
</P>
<P>
 The cola rivalry came as some of the world's top-brand owners pressed for an 
additional clause in a Trade Marks Bill being debated by the British Parliament 
to ban retailers from marketing look-alike, own-label products. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and consumer product giants such as Swiss-based Nestle and America's 
Procter & Gamble say they invest heavily in advertising to establish their 
branded goods only to see own-label copycat products packaged in a similar way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sainsbury's cola is now out on the shelves in similar red-and-white packaging 
to Coca-Cola, threatening to dent Coca-Cola's leading 60% share of Britain's 
670-million-pound ($1-billion) cola market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it matches the leading brands," Sainsbury spokeswoman Louise Platt 
said. She disputed suggestions that her company's cola was designed to look 
like a counterfeit Coke, at a price of about 38 cents per can, contrasted with 
48 cents for Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lettering's different," Platt insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the white word Coke on the red can of Coca-Cola appears quite similar to 
the word Cola on the Sainsbury version, both in size and style. Both cans have 
pictures of bottles that look like old Coke bottles. The red-on-white cans of 
Diet Coke and Sainsbury's Diet Classic Cola also could be mixed up by someone 
who fails to look closely. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of Sainsbury turnover is now in own-label products, which are 
cheaper than main-brand alternatives. Importantly for Sainsbury, Britain's most 
profitable supermarket chain, its own brands have no hefty advertising budgets 
and are more profitable than major brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Coca-Cola is not taking the challenge lying down after it saw its share of the 
North American cola market come under heavy fire from own-label Canadian 
manufacturer Cott Corp., the group also behind the production of Sainsbury's 
Classic Cola.

 ROAD AFTER TRAGEDY: The 1993 slaying of 26-year-old Amy Biehl of Newport 
Beach, when a mob attacked her car in South Africa, sent her family there 
searching for answers. Joining their travels were cameras from ABC-TV's new 
"Turning Point." . . . The segment on Biehl, and strife in South Africa, airs 
tonight at 10, with Barbara Walters as anchor. One solemn statement during 
taping came from Amy's sister Molly: "I now know what it feels like to be hated 
sheerly because of race." 
</P>
<P>
 HARD TIMES? Don't think that hard rockin' is all they do at the Hard Rock 
Cafe. The Newport Beach night spot hosts at 9:30 a.m. today a town hall meeting 
on water preservation, open to the public. The nonprofit Water Education 
Foundation has organized water board people and conservationists to talk about 
local water plans. Says spokeswoman Rita Schmidt-Sudman: "With dry years ahead, 
water conservation is a way of life for Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 RIDING PAST: Maybe you've been around Orange County long enough to remember 
when trolleys like the 64-passenger Newport Beach Limited, built in 1913, were 
a major mode of transportation here. The trolleys finally died out in the 
1950s, but you can still ride the Newport Beach Limited. It's one of a dozen 
that will be in operation this weekend at the Rail Festival at the Orange 
Empire Railway Museum in Perris, near Riverside. Says Tustin engineer Sheldon 
Liss, a museum member: "For some, the festival will be a nostalgic trip to 
their past." 
</P>
<P>
 OAK STURDY: After wildfire burned some 4,000 acres of Caspers Wilderness Park 
in October, officials with the Chevron Cos. -- developer of nearby Coto de Caza 
-- asked if there was anything they could do to help. . . . Result: Chevron has 
donated 2,000 California live oak trees and a 500-gallon water trailer to keep 
the saplings wet. About 100 volunteers recently planted them. Says company 
spokeswoman Amy Greenawalt: "The trees will take a while to grow, but it will 
help."

 RATE RELIEF: The mercury may climb this summer, but water bills won't. The 
City Council voted to extend winter rates Tuesday in part because of angry 
Valley residents who reported bimonthly bills of $500 to $900 last summer (B1). 
. . . Under the two-tier rate structure imposed last year (above), customers 
using more than twice the median amount of water pay a higher fee per cubic 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 SEA OF DEBRIS: Drive the streets of the Valley and you'll see a familiar new 
landmark: earthquake rubble. The good news? Nearly 200,000 tons of debris has 
been hauled away so far. . . . The bad? Residents may be waiting a month or 
more for additional pickups (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 NO FEAR: The workplace looked a little different when employees of the 
Community Redevelopment Agency's North Hollywood office went back to work 
Tuesday. The bullet-resistant glass and security intercom system, for instance 
(B1). . . . Both were installed after project manager Lillian Burkenheim began 
receiving death threats -- like the hearse that showed up to claim her body one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTDOWN: It was a close race, but when all the dust settled, Santa Clarita 
Councilwoman Jill Klajic had lost her seat by a mere 16 votes. She now says 
she'll call for a recount if supporters can raise the $500 fee (B7). . . . 
She's skeptical. "I told them, 'You couldn't raise enough money for me to get 
elected; how are you going to raise enough for a recount?' " DWP Water Rates

 ANOTHER SHAKE: The Marmonte League has decided to give sportsmanship another 
chance. Reversing an earlier decision, high school principals from Camarillo to 
Thousand Oaks have lifted a ban on the traditional post-game handshake (A1). 
The schools sacked the symbol of fair play after it prompted a fistfight. But 
the no-handshake rule sparked an even greater commotion, gaining nationwide 
attention. Sports Illustrated cited the handshake ban as a sign that the 
apocalypse is nigh.

 FRONT-RUNNERS: The Field Poll shows state Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley 
and former Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks as the leading 
Republicans in two statewide races . . . . Wright has the support of 23% of 
Republicans for the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor. McClintock has 23% 
of GOP support for state controller. But 64% remain undecided in Wright's race 
and 59% in McClintock's. "When more than 50% of the voters haven't decided," 
says the poll's director, "it's really a tossup." 
</P>
<P>
 HOLY CHUTZPAH: The Simi Valley priest who beat two embezzlement charges is 
accusing the Catholic Archdiocese in Los Angeles of acting "immorally and 
unethically in actively supporting the criminal prosecution against me." (B1). 
. . Father David Dean Piroli said the church accused him of stealing money that 
it was not sure it was missing and suppressed evidence that would have helped 
his defense. Standing before TV cameras, he said: "No one, not even the Holy 
Father himself, should put himself or herself above the law." 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT A GEM: Jewel Pedi is stepping down from her position as executive 
director of Food Share, the hugely successful food bank in Oxnard. Jewel was 
there from the beginning in 1978, when a band of volunteers ran Food Share out 
of a two-car garage. Now, she directs the organization that feeds 127,000 
people a month through a wide network of relief agencies. Food Share's Dee Volz 
considers Pedi a CEO with a heart: "She has a strong combination of efficiency 
and caring."

MIKE DOWNEY: GARVEY IS MAGAZINE'S NEW MVP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every so often, someone will wonder if I happen to know, "What's Steve Garvey 
doing these days?" Particularly in springtime, when teams are training baseball 
players to be half the player Garvey was, inquiring minds will be curious as to 
what Garvey is up to, whether instead of running the bases he is running a 
business, or running for office, or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Garvey is the new publisher of Sport magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist Steve has been on the job at the L.A.-based magazine for a while 
now, ever since the January earthquake, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first day at work," he remembers. "I was supposed to start that 
morning, but the quake hit us around 4:30. Well, you know me, Mr. 
Never-Miss-a-Game. I get dressed and go to the office on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guard is standing there at the building saying, 'What the heck are you 
doing here?' He's looking at me like, 'We had a little earthquake around here 
this morning, buddy, in case you hadn't noticed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garvey was eager to get to work, same as always. He intends to be a hands-on 
publisher, not some figurehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sport is one of the most venerable monthlies in the magazine trade, one that 
in the past has known much success. But black ink or red, it was in need of 
some new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate executives got the idea of bringing in someone who would be an ideal 
crossover choice, someone who could exist comfortably in each of a sports 
magazine's worlds -- sports and magazines. Garvey was a natural. He was someone 
who could be as at ease inside a boardroom meeting with business leaders and 
advertisers as he generally has been with writers and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed to be the perfect idea at the perfect time," Garvey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Already he has taken an active role in a new design for the magazine, and will 
reshape some of its editorial content. He also is writing a publisher's column 
in each issue. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first issues he could address, were it not so self-serving, could 
be, "What's wrong with those Hall of Fame voters?" 
</P>
<P>
 I can only speak for myself when I say that Garvey has gotten one of my votes 
for baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown ever since he became eligible. So 
far, though, I have not been able to successfully push him over the top for the 
necessary number of votes, any more than I did Orlando Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who reviews Garvey's numbers would be hard pressed to explain why he 
isn't a Hall of Famer. His batting totals alone are noteworthy, but when you 
take into account his astounding fielding percentages at first base, his World 
Series and All-Star achievements and his consecutive-games streak, it is not 
easy to ascertain exactly where Garvey is lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, as they say, if getting there were easy, everybody would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if Garvey had ever weighed a comeback after his retirement, a la Jim 
Palmer. After all, he kept himself in pretty good shape. Probably could have 
padded his numbers a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "I did think about it after my injury healed. But the first team I 
contacted told me, 'We can't offer you a contract, but you could come down and 
try out.' And the next team I contacted told me, 'We can't offer you a 
contract, but you could come down and try out.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that was another example of the collusion among baseball executives. 
Every one would give exactly the same answer, in virtually the exact same 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Back when he was playing for the Dodgers and later for San Diego, there was no 
telling where Garvey's post-career interests might take him. He dabbled in 
broadcasting, ventured into various business areas and had often expressed a 
curiosity about politics. There was some much-publicized upheaval in his 
personal life, then a quiet time when he didn't make the news much. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he publishes it. Sport magazine used to sponsor the trophy presented to 
baseball's most valuable players. Now, the National League's most valuable 
player of 1974 is running Sport magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone over to the other side," Garvey says. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not really. The man can never be a true sports journalist. He works hard 
and dresses well.

IN LIKE A LION; METS' JEFF KENT IS ENJOYING AN EXPLOSIVE START TO THE 1994 
SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't only the predominant color of the New York Mets' uniform that prompts 
Manager Dallas Green to think of second baseman Jeff Kent as blue collar. It's 
his "nose-in-the-dirt, grind-it-out" approach, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager also colors Kent in shades of Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 "He treats every at-bat as if it's the seventh game of the World Series," 
Green said. "He can go three for four and come away mad at himself because of 
the hit he didn't get. If more guys had his determination and pride it would be 
a better industry for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it pride and determination born of a fear of failure, the hard-edged 
discipline he learned as the son of a Costa Mesa police lieutenant, Kent took 
root in the misery of the Mets' 103 defeats last season and has blossomed 
spectacularly. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrives at Dodger Stadium tonight with a .423 batting average. He leads the 
major leagues with 22 runs batted in and is tied for the major league lead with 
eight home runs. In 88 games since July 4, he has batted .324 with 23 home runs 
and 75 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1994 pace projects to 99 homers and 274 RBIs. Those, of course, are 
fantasy league numbers, even with an allegedly juiced baseball, and beyond the 
reach of Clark Kent, let alone Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 A more realistic possibility is that he will break the major league record for 
April homers, 11, shared by Willie Stargell, Graig Nettles and Mike Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 He was last week's National League player of the week but said that has no 
relevance because he is interested only in where he and his team are at the 
finish. The spotlight, he said, doesn't interest him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not dumb," he said in San Diego the other night. "I know what I've done. 
But when I walk out of here tonight, I have to start thinking about tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 "The start is a positive for me in that it helps build confidence, but I don't 
take it seriously because I know how quickly the game can turn on you. I feel 
I'm going to continue to improve and get better, but I hope people don't expect 
me to play at an uncommon level because it's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 It already has, however. This is not simply a shower of April hits. The 
26-year-old graduate of Huntington Beach's Edison High has been performing at 
an uncommon level since last July, proving to those who said he belonged at 
third base that he can handle second and hit at the major league level. 
</P>
<P>
 And helping to prove, as well, that when the Mets traded pitcher David Cone 
and his salary demands as a prospective free agent to the Toronto Blue Jays in 
late August of 1992, they received two cornerstones -- Kent and center fielder 
Ryan Thompson -- for what figures to be a long rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 The talented Thompson has been slower to stand out than Kent, but after 
hitting 11 homers in 80 games of New York's disruptive 1993 season, he has 
three this season, with 12 RBIs and a .317 average. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 185-pound Kent spent three minor league seasons with the Toronto 
organization, then, without triple-A experience, started the 1992 season with 
the Blue Jays when Kelly Gruber was injured. He hit eight home runs and batted 
.240 in 65 games before the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had mixed emotions," he said of the deal. "On one hand I felt that I had 
helped put Toronto in position to win and my job wasn't over, but on the other, 
I knew I had the opportunity to play regularly with the Mets and I'm not sure 
that would have happened as quickly if I had stayed in Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent batted .239 over the final 37 games with New York in '92, then caught 
fire at mid-season last year, angered by a three-day benching in late June. He 
finished with a .270 average, 21 homers and 80 RBIs in his first major league 
season as a regular. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made 18 errors, high among National League second basemen, but his 
manager resisted media recommendations that Kent be moved back to third because 
of limited range and that Bobby Bonilla, now playing third, should be at first 
base, since occupied by David Segui. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people didn't think Jeff could hit in the big leagues or play second 
base, but I'm proud of where he is and the improvements he's made," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would tell you himself that he's not Roberto Alomar or Bill Mazeroski, but 
he turns the double play as well as anyone and he's still learning the 
position. I think he earned the chance last year to solidify himself there." 
</P>
<P>
 Green also thinks that Kent, with his potential of 30 or more homers a year, 
brings an added dimension to that position. Kent hopes he has changed positions 
for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like second base," he said. "I like turning the double play. I like the 
control you feel in the middle of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've told me that nothing is etched in stone, but I feel that second base 
is where I belong until somebody beats me out or the organization says I have 
to move. In that case, I'd just have to adjust and deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent has experience with adjusting. He quit the Edison team as a senior after 
three years as a starting shortstop when he clashed with then-coach Ron La 
Ruffa. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't drafted after high school and didn't attract wide college interest 
until he signed with California after a summer of Connie Mack League play. He 
was the sophomore shortstop on the Cal team that reached the College World 
Series but broke his wrist as a junior and wasn't drafted by Toronto until the 
21st round in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A demanding father taught him to drive through the roadblocks, to throw up his 
"focus wall" when he hears too much from too many people and reads too much of 
the same thing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for my upbringing, I wouldn't have the drive that got me here," 
he said. "I'm not sure I'll raise my kids the same way, but I thrive on the 
negative, the fear of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never want to embarrass myself or my team. I hate to lose, and I'm my own 
worst critic. I don't consider myself an All-Star or Hall of Fame guy, but I'll 
never settle for second best either. I mean, no one is harder on me than I am, 
and that translates to the fire I need to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus wall is vital for the player who lives on emotion and doesn't 
consider himself a people person. In fact, the Orange County beach boy has been 
driven to Texas by the overcrowding in his home state. He and wife Dana 
recently built a home in Austin, which Kent fell in love with while playing in 
an NCAA regional with Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be a cowboy when I was a kid," he said. "I'm not a cowboy 
yet, but I love the open space." 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-collar Kent would also seem to have found some space in the 
statistical neighborhood occupied by the major leagues' top hitters.

HARNESSING THE RAGE; MOORER WILL TRY TO DIRECT HIS INTENSITY TOWARD HOLYFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Moorer, whose moods often swing from bad to worse to "Get out of my 
face!"has shut his eyes. But his mind, as always, is alert -- wary, and 
suspicious of bad intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting, if necessary, to hit back, hard.  
</P>
<P>
 His trainer, Teddy Atlas, calls Moorer a reluctant dragon because, although he 
almost never launches the attack, once stirred, his rage is volcanic. 
</P>
<P>
 He has counter-punched his way through life, inside the ring where he is 
considered the hardest puncher since Mike Tyson, and out of it, with incidents 
involving police, bar patrons and trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 At 26, he has wandered into this situation -- with a real chance to emerge 
Friday as the first left-handed heavyweight champion in history -- trusting 
almost nobody, slamming back at everybody who attacks him, with a chip on his 
shoulder he displays with stubborn pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it time to attack now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you have to say, say it, " Moorer orders his questioner. "You don't 
have to beat around the bush and try and trick me. Whatever you're saying, I 
know what it is. You can't fool me." 
</P>
<P>
 Weary after seven weeks of training for Friday night's bout against 
heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and 
dreading hours of packing as camp breaks in Palm Springs, Moorer speaks in a 
low whisper, a grumble. 
</P>
<P>
 His body is tensed, and his responses are quick, often brutally frank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand what's going on and I'm not going to give in to society," Moorer 
says when asked if he cares that many consider him a bull-headed rogue. "I'm 
going to voice my opinion in whatever way I want to and I'm going to be the way 
I'm going to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "That bothers you? I'm not a tough guy. People want to put that label on. I'm 
not a tough guy, I'm just me. I'm a tough guy because I may say something or I 
may respond to something that they think is wrong? They don't know me. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . You probably think I'm a bad person. I'm myself. I'm not a bad guy, 
I'm just thinking I've got to pack, which I don't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he finishes, almost silently, winking, "I don't want you to get a bad 
impression of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, called an introvert by former trainer Lou Duva, is the man who, when 
one of Palm Springs' older residents complains about the X-rated lyrics of the 
rap song playing while he trains, shakes his head and eventually turns the 
music off. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Snoop Doggy Dog is turned back on, loud, Moorer tells the small 
crowd, "I'm sorry, but there's cuss words, so if you're offended, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
 Contradictory? Maybe. But for Michael Moorer, winner of all 34 of his fights, 
including 30 knockouts, heavyweight contender, soon-to-be-millionaire and proud 
father, nothing is more contradictory than all that surrounds him. 
</P>
<P>
 The sycophants. The parties. The false friends. The posing. The fight game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get the hell out of this game by the time I'm 28, 29," he has said 
earlier. In the midst of his Palm Springs ennui, he moves the retirement 
schedule up to minutes after he wins the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too psychological, too mental," he says. "There are a lot of fake people 
that are around you. People will be your friend, talk to you like they care 
about you, and behind your back talk stuff all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, society thinks that boxers are just dumb. They think they're limited to 
just boxing. I'm not one of them. I don't care. I can get out of this game and 
do something else." 
</P>
<P>
 This is also the man whose run-in with the Monessen, Pa., police cost him 
$250,000 to settle, but who says he wants to be involved in law enforcement 
when he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the man whose wife, Bobbie, from whom he has been separated for about 
a year, served him Monday with a $6-million civil suit regarding an incident 
six months ago in which she was removed from his Detroit apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike has a lot of sympathy, he likes to be a protector, you know, with law 
enforcement," says Henry Smith, Moorer's grandfather and the man who had a huge 
hand in raising the fighter. "He will help you. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you step on his corn, there's something inside of him. He is not going 
to take this. It would be a shame if all he's known for is his temper, but he's 
a good-hearted boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer grew up in Monessen without a father. He was reared by his mother, 
Paulette, and Smith, his grandfather, who took Moorer to the gym he ran when 
Moorer was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a natural puncher," Smith says. "I tried to ignore it at first, 
because he was family and I didn't want him fighting. His mother forced me to 
take him to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Get those gloves on, hit the bag,' and I went over to work with the 
experienced fighters. He went over there -- Bam! Bam-bam-bam! I turned my head, 
looked, and thought, 'The fool's going crazy.' I said, 'Go get that other pair 
of (lighter) gloves,' and he hit the bag so hard he knocks it down, falls off 
the racks." 
</P>
<P>
 As a promising 175-pound amateur, Moorer was taken to Detroit's Kronk Gym, an 
impressionable teen-ager who was swept up by Kronk founder Emanuel Steward's 
engaging personality and boxing knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved from light-heavyweight to heavyweight. Then he had a few 
disappointing performances and a near-disastrous knockdown by Bert Cooper, and 
Steward sold his share of Moorer's management contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emanuel and I were real close," Moorer says. "He was like a father to me. I 
didn't leave Emanuel. Emanuel left me. So I had to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he feel abandoned? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask the question that you want," Moorer snaps. "You're asking if Emanuel is 
fake, right? Emanuel's a fake person as far as trying to do something that he's 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to put on too much, and he can't handle it. The kind of lifestyle 
he has, he's putting up a lot of fronts." 
</P>
<P>
 His boxing career in chaos, Moorer's violent temper seemed to rage.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the 6-foot-2, 217-pound Moorer was involved in a brawl with Monessen 
police, one officer suffering a broken jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no problems with him whatsoever," says Alex Shearer, who worked with 
Moorer while Shearer was with Kronk. "But he's a guy growing up into manhood, 
starting to make large sums of money, starting to deal with outside pressures. 
. . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Says John Davimos, Moorer's manager, "In the long run, Emanuel leaving helped 
Michael tremendously. It allowed him to become a man, allowed him to go out 
there, be confused for a while, be scared for a while, and find his own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think initially, though, it hurt him a lot more than maybe he would admit 
or realize." 
</P>
<P>
 With Lou Duva and George Benton, Moorer rose to his current No. 1 ranking in 
the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation, but seemed to lack 
the fire necessary to win a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He tended to fight hard only when pressured. If the other fighter merely 
wanted to survive, Moorer seemed happy with that. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to his eventual teaming with Atlas, whose directness seems to have 
stirred something within Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a part of him, when he was under pressure, he would waiver and make 
excuses and do things that were contradictory to a person who wanted to be 
successful," Atlas says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was waiting and hesitant in fights. To me, that's a problem where he's not 
disciplining himself to make things happen. That's a person not in control of 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas, who worked with Tyson in the early Catskill, N.Y., days, says there are 
some similarities between the two, quiet but dangerous men. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Moorer) will protect himself by acting in a way that he doesn't really 
feel," Atlas says. "Put those roles on. He's really a sensitive, and sometimes 
unsure person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyson, in some similar ways, was sensitive, and he'd put on those roles that 
he wanted to be around gangsters, and that was all a role. That was Tyson's way 
of getting people to believe him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael's an emotional person, just like Tyson, and he feels the pressure 
just like Tyson did. But Michael's not as malicious as Tyson. He might fool 
you. But Michael's not a malicious person." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Moorer claims that his fearsome image is a useful selling point -- 
he walked into a news conference Tuesday wearing a T-shirt that read: "U have 
the right to remain violent." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorer acknowledges having a quick temper and some embarrassment over the 
incidents -- including at least one fight in a bar -- that have dotted his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have a bad, bad temper," he says. "Used to be very destructive and 
very mean. But I've controlled it a lot. I knew it was a problem for me because 
I would get (angry) at the littlest things outside of boxing. I've made a 
180-degree turn. I don't get that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just sat down and said, 'I'm not going to do that because I'm going to end 
up killing myself one day.' My son being born -- there was a purpose to me 
being here. There's a lot of people who have babies who don't want to be 
fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 And as he prepares to fight Holyfield, the premier example of a fighter who 
apparently has achieved success mostly through discipline and will power, 
Moorer understands that it is time to regain control of his own emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes open wide when he talks about it, and his voice finally is beyond a 
whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evander, it's all within himself," Moorer says. "It's all in his heart and 
his mind. He's a real mental-type of person, like I am. We don't let you know 
what's going on on the outside, but in the inside, we're always thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's minds. It's a meeting of minds."

ROSE BOWL TOUR PROMOTERS SUED FOR STRANDING WISCONSIN FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three tour promoters, including one from Los Angeles, who failed to provide 
Wisconsin football fans with promised Rose Bowl tickets were named in lawsuits 
filed Tuesday by Wisconsin justice officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney General James Doyle said an investigation is continuing into the 
actions of Tournament of Roses officials, ticket brokers and travel agents who 
left up to 1,000 Wisconsin fans on the outside of the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 when 
Wisconsin defeated UCLA, 21-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the suit filed in Dane County Circuit Court in Madison was Barker 
Tours and Travel of Los Angeles, which was 1,145 tickets short for the 1,452 
Rose Bowl packages it marketed. Also named were operators in Hamilton, Canada, 
and Atlanta. For those who were stranded, the average price paid for $46 
tickets was more than $290. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said that the Tournament of Roses' distribution policy was the 
underlying cause of the problems. He said parade participants, committee 
members and others get small numbers of tickets, and almost all end up being 
sold by scalpers. UCLA, which got more than twice as many game tickets as 
Wisconsin, sold one block of 4,500 tickets to a single fan, Doyle said.

WHAT IF BREA PLAYED TEAM OF ALL-STARS? THE COMPUTER KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What if Brea-Olinda played a team of Orange County all-stars in a girls' 
basketball game? What would happen? Here's one scenario using the basketball 
computer simulation, Slam Dunk, which incorporates efficiency ratings based 
upon players' 1993-94 statistics to determine probabilities. The program has a 
built-in bias for height; a manual bias was entered to adjust for the Ladycats' 
cohesiveness. Quotes are based on conversations with the principals after they 
were presented the scenario. Brea-Olinda Coach John Hattrup downplayed the 
importance of a proposed annual game between the Ladycats and a collection of 
the county's best players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already proven ourselves," he said. "What do we have to gain? We went 
33-0." 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll be the greatest team in Orange County history," said a promoter of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already the greatest team in Orange County history," Hattrup retorted. 
"Anybody who doesn't know that doesn't know anything about basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipation was high and opinions varied among county girls' basketball 
observers, as well as these coaches: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mary Hauser, Mater Dei: "It will be competitive. The question is, can the 
five Brea starters last the whole game? You're talking about five all-stars . 
Brea has five quality players that can play with anyone, but man, I think that 
will wear on them after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mary Mulligan, San Clemente: "I don't think any high school team is deep 
enough to deal with that kind of talent. You can't double-team anyone. " 
</P>
<P>
 * Shannon Jakosky, Newport Harbor: "I think the all-stars are going to die a 
slow death. Brea's going to win by 15, 20 points. Their team cohesiveness is 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the speculation went, on and on, right up to game time. 
</P>
<P>
 After the all-stars were announced, the Ladycats were introduced as the 
four-time defending State champion, "the Quad Squad." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stars were selected specifically to attack chinks in Brea's armor. 
They were big -- very big: Calvary Chapel's Blythe Linsey (6-5), Woodbridge's 
Angela Burgess (6-4) and Melanie Pearson (6-1), Cypress' Jessica Eggleston 
(6-0), Marina's Shandy Robbins (6-0), Dana Hills' Karun Grossman (6-1), Rancho 
Alamitos' Akilah Rodgers (5-11 1/2) and Edison's Marie Philman (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot more inside," said the all-star coach, Woodbridge's Eric 
Bangs, The Times Orange County coach of the year. "We'll match strength for 
strength with (Sarah) Beckley and get (Colleen) Hudson in foul trouble. With 
our depth, we'll keep pounding them." And then, after a short pause, he added, 
"But we still might not beat 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere Brea looked, they were looking up. Even at guard, the all-stars 
were tall: Costa Mesa's Heather Robinson (5-11), Mater Dei's Melody Peterson 
(5-9), San Clemente's Michelle Macintyre (5-9) and Woodbridge's Jamie Oenning 
(5-7). They were both intimidating, imposing teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea rode the emotion of a large partisan crowd to an 8-3 lead before the 
all-stars rallied for a 10-8 advantage on Grossman's three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stars got eight points from Rodgers and led, 18-15, going into the 
second quarter. With 5 minutes 4 seconds left in the half, they held the game's 
biggest lead, 24-19. But Hudson hit two free throws, and Beckley and Lauri 
Jordan scored on putbacks, and the game was tied at 25. 
</P>
<P>
 It became apparent as the half wore on that the redwoods in the all-star 
lineup were ill-prepared for Brea's pace; Linsey and Burgess had only two 
points and two rebounds between them. Hudson, driven by the challenge, would 
finish the half with 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson came off the bench and scored eight of the all-stars' 10 points during 
one stretch, but Brea scored 13 during the same period. That's the way it went 
-- the all-stars found answers, and the Ladycats responded accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge's Oenning had asked reporters during the playoffs two months 
earlier what would happen if the two schools played each other. Woodbridge was 
ranked second to Brea most of the season and played for the State Division II 
title. By halftime, after her three-pointer gave the all-stars a lead, Oenning 
had her answer. She turned to Burgess: "These guys are good." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson encouraged her team to continue to play Ladycat basketball 
despite the 35-34 deficit. So often in the playoffs, she had said, "if we play 
the way we're capable, it will take a disaster to beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers opened the third quarter with a free throw, and Macintyre made a 
15-footer to give the all-stars a 38-34 lead. It looked like the beginning of 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea scored eight in a row. Then Jordan scored back-to-back. Then Lee Moulin 
got hot, scoring Brea's next 11 points, including three three-point baskets, 
the last one a buzzer beater to give the Ladycats a 61-49 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans were in hysterics over Brea's sprint, but they weren't loud for long. 
Linsey opened the fourth quarter with five of the all-stars' first seven 
points. Robinson scored twice on drives, and Macintyre buried a 16-footer as 
the momentum turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's 54-game winning streak was ripe for the breaking. The Ladycats were No. 
1 in the nation and 130-5 over the previous four years, but they were out of 
gas. The all-stars' depth had finally paid dividends; the Ladycats seemed ready 
to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, the school's all-time leading scorer, had not scored since the 7:48 
mark of the second quarter. But she answered the all-star rally with a long 
three-pointer, and Hudson followed with a turnaround jumper to make it 71-62 
Brea with 3:39 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stars got the points back quickly. Peterson scored on a drive, then 
hit an 18-footer, and then the usually reserved Moulin -- inexplicably -- was 
whistled for a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers converted the free throws to make it 71-68. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stars couldn't score on the ensuing possession, and Hudson's tip-in 
made it 73-68. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson answered Macintyre's short jumper with a free throw. Brea led 74-70 
with 1:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson had a chance to make it a one-point game when she was fouled by 
Kiyoko Miller on a 14-footer, but the free throw was off and covered up by 
Hudson, who might have been playing the game of her life. The all-stars were 
still two points short, 74-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's Beckley missed underneath on the other end. Rodgers went hard to the 
basket for the tie, but Hudson fouled her with six seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers made the first one, but missed the second. The rebound was Hudson's 
21st, and she got the ball to Erickson. It was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way it's been all year," Hattrup said after the 74-73 victory. 
"Nicole's a great player, but she's not our only player, and people forget 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson finished with nine points while Hudson had 20 points and 21 rebounds. 
Beckley had 13 points, Moulin had 11 and Miller had eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-stars got 13 from Rodgers and Macintyre. Sophomores Philman, Peterson 
and Pearson, the future of OC basketball, had 10, eight and eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, an overjoyed Erickson was in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain how I'm feeling," she said. "I'm in another zone. Honestly, 
I'm numb. It feels like I never even played this game." The Computer's Tale

SAGA IS A REAL POT-BOILER; COMBINED FISHING/CRABBING TRIPS ANGER COMMERCIAL 
BOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stepping aboard the Payback, it is easy to see that this will be no ordinary 
fishing trip.  
</P>
<P>
 On the stern deck of the 32-foot boat is a container of fish carcasses. Not 
your typical fish bait. On the starboard rail is a huge electric winch that 
looks as though it could haul in a whale. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper Dave French is surely going after something big. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 French soon makes it clear that he will use the carcasses and winch to catch 
small crabs before heading out to do some real fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their size, the crabs are becoming a big attraction in these parts. 
Combining crabbing with fishing is the latest rage among sport fishermen, who 
are using this relatively new approach to catch limits of fish and fill a 
bucket with Dungeness crab, maybe the tastiest critter ever to come out of a 
pot of boiling water.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the sea's best," LeRoy Howard says of the Dungeness crab. "For $50 
(the price of a boat ticket), if you limit both ways (on the fish and crabs), 
it's a good deal. You can't beat it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a cloudy sky, French arrives off a sandy stretch of beach north of 
Bodega Bay. Using a long gaff, he snags one of several white buoys stretched in 
a crooked line up the coast and attaches the rope beneath the buoy to the 
winch, hits the switch and pulls up a steel-mesh trap full of lively crabs.  
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding their pincers, he tosses them into a large cooler. The smaller crabs 
and a purple starfish in the trap are tossed overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pasquin, who says his wife sent him on this trip specifically for the 
crabs, re-baits each trap. Warren Darrah holds the gaff. Jim Brower, without a 
chore, pokes his head into the middle of things. Howard stands at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of these passengers, French proceeds from buoy to buoy until the 
last pot is hauled up, emptied and baited again. With 35 crabs in the cooler, 
French says he will return to try to fill everyone's 10-crab limit after a few 
hours at the outer banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to fish now," he says, setting a course for Cordell Banks, 25 or 
so miles offshore. "It's time to fly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Payback is one of three commercial sportfishers that give fishermen a 
chance to do a little crabbing on the side. The Tracer, also out of Lawson's 
Landing at Dillon Beach, and the New Florie S out of Bodega Bay are the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for space on all three boats -- at a time of year when rough weather 
and spotty fishing used to keep them at the docks on many days -- is at a 
premium. Landing operators are pinching themselves, business is so good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a day off since January," says Will Morrow, owner of the 
Payback and Tracer. "One day I got 67 calls, and I used to get six or seven." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kevin Quigley, skipper of the New Florie S: "We've hauled over 1,000 
passengers since the first of the year. It's definitely going to catch on. It 
took off here like wildfire. Others are interested in it and others are already 
getting started." 
</P>
<P>
 This is all well and good for the landings, and for the economy of the region 
in general, but not everyone is happy. In fact, some are downright crabby over 
the new operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial fishermen, who for years have basically had the crab fishery to 
themselves, suddenly feel threatened. Should other sportfishing landings add 
crab pots and winches to their vessels, longtime crabbers say they might soon 
feel the pinch.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the California Department of Fish and Game, Chuck Wise, 
president of the Bodega Bay Fishermen's Marketing Assn. and a member of the 
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assn., uses simple arithmetic to 
express the concerns of commercial crabbers: 
</P>
<P>
 "One party boat with 20 passengers times 10 crabs per person (the limit), will 
catch 200 crab per day. Conservatively, the boat fishes three days a week for 
600 crab for a week, times four weeks equals 2,400 crab a month. That's one 
boat, times an eight-month season. That's 19,200 crab." 
</P>
<P>
 Wise's letter goes on, stating that if other fleets up and down the coast join 
in the crabbing effort, the crab fishery will suffer immeasurably. 
</P>
<P>
 Another gripe among commercial fishermen is that sport-caught crabs can be 
male or female and only have to measure 5 3/4 inches across, whereas 
commercially caught crabs have to be male only and measure at least 6 1/4 
inches across.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel those smaller crabs are our young studs for next year," says Beverly 
Burton, 60, whose family has been fishing in the Bodega Bay area for 30 years. 
"Everybody has a right to the fishery, but I want that fishery for my 
grandchildren. We have to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
 John Duffy, senior marine biologist for the DFG in Sacramento, says there is 
no immediate cause for concern, but he added that the department never expected 
anything like this. Crabbing among recreational fishermen has always been 
limited to a small number of pier fishermen and private boaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy said the DFG plans to examine the methods used by fishermen aboard 
sportfishers to see if they meet DFG requirements. Those requirements are 
vague, stating only that the gear must be regulation and that each fisherman 
must have only one pot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're using (winches) to haul in the crabs and then just filling the 
buckets of fishermen until they have their limits, or if they're leaving the 
crab pots out overnight, well, then how much is the fisherman actually 
participating?" Duffy says. "That's something we're going to have to look at. 
We also are willing to meet with commercial and recreational user groups to see 
if existing laws are inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the phones will keep ringing at the landings and fishermen, in the 
words of Morrow, "will get more for their investment, more bang for their 
buck." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those aboard the Payback, after an hour-long ride over a glassy sea, past 
leaping porpoises and salmon fishermen trolling or mooching closer to shore, 
finally get a chance to wet a line. 
</P>
<P>
 Using heavy iron jigs fished at depths of 400 to 600 feet, anglers begin 
pulling in rockfish of all colors, shapes and sizes, some with air bladders, 
bloated because of the pressure change, protruding from their mouths. Canary 
rockfish, bocaccio, widow bass and olive rock fish, to name a few species that 
thrive on this six-by-three-mile bank, soon litter the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulls and black-footed albatrosses dive at one fish that escapes Brower's 
hook, but its bladder is so bloated the birds can't get it off the surface. 
Shaking its tail from time to time, it floats off toward the horizon, followed 
and harassed by the relentless birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brower, 58, a general contractor from Sacramento, says he would rather be 
fishing for salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to fish for salmon farther up north, but they ran me out because I 
caught too many fish," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's going to run Brower out of this town. French has to help Brower pull 
in his first catch, which Brower insists is a large lingcod. It turns out to be 
only a small rockfish. Brower gets the hang of hauling in fish from such 
depths, though, and soon has six or seven.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the days when you would use 15 hooks and reel in 15 fish," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-afternoon, everyone is close to the 15-fish limit. French says it's 
time to go and fires up the Payback, setting a course for the crab pots. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 32-foot boat chugs on over the rolling swells, Brower continues on a 
roll of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once down in Mexico, I was on a 10-day trip and I fished every single day, 24 
hours a day," he says. Noticing a few skeptics in the crowd, he adds, "I'm not 
kidding you. I'm not!" 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing you know, Brower will be telling his friends how he went fishing 
for rockfish at the outer banks and his group came back with enough crabs to 
feed a small city. But then, that may not be stretching the truth too much. The 
city could be Dillon Beach, population 500.

UNLV, SAN JOSE STATE MIGHT SLIP AWAY FROM THE BIG WEST; ATHLETICS: REPORTS SAY 
THOSE SCHOOLS WILL BE PART OF A WESTERN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing reports in Dallas and Salt Lake City newspapers that the Western 
Athletic Conference will add Big West Conference members Nevada Las Vegas and 
San Jose State along with four other schools in 1996 have heightened 
speculation about the future look of the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports indicate the WAC also will add Southern Methodist, Texas 
Christian, Rice and Tulsa to form a 16-school conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospect of losing UNLV and San Jose State doesn't come as a surprise to 
any of us in the conference," UC Irvine Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said. 
"We met at length at the Big West basketball tournament and considered various 
scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
 Where would this leave the Big West? 
</P>
<P>
 Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell says the conference could stick with the 
remaining eight schools or look to replace UNLV and San Jose State. "We could 
go back to 10 schools or even move beyond that," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell declined to speculate on replacements. Boise State and North Texas 
State have been mentioned in the past for football only. Cal State Northridge 
has been interested in the Big West and Cal State Sacramento also has been 
mentioned, but there are no indications that either is being seriously 
considered at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't close the book on any school as a possibility right now," Farrell 
said. "There are a lot of possibilities and I don't want to limit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said he hopes to schedule a meeting of conference members within two 
weeks to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how you look at it, it would be a matter of losing two respected 
institutions that have brought a great deal to the conference," Guerrero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero said he feels various factors will be considered if the schools do 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no definitive number for a conference that necessarily works well," 
Guerrero said. "We would have to look at it from every option. There are a lot 
of factors that would have to be considered . . . cost, travel and 
compatibility with the other conference members. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I would continue to say that I feel the four institutions that don't have 
football (UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and UC Santa 
Barbara) form the core of the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Athletic Director Bill Shumard also is concerned that the 
interests of the non-football playing schools be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the card is indeed played, we'll have to consider several different 
things, including ways in which we can operate more cost effectively, 
especially in terms of travel for the non-revenue producing sports. . . . The 
Big West has been an excellent conference in basketball and baseball and some 
of the other sports for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton suspended football after the 1992 season for financial reasons. 
Should it return in the future, it probably would be at the Division I-AA 
level.

UCLA'S BALLATORE HIRED AS BROWN'S SWIM COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ron Ballatore, 16-year veteran men's swimming coach at UCLA, was named coach 
at Brown on Tuesday, leaving the Bruin program to carry on its fight for 
survival without him. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA announced last August that it was dropping men's swimming and men's and 
women's gymnastics after the 1993-94 academic year, but reinstated women's 
gymnastics two weeks later when threatened with a gender-equity lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, members of the men's swimming and gymnastics teams were awarded a 
temporary restraining order, barring the school from cutting the programs. But 
the order also required lawyers representing the parties to return to Superior 
Court in Los Angeles on May 16 for further argument. The teams are forbidden 
from scheduling and recruiting in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballatore, whose contract expires in July, decided not to wait for the courts' 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "(UCLA athletic administrators) have given me every indication that they do 
not want to have this men's swimming team here," Ballatore said. "So, I am 
going to go to greener pastures, and maybe I'll take some of my swimmers with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Ballatore, UCLA won the 1982 national title, never finished lower than 
10th at the NCAA meet and has won 26 individual NCAA titles. Brown has never 
won an NCAA individual or team title in men's swimming. WENDY WITHERSPOON

ROBIN ABCARIAN: CIGARETTES NOT ADDICTIVE? OR CANCER-CAUSING? UH-HUH

<P>
 Broccoli and tobacco, two of our most controversial plants, were in the news 
again last week. I don't know which is more disgusting. 
</P>
<P>
 On the veggie front, medical researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced 
that a compound in broccoli blocks the growth of tumors in rats exposed to a 
carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad for our broccoli-hating former President, I thought. Or maybe not, 
since all your cruciferous veggies do the job -- your cauliflower, your 
Brussels sprouts, your cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 But good news for people at high-risk of developing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tobacco front, the chief executives of seven American tobacco companies 
were hauled before a testy, virulently anti-smoking Rep. Henry Waxman and his 
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment in 
Washington, D.C. They came to answer questions about whether nicotine is added 
to cigarettes to ensure the continuing patronage of smokers through addiction. 
(Of course not! said the Marlboro Men, who said they sometimes blend 
higher-nicotine with lower-nicotine tobacco, but only for flavor. ) 
</P>
<P>
 My world view has always been this: Broccoli is good for you. Tobacco is bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I have felt confident in this, certain that no new scientific evidence would 
turn up any time soon contradicting the broccoli-tobacco dichotomy. 
</P>
<P>
 And none has, despite the slick, all-out efforts of the Cigarette Seven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman was hellbent -- as only a politician on the popular side of a 
public-policy debate can be -- on getting the tobacco men to admit that the 
business in which they are engaged is nefarious, dangerous, sneaky . . . and 
may even result in bad breath. (OK, I made up that last part.) 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco men were not about to go down without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 For entertainment value, the hearing didn't have the feel-good potential of, 
say, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," but it was a whole lot funnier in a 
darkly comic way. More John Waters than Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 When Waxman asked the CEOs one by one whether they believe cigarettes to be 
addictive, the answers were predictable: Seven little ix - nays all in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many of us have some experience with cigarettes and addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more of us are familiar with the dynamics of the coping phenomenon known 
as denial. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial is when your kid tells you that the birth control pills/crack 
pipe/marijuana you found in her drawer belong to her best friend . . . and you 
believe her. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial is when your husband comes home stinking drunk, sporting lipstick on 
his collar, and tells you that he must have brushed up against someone in an 
elevator . . . and you believe him. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial is when seven grown men sit in front of a congressional panel and tell 
the American people that they do not believe cigarettes cause lung cancer or 
emphysema, although they would all prefer that their children not smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial is when the president of U.S. Tobacco, Joseph Taddeo, is told that 
people who use snuff are 50 times more likely to develop oral cancer than 
people who do not, and moments later, with a straight face, states: "Oral 
tobacco has not been established as a cause of mouth cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 And the moon, as studies funded by the tobacco industry have shown, is made of 
green cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other unsavory bits of information floated out of last week's hearings like 
someone else's ashes drifting onto your plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of R.J. Reynolds, James Johnston, said he was very sorry for the Joe 
Camel ad that proposed a way for young men to meet potential love interests: 
Drag women swimmers from the water, pretending to think the women are drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was offensive," Johnston said. "It was stupid. We do make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 How many mistakes? Oh, lots. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The head of Philip Morris U.S.A., maker of Marlboro, testified that he had 
blocked publication of a company study supporting the contention that nicotine 
is addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive from Lorillard Tobacco Co., maker of True, Kent and Newport, 
disclosed that he recently gave Congress bafflingly incorrect data. In March, 
he told the very same subcommittee that the nicotine levels in cigarettes had 
dropped 10% since 1982. Last week, he admitted that he had erred, and that 
nicotine levels had actually risen by more than 10% since 1982. How did the 
error occur? "I don't know," he replied, scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the fact that denial is such a potent survival tool -- and they are 
fighting for survival -- one is sorely tempted to call the tobacco executives, 
oh, disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time a kid lights up, we get blamed," sniffed Donald Johnson, head of 
American Tobacco Co., which makes Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Tareyton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry officials, who said last week that cigarette additives 
include ammonia and insecticide -- but, incredibly, not broccoli -- want to 
protect children, not harm them. Johnston of R.J. Reynolds pointed out that if 
cigarettes are banned on the grounds they are too dangerous to be sold, "People 
will be selling cigarettes out of the trunks of cars, cigarettes made by who 
knows who, made of who knows what." 
</P>
<P>
 Back-alley cigarettes. For someone else's kids.

PLAYING FOR KEEPS; MUSIC: INSTRUMENT LESSONS CAN BE A LIFETIME GIFT FOR 
CHILDREN. BUT TODAY, AS MANY O.C. SCHOOLS MAKE CUTBACKS, PARENTS ARE ON THEIR 
OWN IN FINDING A PROGRAM THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEIR YOUNGSTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The world is full of people who remember what their parents told them when 
they balked at music lessons: "Someday you'll be sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I could walk away, I did," recalls Dan Martini, an Orange County 
sheriff's lieutenant. "Now every time I see someone play, I wish I'd listened 
to Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Music can be a lifetime gift, but it doesn't come easily, says Richard Cohen, 
a child psychologist and director of the Pacific Oaks College Research Center 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids these days mostly get good at playing CDs," he says. "They are divorced 
from the actual act of playing an instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Most children used to study music early in their public school years, but 
parents can no longer expect that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some school districts have had to cut out the elementary school music 
programs, and that has eliminated the actual music teacher who would go from 
school to school," says Jim Keltner, choral instructor at Bolsa Grande High 
School in Westminster and president of the Orange County Music Educators Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that some school districts do not provide music instruction until 
the intermediate or high school levels. Parents who want their elementary 
school youngsters to learn to play an instrument are left pretty much to their 
own resources. 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninformed, the array of methods, philosophies and instruments can be 
daunting. Private lessons? Suzuki method? Should you start with the piano? How 
can you tell if the teacher is any good? Should you force a child to practice? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is such a need for information," says Marienne Uszler of San Juan 
Capistrano, editor of the Music Teachers National Assn. Journal and a member of 
the USC piano faculty. "More than ever, parents want to provide music for their 
children, but they don't have a clue about finding a teacher or choosing an 
instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Uszler, who is writing a book to help parents get their children started in 
music, joined several other music education experts in offering some general 
guidelines:  
</P>
<P>
 * What's the best age to begin music lessons? 
</P>
<P>
 There is no consensus, although most experts agree a home where music is 
played is effective even for infants.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a language -- the earlier you start, the more proficient you will 
become," says violin teacher Lorraine Fink of Sherman Oaks, who suggests 
starting children on violin at age 4. The Japanese Suzuki method enrolls 
children as young as 3 in group classes with pint-sized stringed instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 To play the piano, which requires more mature eye-hand coordination, the first 
grade is generally considered a good age to start. Band and orchestra 
instruments can be started in early grades, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, if kids start later -- even in their early teens -- they 
really focus," says Ken Grayson, manager of Grayson's Tune Town in Montrose, a 
music store that provides teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Should a parent insist? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating for a kid to be made to take music lessons if they don't 
want to," Uszler says. With a preschooler, the parents make the decision, but 
by the age of 6, the child needs to be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Music is also a commitment for parents. Joe Thayer, dean of the Colburn School 
of Performing Arts in Los Angeles, says, "Our biggest drop-off in the 
introductory classes is the kid who didn't want to come in the first place or 
the parent who didn't want to give up Saturday morning. They hadn't really 
talked it over." 
</P>
<P>
 Music educator Nadia Lawrence of Santa Monica, whose doctoral dissertation 
analyzed children's music practice and dropout problems in 240 families, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what instrument you choose, you should make a long-term plan 
involving the parents, the student and the teacher," she says. "Agree that 
you're going to stick with the child through all the ups and downs -- and know 
that the roughest times will probably be early adolescence when kids start 
getting really busy." 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you choose an instrument? 
</P>
<P>
 "Choose the instrument first and the teacher second, and in both cases spend a 
lot of time on the decision," Uszler says. "Most parents spend more time buying 
a new car or television than a musical instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests showing children tapes that illustrate what instruments look like 
and how they sound; attending a symphony or a band concert; sitting in on a 
rehearsal of the high school band. 
</P>
<P>
 All is aimed at determining what instrument truly interests the child -- a 
critical factor for success, teachers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Uszler says personality type should be considered. "If you have a little shy, 
retiring girl, she is not going to play the trumpet." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other factors. String instruments require the player to produce his 
own pitch, unlike woodwind, brass or piano. That requires discriminating 
listening by the student.  
</P>
<P>
 And, Uszler adds, "you need to know what amount of care an instrument will 
take. Violin strings break, oboe reeds must be soaked, a harp is not only a 
huge financial commitment, you have to buy a station wagon big enough to cart 
it around."  
</P>
<P>
 Good quality electronic instruments can be attractive, Uszler says, because 
kids see all the pop stars playing them. "The trouble with the electronic 
market is a short supply of really good teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying here," Uszler emphasizes, "is that you should choose an 
instrument as carefully as your family doctor. Don't have your son play the 
saxophone just because you've got Uncle Joe's college saxophone in the attic. 
That's like giving him any old sloppy food to see if he likes to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you get an instrument? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't make a large investment until you know the instrument is going to take 
with the child, and don't buy any instrument until you have a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had beginning students show up with violins that are too big and 
trumpets with the valves stuck," says Ginny Atherton of La Crescenta, a flutist 
with extensive private and group teaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teacher suggests an expensive new instrument, find another teacher. 
What you want is "a good quality entry-level model," says Atherton. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental instruments are a good choice for beginners, says Ron Leon of the Coast 
Music chain of music stores. Depending on quality and whether the rental 
instrument is used, an alto sax rents for about $30 to $65 a month, a trumpet 
for $15 to $30, a violin $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of time people would rather invest money in rental than buy something 
and have it just sit in the closet," Leon says. "Generally it's a good idea, 
but if the price of an instrument is fairly low, a year's rental may have 
bought the instrument. I sell used trumpets for $200." 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores offer plans in which all or part of the rental payments apply 
toward purchase of the instrument, Leon says. 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you find a teacher? 
</P>
<P>
 There are independent teachers for private or small group lessons and the 
group method systems like Suzuki and Yamaha. University programs and specialty 
schools provide performance opportunities. And many music stores provide 
studios for teachers and lists of recommended teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources are the Music Teachers Assn. of California (which operates a 
toll-free referral service at (800) 834-3340), college and university music 
departments and music conservatories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still very haphazard at best," says Howard Richman, a piano teacher who 
gets so many inquiries he is publishing "Guide to L.A. Music Teachers" through 
his Sound Feelings Press in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Keltner says his music educators organization publishes a list of the public 
school teachers in its membership who also provide private lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests parents wanting private lessons consult the teacher at the 
intermediate or high school the child is or will be attending. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have an investment in finding you a good teacher," Keltner says. 
"They'll be getting your son or daughter in their program." 
</P>
<P>
 If you have no success, consult the music departments of local universities 
and colleges, he says. "They may even have some students who are qualified to 
teach. Many of those students are very talented and need the money. It won't be 
as expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon says that the cost of beginning instruction varies considerably, but that 
in Orange County the rule of thumb is about $15 for half an hour of private 
instruction. Be aware there are teachers who prefer beginners and others who 
work best with advanced students. Interview the teachers yourself, says Thayer. 
"Don't be intimidated if you don't know anything about music. Ask what their 
studies have been, how long they have been teaching and what kind of students 
they enjoy working with." 
</P>
<P>
 Other starting advice: Although six-month packages (teacher and rental 
instrument) are popular at music stores, be willing to pay for a couple of 
introductory private lessons, to see that the child, the instrument and the 
teacher are well matched. 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you encourage a child to practice? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rintoul, a professional musician and staff member at the Colburn 
school, teaches a class to help parents support their children's music 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an instant-gratification society," he says. "People want to play an 
instrument. They don't want to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 He offers a few rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice every day, if only for 15 to 30 minutes. The cumulative effect is 
much greater than blitzing before a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice slowly and accurately. Take the piece apart for rhythm, intonation, 
sound and dynamics. "Kids don't like to do that," he says. "They are in a 
rush." 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen to what's being produced. For a more advanced student, it's a great 
help to use a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 All the experts agree practice is the major issue in most households, once the 
early glow wears off. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you want to avoid," says Cohen, "is day-to-day arguments about practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be drudgery, but on the other hand, if kids don't practice, they 
aren't going to progress," he says. "If the child plays in a group, that can be 
fun. There just needs to be some reason to practice."

 And then she bought another one for a friend's birthday. "She was thrilled to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tapert has been reluctant to wear her new bra other than around the house. 
(Once she wore it at a restaurant under a loose-fitting shirt.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't like to wear really sexy revealing clothes out anywhere," 
she said. "I like to be a little covered up. I don't like people staring at 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there is anything wrong with such displays of the flesh, she hastened 
to add. It's just she'd rather keep her pushup to herself -- and, of course, to 
her husband.  
</P>
<P>
 "You feel kind of sexy in it and I think women should get into feeling sexy," 
she said. "That's not compromising yourself. Ultimately, I think women want 
their mystery back. You can be a feminist and compete in a man's world, but 
when the sun comes down you still want to be a woman. If people can't cope with 
that, too bad."

 Remember lift and separate ? This is about lift and unite. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's nothing to be ashamed of. We can talk about this calmly. This 
doesn't call for subterfuge or embarrassment. This is about clothing for the 
healthy.  
</P>
<P>
 This is about a bra, a sumptuous B cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In a feat of marketing and in the spirit of whimsy, "dramatic cleavage 
apparel" -- as it's called in the lingerie biz -- is making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be a tremendous blow to the legmen of America. Really it doesn't 
matter if a woman is tall and lanky. Breasts have resumed their primacy in the 
American pantheon," said one man who insisted, urged, pressured his wife to buy 
one of the newfangled bras. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as these words are being written, thousands of these bras are being 
shipped to New York to begin the big push. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that pushups were ever out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, a British lingerie company named Gossard manufactured the 
Wonderbra, an ordinary item of underclothing that used the principals of both 
aerodynamics and architecture to create cleavage. Other brands, more or less, 
did the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Then two years ago, British Vogue featured an article on the return of these 
bras and the underwear-as-outerwear fad. At the same time, full-bosomed women 
were coming back into vogue. Not that a D-cup could ever be discounted, but 
we'll get to Kate Moss later. 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of 1992, Gossard was turning out 20,000 bras a week and madly 
advertising its product with the memorable slogan "Say goodby to your feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wonderbra was actually created in 1963 by a Canadian company, which 
licensed it to Gossard to market in Britain. Not long after, the Canadian 
company was sold to the all-American Sara Lee. So when Sara Lee, which had also 
bought Playtex, saw those 1992 Wonderbra figures (1.5 million bras sold in one 
year!) it immediately revoked Gossard's license and gave Playtex the pushup 
franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider that the first shot fired over the bow. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 months of research and development, the Brits at Gossard came out 
with their own version of the Wonderbra. The new product was extensively tested 
by 250 unembarrassable British women who volunteered to be probed, prodded and 
measured by perfect strangers at the Gossard factory. The bra was renamed the 
Super-Uplift and introduced at Saks Fifth Avenue on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The company flooded the media with information -- and free pictures -- about 
Gossard's "Call to Cleavage." But even before the media blitz, with just word 
of mouth going for it, Saks sold 109 bras in four days in its Manhattan store. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the people who brought you the best chocolate brownies imaginable 
were working feverishly in their engineering labs to bring back the original, 
the first, the classic, "The one and only Wonderbra," the slogan says.  
</P>
<P>
 On May 9, Sara Lee will introduce its new and improved original in New York 
stores and then launch "a full national rollout in the early fall, beginning in 
Los Angeles and moving on to the rest of the country," said Jill Golden, a Sara 
Lee spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the evolution of women's position in the United States work 
force," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 But before we get to philosophizing, it might be wise to explain how these 
contraptions work. And the Super Uplift (constructed in 48 parts) and the 
Wonderbra (54 parts) do work, say sources who would only be identified by their 
cup sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 A discreet A cup explained during a dressing-room interview that the underwire 
seemed to be at exactly the right pitch to encourage her to stand erect and to 
encourage her breasts to, well, do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 But a C cup, overhearing this explanation, vehemently disagreed. (Remember, 
this is New York.) The C cup insisted that the confluence of fabric and wiring 
seemed to push her breasts up and forward in a way that they hadn't since she 
was in her 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine this," said the 48-year-old, parading around the dressing room area 
in her Super Uplift. At one point she demonstrated the boosting effect of two 
removable pads -- called "cookies" -- tucked under the side of each cup. She 
simply popped them out and said to her own amusement, " Voila ," as gravity 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we can get philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These bras are nostalgic, goofy and perhaps recognition of our collective 
absurdity. They are what some women wear to feel sexier and what others, who 
believe that sex is about fun, wear to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 There are definitely women out there who object -- who see this bra as binding 
evidence of a society contrived to make women feel inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculous," said a Harvard graduate used to her cotton sports bras, the kind 
that hook in the front and guys in college call "front loaders." 
</P>
<P>
 "Next we'll be wearing whalebone corsets," she sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether these pushups are comfortable is difficult to determine short of doing 
some kind of statistically balanced poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women, already accustomed to underwires, seem to have no problem with the 
bras, which come in the usual variety -- front hooked, back hooked, halter top, 
body suits. Others are bothered and report that after a couple of hours 
cosseted in one these things, they have slipped into a ladies' room and simply 
slipped off the scaffolding. Watching a saleswoman at Saks maneuver a 34A into 
a cup of a Super-Uplift confirmed: It was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could put a gun to my head and I still wouldn't have cleavage," the 34A 
groaned. She also conceded, however, that all this pushing and mushing was 
better than surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it may be no coincidence that pushups' popularity coincide with 
women's concern over implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women wanted the look without the danger of surgery and the potential 
aftereffects," said Marjorie Deane, editor of the Tobe Report, a fashion trend 
weekly. She also doesn't believe women are going to give up athletic bras.  
</P>
<P>
 "When they jog they still want the other kind of bra," Deane said, "but this 
is for when you're leaning over the cocktail table and want cleavage to show." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Deane could not predict how long the need for cleavage will endure or 
whether after the initial thrill of owning pushup bras, women will relegate 
them to the back of the drawer -- along with black garter belts and red thong 
underpants. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Tapert, a writer who recently completed the memoirs of Swifty Lazar, 
is already ambivalent about where and when she'll wear her new pushup. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapert bought it at the urging of her husband, Jesse Kornbluth. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's his attitude, delivered not without humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm smart, I'm a writer, I'm cultured," Kornbluth said, "but at the end of 
the day, I'm an American man . . . which means to be under such siege that an 
overflowing B cup looks like a refuge. Now, women are also under incredible 
siege and I don't know what women do for succor. But for a man, there's nothing 
better than. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So this is what Tapert was dealing with when walking down the street with 
Kornbluth, they came across a store advertising the Wonderbra in the window. 
The advertisement had a quote from superwaif Kate Moss about the uplifts: "They 
are so brilliant, I swear, even I get cleavage with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Tapert, a slim 34B, later went to buy one, but after seeing the price came 
home empty-handed. "I didn't feel like spending $40 on just another pushup 
bra." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband persisted: "Do this for me." 
</P>
<P>
 So she went back, tried it on again and shelled out the

THE 'BEANFIELD' BURDEN; JOHN NICHOLS HAS CRAFTED ELEGANT MEDITATIONS ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND WORKED ON HIS FAIR SHARE OF SCREENPLAYS. BUT HE CAN'T STOP 
PEOPLE FROM FOCUSING ON THE WHIMSICAL CULT FAVORITE THA HE WROTE 20 YEARS AGO. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Nichols makes it very plain: He doesn't wish to be remembered for "The 
Milagro Beanfield War" -- the book he has called "an albatross around my neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Milagro" appeared in 1974, Nichols has written books on the 
environment, elegant meditations on the damage people inflict on the natural 
world. He's also done considerable screenwriting, including a rewrite of the 
Costa-Gavras film "Missing" and drafts of "Milagro." 
</P>
<P>
 His latest novel, "Conjugal Bliss," is a bawdy, farcical look at marriage and 
the bonds of fidelity that incorporates antic Nicholsean touches -- and yet it 
is a stylistic departure from "Milagro," Nichols' whimsical account of the 
residents of a poor, mostly Latino northern New Mexico village uniting to 
thwart a rapacious land developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, two decades after its publication, "Milagro" remains his best-known 
book. Thanks to a fanatic cult following, it was even made into a 1988 film by 
Robert Redford. And these days, the ghost of "Milagro" has returned to haunt 
Nichols in the form of a 20th anniversary facsimile edition of the novel. 
</P>
<P>
 As he writes in an afterword to the anniversary edition, "The public has 
arrested my literary development in a 'Milagro' time warp." 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Wood, Nichols' longtime editor at Henry Holt and Co. (whom he describes 
as "the one useful critic I know"), agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever reads a book of his wants that book again," she says. "He's 
disappointed his readers by not writing that book." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a coffeehouse near the University of New Mexico, Nichols is discussing his 
books, his career and the political convictions that have sustained him for the 
past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is 53, and his unruly mop of brown hair is streaked with gray, 
Nichols doesn't seem all that much older than the graduate students hanging 
around campus, thanks to his work shirt, jeans and running shoes. In his nylon 
backpack is a spiral-bound notebook, in which he jots installments of his 
manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September he's lived in an off-campus apartment and teaches a creative 
writing course. He's also working on a film project while his new wife, Miel 
Castagna, finishes her degree in Russian studies. Come May, they'll return to 
Taos, N.M., the mountain village 130 miles north of Albuquerque where Nichols 
has lived since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols says he hasn't really missed Taos, which has been the setting for most 
of his books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where my heart is, is in Albuquerque," he says simply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conjugal Bliss" is set in Taos, but the town serves mostly as a backdrop for 
the tale of Roger and Zelda, middle-aged newlyweds embarked on a passionate 
roller-coaster relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second marriage for both. As narrated by Roger, the story traces the 
demands they make on one another amid the pleasures and pitfalls of the wedded 
state. Zelda is hugely jealous of Roger's old girlfriends and demands his utter 
loyalty. Roger, leery of commitment, is unwilling to burn his bridges and leap 
with both feet into the new marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long they've taken opposite corners. The ensuing apocalypse is vintage 
Nichols: Roger and Zelda come to blows, their house is trashed and a VW Beetle 
is riddled with gunfire. It's not for nothing that Nichols has subtitled the 
book, "A Comedy of Martial/Marital Arts." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought 'Conjugal Bliss' was a real archetypal situation that I had 
experienced in my father's (four) marriages and my own marriages," he says. "My 
dad's always told me that love and hate come out of the same emotional 
reservoir." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Nichols was born in Berkeley in 1940. His father was a psychologist (now 
retired). His mother died when he was 2. Nichols at first lived with cousins, 
the Welds, in Smithtown, Long Island. (Cousin William Weld is now the 
Republican governor of Massachusetts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols later moved around the East Coast, attending a prep school before 
entering Hamilton College in Upstate New York, where he played hockey and 
football and ran track. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating he traveled a bit; published his first novel, "The Sterile 
Cuckoo," and settled in New York. A trip to Guatemala in the spring of 1964 
changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guatemala just blew my head off," he recalls. "I'd never been in a country 
like that, where people were so impoverished, so exploited." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was immersed in books that cast American overseas involvement in an 
ugly light and he acquired a new outlook on his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was American history as I'd never been taught it," he says. "I came out of 
it really, really believing in the socialist ideal, which I still do today." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, meanwhile, had established a literary reputation with "The Sterile 
Cuckoo" and his next book, "The Wizard of Loneliness" -- both of which were 
made into movies -- and had married the first of his three wives and started a 
family. (Son Luke lives in Taos, where he is a musician and builder of 
earthships -- innovative energy efficient structures made of recycled 
materials. Nichols' daughter, Tania, is a student at the University of New 
Mexico.) 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the 1960s, Nichols faced a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a bunch of novels," he says, "but I was so involved in the Vietnam 
War and so angry at the American way that everything I wrote was drenched in 
angry, polemicizing left politics." 
</P>
<P>
 No one wanted to publish the books he was writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid artistic turmoil and an unraveling marriage, he moved to Taos and began 
an unpaid stint with an alternative newspaper called the New Mexico Review. He 
wrote lengthy investigative pieces about land and water conflicts between rural 
mountain residents and developers, which provided the raw material for "The 
Milagro Beanfield War." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Milagro," he says, he "backed off on being so shrill or so obviously 
angry. 'Milagro' was a famous last stab at keeping a career alive. When that 
was published, I felt it wasn't effective because it was too funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite unspectacular sales, "Milagro" became the first installment of 
Nichols' "New Mexico Trilogy," which continued with the darker, more political 
"The Magic Journey" (1978) and the farcical "The Nirvana Blues" (1981). In 
1987, he weighed in with "American Blood," an unrelentingly bleak and violent 
anti-war novel that touched the raw nerve of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Milagro's" mythic, romantic qualities found a wide audience (to 
the extent that today there is a "Milagro" bed-and-breakfast and a "Milagro" 
art gallery in Taos). Nichols acknowledges that the book resuscitated his 
career but fumes at being introduced as the guy who wrote "The Milagro 
Beanfield War." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, editor Wood says that when she received the "Milagro" manuscript 
in 1973, she knew it was unfashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Publishing John Nichols in the '70s was very much against the grain. It was 
political fiction and it was filled with unpronounceable names. It was set in a 
boondock and wasn't 'coastal.' It was in quite a broad-swath style. It was 
trashed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols writes on a manual typewriter or in longhand, turning out a first 
draft of a manuscript in as little as five weeks, then rewriting "dozens of 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pause to think about literature," he says. "I just blam. In fact, my 
friend Mike Kimmel calls it the blam method of writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols says he tries to forget a book as soon as it's finished and turns to 
his next project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always seem really flawed. I always feel embarrassed by the lack of 
doing it better. I feel embarrassed about what a book reveals about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols claims to have relinquished the dream of writing what he considers a 
great work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've realized what the criteria are to produce something special -- it's 
really hard," he says. "I'm not sure if I have the skill or the drive to do 
that, although I'm real proud of what I've done. It's an interesting body of 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he looks fit, even youthful, Nichols is afflicted with a host of 
heart ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years he's coped with tachycardia -- a rapidly beating heart -- and 
atrial fibrillation, a condition in which the heart beats irregularly. He's 
tried different drugs to control the problems but hates their side effects. 
Mitral valve prolapse is another problem, with doctors suggesting open-heart 
surgery to replace the valve. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent much of the winter battling endocarditis, a strep inflammation of the 
heart sac. He was hospitalized and dosed with antibiotics, which brought the 
infection under control. (Nichols also has arthritis, is awaiting a 
double-hernia operation and copes with Meniere's disease, an inner-ear 
disorder.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols has bestowed his heart condition upon a number of his fictional 
protagonists, but he warns against assuming that those characters are him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've used it in different books because it's handy," he says. "People are 
always curious about whether my books are autobiographical. I can't understand 
that question. What isn't autobiographical in a writer's life?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, this writer's life grows ever busier -- even as he yearns for 
greater simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 He's finishing a script for director Ridley Scott, working on his next book, 
and trying to keep up with his reading and correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves less time for beloved pastimes, such as fly fishing in the Rio 
Grande gorge, grouse hunting in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, nature 
photography and playing flamenco guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he says, it feels "like life is sort of a washing machine -- you're 
just tossing and tumbling around."

FAMILY; AN EMBOLDENED VOCABULARY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for a way to augment your vocabulary? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, here is a novel approach: A mystery story, at once whimsical and 
elucidating, filled with hundreds of SAT examiners' favorite test words. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "Tooth and Nail," Harcourt Brace & Co.'s latest guide to the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. Touted as "a terrific test preparation tool and a mesmerizing 
mystery," the book is a benign enough tale of veteran SAT-takers at a mythical 
college in the middle of Iowa who find themselves in a quagmire of 
Shakespearean serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: Every boldfaced word (boldface is dark type, like this) 
is an SAT word. Boldfacing is the authors' subtle way of calling special words 
to young readers' attention without disrupting the flow of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Peopled with stalwart Englishmen and toady dotards, the 366-page tome -- 
including glossary -- is understandably overrun with some fairly ostentatious 
allusions. But, hey, isn't that the point -- or shall we say, raison d'etre -- 
of such a book?  
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to turn the 1.3 million high school students who take the SAT each year 
into perspicacious paragons of prose, the $10 paperback is amusingly 
overwritten by Brooklyn educator Joseph Elliot and San Diego linguist Charles 
Harrington Elster, who also wrote "Is There A Cow in Moscow?" 
</P>
<P>
 And, no, Spiro Agnew had nothing to do with it. PAMELA WARRICK

UP ALL NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: SURE, THEY CAN ROCK -- BUT CAN THEY SWING?

<P>
 The Scene: Sunday's kick-off party for the first Hard Rock Cafe-Eddie Van 
Halen Charity Golf Tournament. It was held at the Beverly Center's Hard Rock. 
The tournament was played Monday at the exclusive Sherwood Country Club's Jack 
Nicklaus-designed course in Thousand Oaks. Holding a rock 'n' roll golf 
tournament at the pro-quality Sherwood is akin to having a monster truck 
contest on the lawn at Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Many who know much about rock 'n' roll, few with the same 
understanding of golf. Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, who at least knows 
how to play the game, said: "I am the Lee Trevino of this crowd." Among the 400 
guests were Van Halen and wife Valerie Bertinelli, Sammy Hagar, Ray (Boom Boom) 
Mancini, Faith Ford, Jamie Lee Curtis and Dweezil Zappa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Although golf pros have told him, "You have to play twice a week just 
to stay bad," Van Halen said he gets by on five outings a year, "so you can 
imagine how bad I am." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High Point: Van Halen, a band that usually plays stadiums, blasted forth 
inside the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is rarely this loud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, How Loud Was It?: So loud that drinks on the bar shook. So loud that jaded 
rock 'n' roll writers, most of them half-deaf to begin with, were reaching for 
napkins to stuff in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: It was hoped that the tournament, plus an auction of 
autographed guitars at the party and underwriting from Cobra Golf, would raise 
$250,000 for the UCLA School of Medicine's Pediatric Kidney Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: While some watched a closed-captioned Jean-Claude Van Damme movie on 
the bar's TV and others schmoozed, Tommy Lee of Motley Crue was in a passionate 
make-out session with girlfriend Bobbi Brown. At one point a photographer said, 
"I think now she's chewing on his nose ring."

COMMENTARY; WHEN CULVER CITY ASKS 'IS IT ART?' IT MISSES THE POINT; ART: THE 
CITY COUNCIL'S DECISION TO ALLOW SOME ARCHITECTURE TO SATISFY ITS 
ONE-PERCENT-FOR-ART REQUIREMENT IS MISGUIDED AND, IN THE END, STINGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This month, Culver City dramatically revised its one-percent-for-art program, 
which, like those in many American cities, had required that 1% of the 
construction cost of a new building be used to acquire or commission public 
art. The City Council has amended its policy to say that, in some 
circumstances, the building itself can satisfy the percent-for-art requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bizarrely, architecture can be considered art. A developer will now be able to 
petition Culver City's City Council and argue that the architectural merits of 
his project are such that the goal of the percent-for-art requirement has 
already been met. 
</P>
<P>
 Public art, like funds for day care or traffic abatement, is a civic mandate, 
based on a belief that increased urban density inevitably causes social 
problems. Public art helps compensate for the negative impact. If the City 
Council agrees that a building's architectural quality is sufficient, the 
public art requirement will be declared to have been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a bold and progressive proposal, which affirms the civic importance of 
architecture in American life, as its supporters claim? Or is it a backward 
semantic shuffle, built on confused ideas about art and beloved by architects 
who resist the idea of allowing artists into the building precinct? 
</P>
<P>
 Procedurally the plan raises disturbing issues. Most harmful is that if a 
building design fails to pass percent-for-art muster, only then would an artist 
be brought in to execute a project; public art claims a higher chance of 
success if the artist is brought in at the beginning of the design process, not 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, the answer to whether the plan is forward-looking or 
self-serving doesn't really matter. Either way, Culver City's revised program 
is predicated on an erroneous belief that art and architecture can be 
interchangeable terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," sniffed a Culver City bureaucrat when I pressed the distinction, "you're 
one of those ." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes. I am. I'm one of those who thinks the distinction between art and 
architecture is more than a semantic quibble. Confusing the two, as Culver City 
has now done, manages more than merely to debase vocabulary. It does real 
damage, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's false assumption that architecture can be art is based on a 
hoary idea, long since discredited. The obsolete reasoning went like this: If 
something is good enough, it transcends its lowly status as a mere artifact of 
the material world and ascends to a higher plane called art. 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, if the design of a building is good enough it will be said to 
have risen above the work-a-day world to become public art. A meritorious 
building floats in art heaven; all the rest is hellish. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the old-fashioned cleft between high art and low. If the moralizing 
distinction between high and low sounds familiar, it should. In our secular 
society, the idea of transcendent art simply shifts Christian doctrine away 
from people -- if you're good, you'll go to heaven; if not, you'll fry -- and 
onto man-made objects. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea may be obsolete, but it remains a staple of our popular imagination. 
When a layman is faced with a painting he loathes, the typical exclamation is, 
"Yuck, that's not art!" Of course, the painting is still art; what's meant is 
that it's not good enough to count. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakenly, we reserve the category of art as a term of privilege, which we 
bestow or withhold based on an assessment of quality. It gives us an ego-driven 
illusion of control over things that come our way -- notably, control that can 
be asserted without having to examine blind prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 What the City Council in Culver City has done is give itself the authority to 
decide when something qualifies as a work of art. A building, if they deem it 
good enough, is declared to have art in it. By default, all other buildings 
must tacitly be considered not to be art. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle of a city council passing such judgment would be funny, except 
for one thing. Governments are best left out of the business of determining 
what is or is not art. The next thing you know, they start deciding who is or 
is not a human being. From Joseph Stalin in the 1920s to Jesse Helms in the 
1980s, the process is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Culver City's atavistic view, consider this: If a work of 
architecture is good enough, it transcends its lowly status and becomes -- yes! 
-- good architecture. If a building is bad enough, it is bad architecture, and 
if it's mediocre enough, it's mediocre architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Never, however, is architecture art. Architecture is architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's wrong with that? Why should it be embarrassed about its status and 
seek some holier-than-thou consecration as a work of art? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe an answer will be found among assumptions that have long guided 
percent-for-art programs. Architects might rightly chafe at the common belief 
that social ills are an inevitable result of the increased urban density their 
buildings produce, and that architecture is helpless to mitigate the harm while 
it's supposed public art magically can. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Culver City's new plan is injudicious. Perhaps its most dispiriting 
feature is that art and architecture are pitted against each other in a contest 
for public worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The program revision doesn't try to add good architecture to what it hopes 
will be good public art, produced under its auspices. Instead, architecture is 
set up to replace public art. Rather than expand the quality of social 
experience that art and architecture can both provide, the public world is 
shrunken into a small, fixed space, where competing amenities must duke it out 
for dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, during the widely publicized brawl over Richard Serra's 
notorious public sculpture "Tilted Arc," which was eventually removed from a 
plaza in New York City, an insightful issue was raised. The 
architecture-as-public-art idea in Culver City raises it anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Crimp, an art critic and admirer of Serra's work, pointedly complained 
during testimony at a hearing about the sculpture's proposed removal: "I am 
asked to line up on the side of sculpture against, say, those who are on the 
side of concerts or maybe picnic tables (for the plaza). But of course all 
these things have social functions, and one could imagine many, many more. It 
is a measure of the meager nature of our public social life that the public is 
asked to fight it out in a travesty of democratic procedure over the crumbs of 
social experience." 
</P>
<P>
 It is another measure of that meagerness that Culver City's percent-for-art 
program has now given us a stingy choice. You can line up on the side of 
architecture or on the side of art, but you can't have both. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time we started to ask why not.

ON SCREEN, BASES ARE LOADED; BASEBALL: AMERICA'S NATIONAL PASTIME IS ENJOYING A 
RENAISSANCE IN HOLLYWOOD -- 'MAJOR LEAGUE II' IS IN THEATERS AND SIX MORE 
PROJECTS ARE ON THEIR WAY. BUT A DECADE AGO, THE GAME WASN'T A HOT TOPIC.

 Let's get this over with quickly: Critic and former Columbia University 
provost Jacques Barzun once wrote: "Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of 
America better learn baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since he pronounced this curse 40 years ago, there has been no end in the 
supply of twinkly-eyed Barzun-clones who arrive with spring to fill the 
airwaves with woody essays about baseball being what Homer had in mind when he 
wrote the Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many who see in baseball the entire fabric of American life," Vice 
President Gore said last May in the kind of speech politicians love to give to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame. "During the jobs bill debate," he said, "we kept 
reminding ourselves Babe Ruth struck out 1,330 times."  
</P>
<P>
 In short, if you need to renew your romance with the national pastime you're 
in luck. There are seven baseball movies on deck to trot around the nation's 
base paths starting immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 First up is "Major League II," David S. Ward's current-release sequel to his 
raucous 1989 clubhouse hit about the funky losers-turned-champion Cleveland 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 William Dear's remake of the 1951 film "Angels in the Outfield" features an 
8-year-old who rouses the deadbeat Angels to believe in themselves after he 
sees "real" angels winging around you-know-where. (Opens July 8.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Big League," by Castle Rock producer-turned-director Andrew Scheinman, 
concerns a 12-year-old who inherits the derelict Minnesota Twins and manages to 
inspire the overpaid bankers on-field to "play" baseball again for fun. (Opens 
July 20.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Shelton's "Cobb" stars Tommy Lee Jones as Ty Cobb, the great Detroit Tiger 
of the 1920s, at the end of his life remembering in flashback how he tormented 
the opposition on-field with his slashing spikes and rationalizing his personal 
losses off the field.  
</P>
<P>
 And Michael Ritchie's "The Scout" stars Albert Brooks in a middle-age, 
middle-management career crisis comedy (just completed filming). 
</P>
<P>
 On the documentary front, Washington-based filmmaker Aviva Kempner is working 
on "The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg." Kempner ("The Partisans of Vilna") 
hopes to release the film by Sept. 19, the 60th anniversary of Greenberg's 
taking Yom Kippur off during the 1934 pennant race with the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
 And Ken Burns ("Civil War") is readying a nearly 20-hour history titled 
"Baseball" to air in nine "innings" of two or more hours each on PBS in the 
fall.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all this activity, baseball was a subject that almost nobody in Hollywood 
could get funded a decade ago, before Ron Shelton's "Bull Durham" (1988) 
parlayed an $8-million investment into a $50-million domestic box-office gross. 
Now everyone in town seems to be stepping up to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball genre began with simple biographies like "The Pride of the 
Yankees" (1942) with Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, "The Babe Ruth Story" (1948) 
starring William Bendix, and even "The Jackie Robinson Story" (1950) starring 
Robinson himself. These are World War II-era baseball versions of "The Jazz 
Singer," patriotic meditations meant to celebrate the American melting pot 
meritocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 When something gets elevated to the film genre the way baseball has, both film 
and social critics inevitably find fault with what they see on screen. The 
complaints about baseball movies occur in two forms: Movies Can't Get Baseball 
Right; and Neither Can Baseball, Anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they showed Shoeless Joe Jackson coming out of the cornfield (in "Field 
of Dreams") and going up to the plate as a right-handed hitter, I almost fell 
over," says Billy Rogell, who played shortstop for the 1934 Tigers with Hank 
Greenberg. "They should have sent that kid (Ray Liotta) back into the cornfield 
and told him to come back as a leftie," adds Rogell, 89. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, and they used an oversize ball to show up better, too," reminds Roger 
Angell, the New Yorker writer, who has taken baseball movies to task in "No, 
but I Saw the Game," a piece he wrote a few seasons back. "Very few guys get it 
right," Angell says. 
</P>
<P>
 It also turns out that Ron Shelton, in Angell's estimation, "really knows 
ball." In fact, he's made a Hollywood career out of it, having traded in his 
cleats as a minor league player to write and direct "Bull Durham" and to write 
two basketball films, "Blue Chips" and "White Men Can't Jump" (he also directed 
the latter). Perhaps that's why it's all the more shocking when Shelton, on the 
set of "Cobb," spells out baseball's fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hardly watch baseball anymore. I'm so upset with a game that's played 
indoors and on plastic," Shelton rails. "Turns out, it's all big business. You 
have athletes right out of college representing shoe and soft-drink companies 
-- but God forbid they do anything a 21-year-old normally does and lose their 
$20-million contracts. We're asking athletes to be a whole lot of things that 
they aren't, including corporate spokesmen, which you cannot be and maintain a 
point-of-view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ty Cobb was Southern-born, sent his kids to Ivy League schools, listened to 
classical music, hung out with Presidents and did not accommodate anybody. Nor 
explain himself, nor ever complain. He took everything head on. He had very 
clear opinions and expressed them freely. He was a lot of things that were 
unpopular, but nobody ever called him a liar. He was a man who played as big a 
game as he talked, who excelled, and who was not ambivalent about all the 
things modern society is ambivalent about." 
</P>
<P>
 If Shelton is wound up, it's because people sense that something has gone out 
of baseball and American life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What baseball represents to people -- or what writers want it to -- is 
innocence," says John Sayles, who wrote and directed "Eight Men Out," about the 
Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball itself, however, no longer seems innocent. "Fans think of baseball as 
a game played by pampered millionaires and run by exploitative owners," says 
Ward, whose "Major League" films take a slapstick look at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the '70s, Hollywood baseball movies -- "Bang the Drum Slowly" 
(1973), "Bull Durham" and even "The Natural" (1984) -- dealt with the 
acceptance of limits, when American men began to face the fact that they would 
not achieve what they thought was a birthright. Never mind the exhilaration of 
glory. The comforts of modest success, a respectable job and a home on a tidy 
street either closed in on baby boomers who had been promised the world or, 
worse, outright eluded them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to face the hard facts, the baseball movie has since slipped into 
fantasy nostalgia. "The Sandlot," by David Mickey Evans, is a 1993 film told in 
flashback to 1962 by a baseball announcer. The movie pines for the days when a 
kid could dream, and stardom was the goal. "There might be an entire generation 
out there whose theme song could be 'I'll Never Grow Up,' " says Sayles. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has been the prism of what was and was not possible in American life. 
To understand baseball then is to understand the Old West and the sense of 
unbounded frontier that was its legacy. Organized professional baseball was a 
19th-Century innovation. Its mechanics are about open fields, and its ethos is 
agrarian, about reaping what you sow. It lent itself to the postwar suburban 
frontier, where city met country, and baseball was the only game in town.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the dynamic has shifted to basketball and hockey, intensely paced urban 
sports sandwiched between buildings. Offense switches to defense in the flick 
of a wrist; a player about to go in for the kill is unmanned in a flash, and 
the action moves deep into his home turf. It makes sense on the court or the 
rink because it makes sense in the city -- and in the overall pace of the 
nation, as regulated by the thermostat of TV and cable TV. Films like "Field of 
Dreams" and "The Sandlot" were made less for contemporary kids than for the 
last generation to whom baseball made sense, those who came of age in the '60s 
or earlier. But the urgency in these films is gone, because the culture has 
moved onto something newer and hotter, which better reduces and clarifies 
experience.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why no one expected Michael Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington, 
N.C., where he played baseball before basketball, to embark on this odd 
personal journey that resists the very cultural clock he helped reset. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Cobb," the baseball movie may be moving beyond nostalgia and edging 
toward the major league equivalent of the aging gunfighter saga. This is how 
"High Noon" with Gary Cooper in 1952 or "Shane" with Alan Ladd in 1953 marked 
the beginning of the end of the vigor of the Western, once the Old West had 
vanished as a touchstone in the mental life of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe like the West, baseball is just not part of people's dreams anymore," 
adds Sayles, "the way it used to be."

RICK DU BROW: PARTY'S OVER, BUT HALL MADE HIS MARK ON TV 
</P>

<P>
 Arsenio Hall was getting boxed in. 
</P>
<P>
 After turning late-night TV on its head by bringing to it a new, young, 
pop-culture sensibility -- and rocketing to the runner-up talk-show spot behind 
Johnny Carson -- he suddenly fell victim to high-powered rivals challenging 
some of his trademarks, including his musical bookings and party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's new "Tonight Show," with Jay Leno replacing Carson, seemingly attempted 
to go the Arsenio route at first in its musical acts. CBS' David Letterman 
series stormed out of the starting gate last August with a high-energy party 
atmosphere of its own, and hasn't yet cooled down. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno-Letterman. Letterman-Leno. That's all anyone seemed to be talking about 
when it came to late-night competition. CBS was pressuring its stations that 
had carried Hall to drop him or push him back later to help the network's 
Letterman showcase. Fox had done the same to its own stations when it launched 
the ill-fated Chevy Chase late-night show in September. 
</P>
<P>
 So unless Hall had an unknown personal reason for quitting, it was hardly a 
surprise when he and Paramount announced Monday that he will be ending his 
5-year-old syndicated series on May 27. The ratings had fizzled in the face of 
the new competition and the pressures to downgrade his time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even KCOP-TV Channel 13, which is neither a CBS nor Fox outlet, pushed back 
Hall's starting time from 11 p.m. to midnight as the handwriting on the wall 
became clearer. Hall's national ratings dropped 24% from January of 1993 to 
January of 1994, and the number of stations carrying his show slipped from 184 
to 160.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he had been so hot that "Nightline," a solid ABC contender for 
years against Carson, found itself frustrated because some of its stations were 
delaying the honored news show until the wee hours and replacing it with Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hall may have also helped box himself in by burning too intensely too quickly 
and without letting up, a lesson that Letterman may want to study. Carson 
lasted 30 years by settling into a relatively gentle, easygoing style that was 
a comfort zone for television viewers at bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 With the proliferation of night-time talk shows on cable as well as the 
networks -- from Larry King on CNN to Tom Snyder on CNBC -- the new age of TV 
and its expanding universe made it even tougher for Hall to maintain a 
definitive, high-profile place for himself on the home screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's series was definitely not everybody's taste. He had matinee-idol looks 
and a sly sense of humor, but he was a fawning interviewer for his celebrity 
guests. His audience barked its approval, and he encouraged the raucous scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that was his weakness to his detractors, it was what his admirers 
liked. And even those who were not thrilled with his approach had to concede 
the terrific energy he spread as a cheerleader for those not yet ready to go to 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the annals of TV, he had already made his mark on a more significant 
level as the first successful black host of a late-night talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Other late-night icons have also had relatively short runs: Steve Allen and 
Jack Paar on the "Tonight Show," for instance, although they both left the 
series while on top. It was Carson's amazing run that perhaps subconsciously 
gave viewers the notion that late-night shows run forever. Letterman ran for 11 
years on his former NBC show. And Snyder lasted nine years with NBC's late-late 
"Tomorrow" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hall's series somehow seems to have faded relatively quickly. Unlike 
most late-night hosts who seek a kind of entertaining neutrality, Hall openly 
plunged into political and social issues, which endeared him to some viewers, 
especially in his positive and admirable TV role during the violence following 
the initial Rodney G. King verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, however, his outspokenness probably got him into hot water 
with non-fans. And here, too, he may have helped box himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1992 was a kind of high-water mark for controversy and some 
remarkable showmanship for Hall's series. The showmanship was epitomized in 
early June of 1992 when Bill Clinton, en route to the presidency, made a 
memorable appearance on Hall's one-hour program, wearing shades and playing the 
saxophone -- "Heartbreak Hotel" followed by Billie Holiday's "God Bless the 
Child." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, a White House spokesman said that then-President George 
Bush was considering appearances on "the same kind of media" as other 
candidates, except for the Hall show. Hall reacted on the air with a personal 
tirade against Bush, opening his show by saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, George Herbert, irregular-heart-beating, read-my-lying-lipping, 
slipping-in-the-polls, do-nothing, deficit-raising, 
make-less-money-than-Millie-the-White House-dog-last-year, Quayle-loving, 
sushi-puking Bush! I don't remember inviting your ass to my show." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same year, Hall also unloaded on Leno as Carson's "Tonight Show" heir, 
telling Entertainment Weekly magazine: "Jay Leno can't replace Johnny Carson. 
It sounds like an insult. . . . I'm gonna treat him like we treated the kid on 
the high school basketball team who was the coach's son. He was there because 
he was anointed too. We tried to kick his ass, and that's what I'm going to do 
-- kick Jay's ass." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not, of course, work out that way. Letterman last year immediately 
grabbed the late-night crown, but Leno has held his own, and Hall went into a 
tailspin.  
</P>
<P>
 Far more controversial than the remarks about Bush was the visit to Hall's 
show this year by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whose views have 
stirred concern among whites, gays and Jews. It was not that Hall should have 
been prevented from doing the program, but, rather, that once again he turned 
out to be a pushover interviewer at an inappropriate moment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's exit in May will, of course, open the door for other wanna-be 
late-night hosts. But with the fallout rate this season -- including upper-tier 
names such as Chase and Hall -- plus the disappointing showing of NBC's new 
Conan O'Brien series, it seems as if the witching hours, at the moment, belong 
strictly to Letterman and Leno, and to Ted Koppel on "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, late-night talk-show territory again is strictly the domain 
of white middle-age men. While Hall is black, isn't it about time to consider 
other emerging minorities as well for candidates? And are there no women out 
there deemed worthy of major national exposure as late-night entertainment and 
talk-show hosts? Just because Whoopi Goldberg's talk show went under is no 
reason to stop looking. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can deny that Hall has flair. The late-night gig is a tough one, as 
other failed, big-name entries in recent years -- Pat Sajak, Rick Dees and 
Dennis Miller -- can attest. 
</P>
<P>
 On his show, Hall did the usual celebrity interviews, but he also supported 
Nelson Mandela, celebrated Martin Luther King Day, talked with Magic Johnson 
about being HIV-positive, discussed music censorship with Ice-T and presented 
lesbian comedian Lea Delaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Like him or not as an entertainer, Hall did have a presence and an attitude. 
He shook things up. And he definitely was a major factor in television for five 
years before the fat lady sang.

'FOUR WEDDINGS': NO BRIDESMAID AT THE BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: THE COMBINATION OF 
GOOD TIMING AND AGGRESSIVE MARKETING HAVE WORKED IN FAVOR OF THE INDEPENDENT 
FILM, WHICH WAS NO. 1 FOR THE WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When "Four Weddings and a Funeral" opened last month, many people who follow 
independent movies expected it to be this year's "Enchanted April." That film, 
also a British comedy directed by Mike Newell, was one of the art-house 
successes of 1992, grossing more than $13.2 million in this country and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 But in just six weeks, the well-received "Four Weddings," variously described 
as "fluff with an edge" and "a multitiered confection," has already taken in 
more than $14 million and is expected to soar way beyond that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the movie has overcome its distributor's fears that, as producer 
Duncan Kenworthy put it, "no American male will go see a film that has wedding 
in the title." 
</P>
<P>
 It has also earned a footnote in the annals of movie history by becoming last 
weekend's box-office leader -- probably the first independent dramatic film to 
reach that benchmark, according to A.D. Murphy, box-office analyst for the 
Hollywood Reporter. (This is not an uncommon achievement for the type of 
low-budget independent product known in the industry as genre films, such as 
New Line Pictures' "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III," which last March 
captured the top box-office spot two weeks in a row.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Four Weddings," which takes place at a series of formal occasions, as spelled 
out in its title, tells the story of Charles (Hugh Grant), a young man who is 
often a best man but never a groom, and his infatuation with Carrie (Andie 
MacDowell), an uninhibited but somewhat mysterious American he meets at -- 
where else? -- a wedding. The film, made for $5 million, one-sixth the cost of 
the average Hollywood movie, was shot in a compressed 36 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's strong showing is attributed to several factors, including 
enthusiastic word of mouth, unusually aggressive marketing for a low-budget 
film, and, as is so often the case in the film industry, good timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Schwartz, president of Gramercy Pictures, the film's distributor, said 
the company first suspected "Four Weddings" might be a sleeper when it 
performed well at several movie theaters in Salt Lake City on the opening night 
of the Sundance Film Festival. The audience was mainly ordinary moviegoers, not 
festival participants. "It was sort of a middle-America situation, and (the 
film) played wonderfully," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 When further screenings also yielded raves, Gramercy, a fledgling joint 
venture between MCA (the parent company of Universal Pictures) and Polygram 
Filmed Entertainment, decided to take the risk of spending heavily on 
television advertising. Schwartz acknowledged that marketing costs have far 
exceeded production costs, but he declined to provide a specific figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he also moved up the film's opening date from April to March to 
capitalize on a vacuum in the marketplace. "We saw there was a hole in terms of 
similarly themed movies, and we took advantage of it," he said. "If there was 
another strong romantic comedy playing at the same time, we might not be doing 
(the business) we're doing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The film opened in limited release, jumping to 240 theaters after Easter -- 
the beginning of a traditionally slow season for movies -- and expanding to 721 
screens last weekend. The movie is expected to be in 900 theaters this weekend, 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the film in March also meant that Grant, who previously appeared in 
the James Ivory movies "Maurice" (1987) and last year's "The Remains of the 
Day," would be starring in three new films at once -- Roman Polanski's "Bitter 
Moon" and John Duigan's "Sirens," as well as "Four Weddings." "It might have 
helped initially," Schwartz conceded, "but now the movie is taking on its own 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's success in "Four Weddings" has apparently not been lost on Miramax, 
distributor of "Sirens." Grant is now being featured in print ads for "Sirens," 
along with co-star Elle MacPherson, although the two are not paired off in the 
movie. (A Miramax spokeswoman said any resemblance between the ads for "Four 
Weddings" and "Sirens" is a coincidence.) 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Kenworthy, in a telephone interview from London, cited Grant's appeal 
as a major reason the movie works. "He has a sort of playfulness which makes 
you think he means more than he seems to be saying, and when he furrows his 
brow and looks worried, you credit him with enormous intelligence," Kenworthy 
said. "People want to mother him or befriend him. He's got a sort of boyish 
quality, that English charm." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Bevan, co-executive producer of the film, said the key to the film's 
success stemmed from the collaboration between screenwriter Richard Curtis 
("The Tall Guy") and Newell. "Richard is a great, great comedic writer, but I 
think that Mike Newell, coming from a very strong dramatic background, went for 
the truth of every scene rather than the punch line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, there seems to be a simpler explanation for why "Four 
Weddings" -- much like last summer's "Sleepless in Seattle" -- is catching on. 
"There is a hunger for sophisticated, witty romantic comedy in the tradition of 
some of the Hollywood movies of the '30s and '40s," said film historian Stephen 
Farber. "There's an audience that's starved for literate escapist 
entertainment."

LAGUNA MUSEUM TAKES FIRST STEP IN DIRECTOR SEARCH; ART: THE BOARD ON TUESDAY 
WILL HEAR GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM IN-HOUSE COMMITTEE ON REPLACING THE 
FIRED CHARLES DESMARAIS. 
</P>

<P>
 General recommendations from a search committee for a new museum director will 
be made Tuesday to the Laguna Art Museum board, according to board president 
Teri Kennady. 
</P>
<P>
 The search committee, headed by board member Gerald Buck, is looking for a 
replacement for Charles Desmarais, who was fired by the board last month 
without cause, an action permitted by the terms of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennady steadfastly has refused to be more specific about the reasons for the 
board's dissatisfaction with Desmarais, other than citing a need for "more 
energy to be put into administration." Desmarais, who held the job for nearly 
six years, has acknowledged that his relationship with the board had been edgy 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past couple of weeks, letters and phone calls from people close to 
the museum have indicated that Desmarais and the board disagreed over how much 
time he should spend curating exhibits as opposed to raising money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Trudy Farrington, a former treasurer and president of the 
Affiliates, one of the museum's three former volunteer councils, said recently 
that all three groups folded during Desmarais' tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why work your rear end off and get no credit?" she asked. In her view, the 
next director should be "someone who's diplomatic and has a bedside manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennady said the museum would hire a search firm, yet to be determined, in 
May. The only attribute of the ideal candidate that she would state before next 
week's meeting is "prior experience as a museum director." So far, she said, 
the board has not decided such issues as the future director's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Desmarais is a top candidate for the director's post at the 
Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston.

STERN'S BACK ON TOP IN L.A. MARKET; RADIO: THE KLSX-FM TALK-SHOW HOST OUSTS THE 
KLAX-FM MORNING TEAM THAT BUMPED HIM LAST YEAR; KABC-AM DUO KEN MINYARD, ROGER 
BARKLEY TAKE SECOND.

 He may be a long shot in the race for governor of New York, but Howard Stern 
definitely is in command of Los Angeles morning radio, according to the latest 
Arbitron ratings survey released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ribald radio personality--heard on KLSX-FM (97.1) and in 15 other markets 
around the country--had been in the top spot early last year, then dropped to 
second place last summer, coming in behind Juan Carlos Hidalgo and El Peladillo 
(Jesus Garcia), the morning team on Spanish-radio phenomenon KLAX-FM (97.9). 
Stern had remained in second place until this survey, which covered the period 
from Jan. 6 through March 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Stern is (on top) in all languages," KLSX program director Ken Anthony 
said Tuesday. "We're very pleased to see Howard take outright No. 1 in 
mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Stern during the key morning period--when the radio audience is at 
its largest as people head for work and school--was the KABC-AM (790) team of 
Ken Minyard and Roger Barkley, with KLAX's Hidalgo and Garcia in third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the morning drop, KLAX retains its almost 2-year-old lead for the full 
broadcast day, attracting, on average, 5.6% of the audience over the age of 12. 
With its upbeat format of banda and ranchera music and its broad appeal to 
young, middle-aged and older Latinos, KLAX has established itself as the most 
successful Spanish-language station in Los Angeles history and the first 
Spanish station ever to take the lead and keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 10 stations overall remained very similar to the last survey period, 
with the notable exception of all-talk KABC, which jumped from 11th place to a 
tie for fifth.  
</P>
<P>
 Two stations tied for second place: KOST-FM (103.5)--which before the advent 
of KLAX had been coasting in the top spot--and hip-hop station KPWR-FM (105.9), 
which evidently was not hurt by its decision earlier this year to drop some 
popular rap songs that station executives felt had derogatory or offensive 
lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk station KFI-AM (640) came in fourth overall, followed by competitor KABC 
in a tie with alternative rock station KROQ-FM (106.7). 
</P>
<P>
 KIIS-FM (102.7) and AM (1150) dropped to seventh overall and its morning show 
starring Rick Dees was in fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other noteworthy ratings jumps involved the stations that tied for 11th 
place: Spanish rock station KLVE-FM (107.5), which in the previous three months 
had been 17th, and KCBS-FM (93.1), which changed its format last September from 
a broad range of oldies to "all rock 'n' roll oldies" and previously was 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a decade, KCBS (formerly KODJ-FM and KNX-FM) had appeared to be 
doomed with low ratings, but the station's luck has turned around with the 
retooling of its format. KCBS challenged and beat classic rock station KLSX 
(97.1)--which dropped from seventh to 14th place, despite the ascendancy of 
Stern--and also edged out veteran rock station KLOS-FM (95.5), now in the 16th 
spot. KLOS has experienced a dramatic drop in the past year, having been in 
seventh place last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 KLOS' morning team of Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps--who had been in the No. 
1 spot for several years before Stern and KLAX came on the scene--were in fifth 
place. Radio Ratings

TV RATINGS; CBS, 'HOME IMPROVEMENT' ARE SEASON'S CHAMPIONS

 In the final week of the so-called "official" prime-time season, "Home 
Improvement" and CBS finished right where they have been for most of the year: 
on top. "Home Improvement," the 3-year-old ABC sitcom starring Tim Allen and 
Patricia Richardson, was the week's and the season's most popular series, while 
CBS was the No. 1 network for the week and the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime-time season championship was CBS' third in a row. The network also 
won the season in daytime and late-night--the first time, CBS said, that a 
network had for the 30-week season, captured such a Triple Crown.  
</P>
<P>
 ABC finished second for the season and boasted that the performance of its new 
programs was the best of any network since 1979-80, with five new series among 
the Top 25: "Grace Under Fire," "NYPD Blue," "These Friends of Mine," "Thunder 
Alley" and "Turning Point." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, ABC and NBC were also pleased to note that they combined to attract 63% 
of the viewing audience during prime time, compared to 60% a year ago.

COURT HALTS SUITS AGAINST 3RD PARTIES IN STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE and ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, overturning nearly a half-century of legal precedents, 
ruled Tuesday that defrauded investors may not sue lawyers, accountants, 
bankers and other third parties who "aided and abetted" a stock scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-4 decision reinterprets the landmark Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to 
limit liability to those who directly perpetrated a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise decision, unless reversed by Congress, will make it virtually 
impossible in many instances for defrauded investors to recover significant 
sums of money when they have been cheated by a deceptive investment scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the crooked promoter of the investment is penniless, having spent 
or squandered the funds gained through fraud. For example, California investors 
won a $1.5-billion judgment against former savings and loan mogul Charles H. 
Keating Jr., but it was uncollectible because he had no money left. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial recoveries have usually been obtained by lawsuits against others 
who have deep pockets, most often lawyers and accountants hired by the 
perpetrator of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very dark day. It means untold thousands of investors in cases 
around the country will lose their day in court," said Joseph Cotchett, a San 
Francisco lawyer who was the lead counsel for a class-action suit on behalf of 
23,000 California investors who purchased the bonds fraudulently sold by 
Keating's American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors received $260 million from lawyers, accountants, appraisers and 
others who worked as advisers to Keating. Although those settlements are not 
affected by Tuesday's decision, the Supreme Court ruling would make it almost 
impossible to effectively pursue future cases in federal court, Cotchett said. 
Neither plaintiffs' nor defense lawyers believe that the decision will end most 
pending litigation, though it will likely cause numerous cases on appeal to be 
sent back to lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers will have to sort out case-by-case whether professionals participated 
in frauds and are still liable or whether they will be dropped from pending 
suits because they were so-called secondary wrongdoers as aiders and abettors 
under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in two years that the high court has moved to shield 
accountants, lawyers and investment bankers from damage verdicts in cases of 
massive fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, on a 7-2 vote, the high court said defrauded investors cannot bring 
a civil anti-racketeering suit against outside advisers on the theory that the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, known as RICO, applies only 
to people who are involved in the "operation or management" of a fraudulent 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most securities fraud claims are filed under the Securities Exchange 
Act. In the wake of the stock market crash of 1929, Congress made it unlawful 
"for any person, directly or indirectly . . . to use or employ, in connection 
with the purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive 
device," such as a misleading stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Private investors were given the right to sue to seek monetary recoveries. 
Without further guidance from Congress, securities law has been developed 
almost entirely in the lower federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In decisions dating from the mid-1940s, judges have upheld private lawsuits 
against not only the principal parties in a failed investment scheme, but also 
those who aided and abetted the schemes. For example, an accountant who 
endorsed a misleading prospectus or an appraiser who put a phony value on 
property could be sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, judges said it was important to demand that all those who knowingly 
participated in a fraudulent scheme join in paying damages to those who were 
cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 This wide-net approach to securities law gained public attention in the late 
1980s when hundreds of lawsuits were filed against lawyers, accountants and 
bankers after the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry. Plaintiffs said 
these white-collar professionals played key roles in the failure of the 
institutions and should pay for the losses they caused. 
</P>
<P>
 But the leaders of accounting and law firms decried this "explosion" of 
litigation. They said they should not be handed a "virtually limitless 
liability" simply because they have deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, their complaints found a sympathetic ear at the high court. Last 
year, after squelching the civil RICO suits against accountants and lawyers, 
the justices agreed to hear an obscure case involving $15 million in housing 
bonds sold by a Denver bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rule on the issue raised in the appeal, the justices said they 
wanted to consider whether the 1934 law creates "an implied private right to 
action for aiding and abetting violations," as everyone had assumed for 
decades. The answer Tuesday was "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it covers only those who engage in 
manipulation or deception, not those who "aid" or "abet" their efforts. Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia 
and Clarence Thomas joined the opinion in Central Bank of Denver vs. First 
Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens faulted the majority for conservative 
"activism" by first rewriting an appeal and then using it to overturn decades 
of settled law. "We should leave it to Congress to alter" the law if 
legislators disagree with the prevailing legal standard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Tuesday's decision was welcomed by the securities industry 
and the accounting profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors "will have their day in court, but they will have to sue wrongdoers, 
not simply people who have insurers or a large bank account," said Theodore B. 
Olson, who represents the Securities Industry Assn. "Many times the accountants 
or underwriters are named in the suits when they really did not engage in the 
practice. But they are listed simply because they are the deep pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants applauded the ruling as 
"important progress in curbing abuses of the federal securities laws."

 Lawyers who represent defrauded investors say they will be able to seek 
damages from accountants and lawyers only if they can show they played a 
principal role in the scheme.

 "In some cases, they are the primary violators. But this is a major change in 
the law. It adds a real hurdle," said Jonathan Cuneo, general counsel for the 
National Assn. of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates the need for Congress to strengthen the law to protect 
investors," he added.

COLUMN ONE; HIMALAYAN HUNT FOR HOLY HEIR; SPURRED BY A CRYPTIC NOTE AND DUELING 
PROPHECIES, MEMBERS OF A TIBETAN BUDDHIST SECT ARE SPARRING OVER WHICH OF TWO 
BOYS IS THEIR REINCARNATED LEADER. THERE ARE RUMORS OF FRAUD -- EVEN MURDER.

 The mystery is as deep, and perhaps as impenetrable, as the snows of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 Its genesis was a dirty, sweat-stained piece of paper hidden for almost a 
decade. In rune-like handwriting and free verse, the riddle told believers 
where to find their reincarnated leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The place: where the "divine thunder" peals. The birth date: the year of "the 
one used for the earth." Identifying characteristics: born to a father named 
Dondrup and a mother named Lolaga, to the "miraculous, far-reaching sound of 
the white one." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of that bizarre trail of hints, somewhere in the high, bleak 
plateaus of eastern Tibet, they would find the holy child. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreement over the meaning of such Delphic clues -- along with bickering 
over whether the note itself is a forgery -- has created an unprecedented split 
between normally gentle Tibetans whose Karma Kagyu order of Buddhism reveres a 
high lama who wears a black hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The purity of the Karma Kagyu, one of the four main subgroups of Tibetan 
Buddhism, is at issue. But so, perhaps, is an unholy thirst for money and 
power. Murder may have been committed. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret services of the Chinese government could even be involved, at work 
to further suppress the people of Tibet, who have lived under Beijing's boot 
since the People's Liberation Army occupied their Himalayan peaks and valleys 
in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in nearly nine centuries, two rival boys have been produced 
to wear the bejeweled crown of blue-black brocade that distinguishes the leader 
of the Karma Kagyu order. High-ranking lamas (monks) disagree about which child 
is their reborn master, or karmapa.  
</P>
<P>
 One, an 8-year-old named Ugyen Trinlay Dorji, is in Tibet. The other, Tenzin 
Chentse, a 10-year-old, was brought to New Delhi, a center of Tibetan exile 
life, and kept under guard in a room filled with chocolates, Wrigley's gum, 
videos of "Alice in Wonderland" and "Tom and Jerry" and a big brown teddy bear. 
His supporters say he has been moved to a location they will not reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 To present Ugyen Trinlay Dorji's case to the world, his monastic champions 
rented a ballroom at one of Delhi's ritziest hotels early this month for a news 
conference and engaged a public relations professional who normally handles 
clients such as Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 For those monks in their burgundy robes, some of whom have the shaved heads 
and beefy bodies of professional wrestlers, the villain of the story is the 
chief promoter of the competing child -- and a reborn traitor from Tibet's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in one thing as Buddhists: This is our karma (fate), the karma of 
everyone involved," said Tai Situ Rinpoche, who is himself venerated as the 
12th incarnation of a distinguished lama. "But karma doesn't mean we have to 
give in." 
</P>
<P>
 When three busloads of people pulled up last month outside a Buddhist temple 
in New Delhi to harass worshipers at a pomp-filled welcoming ceremony for the 
rival Tenzin Chentse, stones and bottles flew. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1110, Tibetan Buddhists say, the karmapa has been reborn in an unbroken 
string. His lineage is a full three centuries older than that even of the Dalai 
Lama, the spiritual leader of all Tibetans. 
</P>
<P>
 The karmapa claims the allegiance of about 20% of Tibetans, but also of a 
third to half of the Buddhists in neighboring Nepal, Bhutan and the Indian 
areas of Sikkim and Ladakh. The Karma Kagyu seat had been at the Tsurphu 
monastery in Tibet, but after the Communist Chinese occupation, its leaders 
fled and established their headquarters at Rumtek in Sikkim, which was a 
princely state before becoming part of India. 
</P>
<P>
 The order has nearly 200 monasteries in Tibet (many in ruins), plus 30 in 
India and Nepal and more than 200 meditation centers worldwide. It claims 
100,000 foreign followers in Southeast Asia, Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The succession drama began when the exiled 16th karmapa died of cancer in a 
small Chicago-area hospital on Nov. 5, 1981, at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
 Where and how would he reincarnate himself? The followers waited impatiently. 
Over the centuries, it had been customary for the karmapas to leave clues in 
letters that would lead believers to their rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the 16th karmapa done the same? On March 22, 1992, Tai Situ Rinpoche, one 
of his four regents, presented thrilling proof that he had. A yellow brocade 
talisman, two inches square, that the karmapa had given him as a gift in a 
Calcutta hotel 10 months before he died contained the dirty, creased paper 
bearing the enigmatic clues, Tai Situ announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tai Situ says that on presenting the talisman to him, the 16th karmapa said, 
"It will confer great benefit." For years, he asserted, he wore the amulet 
around his neck and on his belt before he finally realized the import of the 
karmapa 's words and opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the strange clues, a search party set off from India. Linking up 
with monks from Tsurphu in Tibet, the searchers examined reports of unusual 
births as well as the claims of reincarnation that proliferate after the death 
of a karmapa.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, the monks' travels led them to the village of Bakor in the 
eastern Tibetan district of Lhatog ("thunder god"). 
</P>
<P>
 There, a son had been born to a nomadic shepherd named Karma Dondup Tashi and 
his wife, Loga -- names strikingly similar to those in the written clues -- on 
June 26, 1985, the Tibetan Year of the Wood Ox. Just before the birth, the 
lamas were told, a beautiful songbird perched on the pole of the tent and burst 
into melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, in light of the written hints of thunder and other details, this was 
the karmapa. Tai Situ, who had remained in India, dispatched a happy fax to the 
Dalai Lama, who was traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 The excited searchers took the boy, Apo Gaga, to the Tsurphu monastery, where 
several aged monks recognized him as their reincarnated master. Big-eyed and 
unusually bright, Apo Gaga was so special that he had been invited by another 
monastery to become a monk at age 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalai Lama, who had experienced a vision in which he saw a valley like the 
one where the child was born, gave his assent, and the red-cheeked boy, renamed 
Ugyen Trinlay Dorji, was enthroned as 17th karmapa in Tsurphu on Sept. 27, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the karmapa came to the window, the crowd went into an absolute frenzy 
of veneration," wrote Brian Golden, a journalist who attended the ceremony. 
"All hands were immediately pressed together in a gesture of supplication, and 
the chanting of mantras permeated the air. Hundreds of scarves . . . of white, 
yellow and orange were thrown in the direction of the karmapa, covering 
everything at the front of the monastery." 
</P>
<P>
 When the boy waved and threw handfuls of rice, joyful Tibetans dove to the 
ground to grab a few of the blessed grains. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed wondrous. But was it? 
</P>
<P>
 Another regent, Shamar Rinpoche ( rinpoche is a title meaning precious one ) 
doesn't think so. He calls the whole chain of events that began with the 
letter's discovery a sham. To the dismay of Tai Situ and some other high lamas, 
Shamar, a nephew of the late karmapa, spearheaded his own search for a 
successor. He found Tenzin Chentse, born in May, 1983, in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 3, this boy is said to have told his surprised parents, "Tsurphu was my 
monastery," to have described its golden roof and to have recited an ancient 
Buddhist scripture as though recalling it from memory. It is he who should 
rightfully wear the black hat, Shamar maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the clues couched in verse? A fraud, charges 50-year-old Topgya 
Yulgyal, another nephew of the late karmapa and a cousin of Shamar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with the 16th karmapa since age 11," he said. "I knew his handwriting. 
So the moment I saw this writing (on Tai Situ's paper) I knew it was a 
forgery." 
</P>
<P>
 To give his camp's version of events, Yulgyal, dressed in a Western-style 
button-down shirt, met an American journalist at the New Delhi temple that was 
the site of the stone-throwing melee last month. In a droning buzz, monks 
inside the temple intoned their evening prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was peaceful, a reminder of the blissful calm that leads many 
Westerners to Buddhism. Yet before entering, visitors were frisked and screened 
with a metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one reason for this is power, and the other is money," Yulgyal said 
when asked why the dispute had broken out over the Karma Kagyu leadership. "But 
the main thing here is politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. The Chinese Communists dealt brutally with Tibetan religion. Before 
China's occupation of the "land of snows," prayer flags flew from homes and 
mountaintops, and monasteries flourished. The Chinese closed the temples, 
destroyed religious artifacts and writings and tore down the prayer flags. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, under intense scrutiny for its human rights practices, China has been 
trying to project a more tolerant image. Authorities in Beijing have decided 
that Ugyen Trinlay Dorji -- the boy the Dalai Lama himself recognizes -- is 
entitled to call himself the 17th karmapa. The officially atheistic press hails 
him as a "living Buddha." 
</P>
<P>
 For Yulgyal, that is evidence of the hand of his homeland's oppressors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all "dirty politics in the disguise of holy dharma (law)," Shamar summed 
up. (And one American Buddhist who knows the major players remembers Shamar, 
who has a famously hot temper, reading Machiavelli's "The Prince.") 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, there may be no perfectly clean hands in this saga. 
That is because all four regents, Tai Situ and Shamar included, seem to have 
willingly colluded in a lie in 1986. In February of that year, they announced 
that a packet containing letters written by the deceased karmapa had been 
found. Tibetans exulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it doesn't exist," Tai Situ, 39, now acknowledges, smiling as he 
peers through his metal-rimmed glasses. The regents, he says, invented the 
story because they were under pressure by believers to find their reborn 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Another regent was supposed to lead the search party that went to Tibet in 
1992. But a few days before the scheduled departure, he was killed when a new 
BMW he was riding in swerved and hit a tree. Some lamas, Tai Situ included, 
doubt it was an accident, because the engine, he says, was found 150 feet from 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 There was at least one other odd death. The general secretary of Rumtek 
monastery in Sikkim was invited to lunch by Shamar's cousin, Yulgyal, and died 
mysteriously within minutes of returning home. Yulgyal succeeded the dead man 
as head of operations and business affairs at the monastery, which he says 
contains treasures worth "millions." He was later voted out. 
</P>
<P>
 What is especially ironic about the quarrel for the black hat is that its 
origins lie in a Tibetan institution that some scholars believe was developed 
expressly to eliminate rivalries of succession. 
</P>
<P>
 By transferring authority from one reincarnation to the next, those scholars 
say, monasteries were able to ensure continuity and prevent their vast holdings 
from being taken over or dissipated by rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a monk has gotten rich and has a well-developed monastery and a treasurer 
and a manager, the treasurer and manager can certainly keep their jobs if they 
find a boy to replace the old one," said Jeffrey Hopkins, director of the 
Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Virginia and author of 
books on Tibetan Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Tibetan version of an appeal to the Supreme Court, Tai Situ and his 
allies called on the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to intervene. On 
March 30, his secretariat reaffirmed the spiritual credentials of Ugyen Trinlay 
Dorji, the boy still in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the loose structure of Tibetan Buddhism, and the karmapa 's possession 
of a pedigree older than even the Dalai Lama's, the latter's intervention may 
not be enough to settle the issue. And what of karma, the core Buddhist concept 
that maintains that a person's actions determine his fate in the next state of 
existence? According to some lamas, the current dispute was foretold centuries 
ago, and is foreordained. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Tibetan Buddhists regard Shamar as the reincarnation of a lama who once 
sided with the king of Nepal to invade and sack their land two centuries ago. 
The early Shamar was so hated that his red crown was buried in the Tibetan 
capital of Lhasa, and searching for his reincarnations was forbidden. Only with 
the current bearer of the title was the lineage finally recognized again. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, and even stranger, is a prediction written in the 14th Century by the 
fifth karmapa. "From the north and the east, foreigners will invade, and Tibet 
will be encircled like a ring," he wrote. China's emperors will be deposed and 
others will rule in their place, and "machines made by foreigners will move 
through the skies." 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth karmapa wrote that at the end of the 16th karmapa's reign and the 
beginning of the 17th's, a "demonic being will appear," and "the karmapa 's 
doctrine will come close to destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 The evil lama's name would be Na-tha, a Sanskrit word that can be translated 
as protector , relative or nephew . 
</P>
<P>
 The last translation is not one Shamar Rinpoche or Topgya Yulgyal, nephews of 
the 16th karmapa, care for.

SERBS GRAB BACK HEAVY WEAPONS NEAR SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After pummeling the helpless town of Gorazde while a paralyzed world looked 
on, Bosnian Serb renegades grabbed back 18 heavy weapons from U.N. peacekeepers 
Tuesday in an ominous sign that the deadly bombardment of Sarajevo could resume 
at the rebels' whim. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastation in Gorazde carried on unhindered. The last few foreign relief 
workers trapped in the vanquished city reported scenes of suffering and 
destruction in the U.N. safe area abandoned to a brutal fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Four fieldworkers for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, 
huddled in a basement shelter with the last four U.N. soldiers in Gorazde, 
ventured above ground during a lull in the shelling and reported "a scene of 
desolation, debris everywhere and gaping holes in apartment buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 shells tore through the refugee-thronged city center in late 
morning, the aid agency workers told colleagues here, noting that they saw 
about a dozen bodies strewn on the pavement outside one shelter that took a 
direct hit. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington on Tuesday, the Clinton Administration said it will seek 
European and Russian support for new military and diplomatic pressure against 
Bosnian Serb forces, including wider air strikes against military targets and 
stiffer economic sanctions against their allies in Belgrade, the Serbian and 
Yugoslav capital. But it remained unclear whether new threats and economic 
measures would induce the Serbs to forfeit territory won by force and return to 
the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a sharply worded statement 
warning the Bosnian Serbs to keep their promises to Russia and halt the assault 
on Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia -- which has resisted stronger Western action in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- 
has been a key Serbian ally and had won what appeared to be a major foreign 
policy coup for itself by temporarily achieving some advances in the Balkan 
peace process. The latest Bosnian Serb outburst has become a major 
embarrassment for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gorazde, the rebel attack persisted Tuesday despite another promise by 
Bosnian Serb leaders in nearby Pale to hold fire and allow deployment of a 
small peacekeeping force into the ravaged enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 As artillery shells rained down on the defeated Muslim enclave at the rate of 
more than one per minute, the roof was blown off the city's hospital; that 
facility is packed with the wounded from 20 days of siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian nationalists who have vanquished Gorazde by cinching an artillery 
noose and forcing tens of thousands of inhabitants into the center relentlessly 
fired on the penned-in civilians in an assault U.N. officers here condemned as 
serving no imaginable military purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sniper fire has increased and is contributing to the general air of panic," 
said U.N. Protection Force spokesman Maj. Rob Annink. 
</P>
<P>
 Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, had assured the U.N. 
civilian affairs chief a day earlier that his forces would abide by an 
agreement that was already vastly scaled back from previous U.N. proposals for 
helping Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have allowed Bosnian Serb-escorted aid convoys and the deployment of 
about 260 U.N. troops after a cease-fire that never materialized, Annink said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a scrap of paper and its worth was only that of the people who 
agreed to it," he said of the latest unfulfilled promise. "The other side does 
not keep to its word." 
</P>
<P>
 Evacuations to relieve the crowded, starving enclave cannot be carried out 
until the Bosnian Serbs stop attacking the people whom relief agencies want to 
remove for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, whose campaign for a Greater Serbia has lately careened out of any 
outside power's control, still hold more than 100 U.N. troops hostage and have 
been moving them around among secret locations in an apparent plot to use the 
peacekeepers as human shields against further air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the captives are believed to be held at the rebel barracks at nearby 
Lukavica, where about 50 armed Serbs stormed a U.N. weapons collection site 
Tuesday and intimidated French troops into relinquishing stored weapons, 
according to Lt. Col. Richard Pernod. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 French troops were on duty when the rebels showed up in force to 
demand the return of their weapons, said Cmdr. Eric Chaperon. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said three days earlier, after Serbs moved a tank to another 
weapons collection site to demand its arsenal, that the peacekeepers were under 
orders to use force to prevent Serbs from seizing the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were simply overrun," Chaperon told journalists. "If they had fired, it 
would have been a massacre." 
</P>
<P>
 By grabbing the antiaircraft guns that were warehoused in February under the 
NATO ultimatum, the Serbs have sent a warning that a renewed drive to defeat 
Sarajevo could begin at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also defiantly flouted the standing North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization order for punitive air strikes against any heavy weaponry within a 
12-mile radius of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizures represented another escalation of the campaign of harassment and 
humiliation of U.N. forces conducted by rebels who have been dangerously 
emboldened by the peacekeeping mission's reluctance to stop the savagery 
inflicted on Gorazde. The Serbian nationalists appear to be gambling that NATO 
also lacks the stomach to take them on. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports late Tuesday that the Bosnian Serbs may have relented some 
in their seizures of guns and detentions of U.N. personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters news service quoted Chaperon as saying that the Bosnian Serbs had 
returned many of the guns and pledged to free many of the detained U.N. teams. 
There were few details, and the report could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bosnian Serbs retaliated for token NATO air strikes by kidnaping 
U.N. troops, mining and blockading U.N. patrol posts and refusing to talk to 
officials of the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the civilian chief of the mission, U.N. special representative Yasushi 
Akashi, refused to authorize air strikes after British soldiers were 
deliberately targeted by the Serbs and one was killed, the rebels have stepped 
up their harassment and intensified attacks on Gorazde and in other battle 
zones along Bosnia's nearly 700 miles of active front lines.

KING GETS AWARD OF $3.8 MILLION; TRIAL: THE CITY WILL PAY COMPENSATORY DAMAGES 
TO COVER MEDICAL EXPENSES AND LOST INCOME FROM 1991 POLICE BEATING. JURY WILL 
NEXT CONSIDER PUNITIVE AMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three years after the 1991 beating that made him a national symbol of police 
brutality, Rodney G. King on Tuesday was awarded more than $3.8 million in 
damages from the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal court jury award, which came on the fourth day of deliberations, 
was substantially less than the $15 million King's lawyers had sought, but well 
above the $800,000 the city had offered initially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting, and I was hopeful, that Mr. King's recovery would be greater 
than the $3.8 million," said Milton Grimes, King's attorney. "But I'm not 
dissatisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan had little comment about the amount, except to say that 
"the City Council will now review the jury's award and study the city's 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that (the jurors) have acted, we can hopefully put this chapter behind 
us," Riordan added. 
</P>
<P>
 King was not in the courtroom for the reading of the verdict, although his 
lawyer said he was "somewhat pleased" with the award. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, King had graphically described the pain and humiliation he 
felt on the night he was beaten by Los Angeles police officers in the San 
Fernando Valley, telling jurors: "I felt like I had been raped. . . . I felt 
like a cow that was waiting to be slaughtered, just like a piece of meat." 
</P>
<P>
 The compensatory damages awarded are intended to pay King's medical expenses 
and lost income -- for which only the city was held liable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the verdict, some questioned whether the award had been too 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Rodney King's injuries are worth $3.8 million. I don't think 
Rodney King is worth $3.8 million in terms of his ability to make that much 
money in his lifetime," said former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who resigned 
under pressure after 1992 riots that followed not guilty verdicts in the first 
trial of four officers accused in the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the San Fernando Valley, said: "Here's 
somebody who was fleeing the law. . . . I wouldn't have voted a nickel for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members said they doubt the city will appeal the case, and 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the City Council's Finance and Revenue 
Committee, who two years ago blocked efforts to settle the case for $5.9 
million, said he was frankly relieved that the jury had not been more generous. 
</P>
<P>
 "All in all, while I would have preferred a lower verdict, I think, to be 
candid with you, I was fearing a much higher verdict," Yaroslavsky said. "Any 
time you go to a jury . . . you're rolling the dice with the taxpayers' money. 
We could never have settled this case at $3.8 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said King's attorneys had been unwilling to settle for that 
amount. But with court costs and punitive damages yet to be determined, the 
city could end up paying substantially more. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, legal scholars and civil rights advocates hailed the award -- which 
for reasons that remain unclear was made in the exact amount of $3,816,535.45. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a verdict well within reason," said Loyola University law 
professor and former federal prosecutor Laurie L. Levinson. "It sounds like 
what the jury did -- because the number was down to the penny -- was calculated 
very specifically (as) the actual damages suffered by King." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, added: "It shows the jury has rejected the 
argument that King is not permanently injured and accurately and 
compassionately reflects the pain and suffering from the beating itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The awarding of the compensatory damages in King's case ends the first of two 
phases of the civil trial. In the second, which will begin Thursday, the jury 
is to determine punitive damages and try to assign blame to individual 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way of knowing how much money -- if any -- the jury will award in 
this phase, which is aimed at punishing individuals who contributed to the 
violation of King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for King told U.S. District Judge John G. Davies that they plan to 
call 31 witnesses during the punitive damages phase, and defense attorneys 
estimate that they will put 45 people on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen individual defendants have been named, including Gates and the four 
former Los Angeles police officers originally charged in King's case -- Stacey 
C. Koon, Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno. All are 
current or former city employees, and on Tuesday, City Council members 
expressed concern about whether taxpayers should pick up the tab if damages are 
assessed against the individual officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Punitive damages may end up being substantial," Councilman Nate Holden said. 
"I'm not prepared to say I'm going to cut a guy loose and let him lose 
everything. . . . As a practice, the city has always indemnified employees." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said it would teach a lesson to rogue 
officers if the city forced them to take financial responsibility for their 
misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, he said, should "bear responsibility for their own behavior rather 
than passing it on against taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The civil trial is the third court proceeding since the March 3, 1991, beating 
was caught on videotape and broadcast on television, setting the stage for the 
worst urban riots in a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial, a state criminal proceeding against the four officers charged 
in the case, ended with not guilty verdicts on all but one count -- in which a 
mistrial was declared -- in April, 1992. The verdicts, returned by a Simi 
Valley jury, touched off rioting that lasted three days and left at least 52 
people dead in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, a federal civil rights trial of the same officers resulted in 
the convictions of two of them. Koon and Powell are serving 30-month sentences 
for violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, for the third April in as many years, the case was before a jury 
again, with a new set of jurors asked to place a dollar value on King's 
injuries, pain, suffering and loss of employment potential. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing arguments, his lawyers argued for the $15 million; the city argued 
that $800,000 was a fairer amount. But earlier, King had offered to settle for 
$9.6 million. Negotiations stalled after the city countered that offer with 
$1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the three-week trial, the city has admitted liability, but its 
lawyers and medical experts sought to downplay King's injuries and any 
permanent impairment or brain damage they might have caused. Meanwhile, the 
city emphasized King's troubled past, eliciting testimony about a robbery 
conviction, his use of alcohol and drugs and his involvement with a 
transvestite prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers, meanwhile, portrayed him as the victim of a racist police 
force, a man who was brutally beaten for no reason other than that he was 
black. In fact, during King's testimony -- the most graphic account yet from 
the 29-year-old man -- he told the jury that he could hear the police chanting 
racial epithets as they kicked him and struck him with their batons. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether racial epithets were uttered has been hotly disputed. 
Shortly after his arrest in 1991, King said he did not believe that the beating 
was racially motivated. Later, however, he said he had heard officers make 
racially derogatory remarks, and blamed his inconsistency on memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 King testified that on the night of the beating, he had been celebrating with 
friends. Having been recently released from prison, where he had served time 
for robbery, King said he was feeling proud that night because he had managed 
to win back his job with a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had too much to drink, he told the jury, and when he saw police in his 
rearview mirror, he panicked. He was afraid, he said, that he would be sent 
back to prison and decided to make a run for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police had testified that King led officers on a long, high-speed car 
chase, King said that he tried to elude officers only for about 12 blocks 
before deciding it made little sense to run. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that after stopping, he did not resist and tried to comply with 
officers' commands, adding that he did not strike out or attack the officers 
who beat him, acting only in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he said, he followed orders to lie down on the pavement, but when 
he did, an officer struck him with his baton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had lost half my face," he said, but he told the officer that 
he "felt fine" because he "didn't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing 
that it really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The beating -- which police defended by noting that, in their eyes, King was a 
violent, defiant suspect who had not been searched for a weapon -- was captured 
on videotape by a resident of an apartment building across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts were aired around the world, serving as a flash point for racial 
tensions as the grainy image of the cowering King was shown to billions of 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear my bones crunching every time the baton hit me," King testified. 
"It sounded like throwing an egg and hearing the shell crack. . . . I was just 
so scared. I felt like I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 King's medical experts said his injuries have left him with permanent brain 
damage, chronic headaches and an inability to focus his thoughts or 
concentrate. Meanwhile, his lawyers said, his notoriety has made him fearful 
and so paranoid that he wears a bulletproof vest on the rare occasions when he 
ventures out in public. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much of the jury award King will end up keeping. Although he 
is expected to retain the bulk of the money, one of his former lawyers, Steven 
Lerman, has a lien against his judgment for $780,000 worth of unpaid legal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, King has nine attorneys on his current legal team, none of whom have 
been paid. Grimes, who took over the case when Lerman was fired in 1992, also 
has been lending King an estimated $5,000 to $10,000 a month to help him meet 
his living expenses during the court proceedings. King will almost certainly be 
expected to repay those expenses from his award. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal fees, however, will not necessarily come out of King's pocket. In 
police brutality cases, attorneys may apply to the judge at the trial's end to 
have defendants pay fees and court costs. That means the city of Los Angeles 
may eventually have to pay King's lawyers, in addition to King.

ZULU LEADERS AGREE TO JOIN S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning last-minute reversal, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi and 
the Zulu king finally agreed Tuesday to drop their boycott of next week's 
historic all-race elections, sharply reducing fears of widespread political 
bloodshed during the birth of democracy here. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected end to the impasse brings the leaders of South Africa's largest 
ethnic group, and the last major party of political holdouts, into the contest 
only a week before voters are expected to elect the country's first black-led 
government. Only fringe groups of far-right whites now remain outside the 
democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement is a leap forward for peace, reconciliation, nation building 
and an inclusive election process," said African National Congress President 
Nelson Mandela, who is expected to be elected the country's first black 
president. He spoke at a crowded news conference at the Capitol with Buthelezi 
and President Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, who appeared ecstatic at the end of two days of intensive, 
closed-door talks, concurred. "It is my deepest hope that this agreement will 
bring to an end the violence in South Africa," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu followers of Buthelezi and Mandela have fought an undeclared war for a 
decade, and their brutal clashes have killed a majority of the estimated 15,000 
victims of South Africa's horrific political violence in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloodletting has escalated in recent weeks, despite the March 31 
declaration of a state of emergency in Natal province, home of most of the 
Zulus. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the militant boycott, which effectively began when Buthelezi 
stormed out of constitutional talks last June, is likely to ease soaring 
election-related violence and intimidation, as well as to console nervous 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But deep enmities and competition over everything from drugs to cattle have 
always been part of the Zulu fights and are unlikely to disappear now. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi said he had finally consented to contesting the election "to avoid a 
great deal more bloodshed and carnage." 
</P>
<P>
 But political analysts said Buthelezi had, as one Western diplomat put it, 
"finally recognized reality. They were about to lose everything. So they took 
the best deal they could get." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has not actively campaigned, it has 
prepared posters and other campaign materials. Despite the dwindling time, 
analysts in Natal expect Inkatha to win a sizable share of seats in the 
provincial assembly, although the ANC will almost certainly win a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 As the head of his ticket, Buthelezi also is guaranteed a place in the 
national Parliament and could well win enough votes -- 5% of the total is 
required -- for a Cabinet seat in the ANC-led government of national unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi still complained that both he and his party are "disadvantaged." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been given an impossible task," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough signified a triumph for Mandela and De Klerk, the two men 
most responsible for leading this deeply divided country in the transformation 
from apartheid to black majority rule without detouring into all-out race war. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked a surrender by Buthelezi after months of bluster, brinkmanship and 
bellicose threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal actually gives him and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, his nephew, 
less than they were offered by Mandela and De Klerk during an unsuccessful 
peace summit nearly two weeks ago at a game lodge in Kruger National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi had repeatedly vowed to keep Inkatha out of the race unless the 
balloting was postponed and the interim constitution amended to enshrine the 
powers of the king and provide virtual autonomy to Buthelezi's power base in 
the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu. The homeland will be abolished under the new 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The final three-page accord commits Inkatha to joining the April 26-28 
national and regional elections and to doing "everything in their power to 
ensure free and fair elections." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the ANC and government made only one major concession. They 
agreed to call the outgoing all-white Parliament into special session on Monday 
-- the day before polls open -- to amend two acts of the post-apartheid 
constitution to recognize "the institution, role, authority and status of a 
traditional monarch." 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments are less than were offered at the summit, where the Zulu king 
was also promised his own royal constabulary force, an official coronation, a 
representative in the regional assembly and other inducements. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela and De Klerk also agreed to reconvene international mediation, if 
necessary, after the elections to consider "any outstanding issues" regarding 
the Zulu king and the constitution. A mediation team led by former Secretary of 
State Henry A. Kissinger quit last week after only two days when Buthelezi 
refused to back off from his demand that the elections be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Johann Kriegler, head of the Independent Electoral Commission, the 
watchdog group that is overseeing the vote, told a separate news conference in 
Johannesburg that the country's 80 million national and provincial ballots will 
not be reprinted. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, adhesive strips with Inkatha's name and logo and color 
pictures of Buthelezi will be stuck at the bottom of each ballot, in the same 
size and style as the designations of the 26 other parties. "The printing of 
stickers will start tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler said 700 extra polling booths will be opened, more election staff 
will be hired and manuals and procedures will be amended. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement Tuesday, Buthelezi credited the secret diplomacy of a 
Kenyan politician, Prof. Washington Aggrey Jalang'o Okumu. 
</P>
<P>
 Okumu, who arrived last week to assist the Kissinger mission, stayed on when 
the other mediators left and called Buthelezi, a friend of two decades, to 
arrange a meeting before the Zulu leader flew home to KwaZulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi said he had to leave the airport before Okumu arrived but that the 
plane was forced to turn back for a mechanical problem shortly after takeoff. 
"It was as though God had prevented me from leaving," Buthelezi said. "I'll 
never forget him waiting for me at the airport, larger than life." 
</P>
<P>
 Okumu then reopened talks as a secret intermediary, shuttling messages and 
arranging phone calls among Buthelezi, Mandela and De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton praised the breakthrough as demonstrating 
"great courage and a capacity to compromise."

AFTER TRAGEDY, TRAIN CREW RETURNS TO NEW NIGHTMARE; RAILROADING: NEAR SPOT 
WHERE BUENA PARK YOUTH DIED IN DAREDEVIL GAME, ANOTHER STANDS ON TRACKS, 
ESCAPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Conductor Michael Lepker was peering out the window of a 200-ton locomotive 
early Easter Sunday when an 18-year-old thrill-seeker standing precariously 
near the tracks suddenly stumbled into the path of the thundering freight 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Brakeman Brian Horgan frantically engaged the emergency system, but it was too 
late to stop the unforgiving mass of moving steel. Ryan Adam Pennington of 
Buena Park was killed instantly. His bewildered parents were left to mourn the 
loss of their youngest son, who had apparently lined up with four friends on a 
railroad trestle, waiting to feel the train's windy wake before his fatal 
misstep. 
</P>
<P>
 The train's crew members quietly went on medical leave, haunted by recurring 
flashbacks, self-recriminations and depression. They began receiving counseling 
from a trauma psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, two weeks and two days after the incident on April 3, they felt 
emotionally strong enough to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But as their 70-car freight train roared through Buena Park at about 2:45 a.m. 
on their first day back on the job, they were struck by a terrifying sense of 
deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred feet away, a young man not much older than Pennington stood 
planted in the middle of the railroad tracks, staring down the approaching 
locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 They sounded the horn. They trained a blinding spotlight on the tracks. All to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Horgan was forced to activate the emergency brakes. An 
ear-splitting screech echoed in the darkness as the 3,100-ton train ground 
8,000 feet to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The man held firm until the train, traveling about 32 m.p.h., was within 40 
feet of him. Then, crew members later said, he darted out of its path in the 
nick of time, escaping after being briefly detained. It's not known why he 
faced down the train. 
</P>
<P>
 After the near miss, crew members who had struggled to overcome their 
apprehension about climbing back aboard a train were back to square one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so upset we couldn't even finish the trip," Lepker, 38, of Barstow 
said afterward. "I thought, 'It's the same thing we ran into when Ryan 
Pennington was killed, only this time we missed. This is just insane. But what 
else can we do? We have families so we've got to work." 
</P>
<P>
 For five hours, he said, the train sat idle on the tracks. A Santa Fe van came 
to pick up the dazed crew members and ferry them home. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Lepker, the conductor's wife, expressed her anger Tuesday at the 
foolhardy youngsters who have turned her husband's life's dream into a living 
nightmare. Lepker worked in the railway yard for 17 years before becoming a 
conductor two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something really needs to be done to let these kids see what these guys have 
gone through and what this does to their families," she said. "This Easter has 
been absolute hell for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you what it's like to watch your husband go through this . . . 
he'd have nightmares, and didn't realize it," she said. "I'd have to wake him 
up. He's just a lot more unsure of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Lepker said her husband and his fellow crew members were excited about 
returning to work together for the first time since Pennington's death. But 
now, it's unclear when, if ever, they will work the train again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they're right back where they were," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said they will spend today, the day before their fourth wedding 
anniversary, with the trauma psychologist who has been treating Lepker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called the psychologist right away," she said. "He made it a double session 
and said he feels that it's probably going to be at least next Monday before he 
would want them to go back to work," Lepker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Railroad officials also expressed alarm Tuesday over the latest 
incident, which occurred 7.4 miles east of the site where Pennington was 
killed. According to spokesman Mike Martin, the young man stood in the path of 
the train as it was heading east from Los Angeles to Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was briefly detained by Lepker and other crew members who chased him 
down the tracks and apprehended him. But after a scuffle broke out, Martin 
said, the man got away. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Martin said, a witness told Santa Fe Railway police the identity of 
the man, and railway officials referred the case to the Orange County district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said 53 people were injured or killed in 1992 after they trespassed on 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are suicides, people playing chicken with trains -- we've seen people 
foolishly jogging down the middle of the tracks with a Walkman radio on," 
Martin said. "We've even seen people lay down between the rails to prove to 
friends at a party that a fast-moving train rolling over them won't kill them 
if they're between the rails, and they wind up dead."

SENATE TO RETIRE KELSO AT 4 STARS, AFTER FIERY DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, capping a heated and for many of its male members a deeply 
uncomfortable debate over sexual harassment, voted Tuesday to allow the Navy's 
top admiral to retire without a demotion despite allegations of a role in the 
Tailhook scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the still-overwhelmingly male Senate agonized over 
Justice Clarence Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme Court, partisan politics 
took a back seat to sexual politics as the lawmakers voted, 54 to 43, to allow 
Adm. Frank B. Kelso II retire as a four-star admiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six men joined the Senate's seven female members in voting against the 
motion to let the chief of naval operations retire at his 4-star rank, as 
recommended by President Clinton and Defense Secretary William J. Perry. 
Because the Senate must approve the retirement of all 3-star and 4-star 
officers, the motion's defeat would have meant Kelso's automatic demotion to 
2-star rank and a corresponding reduction of nearly $17,000 per year in his 
$84,340 retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the outcome was never in doubt, male after male member of the Senate 
felt obliged to take to the floor to explain that votes in favor of Kelso -- 
who was officially exonerated of involvement in the 1991 Tailhook scandal -- 
were not being cast along gender lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But any doubt that the emotional daylong debate would turn out to be anything 
other than a skirmish of the sexes was dispelled when all seven female senators 
served notice that they intended to oppose what the Senate leadership 
originally hoped could be a pro forma motion to retire the admiral at his 
current rank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time, and quite possibly the last, that (Barbara) Boxer and 
Kay Bailey Hutchison have voted on the same side" of a controversial issue, a 
Senate aide noted, referring to California's liberal Democratic senator and the 
conservative Republican from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also, added Boxer, the first time that the women -- five Democrats and 
two Republicans -- have stood together to raise the issue of sexual harassment 
and force a debate on gender politics on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The women said afterward that they were not disappointed by their loss because 
they knew from the outset that they had little chance of winning, but hoped to 
use the debate to send a message to the military that Congress will not 
tolerate sexual harassment or discrimination on the basis of sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the women are saying is that the culture of the U.S. military must 
change," Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose -- that's not the point," Hutchison added. "The point is we're 
taking a stand . . . we are debating this issue and we are putting everyone (in 
the military) on notice that promotions like this are not going to be pro forma 
when questions like this are involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpectedly close vote reinforced that message, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's bipartisan effort to defeat the Kelso motion got under way last 
week, when they met informally to coordinate their strategy for the floor 
fight. They conferred again over the weekend at a Democratic retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a bit of stage-managed drama when nine women from the House, led by 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), marched to the Senate to show their 
solidarity with the women senators. 
</P>
<P>
 The maneuver was meant to evoke another scene from 1991, when a group of women 
from the House stormed across the Capitol grounds and were denied entrance to 
the Senate Democratic policy lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 And win or lose Tuesday, the women also were not unhappy about the prospect, 
in one Senate aide's words, of "at least making their male colleagues squirm a 
bit" as they considered what, in an election year, could end up being a 
politically risky vote. 
</P>
<P>
 And squirm they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a completely unpleasant and distasteful exercise," bemoaned Sen. John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), who delivered an emotional speech on Kelso's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of emotion expressed about this in the caucus," Sen. David 
Pryor (D-Ark.) conceded as he emerged from a closed-door meeting of Senate 
Democrats earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps not insignificant that one of the men voting to deny Kelso 
retirement at his 4-star rank was Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania 
Republican who came under intense criticism from women's groups for his sharp 
questioning of Anita Faye Hill during Thomas' 1991 confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the most eagerly watched vote was the one cast by Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.), who is under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee on 
allegations that he harassed some two dozen women over two decades. Packwood 
kept a low profile during the debate but in the end quietly voted against 
Kelso. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Boxer, Hutchison and Mikulski, the women voting against Kelso included 
Democrats Dianne Feinstein of California, Patty Murray of Washington and Carol 
Moseley-Braun of Illinois and Republican Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote crossed party affiliations, with 23 Democrats and 31 Republicans 
voting for Kelso's retirement at full rank and 30 Democrats and 13 Republicans 
voting against it. 
</P>
<P>
 His future became a political issue earlier this year when a Navy judge ruling 
on the Tailhook scandal accused him of not telling the truth when he denied 
having seen any wrongdoing at a 1991 convention of Naval aviators sponsored by 
the Tailhook Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 women had complained of widespread harassment and 
sometimes-violent sexual abuse by male pilots attending the Las Vegas 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso was the highest-ranking officer at the convention. He has steadfastly 
denied witnessing any misbehavior, and a Navy investigation exonerated him. But 
questions about his role resurfaced after the naval judge accused him of 
manipulating the official inquiry to protect himself and other senior officers 
from blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue's sensitivity was underscored last week when the Senate Armed 
Services Committee held an unusually heated hearing on Kelso's retirement. 
After hearing Perry and other senior officials testify that there was no 
credible evidence tying Kelso to the scandal, the committee voted, 20 to 2, to 
recommend that the full Senate approve his retirement at the 4-star rank. 
</P>
<P>
 Endorsing that conclusion before the vote, Clinton said in a television 
interview Tuesday that the "evidence is not sufficiently compelling" to deny 
Kelso retirement at full rank. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a very severe thing to do, and I don't believe the evidence warrants 
it," Clinton said.

ROSARIO AMES DENIES SHE SPIED IN CIA MOLE CASE; ESPIONAGE: SUSPECT TELLS OF 
ANGER TOWARD HUSBAND, INSISTS KNOWING NOTHING OF HIS INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A distraught Rosario Ames said Tuesday that she had no knowledge of her 
husband's activities in the intelligence world and is bitterly angry over the 
shattering of her family's life by the couple's arrest on spying allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first interview since her arrest on Feb. 21, Ames contended that 
portrayals of her as a "Mata Hari" figure in an alleged conspiracy that 
funneled CIA secrets to the Russians could not be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worked for the Soviets," she said in the hourlong interview, which 
was conducted in the presence of her attorney, William B. Cummings, at the 
Alexandria city jail. She is being held there awaiting possible federal grand 
jury indictment or a plea bargain in her case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian-born Ames and her husband, Aldrich H. Ames -- a 31-year CIA 
veteran -- were arrested on espionage conspiracy charges. The FBI alleged that 
Aldrich Ames had been paid at least $2.5 million by the Soviets and later the 
Russians to spy for them as a CIA mole since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Ames and Cummings indicated that they expect another extension of the 
deadline for grand jury action in the case as they work out details of a plea 
bargain with government prosecutors. The Times reported April 7 that Aldrich 
Ames, 52, has indicated willingness to cooperate with investigators as they try 
to assess damage done by his alleged spying, but only if they recommend 
leniency for Rosario, who is 41. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Rosario Ames recounted the difficulties of being held in 
jail for nearly two months and broke down in tears as she pointed to a 
photograph of her 5-year-old son, Paul, saying: "He is the one who keeps me 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 She told of struggling with "anger, resentment and bitterness" toward her 
husband -- feelings that now have settled into "great sadness and 
bewilderment." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked the source of her anger toward her husband and whether she felt "that he 
brought all of this upon the family," she said: "I don't know if I want to. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, who had set the ground rule that Rosario Ames would not discuss 
evidence in the case, cut her off, saying: "I think that's probably too close." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames also waved off questions about excerpts from government wiretaps on the 
couple's phones that depict her as a driving force in her husband's alleged 
spying. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recorded conversation, included in an unusually detailed FBI affidavit, 
Rosario Ames cautioned her husband against carelessness in carrying sensitive 
documents or cash, apparently from his Russian handlers, in suitcases that he 
was checking as airline baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, she berated him, allegedly for failing to leave a timely signal 
for the Russians, saying: "Well, honey, I hope you didn't screw up." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on the recordings, she said: "I would love to, but I can't 
right now. Maybe in the future I will be able to." 
</P>
<P>
 "Her position is that the tapes do not reflect the nature of her relationship 
with her husband," Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he's right," Ames said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond that, it's not something we can discuss right now," Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Ames did strongly challenge the government's describing her as "a paid 
source for the CIA" in Mexico City in 1983, where she was working as a cultural 
attache for the Colombian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her relationship with the agency involved permitting a CIA friend from the 
U.S. Embassy to use her apartment for "certain meetings he needed to conduct 
with people that he couldn't have at the office," Ames said. She also 
introduced the CIA friend, whom she did not identify, to friends from 
diplomatic circles in Mexico City, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never interviewed, officially hired, or met anybody else from the CIA," 
she said. "I was never asked to, and he (her CIA friend) knew better than to 
ask me to betray my country, Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
 She dismissed as "absolutely false" reports that Aldrich Ames, who is known as 
Rick, recruited her for CIA work while both were in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not know that Aldrich Ames -- whom she said she met at a 
Diplomatic Assn. function in Mexico in 1982 -- was in the CIA until he proposed 
marriage just before leaving Mexico in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames said she was shocked to find he was with the agency, and that "I didn't 
like it too much." 
</P>
<P>
 "I share this cultural prejudice, I guess, of the CIA that most Latin 
Americans feel," she said. "When you mention the CIA in Latin America, people 
imagine all sorts of terrible things -- not without good reason in a lot of 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Rosario Ames was asked about evidence cited in the FBI affidavit or 
whether any CIA colleagues took part in her husband's alleged activities, she 
denied having knowledge of her husband's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea about it," she said. "I have very little knowledge of Rick's 
work or his superiors." 
</P>
<P>
 As for incriminating evidence that the FBI reportedly recovered from Rick 
Ames' computer during a search of the couple's home after their arrest, she 
said: "That's my husband's computer, not mine. So I can't answer that." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she maintained a separate word processor at home where she kept her 
graduate work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court hearing, Leslie G. Wiser Jr., supervising FBI agent in the case, 
testified that Rosario Ames volunteered a series of damaging statements to 
agents after her arrest, stating that she learned of Ames' alleged spying in 
1991 and later cooperated in his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 She also reportedly told of accompanying her husband last September on a drive 
into Washington from their suburban Virginia home to look for a signal from his 
Russian handlers verifying that they had picked up a package of classified 
documents left for them at a so-called "dead drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings cut off questions about those statements, noting: "That's an area of 
some disagreement at this stage, so we don't want to use that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames said that when she said goodby to her son on the day she was arrested, 
she expected to be back later that day or the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I would be back if I helped them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy has since gone to Colombia with his grandmother and aunts, a trip that 
Rosario said he had been asking to make, and has been told only that his 
parents are traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has had one telephone conversation with the boy since her arrest, 
"and it was bad. We both cried a lot. . . . When I called, he sort of broke 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames acknowledged seeing a Washington psychologist, a visit approved by the 
court, and that "it helped." She said she is taking medication that has helped 
"to a certain extent." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one special inmate friend, and (she has been) a very important factor 
in keeping my sanity," Ames said. "She talks me out of my depression. . . . 
She's been here awhile, so she knows the best ways to survive here." Ames' 
sharpest comments were aimed at a nanny who worked for the Ameses four years 
ago and who has said in interviews that the mother had frequently spanked the 
child and that the nanny was instructed to keep the infant out of the house 
most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames dismissed the statements by Maria Trinidad Chirino as "the most horrible 
lie I ever heard." She said she fired Chirino for keeping her son out of the 
house for most of a day, without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Tuesday, CIA director R. James Woolsey said that he expected many 
more U.S. espionage cases to be developed, largely resulting from the collapse 
of communist rule in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CIA has come across a good deal of counterintelligence information," 
Woolsey said on NBC's "Today" show. "People should not have the impression that 
the Aldrich Ames case is the only counterintelligence case." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to documents and other information that has become available, 
Woolsey said that "we have been able to come up with a large number of leads 
with respect to people who undertook espionage during the Cold War, in this 
country and in other countries, in several parts of the American government." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was referring to cases outside the CIA, but declined to say if he 
was implying espionage by current or former State Department or White House 
officials. Declaring that it often takes months or years to build espionage 
charges against a suspect, Woolsey said that Americans "are going to see a 
number of these over the years to come."

STUDY FINDS LUMPECTOMY AS EFFECTIVE AS MASTECTOMY; HEALTH: RESULTS SUPPORT 
EXPERIMENT THAT WAS CLOUDED BY FALSIFIED DATA. LESS-INVASIVE SURGERY IS CALLED 
UNDERUSED. 
</P>

<P>
 In a study that experts hope will provide reassurance to thousands of nervous 
breast cancer patients, UC Irvine researchers have confirmed that lumpectomy -- 
in which only the cancerous tumor, rather than the entire breast, is removed -- 
is just as safe and effective as mastectomy. But, the research found, many 
women who are eligible for the procedure do not get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings come on the heels of a major controversy over falsified data in a 
massive international breast cancer study that advocated lumpectomy in 
conjunction with radiation therapy. Experts hope that the new results will 
comfort lumpectomy patients who are wondering if they made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the study of 5,892 Orange County women in 126 Southern California 
hospitals may be as troubling as it is comforting. The researchers uncovered 
stark disparities in the way breast cancer patients are treated, and found that 
whether a patient lived or died after surgery depended in part on the type of 
hospital in which she received care. Those in large hospitals fared the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "This again emphasizes that lumpectomy and radiation is very acceptable 
therapy," said Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer for the American Cancer 
Society. "But the second message is that you want to have cancer care given in 
an institution where they pay attention to quality of care, and those are 
generally the large institutions with the larger number of cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Published in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn., the 
UC Irvine study examined medical records for white women whose breast cancer 
was diagnosed between 1984 and 1990. It is the first in the nation to compare 
the treatment and survival of breast cancer patients by hospital type. It found 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Women who went to university-affiliated teaching hospitals were far more 
likely than others to have lumpectomies. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts estimate that 70% of all breast cancer patients are eligible for the 
procedure, also known as breast-conserving surgery, or BCS. Toward the end of 
the six-year study period, the researchers reported, 70% of patients in 
teaching hospitals had lumpectomies. In other hospitals, about 25% had 
lumpectomies; the rest had mastectomies, a far more invasive surgery in which 
the entire breast is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an urgent need to encourage more frequent use by physicians of 
recommended BCS plus radiation in qualified women," the researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patients in large hospitals -- those with more than 200 beds -- fared the 
best. They were 26% less likely to die in the five years after surgery than 
those who had lumpectomies or mastectomies in small hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patients in HMO hospitals -- both large and small -- fared poorly. HMO 
patients with "localized" breast cancer -- meaning the disease had not spread 
-- were almost twice as likely to die during the five-year post-surgery period 
as those treated in large hospitals, and their chance of dying was 63% greater 
than women whose operations took place in small hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the researchers found, HMO hospital care was improving toward the end 
of the study period, and those with "regionalized" cancer, meaning the disease 
had spread, fared about the same as patients in small hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * All other factors considered, women who chose lumpectomy with radiation were 
just as likely to survive as those who had mastectomies. This finding confirms 
research conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, 
the large-scale study that has recently come under scrutiny amid disclosures 
that a Canadian doctor had falsified data. 
</P>
<P>
 That study was headed by renowned cancer researcher Dr. Bernard Fisher of the 
University of Pittsburgh, who was forced to step down after the disclosures. It 
examined the use of lumpectomy in a controlled clinical trial, with carefully 
selected patients who met strict criteria, and were then picked at random to 
undergo either lumpectomy or mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Irvine study used medical records to take a snapshot of how 
breast cancer surgery is practiced in a suburban area, in this case Orange 
County. Names of patients and hospitals were kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an illustration of how does (lumpectomy) work out there in the 
community," said epidemiologist Anna Lee-Feldstein, the lead author of the 
study. "This shows that the findings of the Fisher study really are applicable 
to the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In the United States, 
experts estimate that 182,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this 
year, and 46,000 will die of it. (The disease also strikes a small number of 
men; about 1,000 each year.) 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment for breast cancer has changed dramatically in the past two decades. 
As recently as the 1970s, doctors were performing radical mastectomies, a 
disfiguring surgery in which the entire breast as well as pectoral muscle were 
removed. The trend then shifted to "total" mastectomy, in which only the breast 
and lymph nodes are removed, and later, in the wake of Fisher's 1985 study, to 
lumpectomies in combination with radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight other studies have confirmed Fisher's results, which even with 
the falsified data are not in dispute. But the Irvine research shows that not 
all doctors and women have taken heed of his findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is physician bias," said Dr. Susan Love, a nationally regarded 
breast cancer expert at UCLA. "I saw a patient today and the surgeon said to 
her: 'Well, I know they showed that (lumpectomy is just as safe) but I've been 
doing mastectomies for a long time and I don't care what the studies show." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say patients, particularly older women who grew up with the notion that 
the entire breast should be cut out at the first sign of cancer, are frightened 
of lumpectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some very intelligent, clear-thinking women do not want to have a lumpectomy 
and radiation therapy," said Eyre of the American Cancer Society. "Some women 
just want to get the diseased organ gone. They feel better when the breast is 
removed."

SCHOOLS DUMP NO-HANDSHAKE SPORTS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Ventura County high school sports league that created international 
controversy last month when it banned post-game handshakes by student athletes 
announced Tuesday that the policy is being rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-handshake policy was adopted in an attempt to curb violence that had 
plagued games this season in the Marmonte League in eastern Ventura County plus 
Agoura in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 For the final few weeks of the spring season, the eight high schools in the 
league will be free to engage in the traditional symbol of post-game 
sportsmanship, the schools' principals said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Christianson, league president and principal at Agoura High School, 
attributed the turnabout to the crush of media attention and controversy the 
policy created. "We don't think we did anything wrong. We still think there's a 
better way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this has caused more furor than anything that should be causing furor." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was implemented in the wake of several scuffles that broke out 
after Marmonte League basketball games, including one in which a player threw a 
punch during a post-game handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 Christianson insisted the league only wanted to ban coaches from ordering 
their teams to shake hands after games. It was never, he said, meant to stop 
players who wanted to shake hands after games from doing so on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the league's original decision was widely interpreted by school 
officials and students as being a complete ban, one that was bemoaned as the 
death of sportsmanship. On Tuesday, for example, Kathryn Scroggin, principal of 
Simi Valley High School, said she understood the policy as a complete ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students on the practice field after school Tuesday at Camarillo High 
School applauded the turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was getting in a fight just because of shaking hands," said senior 
Eric Jue, 17, who plays second base. "I think it shows good sportsmanship to 
shake hands after a game." 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jay Nirenberg, 18, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there's bad blood between the two teams," he said, "but that comes 
out in the game, not when they're shaking hands. I've played varsity for three 
years and I've never seen a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was rescinded as a result of a telephone vote taken Monday and 
Tuesday among the league's eight schools. Christianson said the vote was six 
principals in favor of the change and two abstaining, but he declined to 
identify who abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and coaches at the league's campuses said they had been 
inundated by calls from news organizations throughout the nation and around the 
world about the policy, believed to be the broadest of its kind. The issue drew 
national attention from varied news organizations, including Sports Illustrated 
and the BBC, after it was reported in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The high schools in the league are Newbury Park, Thousand Oaks and Westlake in 
the Conejo Valley Unified School District; Royal and Simi Valley in the Simi 
Valley Unified School District; Adolfo Camarillo and Channel Islands in the 
Oxnard Union High School District, and Agoura in the Las Virgenes Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 During its brief life, the policy was disregarded by students at some 
campuses, although one coach was reprimanded for permitting his students to 
shake hands. The architect of the policy, Camarillo Principal Terry Tackett, 
could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school officials appeared to be relieved at the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a move in the right direction. We put a tourniquet on a paper 
cut," said Thousand Oaks athletic director Jim O'Brien, calling the publicity 
the policy generated "more interesting than Al Capone's vaults on 'Geraldo 
Rivera.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Westlake baseball Coach Rich Herrera of the turnabout: "I think it's 
great. I think they made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could understand where the principals were coming from, but I think the 
coaches are responsible enough to control their players. To punish every sport 
for a handful of instances, that's what I couldn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 On the practice field, pitcher Ryan Bourget, 16, called the whole controversy 
"stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's tradition to shake hands after a game," he said. "I don't like 
shaking hands after a loss."

SUPREME COURT BARS SEX BIAS IN JURY SELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying the day is past when women or men can be excluded from juries based on 
"group stereotypes," the Supreme Court on Tuesday outlawed sex discrimination 
in jury selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equal opportunity to participate in the fair administration of justice is 
fundamental to our democratic system," retiring Justice Harry A. Blackmun 
wrote. Permitting trial lawyers to exclude people from juries because of their 
sex "serves to ratify and perpetuate invidious, archaic and overbroad 
stereotypes about the relative abilities of men and women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-3 decision culminates a century-long struggle to assure women equality 
in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Civil War, the 14th Amendment guaranteed all people the "equal 
protection of the laws," and the Supreme Court in 1880 invoked that clause to 
say states could no longer bar blacks from juries. However, almost as an aside, 
the all-male tribunal added that unquestionably states "may confine the 
selection (of jurors) to males." 
</P>
<P>
 In this century, the legal barriers to women serving on juries slowly fell. 
But as late as 1947, 16 states continued to exclude women from juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after those barriers were removed, sex discrimination in the courtroom 
did not end. 
</P>
<P>
 By tradition, trial lawyers are permitted to exclude a fixed number of 
potential jurors based on a hunch that the person will look unfavorably on 
their client. At least until recently, the hunches behind those "peremptory 
strikes" often involved judgments relating to a person's race or sex, as well 
as his or her appearance, nationality or occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Peremptory strikes are justified on the theory that, by permitting both sides 
to exclude the potential jurors most likely to be biased, the result will be a 
jury panel that is fair and impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 But beginning in the 1986 case of Batson vs. Kentucky, the Supreme Court moved 
to forbid lawyers to use race in striking potential jurors. Follow-up rulings 
broadly extended the principle. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping logic of those rulings virtually assured that blatant sex 
discrimination would soon be outlawed as well, and that final step came 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Women's Law Center applauded the ruling as a "landmark decision 
for women's rights" that recognizes "the shared history of discrimination faced 
by women and racial minorities in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling requires no change in the courtrooms of California. The state 
Supreme Court and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco 
already have forbidden sex discrimination in jury selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting Tuesday were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices 
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Scalia called the ruling a triumph for 
"thoroughly up-to-date and right thinking" that may hurt women more than it 
will help them. "But times and trends do change, and unisex is unquestionably 
in fashion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalia noted that the victor in Tuesday's decision was an Alabama man who, 
because all males had been excluded from his jury, won a retrial in a paternity 
suit even though a blood test showed with 99.9% certainty that he was the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, James E. Bowman, had protested when a state prosecutor moved to 
strike men from the roster of potential jurors. The panel concluded that Bowman 
was indeed the father of the boy born in 1989, and it ordered him to pay the 
mother $415 a month in child support. The Alabama Supreme Court upheld the 
ruling and said Bowman had not suffered any prejudice in the jury selection. It 
noted that his lawyer had moved to exclude as many women as possible from the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high court, state prosecutors argued that in sensitive cases, such as 
those involving rape, paternity or sexual harassment, they should be permitted 
to exclude as many men as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices disagreed, reversed the state court in the case of J.E.B. vs. 
Alabama, 92-1239, and overturned the paternity judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the outcome of that case, a women's rights advocate said the wider 
effect of the ruling will be a benefit for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone -- men and women -- has an interest in having jurors selected on a 
non-discriminatory basis," said Deborah L. Brake of the National Women's Law 
Center. Although prosecutors in Bowman's retrial will not be permitted to 
exclude all the men, the defense lawyer will not be permitted to seek the 
exclusion of all women, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During jury selection, an allegation of race or sex bias can trigger the judge 
to intervene. Then, the lawyer who had moved to strike a particular juror is 
called upon to explain the reason for his or her move. If the lawyer can supply 
a non-discriminatory reason, the juror can be excluded, Blackmun said. 
</P>
<P>
 His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, 
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In a separate statement, Justice 
Anthony M. Kennedy said he agreed with the result. 
</P>
<P>
 In her concurring opinion, O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the high 
court, made clear that she did not share the majority's view that all sex 
distinctions must be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that like race, gender matters," she wrote. "In rape cases, for 
example, female jurors are somewhat more likely to vote to convict than male 
jurors."

COURT CLEARS JUDGE INVOLVED WITH MOBSTER; APPEALS: CONVICTIONS OF ROBERT P. 
AGUILAR ARE REVERSED. HE HAD PASSED WORD OF A FEDERAL WIRETAP TO A REPUTED 
FORMER MURDER INC. KILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Tuesday reversed the convictions 
of U.S. District Judge Robert P. Aguilar for obstructing justice and leaking 
word to an aging mobster that he was being wiretapped by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Aguilar's conduct did not 
violate the federal laws he was charged with breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Supreme Court overrules the 9th Circuit decision, the charges 
against the San Jose judge will be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great and the judge feels twice as good," said Paul B. Meltzer, a 
Santa Cruz attorney who represented Aguilar in the appeal. "When I called to 
give him the news, his first words were, 'Thank God.' He's very relieved." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1980 appointee of President Jimmy Carter, Aguilar, 63, was only the third 
federal judge to be convicted of a felony, and the first in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar's troubles began in 1987 when law enforcement officers on an organized 
crime investigation spotted him having lunch with Abe (Trigger) Chapman, a 
longtime family friend who had served four prison terms. The head of the FBI's 
San Francisco office told Robert Peckham, chief U.S. district judge in Northern 
California, about the sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to warn his colleague that being seen with Chapman -- a reputed mob 
killer and member of the infamous gang Murder Inc. -- would create the 
appearance of an impropriety, Peckham told Aguilar in August, 1987, that 
Chapman's name had come up in the course of a wiretap application. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar joked to Peckham that the Chapman he knew was "a senile old man who 
waddled when he walked." Six months later, though, after spotting people he 
believed to be FBI agents outside his house, Aguilar told his nephew about the 
tap and the nephew relayed the information to Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1989, federal prosecutors accused the judge of eight felonies, 
including warning Chapman about the wiretap. It was also alleged that Aguilar 
attempted to sway another federal judge, Stanley A. Weigel, to give lenient 
treatment to former Teamster leader Rudy Tham, who was trying to persuade 
Weigel to reverse his conviction for embezzling union funds. 
</P>
<P>
 At trial, Aguilar told a San Francisco jury that he had taken actions that had 
embarrassed him, his court and his family, but he denied committing a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's first trial ended with a hung jury. Three charges, including a 
racketeering count, were dropped before a retrial began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in November, 1990, a jury convicted Aguilar of disclosing to Chapman 
that he was the subject of an FBI wiretap. The jury also convicted Aguilar of 
obstructing justice when he lied to FBI agents in 1988 about his efforts to 
intervene on behalf of Tham. The judge was acquitted of three other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar was sentenced to six months in jail, far below the normal term under 
federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel upheld the wiretapping conviction 
but reversed the conviction for obstruction of justice. Both sides appealed, 
resulting in a hearing before an 11-judge panel that led to Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court ruled 11 to 0 that Aguilar's statements to the FBI did not 
obstruct a grand jury investigation because he did not attempt to coerce or 
persuade FBI agents to testify falsely before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that Judge Aguilar tried to tell the FBI how to testify, 
tried to persuade them not to testify, or tried to dissuade them from 
testifying as to what their investigation otherwise revealed," according to the 
majority opinion by Appellate Judge Procter Hug Jr. "The only evidence is that 
he made false and misleading statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with 
Chapman" -- an old friend of Tham -- and with Tham's lawyer Edward Solomon. 
Aguilar was not charged with the crime of lying to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other issue, the appeals court ruled 9 to 2 that Aguilar did not 
violate the wiretapping law because the authorization for the wiretap in 
question had expired eight months before he warned Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plain language of the statute makes it clear that the purpose of the 
statute is to prevent interference" with an existing or pending wiretap, 
according to the majority opinion. "Giving notice of an expired wiretap 
authorization or application is not a violation," Hug wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hug added that interpreting the law to prohibit disclosures for an indefinite 
period of time would create the possibility that citizens' free speech rights 
would be violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hug was joined in his opinion by eight judges -- five of whom, like him, were 
appointed by Carter and three of whom were appointed by Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judges Ferdinand Fernandez, a George Bush appointee, and J. Clifford 
Wallace, a Richard Nixon, appointee, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cannot be doubted that Judge Aguilar conveyed information to Chapman with 
the intent to impede interception" of the wiretap, the dissenters wrote. The 
fact that the original wiretap authorization had expired was irrelevant, the 
dissenters said, particularly since another one had been issued and was in 
effect at the time Aguilar warned Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department spokesman said the agency would make no comment until 
department attorneys had reviewed the 9th Circuit ruling. Any decision to 
appeal to the Supreme Court would have to be approved by Solicitor General Drew 
Days III, said Justice Department spokesman John Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Luskin of Washington, D.C., Aguilar's other attorney, expressed 
confidence that Tuesday's ruling would not be overturned by the Supreme Court 
if the Justice Department appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has never used the theories they used against Judge Aguilar in 
any other criminal prosecution," Luskin said. "And there is no reported case in 
which a federal court of appeals has upheld the use of these statutes in the 
way the Justice Department wanted to use them in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar has been out on bail since his 1990 convictions, but retained his 
judge's title and salary. He has handled settlement conferences for other 
judges, but has not presided over formal court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Aguilar's attorney, Meltzer, said the judge intends "to resume a 
full caseload as soon as possible," including criminal cases. Meltzer said he 
did not think it would be a problem for Aguilar to preside over cases lodged by 
his former accuser -- the Justice Department. Aguilar's office referred all 
calls to Meltzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you were to ask the majority of government lawyers who appeared 
before Judge Aguilar, they would tell you he's been quite fair," Meltzer said. 
The U.S. attorney's office in San Jose did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At a 1990 sentencing hearing, Meltzer told the trial judge that Judge Aguilar 
"knows he has disappointed thousands of people who looked to him as a role 
model." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Meltzer said that in hindsight, Aguilar should not have maintained 
his relationship with Chapman. "It was an error of judgment to allow himself to 
be too open to people he should have shunned," Melzer said.

A LESSON OF HOPE; TEACHER OF THE YEAR URGES SCHOOLS TO TAKE INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandra McBrayer, named this week as 1994 National Teacher of the Year, has a 
message for America's schools: Arise and do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often schools assume the role of victims, that society has dumped all its 
problems on us and nothing can be done," McBrayer said. "My school demonstrates 
that you can do something about the problems. If students are hungry, feed 
them. If students need clothes, give them clothes. Take action." 
</P>
<P>
 McBrayer is being honored by the Washington-based Council of Chief State 
School Officers and the Encyclopaedia Britannica for her work at a school she 
founded six years ago in downtown San Diego to serve forgotten teen-agers 
living in marginal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 McBrayer's boss, San Diego County Supt. of Schools Harry Weinberg, calls her a 
cross between Mother Teresa and Jaime Escalante, the Garfield High School 
teacher whose success in turning out math superstars was chronicled in the 
movie "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandy is demanding and she is consistent," Weinberg said. "She insists on 
perfection from her students and she gets it. She is the real article, not a 
media creation. I had to talk her into applying for this award." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 43rd winner of the annual award, McBrayer will spend a year traveling 
to schools around the country and using the honor as a bully pulpit to call for 
greater public support for education. She begins Thursday by meeting with 
President Clinton in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this school, a lot of the girls would be laid up somewhere pregnant, 
and the boys probably would be selling drugs," said a 17-year-old student at 
McBrayer's school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandy makes you want to go to school," said James Allen, 19. "She's got a 
good attitude. Teachers at my other schools didn't care, but here Sandy and the 
others really care." 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a former bar that was popular with sailors when San Diego was an 
anything-goes Navy town, the Homeless Outreach School serves about 400 students 
a year, teaching them survival skills and providing an emotional safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 McBrayer's students are known in education jargon as unattended and at-risk, 
which means that most of them are without supportive families and vulnerable to 
social dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With students like these, you can't fake it," said Pete Treadwell, an 
administrator at the San Diego County Office of Education. "Either you're 
interested in these kids or you're not. It takes the ability to withstand a lot 
of rough language, frustration and disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 McBrayer, by all accounts, has that ability. "Sandy has a rare gift," 
Treadwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never met a person who is so giving of herself as Sandy," said Lisa 
LaRosa, an outreach worker at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRosa's job is to find teen-agers living on the streets, alone in rooming 
houses and sometimes on the roofs of buildings, and persuade them to enroll in 
school. One study said 1,500 children were living on San Diego's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have children who were sold into prostitution or to a crack house because 
their parents owed money to a dealer," McBrayer said. "We had a boy whose 
father played a game of 'chicken' by putting lighted cigarettes on his arm and 
waiting for him to cry. These children have been through all these things and 
still they want an education." 
</P>
<P>
 McBrayer was teaching juvenile offenders in the court school system when she 
decided that it was time to take a school to the streets. "I realized that part 
our responsibility is to take school to the students and not just wait for them 
to come to us," McBrayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the county Office of Education agreed with McBrayer and now the 
Homeless Outreach School, with three teachers and a squad of assistants, is 
located in a gritty section of Market Street. For the students' protection, the 
school front has no name. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of Marines, the 33-year-old McBrayer believes in equal doses of 
discipline and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are required to use a sign-in sheet and sign contracts pledging to 
meet certain educational goals. Disruptive behavior is not tolerated. McBrayer 
carries a pager, has an 800 number and considers herself on-call 24 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who have children are encouraged to bring them to class. Information 
is available about avoiding pregnancy and staying away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Aguilera, 18, attended the school for two years while on-site care was 
provided for her two daughters. She graduated recently and plans to enroll in 
community college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandy is very special," Aguilera said. "Whether you're from the ghetto, or 
some rich part of town, she takes the time to listen and find out where you're 
coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of students from the school have received their high school diplomas, 
25 are in college and one is getting a master's degree. But there have been 
failures: Since December, three students have died, including a 14-year-old 
student who was shot in a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 McBrayer says she has a simple standard for measuring the success of her 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it a success when a kid is living better today than yesterday," 
she said.

LEGISLATURE URGED TO NOT BOOST FELONIES; CRIME: SEN. LOCKYER CAUTIONS AGAINST 
UPGRADING SOME MISDEMEANORS. HE FEARS WORSE PRISON OVERCROWDING BECAUSE OF 
'THREE STRIKES' LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Leader Bill Lockyer recommended Tuesday that the Legislature refrain 
from upgrading misdemeanor crimes to felonies because of uncertainty about the 
impact of the newly enacted "three strikes" anti-crime law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a genuine problem both of fairness and fiscal dimensions," Lockyer said 
in an interview. "We're already worried that 'three strikes' incarceration 
costs could cannibalize other taxpayer programs such as education. So to the 
extent we expand the number of less serious felonies, we increase the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 He announced the recommendation during a series of hearings before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee on bills that would raise several misdemeanor offenses to 
felonies. Among the crimes that have been under consideration for felony status 
are graffiti vandalism and abalone poaching. Lockyer is the former chairman of 
the committee and remains an influential member. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans said Lockyer was engaging in election-year posturing to wound 
the "three strikes" initiative. "It's partisan, but everything is partisan this 
time of year," said Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who saw her 
anti-graffiti bill softened by the committee after Lockyer's warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said the "three strikes" ballot measure -- which sentences three-time 
felons to 25 years to life in prison -- enjoys such strong public support that 
"this sort of tweaking won't make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he suggested that the Legislature's persistent election-year practice 
of elevating relatively minor crimes to felonies could accelerate prison 
overcrowding problems expected to be caused by the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson this year, but "three 
strikes" backers went ahead and put an initiative on the November ballot to 
guard against legislators tinkering with the provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said he does not dispute that some crimes may deserve to be elevated 
to felony status, but suggested that many others are lesser offenses that 
should not be counted under the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some legislators have proposed provisions to ensure that a particular 
crime does not count as a strike, Lockyer contends that voters' approval of the 
November ballot measure would erase such exemptions, making third-time 
offenders liable for 25 years to life in prison for innocuous crimes. If the 
ballot measure passes, he said, it would take a two-thirds vote in the deeply 
divided Legislature to exempt a felony from "three strikes."LOCKYER, BILL

RULING MAY SLOW BRIDGE STRENGTHENING; HIGHWAYS: JUDGE ORDERS STATE TO SHARPLY 
LIMIT THE USE OF PRIVATE CONSULTANTS AND ENGINEERS FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS, 
CALLING NEW LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL. WILSON WILL SEEK AN APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a decision that could slow down the seismic strengthening of highway 
bridges, a Sacramento Superior Court judge ordered state officials Tuesday to 
severely limit their use of private consultants and engineers in the design of 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Eugene T. Gualco said a new state law that Caltrans had 
relied on for broad authority to hire outside professionals for the design of 
highway projects is unconstitutional and the agency must restrict its use of 
private engineers to certain specified circumstances such as emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exemptions from the decision would be the construction projects under 
way to replace and repair highways damaged by the Northridge earthquake, the 
judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the decision "a direct threat to the safety and well-being of millions 
of Californians," Gov. Pete Wilson said it would force the state to delay 
highway construction projects and slow down its top priority program, the 
seismic strengthening of bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the assistance of private engineers we are placing in jeopardy the 
state's ability to deliver needed safety, seismic strengthening and other 
transportation improvement projects," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the state will immediately ask a higher court to overturn the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said a series of seismic retrofitting projects -- scheduled 
to go out to bid this summer and estimated to cost $60 million -- would 
probably be among the first to be affected by the order. They said it is too 
soon to identify other highway projects that might be delayed by the order. 
This year, the state has contracts with private engineers totaling about $106 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 If the seismic retrofitting is slowed down by the decision, it will be the 
second time in about a year that the court case has delayed the program. An 
earlier decision in the same lawsuit forced Caltrans last year to order its 
private engineers to stop retrofit design. The stoppage lasted for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials argue that with nearly 10,000 engineers on its payroll, it is 
unnecessary for Caltrans to delay the seismic retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Blanning, executive assistant for the union, said Caltrans has used 
outside engineers for about a third of the seismic projects and their work 
could easily be done by in-house professionals transferred from other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the agency will probably transfer engineers 
from other projects to the seismic program to complete the work that would have 
been done by outside engineers. Even so, he said, there will still be delays 
because engineers will need time to retrain and familiarize themselves with the 
seismic work. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest decision is a setback for the Wilson Administration that had relied 
heavily on the private sector to help it speed up a multibillion-dollar 
transportation construction program. In his campaign for reelection, the 
Republican governor has often credited this accelerated program for helping 
create jobs in the sluggish California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Wilson Administration and its predecessor, the George 
Deukmejian Administration, have been battling with Professional Engineers in 
California Government, an employee union, over the hiring of outside 
consultants. The courts have repeatedly ruled in favor of the union, saying 
that the California Constitution essentially mandates that the state's work 
must be done by state employees.

 Taco Bell is run from one of those sparkling glass structures that sprouted in 
clusters in South Orange County during the last boom. Reflected in the office 
tower's green tinted walls are blue skies -- and the tinted walls of 
neighboring office towers. Everything about the place is clean, well-maintained 
and suggestive of wealth: At the corner bus stop, the kiosk billboard 
advertises a Mercedes-Benz dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,000 or so people who work inside this building are the wizards of 
marketing and menu who built Glen Bell's taco stand in Downey into, to quote 
from a corporate press release, "the nation's leading Mexican-style, 
quick-service restaurant chain." They are the folks who devised methods to 
reduce, quoting the company material again, "order processing times to under 30 
seconds" and developed the "K-minus" concept, transforming kitchens "into 
assembly line areas utilizing prepared ingredients." Yum. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the big idea people, the bean trust. "What is the value of a big 
idea?" Taco Bell CEO John E. Martin mused recently for the benefit of a Times 
reporter. "In our case, a big idea could add $600 to $700 million in sales in 
one year to our business." 
</P>
<P>
 The context in which Martin pondered this question is interesting. In the same 
interview, Martin spoke to Ann Conway of The Times of this "decision I have to 
make . . . a tough decision." In simplest terms, the decision is whether to up 
and move Taco Bell's corporate headquarters, the bean trust, to something 
called Plano, Tex. His "druthers," Martin went on, "would be to stay in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 But. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this game Martin is playing, there always is a but. Taco Bell has become 
fabulously successful here, but Texas is offering so many incentives. 
California is a great place to recruit big idea people, but Texas is talking 
about cheap land and multimillion-dollar tax breaks. Loyalty is fine, but 
bidness is bidness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, Taco Bell executives have met with a succession of 
California politicians and business leaders. Pete Wilson is on the case. So is 
Willie Brown. Just what California can deliver for Taco Bell is not clear. 
There is this problem of a looming budget deficit. And it seems the recession 
hasn't gone away yet. And also there was this big earthquake in Los Angeles -- 
although it did not seem to inflict any damage to the glass towers down here. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell executives won't say what exactly they want. They have circled the 
public relations wagons, shooing reporters out of the building, recycling old 
press statements that promise a decision soon but, beyond that, say nothing. It 
is said that some California officials who made the pilgrimage here were 
required to promise in writing that they would not disclose any details of the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all sorts of different things they are asking for," said one 
official familiar with the discussions. Like tax breaks. And relaxed 
car-pooling requirements. And tax breaks. And maybe some help with locating a 
site for a new headquarters. And, of course, tax breaks. "Taxes seem to be 
pretty important," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in trying to keep Taco Bell here believe something greater is 
at stake than a glass tower filled with fast-food wizards. One thousand jobs in 
a 14-million job economy are, in the abstract, insignificant, but losing a 
corporate headquarters to another state is seen to have great symbolic weight. 
As the Irvine Chamber of Commerce president put it: "Taco Bell's is a pivotal 
decision. If they leave, we've lost a major effort to retain somebody. If they 
stay, we've got a major win that we could use to anchor down others." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, perhaps. Another way to look at it is this. There are many reasons that 
Taco Bell has thrived in California. Population, location and lifestyle are but 
three. These reasons remain. And while the business climate might not be 
perfect, it was good enough to put Taco Bell on the fast-food map. No, if 
Martin believes Texas is a better place to run his fast-food chain, so be it. 
Here's hoping he gets good Cowboys tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The greater danger here is not in losing the bean trust, but in playing the 
game in the first place. Appease Taco Bell today, and expect a knock on the 
door tomorrow from Carl's Jr., or Jack in the Box, or Del Taco. What is given 
to one in a bidding contest must be given to others, especially those who 
slugged through the same rough times without holding a gun to anyone's head. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism, too, can cut both ways. Outfoxing grabby Texans might be fun, 
but there's something about letting a fast-food taco chain dictate terms to the 
state of California that doesn't quite sit right. In fact, it leaves a bad 
taste in the mouth. And write your own punch line.

SCHOOLS DROP NO-HANDSHAKE SPORTS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER and JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County high school sports league that created international 
controversy last month when it banned postgame handshakes by student athletes 
announced Tuesday that the policy is being rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-handshake policy was adopted in an attempt to curb violence that had 
plagued games this season in the Marmonte League in eastern Ventura County and 
Agoura in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 For the final few weeks of the spring season, the eight high schools in the 
league will be free to engage in the traditional symbol of postgame 
sportsmanship, the schools' principals said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Christianson, league president and principal of Agoura High School, 
attributed the turnabout to the crush of media attention and controversy the 
policy created. "We don't think we did anything wrong. We still think there's a 
better way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this has caused more furor than anything that should be causing furor." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was implemented after scuffles broke out after several Marmonte 
League basketball games, including one in which a player threw a punch while 
the teams were shaking hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Christianson insisted that the league only wanted to ban coaches from ordering 
their teams to shake hands after games. It was never, he said, meant to stop 
players who wanted to shake hands after games from doing so on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the league's original decision was widely interpreted by school 
officials and students as a complete ban, one that was bemoaned as the death of 
sportsmanship. On Tuesday, for example, Kathryn Scroggin, principal of Simi 
Valley High School, said she understood the policy as a complete ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students on the practice field after school Tuesday at Camarillo High 
School applauded the turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was getting in a fight just because of shaking hands," said senior 
Eric Jue, 17, who plays second base for the Camarillo baseball team. "I think 
it shows good sportsmanship to shake hands after a game." 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jay Nirenberg, 18, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there's bad blood between the two teams," he said, "but that comes 
out in the game, not when they're shaking hands. I've played varsity for three 
years and I've never seen a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was rescinded as a result of a telephone vote taken Monday and 
Tuesday among the league's eight schools. Christianson said six principals 
voted in favor of the change and two abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and coaches at the league's campuses said they had been 
inundated by calls from news organizations throughout the nation and around the 
world about the policy, believed to be the broadest of its kind. The issue drew 
national attention from varied news organizations, including Sports Illustrated 
and the BBC, after it was reported in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 During its brief life, the policy was disregarded by students at some 
campuses, although one coach was reprimanded for permitting his students to 
shake hands. The policy's architect, Camarillo Principal Terry Tackett, could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school officials appeared to be relieved at the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a move in the right direction. We put a tourniquet on a paper 
cut," said Thousand Oaks Athletic Director Jim O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake baseball coach Rich Herrera said of the turnabout: "I think it's 
great. I think they made the right decision."

KEY DEMOCRATS URGE TOUGHER HAITI SANCTIONS; CARIBBEAN: INFLUENTIAL U.S. 
SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO TIGHTEN EMBARGO. IT WOULD ALSO DENY FUNDS FOR 
REPATRIATION OF REFUGEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Castigating President Clinton for pursuing a "morally bankrupt" policy on 
human rights, influential Senate Democrats introduced legislation Tuesday to 
tighten economic sanctions against Haiti and reverse the Administration policy 
of returning Haitian refugees intercepted on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 As criticism of the Clinton Administration's overall handling of foreign 
policy mounted in Congress, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) unveiled a bill 
to ban all but humanitarian assistance to Haiti until its military rulers agree 
to step down and accept the return of the exiled Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
Haiti's democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would impose a complete commercial embargo on Haiti; freeze the U.S. 
assets of Haitian supporters of the military regime; suspend all air traffic 
between the capital, Port-au-Prince, and the United States, and, in a direct 
challenge to the Administration, prohibit the use of funds to intercept or 
repatriate Haitian refugees. It also would direct Clinton to impose sanctions 
on other nations that do not agree to abide by the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd said the current embargo, which has been in place for six months and is 
widely seen as ineffective, "is ridiculous and exists in name only." 
</P>
<P>
 The new sanctions, patterned after those imposed at one time on South Africa 
as a protest against apartheid, would "put a clamp on the (Haitian) military," 
he said, by giving "real teeth" to the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Several senators conceded privately that the bill faces an uphill fight in the 
Senate, where many members are reluctant to intervene in Haiti or reverse the 
Administration policy on Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd said his main purpose in introducing the legislation was to "send a 
message to the military rulers of Haiti . . . that it is time to return 
President Aristide to power and restore democracy to Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, other supporters added, it is meant to send a message to 
the White House that a growing number of Democrats in Congress are growing 
alarmed over what is perceived as vacillation -- over not only Haiti but a host 
of other foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the criticism in recent days has focused on the confusion and apparent 
paralysis of American policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was clear from their comments that the senators' criticism of Clinton's 
Haiti policy flowed from concern over what several described variously as the 
President's disinterested or lackluster management of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has just got to be more attention to foreign policy," warned Sen. 
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that has 
jurisdiction over foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of what lawmakers see as the Administration's halfhearted effort 
to return Aristide to power also has provoked complaints from some of Clinton's 
key allies in the House, where Appropriations Committee Chairman David R. Obey 
(D-Wis.) last week surprised colleagues by calling on Clinton to invade Haiti 
and oust its military junta by force. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest criticism was significant for the vehemence with which it came from 
Democrats who are normally loyal. "While I believe President Clinton . . . is a 
man of conscience, this policy toward Haiti is unconscionable and bankrupt, 
morally and politically," said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).

ISRAEL ROUNDS UP 400 PALESTINIANS IN SWEEPING RAIDS; MIDEAST: THE DETAINEES ARE 
SUSPECTED OF BACKING THE RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUP HAMAS. THEIR ARRESTS COME AMID 
SUICIDE ATTACKS BY ITS MILITARY WING. 
</P>

<P>
 In a massive pre-dawn sweep Tuesday, Israeli security forces arrested more 
than 400 Palestinians on suspicion of supporting a radical Islamic group whose 
military wing has launched suicide attacks that have killed 13 Israelis this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving through Islamic strongholds in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, 
Israeli troops and intelligence agents detained leaders and activists from 
Hamas, from its armed underground units -- the Izzidin al Qassam Brigades -- 
and from the Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military sources said that more than 200 men were detained from Gaza 
and another 200 from West Bank towns and that the sweeps were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim (of the roundup) was to deliver a severe blow at the operational 
structure of Hamas to disrupt their operations," said Col. Renaan Gissin, a 
military spokesman. "The concentrated effort was to send a clear message to 
Hamas that we will not let go of them and will not tolerate such activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad strongly oppose Israel's agreement with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-government. They recently 
intensified their attacks on Israeli targets, striking beyond the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip into Israel itself in an apparent attempt to disrupt the ongoing 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The roundup operation is the largest since Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin forced 
415 Muslim fundamentalists, also members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, into exile 
in southern Lebanon in December, 1992 -- only to bring all of them back a year 
later under international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will fight those who continue terror with all the means that are available 
to us," Rabin said of the new operation. "The only limitation is the limitation 
of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources said about 75 men were detained in Gaza City, about 15 in 
the Jabaliya refugee camp, 30 in Rafah and dozens more in Khan Yunis and Deir 
al Balah. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazans said that some of those arrested there had been detained in the past 
for ties to Hamas, others are relatives of suspected Hamas guerrillas and a few 
are relatives of Hamas leaders. Many of those for whom the troops were 
searching were not home and are apparently in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hebron in the West Bank, residents said about 25 Hamas backers were 
arrested. There were further arrests in Ramallah, Nablus and Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mahmoud Zahar -- a Hamas leader in Gaza City who was deported in 1992 but 
who has not been rearrested -- dismissed the roundup as a Rabin effort to 
convince Israelis that he is indeed taking a tough line on security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO leaders charged that the arrests were an attempt to appease Israeli public 
opinion and will undermine negotiations between Israel and the PLO on 
implementing the agreement on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a snag in the negotiations, but I doubt they will be stopped 
because of the arrests," said Zakariya al Agha, the PLO leader in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 activists from Hamas -- as the Islamic Resistance Movement is 
known in Arabic -- are already in jail. The PLO is pressing in the negotiations 
with Israel for their release, but Israel has so far refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation actually began last week with the arrest of several hundred 
suspected Hamas supporters, including more than 70 Friday, as police searched 
for those involved in two bus bombings in Israel this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas has declared that it will carry out five major attacks on Israeli 
targets to avenge the Feb. 25 massacre by a Jewish settler of Muslims praying 
at a mosque in Hebron. It took responsibility for the two bombings and an ax 
attack on Israeli buses this month. Islamic Jihad claimed a shooting attack 
against a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 In a leaflet released Tuesday, Hamas said that the ax attack Monday that left 
four Israelis wounded -- two of them by gunfire directed at the attacker -- was 
the third of the revenge attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamas' hard-line opposition to Israel may be easing. A leader of the 
movement said in comments published Tuesday that the group is ready to make 
peace if Israel withdraws from the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mousa abu Marzouk, with Hamas' political office in Damascus, Syria, appeared 
to back away significantly from Hamas' previous insistence on the annihilation 
of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the enemy government wants a way out of the crisis it is living through," 
he reportedly told the weekly Al Sabeel, the mouthpiece of Jordan's Muslim 
Brotherhood, "then we say that the way out is through a total withdrawal from 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem and the removal of all (Jewish) 
settlements in the territories." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas' position has been that Israel's entire Jewish population should be 
evacuated to Europe and the United States and an Islamic state created in its 
place.

EPA'S LEAD WARNING AD CALLED HEAVY-HANDED; TV SPOT WAS YANKED IN THE NORTHWEST, 
WHERE THE HAZARD IS BELIEVED RARE. CRITICS SAY COSTLY TESTS AREN'T FOR 
EVERYONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's the kind of public service spot usually aired on television in the wee 
hours of the morning. The scene is a child's bedroom filled with toys. As a 
musical mobile rotates above a crib, the urgent voice of actress Phylicia 
Rashad warns of an unseen threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poisonous lead that hides in dust, in paint, in water. A child can eat it, 
drink it, even breathe it. . . . One out of six preschoolers has high levels of 
lead in their blood." Viewers are told to call an 800 number for a brochure 
that lists as Step 1: Get your child tested for lead poisoning, even if he or 
she seems healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 While stations around the country played this ad last year, it was blacked out 
in much of the Northwest. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, one of the 
sponsors, pulled the spots at the urging of Washington state medical 
authorities -- among them the state's chief health officer, who advised that it 
not be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 Their argument: The campaign needlessly scares parents over an environmental 
hazard they believe is relatively rare in Washington and other parts of the 
West. Moreover, some say, blood lead testing is an expensive and 
anxiety-producing procedure with erratic accuracy, and only children with 
extremely high levels are treated for poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a frightening, frightening commercial," said Dr. Abraham Bergman, the 
head of pediatrics at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and a persistent 
critic of federal efforts to get every child's blood tested for lead. The same 
blackout may occur here again this spring as the EPA plans another lead 
awareness campaign using the same announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a medical question," said Bergman, who after 30 years of practice 
in Seattle has never seen a case of lead poisoning. "The EPA has no expertise 
(in medicine), yet they become zealots." Instead, he suggests, the government 
should throw its finite resources into environmental controls in those places 
where lead is still a problem, and toward more pressing public health concerns 
where it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the lead is, and where it isn't, is at the crux of this often-heated 
debate. "In an ideal world, we'd like to be screening those who need it, and 
not screening those who don't," said Dr. Peter Briss of the national Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. In the meantime, "the benefits of 
identifying the higher level cases are worth the testing." 
</P>
<P>
 High levels have often been linked to lead paint in older urban housing more 
common to Eastern cities, and less frequently in similar neighborhoods of 
California and the West. Critics argue that many areas of the West have such 
low levels that blood testing is one of the least efficient ways to find 
poisoning cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A study in Orange County last year found so few children with high levels that 
it concluded: "In jurisdictions with newer housing, initial screening (an 
interview) for a history of possible lead exposure alone" may be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 At sufficient levels, lead can damage a number of systems in the body, 
especially the developing brain and nervous system in fetuses and preschool-age 
children. Lead was banned in paint and gasoline by the early 1980s. The CDC 
radically lowered the blood lead safety threshold in 1991, even as studies were 
showing drops in the nation's blood lead level. 
</P>
<P>
 "On average, most Americans' lead exposure has declined," Briss said. "This is 
the good news. The bad news is that there is an increasing body of evidence 
that lead has more subtle effects" at the lower levels, including small but 
significant effects on IQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost estimates of testing every American child range from the CDC's guess of 
under $1 billion over five years, to the tens of billions of dollars when 
associated expenses are included, such as abatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of universal screening say geography is no reliable predictor of 
lead problems. "It sounds attractive to say, 'That's not a problem here, our 
housing stock isn't at risk,' " said Thomas Burke of the Johns Hopkins School 
of Public Health. "But there's lots of missing pieces, and we don't understand 
all the pathways of exposure. Do you want to err on the side of the angels, or 
on the other side?" 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents contend that in an age of drug-addicted and HIV babies, where 
less than half the country's toddlers are fully immunized against routine 
diseases, the angels may be on many sides, all of them expensive to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the push for universal screening breeds a false confidence in 
the public mind about what testing can medically accomplish. "There is no 
'treatment' for moderately or slightly elevated blood lead levels," Bergman 
said. When those levels turn up in an individual, "you don't do anything 
anyhow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for universal screening is also being questioned in other areas. The 
45,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics wrestled with it last year before 
deciding to recommend two tests before children turn 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 But in February, the academy's journal, Pediatrics, published articles 
examining the debate over blanket screening. In a commentary, associate editor 
Dr. Birt Harvey expressed doubt over the policy's cost-effectiveness. Tobacco 
Debate Heats Up 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco opponents sharpen their attack as the tobacco industry defends itself 
from allegations that cigarettes contain harmful chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Questionable Mix 
</P>
<P>
 The eight chemicals among cigarette additives most questioned by tobacco 
opponents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Megastigmetrienone: a flavoring tobacco companies contend is found naturally 
in grapefruit juice and considered safe by the food industry. FDA could not 
confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dehydromenthofurolactone: a flavoring tobacco companies say is found in 
peppermint and considered safe by the food industry. FDA couldn't confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethyl furoate: found naturally in coffee, kiwi and peanuts. FDA has not 
formally ruled on the issue, but said the food industry considers it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maltitol: a sweetener used in chewing gum and candy for diabetics. The food 
industry considers it safe, but FDA has not ruled on a petition questioning the 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sclareolide: a synthetic form of a naturally occurring tobacco element. The 
food industry considers it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco extract: used to boost flavor of tobacco; companies say it does 
contain a small amount of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ammonia: a processing aid. FDA considers certain forms of ammonia safe in 
foods but could not comment on the type in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Methoprene: an insecticide that toxicologists say is biodegradable and works 
by stopping insects from growing to adulthood.

THE BOSNIA DILEMMA; U.S. TO SEEK NATO ALLIES' SUPPORT FOR BEEFED-UP THREATS 
AGAINST SERBS; MILITARY: POLICY WOULD INCLUDE WIDER AIR STRIKES AS WELL AS 
TOUGHER SANCTIONS. IT DEPENDS ON ASSENT FROM EUROPEANS, RUSSIANS.

 The Clinton Administration will seek European and Russian support for new 
military and diplomatic pressure against Serbian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
including wider air strikes against military targets and stiffer economic 
sanctions against Belgrade, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials hope that a new series of threats and a tightening of 
the economic screw will induce the Bosnian Serbs to forfeit territory won by 
force and return to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Bosnian Serbs -- with support from their staunch allies in Serbia 
-- have not been intimidated by limited North Atlantic Treaty Organization air 
strikes and have repeatedly broken diplomatic promises to cease assaults on 
Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Administration policy, like all of its previous policies, depends on 
allied assent to the use of broad military power and goodwill on the part of 
the Bosnian Serbs, conditions that have proven elusive despite 15 months of 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the latest Administration proposal, announced after three hours of 
White House meetings among Clinton and his top foreign policy advisers, appears 
to be an increased willingness by Moscow to lean heavily on its traditional 
Serbian allies to withdraw from the besieged town of Gorazde and abide by 
cease-fire agreements elsewhere in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Monday asked the United States 
and its NATO allies to prepare to deliver a series of air attacks on Bosnian 
Serb targets in the wake of the assault on Gorazde, one of six Bosnian Muslim 
towns declared safe areas by the United Nations last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior official said the new Administration proposal will be "responsive" to 
Boutros-Ghali's request for increased use of force in Bosnia but will also seek 
European and Russian participation in a diplomatic initiative designed to quell 
the conflict in the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important here that we combine the military and power 
relationships on the ground with the diplomatic (initiatives)," said a senior 
Administration official, trying to portray the latest Bosnia policy as more 
muscular than its previous incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The use of power without diplomatic ends is purposeless, and the use of 
diplomacy without power will fail," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 Another foreign policy official said the immediate focus will be to pressure 
or punish Bosnian Serb forces to force them to lift the siege of Gorazde, which 
is jammed with vulnerable Bosnian Muslim refugees from the surrounding 
countryside. Gorazde was essentially in Serbian control on Tuesday, and a State 
Department official described conditions there as "awful." 
</P>
<P>
 If the siege is lifted, Washington then hopes to establish an "exclusion zone" 
around the city that would force the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw all guns to a 
safe distance and to allow aid convoys into the city, as was done around 
Sarajevo earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The protections would then be extended to other safe areas -- the Bosnian 
towns of Tuzla, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior American official summarized the Clinton proposal as including two 
parts: a beefed-up military plan to protect the safe areas coupled with a 
diplomatic effort to get the negotiations going. He said there is also "an 
effort to get Serbia to focus on its responsibilities. We're hoping the 
Russians will help on that." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes a major effort to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to release the 
more than 100 U.N. peacekeepers they have detained. One option, according to a 
U.S. official, is to warn the leaders of Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs that the 
West will hold them personally responsible for the fate of the detained 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher began contacting top allied and Russian 
officials Tuesday night to outline the Administration proposal. Christopher 
might travel to Europe next week to try to restart the stalled Bosnian peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO ambassadors were to take up the American plan beginning this morning in 
Brussels; the United States also will discuss with its major allies and Russia 
whether to hold an international conference at a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said in a brief statement that he was encouraged by Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin's tougher tone in discussing the behavior of the Bosnian 
Serbs. Yeltsin also proposed a high-level meeting to urgently address the 
political and humanitarian disaster in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I presume from his statement today that he's sufficiently concerned about 
what's happened in the last couple of days (in Gorazde) that he thinks maybe we 
ought to go ahead and do it now," Clinton said. "I think it deserves serious 
consideration, and I want to discuss it with him and with the other nations 
that would be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, mindful of the failure of past policy proposals from Washington, also 
said, "We simply must not be on record in favor of any policy we are not 
prepared to follow through on." 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor of Tuesday's exchanges seemed to reflect two bedrock American 
principles: There will be no unilateral American military action against Serbia 
or the Bosnian Serbs, and there will be no commitment of U.S. ground forces 
until there is an enforceable peace agreement among all the warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton appears to be willing to risk a handful of American pilots in a 
stepped-up air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs but has no stomach -- and 
little political or public support -- for the use of U.S. infantry. The 
American public narrowly supports the use of air power in Bosnia but 
overwhelmingly opposes the dispatch of ground troops.

THE BOSNIA DILEMMA; YELTSIN WARNS SERBS TO STOP ATTACKS; RUSSIA: THE KREMLIN 
LEADER'S SHARPLY WORDED STATEMENT SHOWS SHIFT IN ATTITUDE TOWARD LONGTIME 
ALLIES.

 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on Tuesday warned the Bosnian Serbs to keep 
their promises to Russia and stop attacking Muslim civilians trapped in the 
U.N. safe area of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's sharply worded statement was a sign that Russia's patience with its 
traditional Serbian allies is wearing thin, as what appeared to be a major 
foreign policy triumph by a resurgent Moscow turns into an embarrassing rout 
for Russian diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian Serb leadership must fulfill its promises given to Russia, stop 
the attacks and withdraw from Gorazde . . . enable the introduction of U.N. 
forces in the area and unblock the U.N. personnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina," 
said Yeltsin's statement, distributed late Tuesday by the semiofficial 
Itar-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin's statement fell far short of endorsing air strikes by the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization on rebellious Serbian armies that are menacing 
Gorazde and Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Yeltsin's special envoy to the former Yugoslav federation, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin, said a group of Bosnian Serb extremists had 
"fallen ill with the madness of war" and had broken cease-fire promises made to 
Moscow. Churkin said he had reversed his previous stance and would now 
recommend to his superiors that Russia support "energetically" new NATO air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's statement said the international community must do its best to 
achieve a political settlement of the Bosnian crisis. He called for a summit on 
Bosnia that would include officials from Russia, the United States, the 
European Union and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl. The Kremlin leader told Kohl that "Russia made and is making the maximum 
effort to prevent the escalation of the crisis around the city of Gorazde," but 
to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian Serbs do not keep their word," Yeltsin said, according to 
Itar-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, still stinging from the betrayal, 
warned the Bosnian Serbs to "stop taxing the patience of the world community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Security Council will meet today to discuss the Bosnian crisis. A 
closed session of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, will 
also be held today. 
</P>
<P>
 But snubbing or punishing the Bosnian Serbs or their allies in Serbia could 
prove politically risky. Neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky has 
championed their cause, and public opinion remains sympathetic.

FRENCHMAN GETS LIFE TERM FOR WWII KILLINGS; WAR CRIMES: THE VICHY REGIME'S 
MILITIA CHIEF ORDERED THE EXECUTION OF SEVEN JEWS IN 1944. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Touvier, the first French citizen tried for crimes against humanity, was 
sentenced today to life in prison for ordering the execution of seven Jews 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The former militia chief of France's collaborationist Vichy government was 
convicted early today of complicity in crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 His conviction, after an emotional five-week trial, was a historic milestone 
for a nation that has struggled to come to terms with its wartime past. 
</P>
<P>
 The 79-year-old Touvier, his face white and tense, swallowed hard several 
times as the verdict was read after 5 1/2 hours of deliberation by the jury. He 
turned around, waved to the courtroom audience and was escorted out by his 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer said Touvier will appeal the verdict. Touvier was also fined $430, 
and civil parties asked the court for one franc -- 17 cents -- in symbolic 
payment for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier admitted ordering the execution of seven Jewish prisoners at 
Rillieux-la-Pape outside Lyons on June 29, 1944, but said he had sacrificed 
them to save the lives of 23 others. He said the Nazis had demanded 30 victims 
to avenge the assassination of Vichy Information Minister Philippe Henriot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement issued before jurors began deliberations, Touvier said: 
"I have never forgotten the victims of Rillieux. I think about them every day, 
every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the victims welcomed the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great feeling of satisfaction tonight," said Gerard Benzimra, whose 
brother Claude was one of the victims. "There is no question of vengeance for 
me. What's important is a crime against humanity has not gone unpunished." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was filled with emotional testimony by victims' families as Touvier 
sat stoically in a bulletproof glass booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Jacques Tremolet de Villers made a final appeal for acquittal on 
Tuesday, saying Touvier was accused of war crimes, which cannot be prosecuted 
because the 30-year statute of limitations has run out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an act of war in reprisal for an act of war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier will remain in custody pending his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier was arrested in Nice in 1989 after spending decades as a fugitive, 
harbored in convents, churches and monasteries across France.

CHINESE PREMIER BEGINS GOODWILL TOUR OF CENTRAL ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promising that China will not try to reassert its traditional influence in 
this region, Chinese Premier Li Peng has launched a 12-day tour down the 
ancient Silk Road, which winds through the newly independent Central Asian 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when our economy is developed and our country becomes rich and powerful, 
we will never claim hegemony and will always maintain friendly relations based 
on equal rights," Li told officials in this Uzbek capital Tuesday, the morning 
after his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Shen Guo Fang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman traveling with the 
delegation, added that closer Chinese ties to the former Soviet Central Asian 
republics will not affect relations with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Li, 66, is taking his five-nation tour at a leisurely pace. The visit, first 
planned for last year, was postponed amid rumors that the premier had heart 
problems. Li will visit four of the five former Soviet Central Asian republics 
-- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan -- plus Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the first Chinese leader to pay a state visit to the new nations since 
independence in 1991 and the first to visit Mongolia in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Li will not visit war-torn Tajikistan, which includes a large chunk of 
mountainous territory in the Gorny Badakhshan region that China claims as its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing's biggest worry about its new neighbors on its northwestern flank is 
that the Muslim nations could fan the Islamic fundamentalist movements that 
have already taken root in western China. 
</P>
<P>
 Li is expected to try to build stronger ties with the secular leaders of 
Central Asia as well as reassure them that China has no designs on their land.

RWANDA OFFERS NO SANCTUARY FROM CHAOS; CENTRAL AFRICA: MISSIONARIES REPORTING 
BLOODLETTING ARE STUNNED THAT HOLY PLACES AREN'T SAFE.

 Killing frenzies and large-scale massacres are spreading from the Rwandan 
capital of Kigali to many parts of the anarchic hinterland, Roman Catholic 
missionaries here said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid new fighting and the shelling of refugees in Kigali, missionaries devoted 
to what is nominally Africa's most Catholic country told of heartbreak and 
heroism in a tortured land. 
</P>
<P>
 A Spanish nun recounted how hospital patients paid their executioners for 
swift death. And a 76-year-old Italian lay missionary told her son by radio 
that food is almost gone but "I am not leaving without the children" -- 42 
orphans marooned in the lawless countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports filtering into the headquarters of missionary organizations by 
telephone and radio Tuesday from Burundi and other neighboring countries 
depicted apocalyptic savagery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke with a senior church official in Burundi this morning who told of 
horrible new massacres in Rwandan parishes near the border. The killing 
continues. We will never know how many died, but I believe it must be 100,000 
already," said the Rev. Pedro Sala, assistant general of the Society of 
Missionaries of Africa, the largest order of foreign priests. 
</P>
<P>
 One French member of the order was killed in the violence that has gripped the 
nation of 7 million since earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sala, who was in Kigali when the killing started April 6 after the deaths of 
the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, said massacres have spread in recent days 
to areas east and west of the capital where most people are members of the 
Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's reports told of "horrible massacres" of civilians in the parishes of 
Cyahinda and Kibeho near the Burundian border, Sala said. Soldiers and 
civilians of the Hutu majority committed the atrocities in Kigali, missionaries 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali, fighting continues between the mostly Hutu army and mostly Tutsi 
insurgents while surviving civilians huddle for their lives in usually 
ramshackle dwellings without electricity, water or food. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters news agency reported from Kigali on Tuesday that nine Rwandans were 
killed and 170 more were wounded when 30 shells slammed into a crowd of around 
4,000 hungry refugees at the national soccer stadium, a landmark of the 
desolated capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a battle for power, for economic advantage and for survival that is 
being fought in the context of a race war," said Sala, who served six years as 
pastor of a Kigali parish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Franiszek Filipiec, a Polish priest with the Marian Fathers, who have 
a large mission in a rebel-controlled area of northern Rwanda, said there were 
reports of massacres of dozens of people in different settlements in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence between Hutus and the Tutsi is a tragic constant of national life in 
Rwanda, Africa's most densely populated country. Still, the current round of 
killing has stunned missionaries in part because the rampage of 
machete-wielding mobs and army troops has violated the unwritten rules of 
ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always before, frightened people sheltered safely at churches and in the 
compounds and residences of the religious. This time there is no asylum. We 
don't understand why they will not respect the holy places. Women and children 
have been wantonly slaughtered, sick children murdered in their hospital beds. 
It surpasses understanding," Filipiec said. 
</P>
<P>
 Missionaries say about 20 priests have been murdered, almost all of them 
Rwandan and almost all Tutsi. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as dawn broke on the morning after the plane crash that killed Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprian Ntayamira, troops 
of the elite Presidential Guard raided a retreat house in Kigali run by the 
Society of Jesus, the Jesuits. Three Belgian Jesuits were locked up in one 
room. In another, the soldiers killed 11 nuns, three Rwandan Jesuits and five 
other African priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuns and priests appear to have been "the principal target" as the violence 
began, the Rev. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, head of the Jesuit order, said in a 
letter to senior leaders of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the stories now emerging from the Rwandan slaughter, none is more tragic 
than that of Spanish Sister Pilar of the Missionaries of Jesus, Mary and 
Joseph. The 63-year-old missionary told reporters in Madrid that when the 
killers came to a hospital the nuns ran in the town of Kibuye, about 50 miles 
from Kigali, the patients realized they had no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients, who died by the hundreds, paid the assassins to kill them 
quickly and not with machetes," she said. "We saw children of 6 killing with 
machetes. Many of them were Catholics, and we knew them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Pilar said the nuns hid Tutsi patients, a nurse and four orphans and 
convinced Hutu killers that all the Tutsi were dead by showing them heaps of 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 There were around 1,100 nuns and 500 priests in Rwanda when Pope John Paul II 
visited in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 70 Catholic missionary orders, mainly European, work in Rwanda, but six 
pulled up stakes last year and Filipiec expects that 20 more may follow them. 
About two-thirds of foreign missionaries who make up the majority of the 
country's priests have left the country, with the remainder either unable to 
leave or refusing to go. 
</P>
<P>
 One missionary who is staying is Amelia Barbieri, an obstetrician who answered 
a magazine call for lay missionaries 10 years ago. At 76, she runs an orphanage 
near Muhura in an area controlled by Tutsi rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tens of thousands of refugees outside and 42 orphans inside with 
Barbieri and a handful of Rwandan assistants, her son Piercarlo said by phone 
from the family home in northern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Monday, Mama was afraid they would be attacked. Today she told us on the 
radio that they were safe but there was very little food left. She could have 
left, but she's insisted from the first day that she would not go without the 
children. She says if she goes it's their death sentence," the missionary's son 
said.

WILSON PLANS IMMIGRATION OFFENSIVE; POLITICS: THE GOVERNOR, WHO SAYS ILLEGAL 
ENTRANTS SAP THE STATE'S JOBS AND BUDGET, WILL MOUNT A 10-DAY BLITZ ON THE 
ISSUE. CRITICS DISMISS THE STRATEGY AS A REELECTION PLOY.

<P>
 Returning to a theme that has resounded with voters, Gov. Pete Wilson plans to 
devote much of the next 10 days to events focused on illegal immigration, the 
problems it causes and his proposed solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a trip to El Paso on Thursday and ending next week with the 
filing of a lawsuit against the federal government, Wilson will highlight his 
view that illegal immigrants are sapping the state's budget, taking jobs from 
legal residents and burdening hospital emergency rooms, especially in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's aides say the renewed emphasis on immigration is meant to underscore 
the governor's message that California is the victim of failed federal policy. 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress nearing a key decision on a major crime bill and the federal 
budget, Wilson is trying to turn up the heat on lawmakers and President Clinton 
to reimburse California for the cost of providing services, including prison 
cells, to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor's critics, including White House officials and spokesmen for 
Democrats competing for the nomination to oppose him in the fall, say Wilson is 
exploiting the issue in an attempt to jump-start his reelection campaign; polls 
still show him running behind his most likely challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Paso, the Republican chief executive will view the so-called border 
blockade established by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Officially known as Operation Hold the Line, the project has resulted in an 
estimated 73% reduction in illegal border crossings in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson acknowledges that the El Paso experiment cannot be duplicated 
in California because the terrain along the international border between San 
Diego and Tijuana is much more rugged than in west Texas, he says the Border 
Patrol could do more to stop illegal immigrants from entering California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will follow up his Texas trip with a speech in Los Angeles on Monday 
outlining the framework for the state's suit against the federal government. 
The lawsuit will seek reimbursement for the $2.5 billion Wilson says it costs 
the state to provide education and emergency health care to illegal immigrants 
and to imprison about 15,000 illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on Monday, Wilson will travel to San Francisco to address a national 
conference on immigration issues sponsored by the Pacific Research Institute 
and the Manhattan Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 After several media interviews on the subject Tuesday, Wilson will take a 
day's respite from the immigration beat and then visit Los Angeles and San 
Diego on April 28 and 29 for several more events, including the filing of the 
federal lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled spate of immigration events is the clearest example to date of a 
new communications strategy in which Wilson hopes to saturate the state for 
days at a time with a single subject. Devised by Leslie Goodman, the governor's 
new deputy chief of staff, the strategy is an outgrowth of the "message of the 
day" that Ronald Reagan used as President to convey his ideas clearly to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said she believes that the public understands and supports Wilson's 
opposition to illegal immigration. But she said Californians are not as 
familiar with the steps the governor advocates to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the people of California to understand the actions that Pete Wilson 
has taken on all fronts -- in the Legislature, in Congress and finally through 
the courts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Epstein, a White House political aide who keeps tabs on California 
issues, said that Wilson's renewed activism is ill-timed and that his criticism 
of the Clinton Administration is unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said Clinton has beefed up the Border Patrol and fulfilled the federal 
government's legal obligation to reimburse the state for costs associated with 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done more in 12 months than had been done in the previous 12 years by 
Republican administrations," Epstein said. "This all existed while Pete Wilson 
was a U.S. senator and while he was governor. It's curious that he never made 
much of an issue about it until we had a Democrat in the White House and he was 
running for reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 Payment of the money Wilson is asking for is not required by law, Epstein 
said. A task force of federal and state officials is studying the issue and is 
expected to make recommendations on possible changes this summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's potential Democratic foes in California have said they support his 
pursuit of federal funds and, like the governor, believe the U.S. government 
should do more to secure the border. But they have criticized Wilson for the 
tone of his rhetoric and questioned his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has chosen to exploit the passions that attach themselves to this 
issue by making it very personal," said Darry Sragow, campaign director for 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that the issue has been a political plus for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll in September found that 92% of registered voters 
considered illegal immigration to be a problem, and 77% said it was a major 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the poll's respondents said Wilson's immigration proposals 
made them feel more favorable toward him, while only 12% said the ideas made 
them less favorable toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Times poll taken last month shows that the fervor over illegal 
immigration is not as great as it was.

EFFORT TO ENSURE INFANT VACCINATIONS URGED; HEALTH: A REPORT CALLS FOR ALL 
CHILDREN TO BE IMMUNIZED BY AGE 2. TODAY, FEWER THAN 70% OF 2-YEAR-OLDS IN THE 
NATION ARE PROTECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Citing the distressingly low rate of infant immunizations in this country, the 
Institute of Medicine urged the public health community Tuesday to adopt 
innovative measures to ensure that all children receive their vaccinations by 
the age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
 A report issued by a special panel of the institute, part of the National 
Academy of Sciences, recommended greater collaboration among physicians, 
families and public health officials to achieve comprehensive immunizations. It 
encouraged pediatricians, for example, to administer as many vaccinations as 
possible during a single office visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the age of 2, all children are supposed to have received nearly their full 
set of immunizations, but fewer than 70% of 2-year-olds in this country have," 
said Lorraine V. Klerman, chairwoman of the department of maternal and child 
health at the University of Alabama. Klerman chaired the institute panel 
studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A childhood immunization initiative introduced by President Clinton last year 
designates 1996 as the target date for achieving comprehensive immunization of 
2-year-olds. During the last five years, numerous outbreaks of 
vaccine-preventable diseases -- such as measles -- have focused attention on 
low immunization rates among preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccines are available for virtually all major common childhood illnesses 
except chicken pox. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to license a 
chicken pox vaccine by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 95% of American children are fully immunized by the time they enter 
school, a figure that "is in sharp contrast to the unacceptably low 
immunization rates" for those aged 2 or younger, the report noted. Public 
schools typically require immunization upon entry, accounting for the higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rates are especially low among minority preschool children, 
incomplete immunization is "a widespread problem" for all socioeconomic levels, 
the report said. Statistics for 1992, for example, show that more than 70% of 
2-year-olds who were not protected against measles were white, and a similar 
proportion were not living in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Various barriers contribute to under-immunization, the panel said. Chief among 
them is the health care system itself, which often emphasizes acute care over 
preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors include lack of education, limited access to health care, 
personal and cultural characteristics that make families unaware of the risk 
and severity of illness, and the failure of health care providers to adequately 
monitor patients' immunization status. 
</P>
<P>
 The responsibility for achieving full immunization must be shared by public 
health officials, health care providers, families and communities, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel urged physicians to become more aggressive in ensuring that 
youngsters receive the necessary shots. 
</P>
<P>
 It recommended that they maintain accurate records and regard all visits as 
opportunities to screen, educate and vaccinate eligible children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A newborn child's first immunization appointment can be made in the hospital 
before the mother and child are discharged," the report said.

EPA REPORTS 4-YEAR DROP IN TOXIC WASTE RELEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The amount of toxic waste released into the environment by U.S. industries has 
declined for four consecutive years, even though total production of dangerous 
chemical compounds has continued to increase, federal officials reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency said that industries participating in its 
annual pollutant survey reported releasing a total of 3.2 billion pounds of 
toxic pollutants into the nation's air, land and water in 1992, down 6.5% from 
1991. Toxic emissions have fallen 35% over four years as industries adopt 
improved recycling and waste treatment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Toxic Release Inventory, an analysis of toxic industrial pollutants 
prepared yearly since 1988, was hailed by EPA officials as a sign that the 
state of the nation's environment is improving -- at least slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reported decline in air and land releases is obviously welcome news," 
said Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the continuing release of toxic substances into the environment is 
cause for concern, EPA officials cautioned. Of 1992's total emissions, about 6% 
-- or 197 million pounds -- are known cancer-causing chemicals or suspected 
carcinogens. And while the release of toxic chemicals into the air declined 
almost 10% in 1992, releases into rivers, lakes and streams increased by 12% 
during the same period, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, EPA officials acknowledged what environmental activists long have 
charged: The agency's annual inventory actually encompasses only a fraction of 
the pollutants produced and released by American industries. Businesses such as 
electric utilities, airports and recyclers are not required to report their 
toxic releases, although all are believed to contribute significantly to 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among those industries required to submit tallies of their toxic 
releases, compliance is widely believed to be incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxic chemicals most commonly released into the environment are ammonia, 
hydrochloric acid, methanol, phosphoric acid and toluene. 
</P>
<P>
 The five states with the largest reported releases were Louisiana, Texas, 
Tennessee, Ohio and Indiana -- the same as in 1991. California ranked 14th in 
the nation; a total of 1,830 facilities in the state reported producing about 
648 million pounds of toxic waste, of which about 10% was released into the air 
or water or onto land. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the state's largest polluters are in Southern California: GR Foam in 
Orange County, which released 1.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the 
air; Crain Industries Inc. in Compton, with just under 1.1 million pounds of 
air pollutants released; Molycorp Inc. in San Bernardino County, which released 
50,422 pounds of air pollution and deposited 969,215 pounds of toxic chemicals 
onto land; Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long Beach, which released 986,660 pounds of 
air pollution; and E.R. Carpenter Co. Inc. of Riverside, which reported 882,610 
pounds of toxic air emissions.

KEVORKIAN'S ASSISTED-SUICIDE TRIAL OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury is slated to decide for the first time whether Jack Kevorkian, famed as 
"Dr. Death," has violated Michigan's assisted-suicide ban, while the state 
continues to grapple with the issue of what to allow when the ill want to end 
their pain by ending their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Michigan Legislature made it illegal in February, 1993, to help 
another person commit suicide, Kevorkian has been charged four times with 
violations, and the total number of suicides at which he has been present has 
climbed to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian has been jailed twice, staging hunger strikes in protest both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Three lower-court judges, all for different reasons, declared the law 
unconstitutional, dismissing charges in the cases before them. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the fourth case, Detroit Recorder's Court Judge Thomas E. Jackson 
ordered a trial. On Tuesday, in Jackson's courtroom, selection began of a 
citizens' panel to weigh Kevorkian's role in the death of Thomas Hyde, a 
30-year-old former construction worker who could barely swallow, speak or move 
because of the degenerative Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, it will not settle the status of physician-assisted 
suicide here. The Michigan Court of Appeals is still reviewing the ban, and 
even that long-awaited ruling could be appealed further to the state and U.S. 
Supreme Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban itself is a temporary measure, expiring in November. An appointed 
commission is supposed to report recommendations for a permanent law to the 
Legislature next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kevorkian has launched a campaign to collect signatures for a 
separate statewide vote. Janet Good, president of the Hemlock Society of 
Michigan and a ballot drive coordinator, said 256,000 valid signatures must be 
submitted by July 1 to secure a place on the November ballot. She said 100,000 
people have signed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kevorkian is convicted of the charge against him now, he faces a four-year 
prison sentence and a $2,000 fine. If he ends up behind bars again, he said, he 
will not fast this time. "I wouldn't give them the satisfaction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet!" Kevorkian called, beckoning to Good as prospective jurors in another 
room filled out a 12-page, 60-question survey of their beliefs regarding 
suicide, religion and politics. "If I'm sitting in jail, how does it affect the 
petition process? 
</P>
<P>
 "Now be honest," he said, smiling, as his friend approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Good laughed, then answered quietly, "It'd help." 
</P>
<P>
 By afternoon, Kevorkian was studying Japanese at the defense table, while the 
judge and lawyers asked jurors about their families' health. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break, Kevorkian said, "This is a play, not a jury trial. This is the 
only judge in town who doesn't know" the law is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde, of suburban Novi, was the first suicide announced by Kevorkian after the 
ban took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hyde's death Aug. 4, Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, held a news 
conference, as is his custom. He practically begged to be prosecuted. He even 
called reporters together a second time, after Wayne County Prosecutor John 
O'Hair said he had not provided enough detail to be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded on audiotape and by television cameras, Kevorkian explained that he 
had driven Hyde to an island park in the middle of the Detroit River. There, in 
the back of his rusty van, Kevorkian supplied carbon monoxide and secured a 
mask over Hyde's face. The young man released a clamp, allowing the deadly gas 
to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Geoffrey N. Fieger is hoping to introduce another tape -- a 
video of a conversation between Kevorkian, Hyde and Hyde's fiancee, Heidi 
Fernandez, a month before the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to end this; I want to die," says Hyde, thin and shaking in a bright 
orange T-shirt, on the tape. When Kevorkian asks, "Do you have any 
reservations?" Hyde answers: "Oh, no." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom is suffering so," says Fernandez, a hand on Hyde's shoulder. "He wants to 
be free -- to be free of this body. His soul will be free." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Timothy Kenny has objected to allowing the jury to see the tape. 
"Whether Thomas Hyde committed suicide for the most noble of reasons, or 
whether he did it for the most unwise of reasons, is really legally 
irrelevant," Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had not decided yet whether to allow the tape to be played in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy jury selection process showed how many people have been touched by 
the issue of assisted suicide and have strong feelings about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson dismissed seven members of the 66-person pool who said they thought 
they could not judge Kevorkian fairly; all said they did not believe in 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 One man told of watching a terminally ill relative suffer. "I prayed for her 
to die," he said, "but wouldn't want anybody to help her die, only the man 
upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said they thought physician-assisted suicide should be legal. 
"I don't believe anyone should suffer," one said. Another volunteered that he 
often works with Good and the Hemlock Society. 
</P>
<P>
 As the court day ended, the jury still had no official members.

14% OF AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE SUFFERED FROM STROKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being President could be bad for your neurological health, according to a USC 
researcher who has found that 14% -- or six out of 42 -- of U.S. presidents 
have suffered from strokes either during or after their tenure, including 
former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shri K. Mishra, a USC professor of neurology and historian for the 
American Academy of Neurology, had just completed a research paper on the 
incidence of stroke among presidents when Nixon was stricken Monday.He combed 
through historical documents and books to find that: 
</P>
<P>
 Stroke -- which occurs when a blood vessel bringing oxygen to the brain bursts 
or is blocked -- was, predictably, the most common neurological affliction 
among the chief executives. Other neurological disorders include Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Two presidents -- Warren G. Harding and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- died of 
strokes while in office. Thomas Jefferson, who suffered from diabetes and was 
plagued by episodes of memory loss, is believed to have died from a stroke. 
Woodrow Wilson experienced two strokes; the second one killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 While stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the United States, 
its incidence has declined by 50% over the last 15 years, and Mishra says the 
health of presidents follows this trend. The last president to suffer a stroke 
was Dwight D. Eisenhower. He recovered but was left with impaired speech.

HOUSE VOTES $13.5 BILLION FOR STATE PRISON SYSTEMS; CRIME: EARLY RELEASE OF 
VIOLENT CRIMINALS IS TARGETED IN BILL TO HELP BUILD, EXPAND FACILITIES. AMOUNT 
IS QUADRUPLE THAT OF EARLIER PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about the early release of violent criminals, the House voted 
Tuesday to authorize $13.5 billion over five years to help states build and 
operate new or expanded prisons -- more than quadrupling earlier crime bill 
funding proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 One provision -- which passed 376 to 50 with President Clinton's endorsement 
-- allocates $10.5 billion for prisons, with special incentives for states to 
require that violent offenders serve at least 85% of their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the House voted 215 to 206 to authorize $3 billion in spending 
over five years to build state or regional prisons for violent repeat 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tells the states that if you keep violent criminals in prison longer, 
we'll help you build the prisons to hold them," said Rep. Jim Chapman (D-Tex.), 
author of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate-approved version of the crime bill authorized $6 billion for prison 
construction and alternative forms of incarceration, such as "boot camps" for 
first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman proposal would earmark 25% of the funds, or approximately $2.6 
billion, for states that increase the amount of time served by violent 
offenders. The remaining 75% of the money would be allocated to states based on 
their rate of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to target the small percentage of violent offenders who are wreaking 
havoc," Chapman told the House. "To qualify for funds, states must get tougher 
and tougher and tougher on violent criminals across this land." 
</P>
<P>
 No member of the House spoke against the proposal to allocate $10.5 billion 
for prisons, adding to the cost of the $17-billion measure pending in the 
chamber, although 50 lawmakers voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a criminal does a crime, he or she must serve the time," said Rep. Lynn 
Schenk (D-San Diego), while Rep. Bill Baker (R-Danville) added: "It's time for 
violent offenders to be locked up and not walking the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 In other decisions suggesting a get-tough mood on crime, the House expanded 
the role of drug offenses in a "three-time loser" proposal that would require 
life sentences without parole for repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The 303-126 vote on a Republican amendment -- opposed by the White House and 
the Democratic leadership -- would expand the number of offenses subject to the 
"three-strikes-and-you're-out" provision of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, offered by Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.), a serious 
drug offense could count as either the first, second or third "strike." Under 
the version of the bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee, it could 
only be used as a first or second "strike." 
</P>
<P>
 "I take strong exception to those who deny the relationship between drugs and 
violent crime in our country," Solomon said. The Clinton Administration opposed 
his amendment on grounds it would reduce the focus on incorrigible violent 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The House approved an amendment by Rep. Harold L. Volkmer (D-Mo.) to add bank 
robbery, along with robberies and burglaries involving narcotics or other 
controlled substances, to the felonies counting toward a life-without-parole 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 It also knocked out a provision that would have liberalized the system for 
appealing death penalty sentences through habeas corpus proceedings in federal 
courts, after opponents argued that its adoption would effectively halt 
executions. The vote was 270 to 159. 
</P>
<P>
 The House agreed with Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), who argued that the 
provision designed to streamline appeals of death sentences would do more harm 
than good by encouraging even more attempts to get federal courts to reverse 
state court convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt by Rep. Butler Derrick (D-S.C.) to push through a compromise 
amendment on the habeas corpus issue was rejected on a 256-171 roll call.

UCI RESEARCHER'S INTEREST GOES BEYOND TRAINING; CANCER: 'I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT,' 
SHE SAYS OF HER BATTLE WITH THE DISEASE. SHE CREATED A LANDMARK CANCER 
MONITORING PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoda Anton-Culver, one of the three UCI researchers whose study supporting 
breast-conserving surgery for cancer are in the international spotlight today, 
has an interest in the disease that goes far deeper than her medical training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been through it," said the 52-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the Egyptian-born epidemiologist detected cancer in her 
breast and had to make her own decisions about surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most depressing thing is not getting information that will help you," she 
recalled Tuesday. She hopes studies like the one she co-authored, which was 
published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., will help women 
with cancer make those important choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton-Culver's academic interest in cancer spans her entire career. Educated 
in cancer epidemiology, immunology and genetics at St. Andrews University in 
Scotland, she taught at McGill University in Montreal and Creighton University 
in Nebraska before coming to UCI College of Medicine in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, she established the medical school's epidemiology program, then in 
1984 she created a landmark cancer monitoring program for Orange County under a 
new state law. Information collected by this registry, which records 
diagnostician procedures and treatments and follows cancer patients until 
death, provided the data used in the breast cancer study. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County registry served as a model for the statewide cancer registry 
program, which has 12 reporting regions statewide. Today, hospitals and doctors 
statewide are required to report all cancers to their respective registries. 
The Orange County registry has been expanded to include San Diego and Imperial 
counties. Anton-Culver said 19,000 to 20,000 new cancers each year are reported 
to the three-county registry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing with pride to the registry and its vast storehouse of information, 
Anton-Culver said she hopes to use this data to discover the causes of breast 
cancer and find treatments that may increase survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got interested in breast cancer because it is a major problem for the 
nation and for Orange County in particular, which has the highest breast cancer 
rate in the nation," she said. "And I am interested in (breast cancer) because 
it is on the rise and we don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 The lead author of the JAMA article, Anna Lee-Feldstein, was invited by 
Anton-Culver to join the epidemiology program in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do the number crunching," said Lee-Feldstein, who is trained as a 
bio-statistician and who worked previously at the University of Michigan's 
School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Paul J. Feldstein, a professor in the UCI Graduate School of 
Management and the third author on the JAMA article, said the couple decided to 
collaborate because they wanted to merge their diverse professional interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anna and I were thinking of pulling together the things we were interested 
in," he said. "She was interested in epidemiology and I was interested in 
health-care delivery systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldstein, 60, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago 
and wrote a popular textbook called "Health Care Economics," was recruited by 
UCI seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the breast cancer study found that patient treatment and 
survival rates were best at large hospitals and poor at at HMO hospitals. With 
the growth of HMOs and other managed care systems to contain medical costs, 
Feldstein said, "I think the future is for people to request from their managed 
care organizations the kind of outcome measures we talk about in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 All three authors of the breast cancer study expressed amazement at the 
national attention their work has attracted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had publications before and never this kind of publicity associated 
with them," said Lee-Feldstein. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the excitement stems from the timing of the publication, which 
comes amid a controversy about the falsification of results in another major 
breast cancer study. The falsification of data in that international study 
called into question its conclusions, which generally advocated lumpectomy for 
treatment over mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI study bolsters confidence in the less radical, breast-conserving 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Lee-Feldstein said, she and her colleagues had no idea this would 
happen when they completed their study last summer and submitted it to JAMA in 
hope that it would be published. Today it is the magazine's lead article. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is probably an accident of history," she said.

BREAST CANCER STUDY CLEARS DDT, PCBS; HEALTH: NEW RESEARCH BY KAISER 
CONTRADICTS EARLIER FINDINGS. BUT THE REPORT IN NO WAY SUGGESTS THAT THESE 
CHEMICALS ARE SAFE, AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST WARNS. 
</P>

 Contradicting previous findings, a major new study finds no link between 
breast cancer and exposure to the pesticide DDT or to the industrial chemicals 
known as PCBs, Kaiser Permanente researchers in Oakland report today. 
</P>
<P>
 Several previous studies involving small numbers of women had suggested such a 
link, frightening women who live in proximity to farming regions and industrial 
chemical companies. Last week, a study showed that women living near large 
chemical companies on Long Island, N.Y., had an increased risk of developing 
breast cancer after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new study, which appears in the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute, leaves open the possibility that other industrial chemicals may play 
a role in the disease, it seems to eliminate DDT and PCBs as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Epidemiologist Nancy Krieger and her colleagues at Kaiser and the Mt. Sinai 
School of Medicine in New York City studied 300 women from various ethnic 
groups, using frozen blood samples obtained when the women enrolled in the 
Kaiser program in the 1960s, before DDT was banned and the use of PCBs was 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, they found no apparent link between levels of the two chemicals in 
the women's blood and the incidence of breast cancer. Women with the highest 
levels of the chemicals were not more likely to have breast cancer and those 
with the lowest levels were not less likely to have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the definitive study," Krieger said, "but I think it helps set a 
new standard for future studies." 
</P>
<P>
 Epidemiologist Robert Hoover of the National Cancer Institute, which funded 
the study, complimented its design, but cautioned that the study does not 
completely rule out the role of the two chemicals. "I wouldn't have written 
(the conclusions) so strongly negative," he said. "It turns out this is a more 
complex question than people thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Krieger also noted that her results do not absolve DDT and PCBs of the other 
risks they pose. "It's essential to remember that they have already been shown 
to be carcinogens and to pose health risks to humans and to other animals," she 
said. "This study in no way suggests that these chemicals are safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The concern about the effects of DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls -- PCBs -- 
is based on their tendency to dissolve readily in fat and accumulate in fatty 
portions of the body, such as the breast. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five small studies have attempted to link the chemicals, called 
organochlorines, with breast cancer, with mixed results. Among the most recent 
was a study of 58 women with breast cancer conducted by epidemiologist Mary 
Wolff of Mt. Sinai. Using blood samples obtained an average of six months 
before the diagnosis of breast cancer, Wolff found no link to PCBs, but a 
significant association with DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem with Wolff's study and others, Krieger said in an interview, 
is that breast cancer itself can mobilize organochlorines in breast tissue, 
causing them to appear in the blood in higher concentrations. Six months before 
the diagnosis of breast cancer, many of the women in the New York study 
undoubtedly already had cancer and could have had higher blood levels of 
organochlorines because of it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That problem was eliminated in the Kaiser study, in which Wolff also 
participated, because the blood samples were collected, on average, 14.2 years 
before the cancer was diagnosed. Kaiser's large clientele also allowed the 
researchers to select a broader ethnic representation, more characteristic of 
the population at large, including 50 whites, 50 African Americans, and 50 
Asians with breast cancer. They also identified an equal number of controls 
without the disease. In contrast, 80% of the women in Wolff's earlier study 
were white -- a limitation Wolff acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 When the data for all three races was combined, there was no apparent risk 
from the two chemicals. African American women with high blood levels of the 
chemicals appeared to have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer, 
but the increase was not statistically significant. Nonetheless, Hoover and 
others urged that further studies be done to determine if that increased risk 
for such women is real.

CLOUDS, WINDS DELAY LANDING OF SPACE SHUTTLE

 Dense clouds, tricky crosswinds and a hint of rain forced NASA to cancel 
Tuesday's planned landing of the shuttle Endeavour, giving the crew another day 
to study the Earth from orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Low, dark clouds scuttled a first attempt to land at the space center and 
skies did not clear enough for a second try one orbit later.Because of the way 
the orbit was shaped, there were only two chances to land Tuesday, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour will have two opportunities each to land today at the space center 
or at Edwards Air Force Base in California, flight director Rich Jackson said. 
The first chance for Kennedy is at 8:29 a.m. PDT and the first for Edwards is 
at 9:55 a.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was not considered for landing Tuesday because initial weather 
forecasts at Kennedy had been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials prefer to land 
shuttles at the space center to avoid the cost of ferrying the spacecraft 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle has enough supplies to stay up three more days.
