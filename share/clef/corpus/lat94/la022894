GEORGE RAMOS: POLANCO TURNS HIS BACK ON CHICANO TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Polanco made many Eastsiders angry when he joined the state Assembly 
back in 1986. Now, as he prepares to move on, he's got them angry again. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco, running for the state Senate, has endorsed his chief aide, who is 
white, for his old Assembly seat. At a time when Latinos are working to 
increase their numbers in the Legislature, Polanco's decision has angered 
political activists who believe he should have supported a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't mad at him for snubbing the Chicano backed by his longtime 
nemesis, County Supervisor Gloria Molina. That they can understand. They're 
upset because a non-Latino with Polanco's support could win a seat that has 
been held by Mexican American politicians for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists are so angry that they're pushing Gloria Romero, a well-known 
Latina activist, to run against Polanco in the Senate race, which beforehand 
would have been a cakewalk for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco is unapologetic for his support of Bill Mabie. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Latino doesn't necessarily have to represent the community," he says. "Bill 
is the person who brings the type of community support and commitment to the 
(45th Assembly) District that the community deserves. I happen to think Bill 
will do more for the district than (Molina-backed candidate) Antonio 
Villaraigosa." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco has this knack for getting people angry. He got into hot water within 
hours after he assumed office in 1986 following a bitter election to succeed 
Molina in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 After his swearing-in, Polanco was put on a committee considering the proposed 
construction of a prison near the Eastside. The plan had languished in 
committee for some time but suddenly found life when Polanco arrived on the 
scene. He supported the proposal, casting a decisive vote to send the measure 
to the 80-member Assembly for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he later voted against the prison, by then it was too late. The 
proposal easily passed the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 His committee vote outraged many who felt Polanco had double-crossed them. "He 
sold us down the river," charged East L.A. activist Frank Villalobos. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco's explanation made people angrier. He said he only wanted to give the 
entire Assembly a chance to consider the issue. "Had I known we didn't have the 
floor votes to kill the bill," he said, "I would have voted differently in 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
 I thought Polanco should have apologized, a statesman-like gesture that would 
have put the controversy behind him. To this day, he disagrees, preferring to 
emphasize his role as the Latino caucus leader who ultimately persuaded the 
governor to abandon the prison after an eight-year fight. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, Polanco has worked hard in Sacramento. He battled for state 
monies for child care and AIDS victims. He won over suspicious constituents 
when he found funds for an air-conditioning system for City Terrace Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has been a leading Latino voice against immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I telephoned about the latest furor, Polanco's answers had the same 
unapologetic tone as before. 
</P>
<P>
 What about finding a Latino candidate to support? 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had approached several Latinos about the race, but they turned him 
down. I never heard of some of the people and when I mentioned Derek Alatorre, 
the 29-year-old son of the L.A. city councilman, Polanco acknowledged that he, 
too, said no. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the criticism that his support might lead to the election of a 
non-Latino in an area that has been represented by Chicanos since 1974? 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular case, the people will decide who will represent them," he 
said. "I have participated in increasing the numbers of Latinos in the state 
Legislature. All reapportionment did (in creating districts favorable to Latino 
candidates) is give the community a chance to pick the person of its choice. My 
endorsement doesn't guarantee a seat for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't buy Polanco's arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision to support Mabie as his successor is a slap in the face to all 
the Chicanos, including many who have supported him, who fought long and hard 
to gain a margin of political power for their community. What about all the 
court fights to open up the L.A. City Council and the Board of Supervisors? 
What about the fights in Bell Gardens, in Pomona and other cities where Latinos 
live? 
</P>
<P>
 What about helping your own kind, the same way veteranos like Alatorre and 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) helped Polanco in the beginning? 
</P>
<P>
 By turning his back on that tradition, and the legitimate aspirations for 
Chicano power, Polanco shouldn't be surprised that he's got a lot of folks on 
the Eastside angry at him once again.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE ORGANIZATION'S APPROACH: GET PARENTS TO HELP COLLEGE BOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College enrollment rates among white high school graduates have increased by 
more than 10% since 1980 but rates among African American and Hispanic high 
school graduates have remained largely unchanged. After helping their son 
successfully apply to college Andy and Johnnie Savoy of Cerritos wanted to 
share with other African American and underrepresented families the knowledge 
they gained about how to prepare their children for higher education. They 
organized College Bound, a counseling service, to offer college admission and 
scholarship support for underrepresented students in grades seven through 
college. At the program's core is required parental participation. One Saturday 
morning each month students gather with their parents to learn about and 
prepare for the college application process. Students attend classes, usually 
taught by credentialled teachers, to sharpen their writing and test-taking 
skills while parents attend lectures and discussions led by experts in fields 
like adolescent health or financial aid. Since the program was established in 
1990 enrollment has increased from 39 to more than 200 students, including 84 
who are now in college. And College Bound has linked students with more than 
$170,000 worth of academic scholarships and summer enrichment programs held at 
universities and colleges throughout the country. Counseling and instruction

with College Bound 
</P>
<P>
 There are kids and parents who seek support in the application to college 
because they are not getting satisfaction from their schools -- especially to 
meet the needs that minority students experience. The biggest gap I personally 
experienced with my daughter is that the college counselor (at her high school) 
did not have the resources nor the interest to network to find opportunities 
designated specifically for minority students. For example, they did not 
encourage the minority students that there are educational services and 
programs that would give support to a student who might not qualify for regular 
admission or to help motivate them to make application. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a daughter who went to a private high school. I paid money for a 
college curriculum, and her counselor advised her to go to a two-year college. 
My daughter is now maintaining an above 3.0 GPA at UC Irvine as a result of 
College Bound intervention. And it's not just my daughter -- most of the 
students that come into College Bound have very high potential; the expectation 
from their families is there, but the expectation is not in the school for the 
minority child. 
</P>
<P>
 I think College Bound provides parents with an awareness of the responsibility 
they must take to ensure their children's college experience, that they cannot 
rely solely on the high school their child attends. College Bound is an arm 
that reaches to college campuses, connects them with students and touches 
parents to heighten their awareness of the type of commitment they must have.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, college has always been a part of the recipe for my children. 
College Bound was another voice that came into my house, another voice in my 
children's ears that college is important, that it is rewarding, that this is 
the way to get where you want to be. A STUDENT'S VIEW

 I go to an all boys' school, predominantly white. With your counselor you can 
only get so much; a counselor has to deal with lots of students. College Bound 
offers direction and support. What's behind it is to take you as far as you 
want to go in all your schooling, to whatever level you want -- college, 
graduate school, medical school. I get to meet with and learn from people who 
understand me. It's an important addition to my social circle and my cultural 
circle. It's opened doors for me that I would have never seen.  
</P>
<P>
 College Bound is extremely important for the African American community 
because there's a perception that African American males are either gang 
banging, selling drugs or doing something they're not supposed to be doing. 
College Bound keeps us straight, gives us focus, puts us in an environment that 
is comfortable -- you're with your peers and it's fun.  
</P>
<P>
 There's been many times I've felt I've been on my own because my Mom may be 
working, and I don't live with my father. With my Mom in College Bound with me 
I feel more emotional and mental support.  
</P>
<P>
 Before this year I had never seen my Mom so into my work. Freshman and 
sophomore year I did well in school, and I would bring my report card home, and 
my Mom would say, "Good." Junior year I joined College Bound and my Mom went to 
the meetings. She hears about what we go through and what we have to do as 
teen-agers today. Now she tells me to do homework. I see her walking into my 
room, asking if I have any homework to do, telling me to get off the phone. The 
fact that she got up, walked to my room and said it means the whole world to 
me. TO GET INVOLVED

 For information about College Bound call (310) 860-2127. College Bound 
expenses are financed by donations and proceeds from an annual student 
registration fee. Fee scholarships are available, and arrangements to obtain an

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; NOW 
IS THE TIME TO BE A GOOD SPORT; NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY ENCOURAGES 
ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES, STUDENT ATHLETES, PARENTS AND FANS TO DISCUSS FAIR 
PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS GOUGH, Russ Gough, a professor of ethics at Pepperdine University, is a 
1994 Sports Ethics Fellow with the University of Rhode Island's Institute for 
International Sport. The institute's how-to kit for Sportsmanship Day is 
available at (401) 792-2375. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan shows anything, it is that 
athletes who compete with a win-at-all-costs attitude may be skating on thin 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 While enjoying the wintry grandeur of the Olympic games and pondering the 
questions around Tonya Harding's participation, we can observe National 
Sportsmanship Day on Tuesday by helping student athletes keep competition in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Is winning everything? Does sportsmanship matter? Should athletes be role 
models? Is "sports ethics" a contradiction? Is an athlete's or coach's behavior 
necessarily "right" even though they do not violate rules? 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, more than 6,000 schools nationwide, elementary to university, have 
benefited from addressing these questions. According to Olympians Florence 
Griffith Joyner (running) and Tom McMillen (basketball), co-chairs of President 
Clinton's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, "Sports should teach us 
honesty, integrity and humility, as well as develop a sense of fair play and 
excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 Excellence. The ancient Greeks used a very similar word, arete, to describe 
the original Olympic athletes. Arete not only meant excellence in skill but 
excellence in character. "Sportsmanship" is the modern term we use to describe 
playing fairly, respecting the opponent, being considerate in victory and 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmanship should be cultivated in young people if they are to keep 
athletic competition in perspective. "Playing fairly" and "being a good 
winner/loser" are worthwhile ideals because they show us where numbers on 
scoreboards end and where life-enriching qualities of character begin. With 
these themes in mind, here are a few things we can do to promote the ideals of 
National Sportsmanship Day: 
</P>
<P>
 * Suggest to school and community sports leaders that a general code of 
conduct be developed to guide fans, student athletes and coaches at sporting 
events. The code should be visible: Consider printing it on game programs and 
gym posters or around playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * School administrators, teachers and community athletics organizers can 
remind student athletes, parents and fans through mottoes, meetings, posters 
and other means that winning is not everything and that losing does not make 
one "a loser." Publicly praise teams that demonstrate sportsmanship in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage student athletes to be the same on or off the field. This doesn't 
mean they can't play to win, but it does mean they can't let their competitive 
spirit get the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents and teachers should encourage athletes to ask, "Is this action right 
or wrong?" just as much as they ask, "Is this action against the rules?" Tonya 
Harding did not break a law by failing to report the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, 
but she still did not do the "right" thing -- contacting police immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your school has a skillful coach with integrity and ethical character, 
give him or her your support no matter the team's win/loss record. When it 
comes to the educational development of student athletes, winning percentages 
mean as little as the paper on which they are recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop year-round programs to help students prepare for the ethically 
confusing world of today's sports. One example is the Student Athletes Future 
Empowerment (SAFE) program at First A.M.E. Church in L.A. SAFE conducts 
"preventive maintenance" seminars to help athletes prepare for the often 
unsportsmanlike business of college recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 We must teach students that they are all role models. Just because they may 
never become famous athletes does not mean their words, actions and values do 
not influence others. The question is never, "Should I be a role model?" but is 
always, "What kind of role model should I be?"

'ABSTINENCE-ONLY PROGRAMS NOT FOR EVERYONE'

Simi Valley.

 Contrary to the popular adage, I'm inclined to believe that, in most 
circumstances, ignorance is not bliss. In the case of denying birth control 
information to students, ignorance can be downright deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been conflicts in public schools across the country over whether 
and/or when such birth control curricula should and would be taught. Some who 
object argue that any contraceptive method that is not 100% effective should 
not be taught in schools. Others see this as a religious issue rather than one 
of health education, attaching words like "immoral" and "sinful" to the 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Their answer to birth-control education almost always consists of 
religious-based curricula that are often short on facts and long on propaganda. 
Some widely used abstinence-only programs have been challenged in court for 
presenting inaccurate medical information. 
</P>
<P>
 The public should look at any sex-education curricula that stress abstinence 
only and compare them to what common sense tells you about sexuality and 
teen-agers. In other words, is it realistic to expect that every student will 
heed an abstinence-only message? 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, abstinence is the only 100% way to keep safe from pregnancies and 
disease. But if this message is not reaching 100% of the students, wouldn't the 
program, according to beliefs of abstinence-only supporters, be a loser? I 
believe so. 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect world, students could receive barrages of abstinence-only 
messages before they experiment sexually and elect to wait based on health 
concerns or religious reasons. But this is not a perfect world.  
</P>
<P>
 Students who have decided to engage in sex and are not educated about 
protection are at great risk of disease and pregnancies and the complications 
of life that accompany them. The realist realizes that most teen-agers do not 
receive this education at home and that the student who has already made up his 
or her mind will never regard an abstinence-only message, regardless of how it 
may be presented. 
</P>
<P>
 People who object to birth-control education often cite concerns that it 
undermines their role as parents to decide what to teach their children. This 
argument is a fallacy, for if these pious parents teach their children morals 
and values and set good examples, those children will not sway from their 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible educators would agree that programs stressing religious themes 
could have devastating psychological effects on the psyche of a sexually active 
student who would receive the message that he is immoral, sinful, and wrong -- 
bearing out already-existing confusion and guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstinence-only programs are not for everyone. They should not be, for 
students are as diverse religiously as they are racially and each comes from a 
home where values and morals are being stressed by religious and non-religious 
parents alike. Just because some methods of contraceptives are only 80% 
effective does not mean that they should not be used. This is as crude as 
suggesting that chemotherapy should not be used to counteract cancer, since it 
does not work for everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 Sexually active students who are ignorant about protection become victims of 
cruel and misguided censorship. A responsible protective program must stress 
abstinence first and foremost, but also must reach out to students who choose 
not to abstain to avoid sending the message of "I told you so!" to any who fall 
victim to AIDS, other sexually transmitted diseases or premature parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask those who oppose sex education: How could education ever be wrong? How 
could ignorance ever be right? What good is reading, writing and arithmetic to 
a student who will die of AIDS because he or she was denied education by our 
schools? There are many reasons why schools must educate students on life 
issues like protective sex education. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance is not bliss.

COMMENTARY FROM OTHER MEDIA; RAFU SHIMPO; GAME GIVES ASIANS A FIGHTING CHANCE 
IN THE VIDEO ARENA

<P>
From a column by George Johnston in Rafu Shimpo, a Japanese daily published in 
Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Video games are as big a mass medium moneywise as anything Hollywood churns 
out. In "Street Fighter," warriors compete for the title of world's greatest 
fighter.It's goofy, but fun. Given the generally lackluster portrayal of Asians 
by Hollywood, I was pleasantly surprised that of its 12 characters, two are 
Japanese, one is Chinese and a woman, one is South Indian and one is Thai. The 
locales for the battles include Japan, China and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Asian characters and locations are well represented. Some 
might even think Asian characters are overrepresented! But that's to be 
expected when the game's programmers are Japanese. Would there have been as 
many Asian characters if the programmers were American? While I have mixed 
feelings about a generation of youngsters getting hooked on computer games, I'm 
encouraged that these same youngsters, if they're playing "Street Fighter II," 
get introduced to an ethnically diverse cast of characters.

 On Sunday, Feb. 13, The Times published "The Next Los Angeles: Reinventing Our 
Future," a special section intended to spur debate about what residents of Los

 The question is not about preparing for jobs; it's about preparing for 
financial independence. We have to broaden our scope to teach children not only 
about jobs, but about entrepreneurial opportunities as well as investment 
strategies. These are the three ways of making money. Our children need to know 
all of these to be completely well-rounded so when jobs retreat, we won't 
panic. They need to know about other options such as how to access government 
and private and public sources of support. Learning how to take an idea and 
turn it into an opportunity -- problem-solving -- should be taught to our 
children at as young an age as possible. BOB MARLIN

 I believe Berendo Middle School in Los Angeles Unified is the school of the 
future. The school is used six days a week, from early morning to late at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 School starts at 7:40 a.m. There's a parenting skills class, teen peer 
counseling groups, an inoculation clinic. After school ends, there's a school 
advisory board meeting, a homework clinic that uses USC tutors, a a peer center 
and English as a Second Language and citizenship classes for parents. 
Throughout the day, there is group counseling and sessions on drug and alcohol 
abuse and gang involvement. On Saturdays, the school is leased to Koreans who 
teach English to adults and Korean history to children. MARTHA BLAIR

 One of the biggest helps for our schools would be to have smaller classes. I 
also feel that year-round school, even though I can see the pros to it, can 
hurt. It hampers team sports, and more importantly, it's pulling families 
apart. Your greatest support group is your family. Our kids are on a million 
different schedules. There's no time slot to be together as readily as if we 
were on a traditional school schedule. ADRIENNE MOONEY

 The biggest problem with bilingual education is that not enough people -- 
including teachers -- understand it. The goal is to teach students to speak two 
languages, not one. The fastest way to do that is to start off teaching subject 
matters in their native language, Spanish, while they are learning to speak 
English. When the students are proficient enough to survive in an 
English-speaking classroom, that's where they're put. 
</P>
<P>
 I think teachers should start re-educating themselves on bilingual education 
and disseminate the information to their students, parents, the PTA and the 
community. I think once people understand how bilingual education works, there 
will be greater support for it and a greater understanding of the benefits of 
it. RAJ RAMANI

 My proposal is that we graduate children at the age of 16 and direct them to 
two-year community colleges. In those two years, they will be offered either 
vocational, technical or specific courses that prepare them for core education 
classes they can take prior to selecting a major of their choice. Vocational 
and technical programs should prepare them for employment, especially if you 
get industry involved. Parents would have to get more involved too because 
community colleges charge $13 a unit and the money would have to come from 
somewhere or there would have to be scholarships. CHARLES THOMAS

 The biggest problem with a lot of kids is that they've given up because all 
they can see is jobs at (fast-food restaurants). More emphasis needs to be put 
into vocational training, even if a person is going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of times kids have to work. If they have some kind of trade that they 
can work at full time or part time to help earn funds for college or whatever, 
it makes it easier and shows them that they can help themselves, that it's not 
hopeless, that there is a way out. TOBY WEISSMANN 
</P>
<P>
 Student, Orange Coast College, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Classes should be made smaller. There should be some classes that give 
bilingual education. People should also be made aware of what educational 
programs are available on television and radio and what books are the best to 
read besides the assigned books in a given class.

 Helen Johnson works for a U.S. firm owned by a Japanese corporation. All the 
top executives are Japanese men with very limited English-language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 On her second day, Johnson needs to communicate with one of the bosses, Mr. 
Yamashita, about some paperwork on her desk. Conscious of the language barrier, 
she tries using body language to communicate with him. 
</P>
<P>
 After she catches his eye, she raises her hand, palm upward, and crooks her 
index finger moving it in a "come here" motion to beckon him to her desk. When 
Mr. Yamashita sees this, he flies into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The innocent American "come here" gesture in Japan is an obscene signal. 
Johnson was horrified when she discovered that her boss thought she was making 
a hostile sexual suggestion to him. 
</P>
<P>
 After this incident Johnson became so uncomfortable that she wanted to quit. 
However, when she gave notice, Mr. Yamashita refused to accept it because he, 
too, faced a cross-cultural embarrassment: In Japan, employees usually don't 
quit. Despite Mr. Yamashita's protest, Johnson felt so humiliated that she left 
the firm.  
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese are not the only ones to interpret the American "come here" 
signal negatively. Malaysians and people from the former Yugoslavia use the 
gesture to call animals, while Indonesians and Australians use it to attract 
streetwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Gestures do not have universal meaning. What might be innocent to 
Americans could be insulting to those from elsewhere.

 In response to Column One, "A Feud Over Club Meditation," by John-Thor 
Dahlburg, Feb. 5: 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as some surprise that the esoteric topic of whether Osho recommends 
three- or 10-day meditation camps should merit Column One headlines in a city 
known for riot-sized "feuds." Just to set the record straight, those 
disgruntled disciples who complained to your reporter were always free do 
whatever they pleased; they were simply told that if they chose to disregard 
Osho's suggestion, they could not expect the commune to support them by placing 
ads in its newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called empire Dahlburg refers to is a projection of his imagination. 
The truth is that of the many hundreds of entities around the world involved in 
Osho's work, every single one of them is economically independent and only 
spiritually affiliated.

 So, I wish to thank you for the positive parts of your article, and in regards

JET SALE TO SAUDIS

 Your editorial, "Hail to the Chief (Salesman)!" (Feb. 18), regarding President 
Clinton's role in the Saudis' decision to purchase 50 or more jetliners from 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas is very good example of revisionism at work. The 
world knows that it was George Bush who led the fight against Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait, thereby ensuring the safety of the vast Saudi oil fields.The Saudis 
are showing their gratitude to the U.S. with this large order, which helps our 
aerospace industry. Clinton had nothing to do with their decision.

 It is good news that the President helped the Saudis conclude that buying 
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing planes was good business. Now, if we can only 
convince the management of McDonnell Douglas to build the planes here in Long 
Beach, rather than in China as they did the last five commercial planes, 
perhaps California will benefit too!

 Welfare reform is high on every politician's list in Washington. President 
Clinton plans to make good on his campaign promise to "change welfare as we now 
know it" when his Administration submits its proposals to Congress, possibly as 
early as April. Republicans aren't waiting on Clinton. Their bills are already 
in the hopper in the House and Senate. We hope the coming debate results in a 
program that puts recipients to work without sacrificing the well-being of 
children or driving the nation deeper into debt. That's a difficult but not 
impossible goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's welfare task force is expected to allow two years of benefits before 
requiring a recipient to get a job. To encourage the transition to work, the 
government would provide child care, training and, if a recipient couldn't find 
work, a public job such as some form of community service. However, this humane 
approach -- certainly superior to "reforms" that would cut off needy people 
without regard to their children's survival -- could cost as much as $7 billion 
over five years. Washington couldn't afford that sum without savaging other 
federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the cost, Clinton's welfare experts recommend phasing in the 
program. They would start with mothers born after 1970 -- young women 
considered good candidates to escape from welfare. With overall participation 
initially limited, their chances of finding jobs in the private sector would 
improve and the cost would drop because fewer public jobs would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the next generation of welfare mothers would require a small 
investment that could easily pay for itself in the long run because the 
majority of teen-age mothers end up on welfare and these women tend to stay on 
longer than more mature first-time recipients. Prevention is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Phasing in welfare reform also makes sense because a gradual approach would 
allow the government to capitalize on what works and fix what fails before 
mandating wholesale changes. California successfully phased in the state 
workfare program GAIN, although lack of funding limited participation for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar fiscal constraints also severely limited the effectiveness of the 
well-crafted Family Support Act of 1988, a bipartisan welfare reform that Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) shepherded through Congress. Few states could 
afford to pay their shares, so barely 15% of eligible recipients have been able 
to use this program. 
</P>
<P>
 The state expense also makes welfare reform a hot topic in Sacramento. Last 
week gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi put forth his own welfare reform 
program; the Democrat Garamendi, like the Democrat Clinton, is starting to 
sound more like the Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the growing bipartisanship, Congress will consider dozens of proposals 
to encourage or force the 4.5 million parents who receive Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children to become self-sufficient. Phasing in any new program will 
reduce costs and improve the chance of success.

A VITAL AND IMPORTANT SYMBOL FOR THE CITY; THE MAYOR SHOULD GET PUEBLO 
COMMISSION UP AND RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Alfaro Siqueiros' ruined 1932 mural, "America Tropical" -- painted and 
then painted out on a wall overlooking Olvera Street -- is a work of art that 
lies close to the secret soul of Los Angeles. A searing comment on the abuse of 
native peoples, it shows an Indian lashed to a gibbet before a pre-Columbian 
pyramid as an American eagle bares its talons above him. To the right, a 
peasant revolutionary takes aim at the eagle or perhaps at the Indian himself, 
who looks on first glance like Christ crucified but on second like a man facing 
a firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1932, when Siqueiros fled his Mexican homeland, Mexico's peasant revolution 
had betrayed at least part of its origins, and fascist "Gold Shirt" thugs were 
terrorizing communists and labor organizers alike. Siqueiros, who was both, may 
well have had more than one oppressor in mind when he produced this work. Be 
that as it may, the Los Angeles vigilantes who had the work painted over in 
deathly white have now become a grim part of the very history Siqueiros sought 
to present: History includes the whitewashing of history. 
</P>
<P>
 To Los Angeles' great good fortune, the Getty Conservation Institute has taken 
on the task of removing the white paint, stabilizing what remains of the 
18-by-80-foot mural and erecting a rooftop pavilion to welcome visitors. The 
institute, with the Friends of the Arts of Mexico Foundation, will have spent 
nearly $1 million by the time the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it ever be completed? Amazingly, the institute has had to hire a 
full-time employee solely to cope with the overlapping local bureaucracies. The 
institute clearly has done its part, but, after six years, the city has failed 
to meet it halfway. As a result, this extraordinary project may be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, who still has not appointed the commission that is to 
take over the Olvera Street Pueblo -- the original Los Angeles settlement -- 
from the city's parks department, should do so with dispatch. And he should 
appoint commissioners who will make historic preservation their top priority. 
The first question to ask any proposed general manager for the new agency 
should be: Do you have what it takes to bring the Siqueiros project to 
completion? 
</P>
<P>
 If the mural is made the key criterion, then in the end everyone down to the 
smallest merchant will benefit. Arthur Frommer, whose long career in tourism 
began with "Europe on $5 a Day," ranks the allure of "visiting" the past below 
only the need for rest and the appeal of natural beauty as a motive for 
vacation travel. Cities that find a way to make their history visible attract 
tourists and even conventions, he says; cities that don't, don't. For proof, we 
need look no further than Santa Fe, which did, and Albuquerque, which didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the happier history of Los Angeles is made visible in the festive air 
of Olvera Street and the tranquillity of the adjacent Our Lady of the Angels 
mission. But the buried pain of Angeleno history -- and indeed of all North 
American history as a history of conquest -- is made visible at Olvera Street 
only in Siqueiros' mural. We urge the mayor to help make this masterpiece the 
national attraction and local shrine it deserves to become. Los Angeles is a 
city whose secret soul was painted over. It is time to start removing the 
paint.

TO PUT IT CRUDELY: END OIL EXPORT BAN; A TIME-WARPED POLICY NEEDS LIBERATION BY 
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does it make sense to continue to ban U.S. exports of crude oil? No, plain and 
simple. It's high time to get rid of this albatross. The ban is contrary to 
free trade -- and unfairly excludes U.S. crude from international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no oil crisis now; indeed, the world is awash in low-priced oil. Yet 
the prohibition on U.S. crude exports goes on. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting the ban has been called a "no-brainer" by some energy experts, but the 
politics of oil often defy logic. Common sense tells us that forbidding oil 
exports is no substitute for a coherent energy policy. Congress should reject 
the ban when it comes up for review later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall against exports was erected during the 1970s oil emergency. The 
rationale was to provide a measure of self-sufficiency: Oil vital to U.S. 
energy and national security interests wouldn't go to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban has meant that Alaskan producers have little choice but to send their 
oil south instead of abroad; so most of that crude ends up in California. The 
Alaskan oil, in turn, depresses prices here for California-produced heavy 
crude, which is less desirable for domestic refining in the current market. 
California's independent producers say that, given the Alaskan glut, it's not 
profitable for them to pump crude from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But ah, there is a huge overseas market -- especially for Alaskan oil -- in 
Japan and elsewhere. Alaskan crude would be going overseas instead of to 
California were it not for the ban. There have been exceptions to the ban: In 
1991, the Bush Administration granted an export license to two California oil 
companies to sell their heavy crude in Asia. Why not allow the free flow of oil 
for all? 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of lifting the ban cite the need to secure energy resources and the 
threat of higher prices for consumers. They note that the United States already 
imports about half of its oil and that prices here could rise with export 
demand and the increase could be passed on at the pump. Perhaps, but prices 
depend on overall market conditions, domestic production and other 
unpredictable factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Energy plans to launch a study, which will include 
hearings, on lifting the ban. Restricting U.S. oil exports makes little 
economic sense. Our judgment is that those hearings will yield the conclusion 
that the domestic import ban distorts markets and prices and hardly offsets 
U.S. reliance on oil imports.

IMMIGRATION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Think Tank Study Determines Immigrants an Economic Plus" (Feb. 23), the 
issue of "legal" immigration, which I support, must be distinguished from 
"illegal" immigration of people, who have no legitimate right to be here and 
thus should not, and cannot, without bleeding public coffers dry, be afforded 
any of the benefits of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 As a long-time resident of Los Angeles, I believe our undocumented immigrant 
population is vastly underreported; it is much closer to or perhaps even more 
than the one-third of the immigrant population that the Huddle study says is 
illegal. Further, as opposed to Jeffrey Passel's study, Donald Huddle's study 
reporting that immigrants deflate federal, state and local economies is, to the 
best of my knowledge, untainted by the support of any special interest group.

 You're shedding light in the wrong direction when you support the Clinton 
Administration's $540-million-plus initiative, which includes money for 400 
more Border Patrol agents and more border lights ("Humane and Necessary Border 
Control," editorial, Feb. 4). "Throwing money at problems along the border 
won't make them go away," the editorial states. I agree, and money alone cannot 
stop this human flow. 
</P>
<P>
 As citizens of the U.S. we can help stem this tide if we will address the root 
causes forcing immigration and work to effect change in Washington with regard 
to our sometimes nefarious involvement in foreign countries. I refer to our 
history of supporting oppressive Latin American governments with U.S. tax 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Governments such as those of Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala have lived by 
policies well known to suppress free elections and public opinion. The vast 
majority of people living in these countries are silenced by the threat of 
torture, even death inflicted by their government's omnipresent military and 
death squads. One does not challenge such governments unless willing to incur 
the consequences. Consequently there continues to exist widespread poverty, 
disease and illiteracy amid unsafe and filthy working conditions underscored by 
scandalous pay. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot help but think that if we understood our nation's complicity in these 
heinous crimes against humanity we would demand they cease. I know that if I 
lived with my family under such intolerable conditions, I would risk the trip 
north; wouldn't you?

 In response to "California Can't Keep Paying This Tab," editorial, Feb. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton in 1993 gave California its full allotment of federal 
immigration funds, the first President in more than a decade to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.3 billion Gov. Pete Wilson is demanding in federal funds is for 
accumulated immigration costs that went unpaid under Presidents Reagan and 
Bush. Curiously, then-Sen. Wilson made no demands for these unpaid California 
funds, and at the very time immigration costs in this state were escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 It would appear that, with a Democrat in the White House, Gov. Wilson has 
suddenly discovered the power of the presidency.

JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in response to a letter (Feb. 7) from William Thomas regarding 
the Menendez brothers' mistrials. Some of his concerns regarding the fees and 
costs involved in prosecuting and defending the Menendez murder case are 
certainly legitimate. However, his sweeping condemnation of attorneys and the 
entire civil and criminal justice system is unfair, unjustified and 
misinformed. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial involving complicated issues of liability and damages in a civil case, 
or guilt or innocence in a criminal case, can be lengthy and expensive for all 
of the participants. The suggestion that the length and expense of a 
complicated trial are caused by the incompetence of conspiring judges and 
attorneys endeavoring to enrich themselves is preposterous. Any judge or 
attorney presently litigating cases in Southern California can attest to the 
fact that there is little judicial tolerance for any tactics designed to cloud 
the issues or otherwise delay a trial. Severe sanctions, both monetary and 
procedural, are quickly imposed against any offending party or attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas lashes out against consumer rights, arguing that personal injury suits 
involving automobiles and medical malpractice are clogging our judicial system, 
and therefore must be eliminated and replaced with no-fault insurance and caps 
on damages. He should be reminded that personal injury cases account for only 
10% of all civil filings in California. Only a small percentage of those cases 
are actually tried before a jury. California already has a law ("MICRA") 
limiting attorney's fees, and damages, in cases against physicians. Unfair 
versions of "no-fault" insurance have been consistently rejected by California 
voters and their representatives in Sacramento. Unless and until a fair 
alternative to our present system allowing full and fair compensation for 
victims of negligence is presented, the status quo should remain so. 
</P>
<P>
 Our justice system is certainly not perfect. Expensive delays and inefficiency 
in civil and criminal cases can and must be minimized so that confidence in our 
system is restored. Our judicial system guarantees us the fundamental 
constitutional right to due process in a criminal case and the right to 
compensation for victims of negligence in a civil jury trial. These fundamental 
rights can only be guaranteed to us, and future generations, by steadfast faith 
in our ability as intelligent beings to improve and eventually perfect the 
system.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE HEBRON MASSACRE; DISARM THE SETTLERS' GUN SQUADS; THE 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS ARE ARMED TO THE TEETH AND FREELY TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR 
OWN HANDS AGAINST PALESTINIANS.

 The massacre on Friday of dozens of Palestinian worshipers by a Jewish settler 
urgently requires a strong and dramatic reaction. Condolences, apology and 
condemnation as expressed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin are not sufficient, 
nor are investigations. The Israeli government, which under international law 
is responsible for the safety of the 2 million Palestinians in the occupied 
territories, has no choice but to disarm the paramilitary units of Jewish 
settlers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaughter at the Ibrahim Mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron, a site 
holy to both Jews and Muslims as the Tomb of the Patriarchs, was an act of a 
religiously fanatical gunman. Baruch Goldstein was an American Jew who 
emigrated to Israel 11 years ago to follow Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the 
Jewish Defense League in New York and the radical Kach party in Israel. Before 
being murdered in 1990 by Muslim fundamentalists, Kahane had developed a small 
following that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel. The massacre 
perpetrated by Goldstein on Friday, however, is rooted in a larger 
psychological environment, created by the hatred, physical harassment and low 
regard shown by leaders of the settler movement to their Palestinian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the 130,000 Jews who live in more than 100 rural and urban 
communities in the West Bank are peace-seeking and law-abiding citizens. Most 
of them are secular families who settled in the West Bank for economic and 
social reasons. They were attracted by the cheap subsidized housing offered by 
right-wing Likud governments and by the desire for "life quality." It is even 
assumed that most of the settlers are receptive to the peace talks between 
Israel and the PLO and ready to leave their homes if they are properly 
compensated. Nevertheless, they have been a silent majority, allowing 
themselves to be represented by leaders vociferously opposed to the peace 
negotiation. These leaders -- political organizers and their spiritual rabbis 
-- are mainly motivated by Jewish religious zealotry that very much resembles 
Iranian-based Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, these leaders inspired and encouraged the organization of secret 
cells. These cells, known as the "Jewish underground," were involved in 
assassination attempts against Palestinian mayors, terrorist attacks on Muslim 
college students and a conspiracy to blow up mosques in Jerusalem. Eventually, 
even the Likud government could no longer turn a blind eye on their deeds and 
plots, and in May, 1984, ordered Israel's security services to crack down on 
the Jewish underground. Members were arrested, charged and sentenced to jail by 
Israeli courts. But their leaders, the inciters, were untouched and remained 
free to continue with their agenda against the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of re-creating the underground, the settler leaders now concentrate on 
organizing their supporters in paramilitary groups. The organization that 
Baruch Goldstein belonged to is considered too extreme even in the eyes of most 
right-wing settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem, however, is with the so-called mainstream settlers' 
movement, which encourages the formation of these citizen armies. Their members 
serve in the Israeli defense forces as reservists and are armed to the teeth. 
Their weapons come from army stores and are to be used only for self-defense. 
They are also highly disciplined and ready to sacrifice their lives on the 
altar of the cause. Although they have no official warrant, they "patrol" the 
streets of Palestinian communities and the roads that connect them. And they do 
not hesitate to take the law into their hands, avenging the murders of Jewish 
settlers by storming houses in the middle of the night and killing 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's security services, which have been so successful in tracking 
Palestinian terrorists, have done nothing to stop the Jewish paramilitary. 
Cabinet ministers and military commanders believed that they could control and 
tame the settlers.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday's tragedy demonstrates that pacifying terrorists is counterproductive 
and costly. The Israeli government has to dismantle the settlers' paramilitary 
squads. Such a step will be supported by the majority of Israelis who wish to 
see the peace negotiation brought to fruition. It may even be accepted by most 
settlers as politically inevitable. Providing security to all people, 
regardless their race or religion, is solely the responsibility of the 
government. It should not be in the hands of vigilantes who, because of the 
authorities' past inaction, have come to see themselves as being above the law. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Israeli government does not act now and quickly the consequences will 
be dire. Not only the already delayed implementation of the Israeli-PLO peace 
accord will be jeopardized. The very nature of Israel as a free, lawful and 
democratic society will be threatened.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE HEBRON MASSACRE; A KILLER AND HIS BELIEFS WERE U.S. IMPORTS;

RADICALISM OF BROOKLYN'S OWN JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE.

<P>
 It is noteworthy that it was an American immigrant to Israel who committed a 
horrible act of violence Friday in the massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 What has been the effect of American immigrants on politics in Israel and 
specifically on relations between Israelis and Palestinians? The impact has 
both impeded and advanced the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlers on the West Bank tend to be disproportionately drawn from American 
immigrants to Israel, though the numbers are not overwhelming. About 1% of all 
Israelis are recent American immigrants, but 10% of the settlers in the 
occupied territories come from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point of the Hebron massacre, however, the radical settlers tend 
to come from the United States. Dr. Baruch Goldstein, who carried out the mass 
shooting, was an adherent of the extremist Kach movement, which believes that 
Arabs should be forcibly expelled from the area of "Greater Israel" that they 
envision as stretching from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River. 
</P>
<P>
 Kach was founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, who emigrated to Israel after 
starting the Jewish Defense League in Brooklyn, New York. The JDL carried out 
intentionally provocative actions against blacks in New York and portrayed 
black-Jewish relations as an inevitable clash of enemies. Kahane's actions won 
him the fervent loyalty of a small band of committed extremists, as well as the 
staunch opposition of leaders in both communities who wanted to work together 
for better relations and the furtherance of mutual agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Kach in Israel is essentially the wholesale importation of the JDL to the Holy 
Land, except that racism against blacks was replaced by unmitigated hostility 
against Arabs. Running on an anti-Arab platform, Kahane won a seat in the 
Israeli Knesset. So unacceptable was his ideology, however, that Israeli 
parties of the Left and Right joined together to ban Kach from elections. 
Kahane was later assassinated, but his followers carry on his virulently 
anti-Arab message. 
</P>
<P>
 Kach forms the core of the Hebron settler community, the most hard-line in the 
West Bank. Residents have announced that they will resist with violence any 
territorial compromise the Israeli government might negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding all this, it is not surprising that Goldstein, imbued with 
racist ideology, committed the mass murder in Hebron. Even if he decided alone 
to shoot up a crowded mosque during an important service, he could only have 
believed from his Kach experience that there was nothing wrong with killing 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the importation of JDL and Kach ideology to Israel is not the 
only contribution that Americans have made to Israeli public life. 
</P>
<P>
 American immigrants were also among the founders and leaders of Israel's Peace 
Now movement. They supported peace initiatives during the years the Likud 
Government opposed dialogue with the PLO and have led the country in advocacy 
of the current peace process. They have mounted massive demonstrations on 
behalf of peace and have conducted research projects to expose the extent of 
settler activity and its enormous cost to Israeli society. They have also 
initiated dialogues with Palestinians that have furthered the peace 
negotiations. Many of these immigrants are veterans of civil-rights and 
social-justice movements in the United States and have brought their values to 
the movement for peace in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the two kinds of immigrants was starkly illustrated 
when Peace Now called for the removal of Jewish settlers -- many of them Kach 
supporters -- from the heart of Hebron after the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. culture has greatly influenced both mainstream peace advocates and their 
most violent opponents. Some claim that American Jews can have no real impact 
on the peace process. The facts, however, show that our influence is profound.

LAPD OFFICER HAMILTON AND THE COURAGE OF WOMEN; LOS ANGELES: BRAVERY IS COMING 
TO TERMS WITH THE THINGS WORTH STANDING UP FOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN SNORTLAND, Ellen Snortland lives in Lake View Terrace.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The tragic death of LAPD officer Christy Lynne Hamilton is a reminder that the 
struggle for equal rights includes the weight of equal and sometimes deadly 
risk and responsibility. As women are integrated into traditionally male 
domains, we are forced to confront how we feel about women dying in service to 
the public order. 
</P>
<P>
 Courage is important to consider in these days of gender revolution. 
Apparently, Hamilton had it in aces. Not only did she buck complacency by 
taking on a career change after age 40, but she also took on a culture with a 
reputation for not being female-friendly. She exemplified honor and the dignity 
of taking action against the stereotype of a helpless woman. Contrast this with 
those of us who are too afraid to say something because someone might get angry 
or call us a name or criticize our looks. It's true that women have very real 
fears of violence; we wrestle daily with apprehension ranging from the petty to 
the profound. 
</P>
<P>
 As a self-defense teacher, I have the great fortune to be around women who are 
committed to conquering their fears. We ask our students to contemplate the 
question, "What are you willing to fight for?" It's not only a matter of 
physical fighting. What are we willing to fight for in terms of values? Quality 
of life? Social equities? How do we access our heart, our vision? 
</P>
<P>
 We've all been guilty of falling back on permissible "helpless-female" 
behavior when it came down to hard situations, whether it was making a 
difficult phone call, telling someone to back off or checking out a suspicious 
sound at night.  
</P>
<P>
 It's important that grown-ups -- male and female -- come to terms with a fact 
of life: It not only takes courage to risk your life; it also takes courage to 
live a free and equal life. Women in dangerous occupations can teach us that. 
Female police officers are pioneers who dare to take the all-too-real risk of 
injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
 We forget that women actually come from a tradition of courage. For millennia, 
women died regularly in childbirth; marriage was an act of mortal courage. 
Countless colonial and pioneer women threw caution to the often-deadly winds, 
shoulder to shoulder with their male loved ones. Native American women died 
defending their families and tribes. Slave women endured unspeakable torture; 
many who escaped came back to liberate others at great risk. Mexican women have 
risked all crossing a border to make a better life. Many women must brave 
deadly neighborhoods every day. Women have no shortage of heroic role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's life and death can be a reminder that courage is courage only when 
things are difficult, and that it is not only the province of men. Given the 
deadly nature of the problems we face -- guns, drugs, violent crime, quakes, 
fires, floods, explosive race relations -- we need all the courageous people we 
can muster.  
</P>
<P>
 It sounds so cliched, but we have an opportunity to make sure that Christy 
Hamilton's life was not spent in vain by examining bravery in our own lives. 
When is the last time you had a talk with yourself, your spouse or your kids 
about what is worth fighting for? Have a moment of silence for Hamilton and 
then talk about what you stand for. That takes courage.

IF TAXES CAN BE RETROACTIVE TO 1993, WHY NOT TO 1990?; LAW: THE SUPREME COURT 
SHOULD CLARIFY THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON CONGRESS' ABILITY TO TAX 
RETROACTIVELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH E. SCHMITZ, Joseph E. Schmitz, an attorney in Washington, is counsel 
of record for the Washington Legal Foundation, 22 U.S. senators, 20 U.S. 
representatives and one governor as friends of the court in United States vs. 
Carlton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1819, Chief Justice John Marshall warned that "the power to tax involves 
the power to destroy." Now, 175 years later, the Supreme Court is poised to 
decide the extent to which, if at all, the Constitution grants Congress the 
power to tax (and therefore to destroy) retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will soon decide a retroactive tax case, United States vs. 
Carlton, which could also affect the pending challenges to the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- enacted last August but retroactive to Jan. 1, 
1993. The Clinton Administration claims that the 1993 tax increases affect 
"fewer than 2% of taxpayers." Even if this claim were accurate, what is to 
prevent another tax increase in 1994 -- affecting "fewer than" 50%, and 
retroactive to Jan. 1, 1990? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Carlton case, to be argued before the Supreme Court today, a federal 
appeals court in California held that a 1987 amendment to a tax incentive 
enacted by Congress in 1986 was "so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the 
constitutional limitation." Between 1986 and 1987, of course, taxpayers had 
relied on the new tax incentive. Everybody who pays federal taxes in 1994 
should be watching this case, for its resolution may ultimately influence 
whether they pay retroactive taxes this year and in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenges to such laws predate the American Revolution. Blackstone's 
"Commentaries on the Laws of England" (1765), the most authoritative legal 
treatise at the time, describes retroactive laws as procedurally "more 
unreasonable" than those of the Roman Emperor Caligula -- who "wrote his laws 
in a very small character, and hung them up upon high pillars, the more 
effectively to ensnare the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Retroactive laws were such a problem when this nation was formed that the 
drafters of the Constitution included two explicit prohibitions, forbidding 
both Congress and states from passing any "ex post facto Law" (after the fact 
law). One might ask: With these two explicit prohibitions, why is there even a 
debate over whether Congress can pass ex post facto tax laws? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is complicated by a 1798 Supreme Court decision on a Connecticut 
case in which the state Legislature had overruled a decision of a probate 
court. In Calder vs. Bull, the Supreme Court is generally understood to have 
decided that the Constitution's two ex post facto prohibitions apply only to 
criminal laws. However, a close reading of the separate opinions of Justices 
Iredell and Peterson in that case indicates that the outcome would have been 
different had the issue been federal instead of state legislative power. At 
that time, the Connecticut Legislature, unlike Congress, had the power to 
overturn judicial decisions retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, even assuming that both ex post facto prohibitions only apply to 
criminal laws, if an individual does not pay his or her ex post facto taxes in 
1994, he or she is likely to face federal criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carlton case may be the first opportunity in almost 200 years for the 
court to revisit the Calder vs. Bull decision, and to clarify the 
constitutional limits on Congress to impose new taxes after the fact. The court 
should clarify the constitutional Rule of Law so that Congress cannot pass any 
form of retroactive tax it deems "necessary," regardless of the consequences on 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 As James (later Justice) Iredell observed during the debate over the federal 
Constitution in 1787, "Ex post facto laws . . . have been the instrument of 
some of the grossest acts of tyranny that were ever exercised, and . . . the 
plea of necessity is never wanting where it can be of any avail." 
</P>
<P>
 If the court is unwilling to constrain Congress from passing ex post facto tax 
laws, then perhaps "we the people" need a constitutional amendment to constrain 
the federal government from taxing (and therefore destroying) after the fact. 
The practical difficulty is that the very body through which any amendment 
initiative must pass is the body least interested in losing its ability to tax 
retroactively -- i.e., Congress. The Supreme Court may thus be the last and 
only bastion for the individual against the power of the federal government to 
tax after the fact.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; AN ART EMBARRASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gail Choice, whose credentials are given as a film and TV producer, writer and 
director (all that, sans credits?), claims that the Hollywood La Brea Gateway 
warmed her Hollywood, feminist and civil rights heritage. She lambasted 
Christopher Knight, but had no fundamental critique for what he accurately 
described as "the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
 To whatever extent Choice may be right that the four women depicted are 
"pioneers" and "women of steel," the opposite of that vision and spirit has 
been (mis)created in this work. If anything, it perpetuates the image of these 
cinema queens as sex symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gateway is an embarrassment as a work of art.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; TRADITIONAL ARTS VALUES HELP UNITE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While I fully agree with Councilman Joel Wachs' assessment of arts needs and 
benefits to the voiceless underclasses of the city ("Urban Lesson: No More 
Walls," Feb. 7), I believe we have gone too far in publicly subsidizing ethnic 
fringe art at the expense of mainstream arts. Many believe that sharing 
traditionally valued arts with diverse Angelenos does more to break down 
walls.Arts appreciation also weaves common cultural strands and builds bridges 
for mutual understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 I am convinced that the voiceless voting majority of middle-class Angelenos of 
all races much prefers cultural events that reinforce American and 
Judeo-Christian cultural and philosophical roots. Our Constitution, notions of 
tolerance, democratic institutions and respect for the value and dignity of 
each person have become necessary ingredients for the crucible of America's 
staggering historic productivity and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Models in literature, drama, visual art, music and dance survive today as 
mainstream arts curriculum in schools (where taught) and colleges. They also 
constitute the core of artistic excellence upon which other more limited and 
transitory expressions are tested. I vigorously object to public funds being 
spent to uncritically subsidize narrowly based ethnic and racial art 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 For every youth who is saved from drugs or gangs via athletics, there are 
dozens to be saved through arts.

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; THE GATEWAY AND HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although its theme is clear, Catherine Hardwicke's defense of the Hollywood La 
Brea Gateway sculpture as politically correct or appropriate as symbolism 
regarding Hollywood history is way off the mark. ("Critic Missed Gateway Humor, 
Symbolism," Feb. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 I think the Gateway is historically ignorant. Dorothy Dandridge may have been 
nominated for an Oscar, but Hattie McDaniel won one. There wasn't enough 
research done. Does Mae West represent the best of Caucasian actresses 
throughout history? This was not a well-thought-out choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Marilyn Monroe, arguably an international symbol of women in film, 
perched Tinker Bell-like at the top of this structure, barely visible? Is she 
somehow less important? 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite the artist's self-defense claim, the goal of a monument should 
not be a photo op. This street art is not for the residents, it does not 
respectfully address the history of the community and it is not even adequately 
protected. The last time I saw the statues, Dolores Del Rio had a 
felt-tip-markered silhouette of a hand on her posterior along with a bumper 
sticker. 
</P>
<P>
 Why spend for these "monuments" when we are losing real history every day, 
when real Hollywood landmarks like the Brown Derby are easily demolished, the 
Egyptian Theatre restoration stalled and the future of the Hanes House in 
jeopardy?

COUNTERPUNCH: WHY WOULD ANYONE LAUGH AT 'SCHINDLER'S LIST'?; HOLLYWOOD HASN'T 
TAUGHT HISTORY TO BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There is nothing more galling than hearing people laugh at an image or idea 
that you take very seriously. With each chuckle your head aches with anger and 
your eyes fill with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how some patrons at the Grand Lake Theater in Oakland felt when a 
group of high school students laughed through parts of Steven Spielberg's World 
War II Holocaust epic, "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, everyone from CNN to Steven Spielberg has been speculating on what 
was behind that disturbing laughter. Were the students "desensitized to 
violence"? Uncomfortable? Or merely rude? 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying these questions is a deeper one: How could anyone laugh at the 
extermination of the Jews and other minorities by the Nazis all over Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: They were laughing not at the Holocaust but at the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, few African Americans go to the movies -- even "serious" movies 
like "Schindler's List" -- expecting a $7 epiphany. We're used to distancing 
ourselves from what we see on the screen, not identifying with it. We're used 
to laughing. How else can we deal with the absurdly degrading portraits of 
ourselves we see on the screen -- or with our total invisibility? 
</P>
<P>
 My mother watches a cable channel dedicated to "classic" American movies. She 
enjoys the comedies, musicals and dramas that she grew up with, calling them 
"good old movies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally I watch them with her. I like to pick out how many black people 
are in the movie, and what their roles are. Inevitably, every face that 
resembles my own is a shucking and jiving servant, or some similar stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, when a black character makes it halfway through a horror flick 
without making some stupid blunder that allows him to be killed, I celebrate it 
as a change in the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot going on  
</P>
<P>
 First ya guilty now ya gone  
</P>
<P>
 I'll check out ya movie but it will take a black one to move me."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck D of Public Enemy recorded that rhyme two years before the Los Angeles 
rebellion, summing up what actually lies at the heart of the current 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were taken to see "Schindler's List" on Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day, a day supposedly set aside for them to acknowledge and honor their own 
struggle. The idea was that these kids might better understand their own 
painful experience through identifying with another's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But these young people are taught so little of their own history, they barely 
have the context to understand their own lives. Try imagining asking a group of 
young Jews to memorialize the Holocaust by watching "Roots." While the number 
"6 million" is etched in our national consciousness, how many of us know the 
much greater number of Africans who were murdered or uprooted in the slave 
trade? What does "never again" mean to young people who see the bodies of their 
brothers, friends, sisters, mothers carried out of the ghetto on a regular 
basis? 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Raquel, a 23-year-old apprentice teacher of African-Panamanian descent, 
suggests that there are better ways to teach a group of African American 
students about their ancestor Martin Luther King Jr. than to bring them to a 
Hollywood movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should question Hollywood's teaching qualifications," the San Francisco 
woman says. "Can a money-making industry that has historically exploited them 
teach these young people anything new about oppression? We might better have 
asked: Is Hitler really dead? And then learn from the students."

COUNTERPUNCH: TITLES ARE DIFFERENT, BUT THE FANTASIES REMAIN THE SAME

 George Morgan pointed out similarities in "Dave" and "King Ralph" ("Two More 
Films, a Lot More Coincidences," Calendar, Jan. 3) in response to Marshall 
Fine's article "Two Movie Families, 10 Coincidences," comparing "The Beverly 
Hillbillies" and "Addams Family Values." 
</P>
<P>
 Common ideas repeatedly play out in films. Consider the similar themes of the 
successful films "Shirley Valentine," "Desperately Seeking Susan," "Pretty 
Woman" and "The Piano": 
</P>
<P>
 * The plot focuses on the romance of a dissatisfied woman whose life has been 
narrowly confined. 
</P>
<P>
 * The heroine escapes her predictable life through unlikely adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 * The heroine finds meaning in life by sexual involvement with a handsome 
stranger. That relationship would collapse without sex. 
</P>
<P>
 * Romance with a handsome man other than a spouse enables the heroine to cope 
with life's problems and find happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 * The heroine makes herself sexually available to her boyfriend and does not 
demand marriage in return. 
</P>
<P>
 * The heroine does not get pregnant. The heroine does not worry about getting 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 * The middle class is narrow and unlikable because it falls outside the 
subculture the heroine finds herself in. ("Pretty Woman" adds the wealthy class 
to this category.) "Shirley Valentine" has the heroine escaping middle-class 
suburbia for a Greek coastal village. "Desperately Seeking Susan's" heroine 
escapes middle-class life for the environs of new wave/punk. "Pretty Woman's" 
heroine lives in the underclass of prostitutes. "The Piano's" heroine dwells 
among New Zealand aborigines. 
</P>
<P>
 * The members of the subculture are morally superior to those outside who 
conform to societal conventions. Those outside the subculture are portrayed as 
boorish, judgmental and repressed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The heroine's family does not help the heroine's emotional or psychological 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal desires take precedence over moral questions. Moral issues do not 
transcend what individuals want for themselves. One achieves meaning in life 
only with an exciting sexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite their great magnitude, relationship problems are resolved happily, 
fulfilling the heroine's fantasy.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'DEADFALL' A COPPOLA FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Deadfall" (at the Highland, in Highland Park), a hopelessly callow, 
leaden-paced attempt at film noir, is of interest only because it was directed 
and co-written by Francis Coppola's nephew, Christopher, and because it has a 
far more stellar cast than is usual for low-budget B pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 An overly bland Michael Biehn -- his soundtrack narration in particular is as 
flat as the material he's been given to read -- stars as a young con man who 
accidentally kills his partner/father (James Coburn, as witty as ever but 
woefully wasted here), who with his dying breath reveals he has a twin brother 
living in Santa Monica. Biehn departs New Jersey for California, quickly 
impresses the shady uncle (also Coburn) he never knew he had. 
</P>
<P>
 This development, however, incites the jealousy of the uncle's unlikely junior 
partner in crime (a way-over-the-top Nicolas Cage, the director's brother), a 
cokehead given to shades, flashy clothes and a bad wig. Just as swiftly, Cage's 
girl (Sarah Trigger) finds herself attracted to the handsome Biehn. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no point in further elaborating on the film's progressively contrived 
plot and its too easily predicted "surprise" twist finish. Cameos by Peter 
Fonda, Talia Shire (the director's aunt), Charlie Sheen, Clarence Williams III 
and ex-Monkee Mickey Dolenz aren't much help. On its posters, "Deadfall" is 
all-too-aptly billed as "the ultimate con."

TV REVIEWS; NOVA GOES 'IN SEARCH OF HUMAN ORIGINS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Modern humans, people who looked pretty much like you and me and who probably 
behaved much the same way, have been around for about 100,000 years, most 
researchers agree. But our ancestors, primates who walked upright on the plains 
of Africa, who banded together for shelter and warmth and who may have used the 
simplest tools -- like a twig to remove termites from a nest -- have been 
around much longer, at least 3.2 million years. 
</P>
<P>
 That age is based on a 42-inch-tall fossilized skeleton found in a wasteland 
of bare rock and gravel in Ethiopia 20 years ago by a then-brash young 
anthropologist named Donald C. Johanson, who now heads the Institute for Human 
Origins in Berkeley. That skeleton, known as "Lucy" in honor of a Beatles song 
playing on the researchers' tape deck when its identity was confirmed, is now 
arguably the most famous fossil in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of that discovery and its impact on our search for the essential 
nature of humanity is the centerpiece of the first episode of the three-part 
"In Search of Human Origins," an entertaining and thought-provoking "Nova" 
miniseries that debuts on PBS tonight. The series is hosted and narrated by 
Johanson, who has the makings of a charismatic and knowledgeable PBS host on 
the lines of Carl Sagan and David Attenborough. 
</P>
<P>
 (All three installments are running back to back tonight, from 8 to 11 p.m., 
on KCET-TV Channel 28. KVCR-TV Channel 24 is showing them at 7 p.m. tonight, 
Tuesday and Wednesday. KPBS-TV Channel 15 is showing them Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. 
and Wednesday at 7:30 and 8:50 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcely bigger than an 8-year-old, hairy and virtually indistinguishable from 
other primates, Lucy had one key characteristic that marked the transition 
between animals and men: Her knee-joint was capable of locking her leg 
straight, allowing her to walk upright for long periods of time and providing 
the mobility and versatility that started her line on the road toward modern 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Johanson frequently, and accurately, calls her the "missing link" between apes 
and humans, a term that is only now coming back into repute after earlier and 
more laughable claims disgraced it. "She is really the woman that shook up 
man's family tree," Johanson said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 In Part I, Johanson and his team re-create both their moment of discovery and 
the rather sedate celebration that led to her name. An English "movement 
artist," heavily made up, portrays the last days of Lucy in the then-lush 
wilderness, and a highly detailed audio-animatronic Lucy head demonstrates how 
she might have used a twig to capture termites from their mounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Part II tells the story of how this frail creature and her brethren, many of 
whom were actually closer in size to modern humans, were able to survive on the 
Ethiopian battleground. Early man was not the ferocious hunter so often 
depicted in mythology, but rather a timid scavenger who made his living by 
stealing carcasses after more powerful carnivores were finished with them, 
settling for fruits and termites and the like when nothing better came to hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the final chapter moves forward in time to look more closely at 
the development of culture, perhaps the defining characteristic of humanity. It 
focuses largely on the much-maligned Neanderthal, a brutish species once 
thought to be our forebears but now known to be a separate lineage that became 
extinct 30,000 years ago, perhaps because they could not compete with 
anatomically modern humans.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet they shared many human traits. "They ate the same foods, hunted the same 
way, buried their dead, built the same kinds of fireplaces," Johanson said. In 
many ways, he argues, Neanderthals were human. Being a modern human, he 
concludes, may be less about what we look like and more about how we behave.

TV REVIEWS; JETS PLAYER'S STRUGGLE DRAMATIZED ON FOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest sack of defensive lineman Dennis Byrd's life -- knocking into a 
hat the medical predictions that he would never walk again -- is the stuff of 
the legendary "Brian's Song" (1972), although Byrd's movie has a sunny ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Even viewers who have never heard of the New York Jets player, who broke his 
neck in a collision with a teammate in a New York-Kansas City game in 1992, 
should be touched by "Rise and Walk: The Dennis Byrd Story" (at 8 tonight on 
Fox, Channels 11 and 6) with its personal crucible of courage, strength, 
commitment and the infectious display of love from his wife (Kathy Morris) and 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at last, for those always lamenting murder-of-the-week TV movies, is a 
positive, upbeat movie. Man in conflict with himself is the only discord here, 
with actor Peter Berg convincingly steering Byrd from an affable, gung-ho jock 
to a tenacious, bedridden fighter with metal screws holding his head straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The camaraderie from Jets teammates seems genuinely unforced, and Byrd's 
grind-it-out-three-inches-and-a-cloud-of-dust rehabilitation regimen is 
sensitively helmed by director Michael Dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk with such a project is the absence of a dark edge. We are not only 
used to corruption in our sports world, we anticipate it. Here everybody loves 
everybody. The movie (adapted from Byrd's book by Sally Nemeth, John Miglis and 
Mark Levin) never once questions the conditions of the game. Even the coach and 
a wheelchair-bound rehab sorehead are curiously lovable. RAY LOYND

<P>
 AWARENESS: United Way of Orange County will announce the results of its 1993 
fund-raising campaign on March 9 and spokeswoman Janice Parks expects it to 
meet the $18.5-million goal, slightly above last year's $18.2-million take. 
Statewide, contributions are down as much as 7% largely because of the 
recession and layoffs. . . . Parks says the agency locally is trying to focus 
people's attention on the needy. "People in Orange County don't seem to give if 
the problems aren't something tangible: when it's something like the homeless, 
child abuse or the elderly." Otherwise, she says, "it's like it isn't there if 
we don't see it." 
</P>
<P>
 CRIME TIME: Many people are reluctant to give because they fear getting ripped 
off. . . . "We're a hotbed for fraud," says Maureen Williams, a member of 
Charities for Truth in Giving, a local coalition of charitable organizations. 
The group estimates there are more than 100 unscrupulous boiler rooms operating 
in Orange County, and it has tried unsuccessfully to get a countywide ordinance 
passed that would regulate charitable solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
 DISASTERS: There's nothing like a firestorm, mudslide or earthquake to loosen 
people's wallets. . . . Increased donations meant that the Orange County 
Chapter of the American Red Cross earmarked more than $600,000 for the Laguna 
Hills fire victims and helped 21,000 people this fiscal year. "The community 
responded with compassion during these disasters and that enabled us to meet 
the needs of the victims," says a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 CASH FLOW: While big-name charities rely on business-driven fund-raisers, many 
smaller philanthropic organizations survive on the efforts of support groups 
(E1) to make ends meet. Few Orange County couples have done more to help out 
local causes than John and Donna Crean, who donate their Santa Ana Heights home 
for about 150 galas each year. "We just have a lot of fun doing it . . . though 
we don't attend most of them," says Crean, who does background checks on every 
charity "to make sure there are no rip-offs." Less Than Generous

 FISHING GEAR: About 2 million Californians have fishing licenses, more than 
any other state. . . . Under a law that takes effect Tuesday, anglers will 
sport a new accessory along with poles and lures: fishing licenses. . . . The 
law, requiring anglers to pin licenses to their clothing, aims to discourage 
illegal fishing, which costs the state as much as $14 million a year. . . . At 
Lake Casitas, many fishermen are already complying, said Bruce Schrader at the 
tackle shop. But, he said, "I think most people find it's a new law they don't 
want to have."

 MARCHING IN: Historically, March has been an eventful month in Ventura County. 
. . . On March 10, 1866, the city of San Buenaventura was incorporated. The 
first Ventura town meeting was held in a dance hall over a saloon near San 
Buenaventura Mission. . . . On March 13, 1928, 380 people were killed when the 
San Francis Dam collapsed east of Fillmore. . . . And on March 1, 1910, the 
Blanchard Memorial Library in Santa Paula opened with 800 books. . . . The 
Month Ahead (B2) lists events planned for this March. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTDATED LAW: An obscure Ventura policy that prohibits club owners from 
allowing people of the same sex to dance together could be wiped off the books. 
. . . The City Council tonight will consider striking the resolution, which 
dates from 1968. . . . The action comes after Dan Gaffaney, owner of Lipstix, a 
newly opened bar that caters to lesbians, brought the policy to the city's 
attention. . . . The complaint marks the first time that anyone has challenged 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 STUDENTS' VIEW: The nationwide debate over whether birth control should be 
taught in public schools inspired Travis Lund Moon, a high school student in 
Simi Valley, to take up his pen (Voices, B10). . . . "In the case of denying 
birth control information to students, ignorance can be downright deadly," 
wrote Moon, 18. . . . The Simi Valley school board decided last week to include 
birth control in sex education classes. License to Fish

AVERY FISHER; PHILANTHROPIST IN MUSIC, PIONEER IN ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avery Fisher, an electronics industry pioneer and philanthropist for whom a 
New York City concert hall was named, has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher died Saturday at a New Milford, Conn., hospital of complications from a 
stroke. He was an influential figure in New York music circles, sitting on the 
boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln 
Center and the Marlboro Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Center's Philharmonic Hall was renamed Avery Fisher Hall in 1973 after 
Fisher donated $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday, they'll say: 'Who the hell was Avery Fisher?' It doesn't bother me," 
Fisher told the Los Angeles Times at the time he made the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation from New York University in 1929, Fisher worked in 
advertising and publishing before making his fortune in electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The amateur violinist started out building radios simply to improve sound 
quality for his own enjoyment. By 1937 he had become so adept at it that he 
founded the Philharmonic Radio company. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold Philharmonic Radio in 1945 and formed Fisher Radio, which offered 
high-fidelity components at premium prices and had a factory on the site now 
occupied by Lincoln Center. Fisher offered the first transistorized amplifier 
for sale in 1956 and the first stereo radio-phonograph combination two years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 After selling the business in 1969 for what he estimated at "just under $31 
million," Fisher turned his attention to philanthropy. 
</P>

 "I started thinking in terms of where I could do a little good with that 
money," he once said. "I kept coming back to the realization that I owed 
something to music. It all came out of the world of music and some of it should 
go back as a repayment of a personal debt, you might say, but also as a civic 
responsibility."

BILL HICKS, 32; POPULAR COMIC IN U.S., ENGLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William M. (Bill) Hicks, the dark and biting stand-up comedian whose material 
was excised in October from "The Late Show With David Letterman" because it 
purportedly touched "too many hot spots," has died of pancreatic cancer. He was 
32. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, the subject of two HBO specials and a New Yorker magazine profile who 
performed regularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties, died Saturday at the 
home of his parents in Little Rock, Ark., his co-manager, Colleen McGarr, 
announced Sunday. Before Hicks' illness, he had lived on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Hicks released the comedy album "Arizona Bay," and was named by 
Rolling Stone magazine as the year's "hot stand-up." He was recently nominated 
for his third American Comedy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks had appeared 11 times on Letterman's former show, NBC's "Late Night." 
But when he recorded six minutes of material for Letterman's CBS version last 
fall, the executive producer called him to say that CBS representatives had 
ordered the segment axed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show went great," Hicks told The Times then. "Dave even gave me a Havana 
cigar during the break." 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned by the censorship, Hicks said: "I perform this stuff for my mom on her 
porch in Little Rock, Arkansas. I even wore a delightful new outfit, with fall 
colors. I didn't wear black." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks customarily wore black in his club dates here, across the United States 
and in England, where he became a cult favorite. The costume emphasized his 
dark, satirical humor that caused some fans and critics to label him the 
"prince of darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 His routines customarily examined a host of controversial subjects -- 
homosexuality, religion, gun-control laws, smoking, politics, pornography and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 On religion, he typically commented in his act: "Why do Christians wear 
crucifixes around their neck? Do you think when Jesus comes back he ever wants 
to see another (expletive) cross?" 
</P>
<P>
 On drugs, Hicks would say: "You never see positive drug stories on the news, 
do you? Isn't that weird, since most of the experiences I've had on drugs were 
real (expletive) positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks started sneaking out of the house at age 13 to perform at open mike 
nights at Houston's Comedy Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, his hourlong performance at the Just for Laughs Montreal 
International Comedy Festival gave him international status and made him 
particularly popular in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he found less censorship in Britain than in the United States, he 
said last year before the Letterman incident: "It's kind of funny to see a guy 
who talks about free speech (being) edited. That's America. God bless it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks had recently created a series for British television, called "Counts of 
the Netherworld," involving two Victorian-era counts who sit around 
philosophizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks' stand-up style involved talking his way through a subject to reveal its 
inherent absurdities rather than telling jokes. Called everything from "a 
foul-mouthed moralist" to "a satirical comedic poet," Hicks refused to describe 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenny Bruce (said): 'I'm not a comic, I'm Lenny Bruce,' " Hicks mused last 
year. "I think he was trying to say, 'Don't label me.' I think I'll go the same 
route." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks is survived by his parents, James and Mary, of Little Rock; a sister, 
Lynn, of Fort Worth, Tex., and a brother, Steve, of Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled Tuesday at 10 a.m. at the Griffin Leggett 
Funeral Home in Little Rock, with graveside services at 2 p.m. Wednesday in 
Leakesville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Hospice Home Care 
Inc. in Little Rock.

TITANS FLEX THEIR MUSCLES AT RIGHT TIME; BASEBALL: CAL STATE FULLERTON'S 2-0 
VICTORY OVER GEORGIA TECH NETS A TOURNAMENT TITLE AND SOME RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week that began with a loss to a Division II team ended with an exhilarating 
shutout of the nation's top-ranked Division I team, as Cal State Fullerton beat 
Georgia Tech, 2-0, Sunday to win the Anaheim Hilton & Towers Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 1,861 in the Titan Sports Complex saw junior right-hander 
Mike Parisi strike out 10 and allow only four hits in seven innings to lead 
third-ranked Fullerton to a 3-0 record in the round-robin tournament, which 
included Oklahoma and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Silva pitched a scoreless eighth and ninth inning for the save and Georgia 
Tech suffered its first shutout since an 8-0 loss to Clemson on April 27, 1991. 
The Yellow Jackets (6-2) had scored in 152 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans improved to 15-2. Nine of those victories have come over college 
baseball heavyweights Stanford, Arizona, Texas and Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a College World Series-caliber team? You bet. But before Fullerton 
fans book their flights to Omaha, Coach Augie Garrido reminds you to see 
exhibit B, Tuesday's 7-6 loss to UC Riverside, a tough Division II contender 
but one the Titans should knock out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed this weekend that we have the ability to play championship-type 
baseball," Garrido said. "Against Riverside, we showed we have the ability not 
to play championship-type baseball. We made a lot of defensive mistakes that 
day. But if we continue to improve, we're going to be hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had only six hits against Georgia Tech right-hander Al Gogolin, who 
went the distance, but one was D.C. Olsen's soft, two-out single to left-center 
field, which scored Adam Millan in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Millan also singled to lead off the sixth, was sacrificed to second, and got a 
huge jump off Gogolin and stole third, his first stolen base in his two-year 
Titan career. Millan then scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans took advantage of what few offensive opportunities they had, but 
pitching and defense were the deciding factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton center fielder Dante Powell, the tournament's most valuable player, 
made a diving catch of Scott McIntyre's shot to right-center field with a 
runner on first and two out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans also snuffed a Georgia Tech threat with a difficult, 3-6-1 double 
play in the eighth, as Millan fielded Scott Byers' grounder at first and threw 
to shortstop Jack Jones, who relayed his throw to Silva covering first. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the defense plays like it did tonight, it gives you so much more 
confidence," said Parisi, the tournament's most valuable pitcher. "I just try 
to let them hit the ball and watch us make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton didn't have to make too many plays behind Parisi, who effectively 
mixed his fastball and slider throughout his seven-inning stint. He struck out 
the side in the sixth. Georgia Tech catcher Jason Varitek, a first-round pick 
in 1993 and the starter on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, struck out three times 
against Parisi. 
</P>
<P>
 Varitek entered the weekend with a .611 average but went 0 for 9 until 
breaking through with a two-out double off Silva in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great hitter but I just went after him," Parisi said. "The crowd 
cheering really pumped me up and made our whole team play better. I hope they 
come more often, because they had a big effect on the game." 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament action: 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma 10, San Diego 9: The Sooners scored five runs in the bottom of the 
ninth, on Jerry Whittaker's three-run homer and Mark Soto's two-run single, to 
tie the score, 8-8. Karl Schmidt's sacrifice fly gave San Diego a 9-8 lead in 
the top of the 10th, but Oklahoma took advantage of two bases-loaded walks in 
the bottom of the 10th to pull out the victory.

STRUGGLING MATADORS FIND HOPE IN SPLIT; COLLEGE BASEBALL: CSUN ROUTS 
16TH-RANKED OHIO STATE IN FIRST GAME BEFORE LOSING, 6-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Membership is a privilege, not an inalienable right. Access to the club isn't 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cal State Northridge beat down the door. Or at least, put a crack in the 
woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing their first two games of the Florida Gator Slug-Fest, the 
Matadors on Sunday split a doubleheader with previously unbeaten Ohio State to 
salvage a win and a measure of credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, Northridge's struggling offense bombed the 16th-ranked 
Buckeyes in the first game, 12-4, before falling in the second, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (5-9) likely won't be cracking the national rankings and joining 
the ranks of the elite, but they perhaps proved something to the fans. If not 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we deserve to be here," said first baseman Jason Shanahan, who was 
six for eight on the day. "We knew we could compete with these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge first dropped a 5-4 decision to sixth-ranked Oklahoma State and 
then was blown out by 22nd-ranked Florida, 14-2, extending the Matador losing 
streak to five games -- the longest in Coach Bill Kernen's six-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the offense came alive in the seven-inning opener against the 
Buckeyes, rolling up 13 hits. Though they lost the nine-inning afternoon game, 
the Matadors outhit Ohio State, 9-7. If the five previous games were stumbling 
blocks, the victory was a building block. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the (glimmers) of hope where you can get them," Kernen said. "We've 
got a lot of work to do. It's still a big mountain to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 After being routed by Florida on Saturday night, the Matadors put together 
their best performance in the opener against the Buckeyes, who won the 
round-robin tournament title with a mark of 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored a season-high eight times in the fifth to take a 11-4 lead. 
The Matadors sent 13 batters to the plate and had six hits. The contrast was 
stark: Northridge had scored 12 runs in its previous five games and topped the 
six-hit plateau once in the same span. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Nelson, Kevin Howard and Eric Gillespie each had two-run singles in the 
inning, during which the Matadors greeted reliever Dennis Pachner with three 
straight hits to blow open the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander John Najar (2-2) gave up four runs on as many hits over seven 
innings, walked two and struck out six. Najar became the first Matador to 
record a victory over a team with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a defensive letdown in the second game, right-hander Rick Orr (0-1) 
might have made a similar claim.  
</P>
<P>
 With Northridge holding a 2-0 lead in the third, Ohio State (3-1 overall) 
turned a throwing error by Orr into five runs, two of which were earned. 
</P>
<P>
 With a run across and runners at first and second and none out, Orr fielded a 
poor sacrifice attempt by Jonathan Sweet and tried to force the lead runner. 
The ball sailed past third baseman Tyler Nelson for a throwing error that 
started the downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Over seven innings, Orr gave up three earned runs and seven hits, struck out 
six and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, what might have been. Throw out a few self-inflicted mistakes along the 
way and the Matadors might even have won the tournament title. But there's 
little margin for error against national-caliber competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came this close," Shanahan said, holding up a thumb and forefinger, "to 
going 3-1 and taking the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Matador Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the small-world department, Northridge pitcher Jason Vargas and Oklahoma 
State shortstop Damon Auchard grew up together in Tracy, Calif., and played 
together last year at Delta College in Stockton. . . . Northridge has five 
nonconference games remaining before its Western Athletic Conference opener 
with Hawaii on March 11. Hawaii is favored to win the WAC West Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jason Shanahan drove in three runs while batting cleanup Sunday. 
Strange as it seems, the Matadors had received three runs batted from the 
cleanup position over their first 13 games, all on a three-run homer by Kevin 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman designated hitter Eric Gillespie drove in three runs against the 
Buckeyes to give him a team-high 15 RBIs, a pace of better than one per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Jonathan Campbell, who missed six starts because of a foot injury, 
hasn't had a hit since the season opener. He is zero for his last 15.

 Coach: Mike Jagd (15th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 12-8, 6-4 in the South Coast League. Lost in Division I first round to 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Jeremy Beck, 6-3, middle blocker, Sr.; Chris Jacobson, 6-9, 
middle blocker, Sr.; Ryan Mariano, 6-3, outside hitter, Sr.; Todd Steinert, 
6-3, setter, Sr.; Doug Thompson, 6-5, outside hitter, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Bill Coblenz, 6-0, left-side hitter, Jr.; Arjuno Soriano, 5-8, 
setter, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: All-league players Mariano and Steinert lead a talented group of 
returners, giving Jagd reason to be excited about this season. Mariano is a 
dynamic hitter who could be the best the school has produced, Jagd said, and 
Steinert is a cool-under-pressure leader. Jacobson, who is being recruited by 
Pepperdine and UCLA among others, and Beck give the Chargers a solid middle, 
and Thompson, Coblenz, and Soriano add to El Toro's depth. "I've never had this 
many guys who can really play," Jagd said. "I look forward to our practices . . 
. it should be a fun year."

 Notes: The South Coast League figures to be the toughest in the county. Only 
three of the four teams ranked in the top 10 will automatically qualify for the 
playoffs. . . . Coach Mike Jagd returned to El Toro after spending two years 
coaching Colorado's top club team. On March 10, the Chargers will get their 
first severe test, playing at second-ranked Laguna Beach. . . . The Artists and 
the Oilers are heavy favorites to win the Pacific Coast and Sunset leagues. 
Edison and Marina could challenge Huntington Beach, which begins the season 
with a 23-match winning streak. . . . Tustin, Corona del Mar, and Irvine could 
give Newport Harbor fits in the Sea View League if the Sailors don't recover 
quickly from key injuries. "There's not one dominant team in the county, but 
there are six or seven really good teams," Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said. 
"It should be really interesting."

 Coach: Rocky Ciarelli (10th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 23-0, 14-0 in the Sunset League. Won the Division I championship, 
defeating Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Jeremy Bart, 6-3, outside hitter, Jr.; Jody Cook Fisher, 5-11, 
outside hitter, Jr.; Mike Grave, 6-3, outside hitter, Sr.; Brad Simon, 6-4,

 Key newcomers: Chad Gremel, 5-10, outside hitter, Sr.; Steve Markham, 5-11, 
outside hitter, Sr.; Zach Montgomery, 5-11, outside hitter, Jr.; Josh Moss, 
6-4, setter, Sr.; Sean Tucker, 6-3, middle blocker, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Ziegler and Grave are the two returning starters Ciarelli will look 
to for leadership as the Oilers try for their second consecutive section title. 
"It's the biggest team I've had and that's the easiest way to score points -- 
with the block," Ciarelli said. Blocking will be a strength, but the Oilers are 
a well-balanced team. All-county setter Chris Jones graduated, so Moss will 
take over after leading the junior varsity to a 17-0 record last season.

 1993: 14-4, 12-2 in the Sea View League. Lost in Division I quarterfinals to

<P>
 Key returners: Wes Badorek, 6-4, middle blocker, So.; Mitch McCoy, 6-3,

</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Three-year starters McCoy and Vallely return for the Sailors, giving 
Glenn reason for optimism. McCoy earned All-Southern Section honors last season 
and Vallely, an All-Sea View selection, played setter during the season's 
second half. But injuries have already sidelined two projected starters. Slick 
is recuperating from torn tendons in his elbow and Shoukry will be out for a 
month after suffering from appendicitis. "We won't be at full strength early," 
Glenn said. "But I don't worry about the losses in the beginning. Winning at 
the end is what counts."

1994 BOYS' VOLLEYBALL PREVIEW; WHITTIER CHRISTIAN TRYING TO SUSTAIN INLAND 
DYNASTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blueprint is far from perfect for building a powerhouse volleyball 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian High in La Habra has no on-campus gym, so the Heralds must 
practice and play home matches at a church in neighboring Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is near the smoggy foothills of La Habra, miles from the surf, sand 
and beach volleyball nets. And with only 600 students attending the small 
private school, there isn't a vast talent pool from which to draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, under Coach Dave Herron, Whittier Christian has attained a level of 
success few have matched in Southern Section boys' volleyball history. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Whittier Christian defeated Bellflower St. John Bosco in the 
Southern Section Division III title match, 15-5, 15-12, 15-9, to win its third 
consecutive Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Derek Beard, the Heralds also set a Southern Section record for 
consecutive victories. The victory against St. John Bosco stretched Whittier 
Christian's winning streak to 39. 
</P>
<P>
 The titles, the rings, the victories all make Herron smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the first day of practice last week, Herron was beaming when 30 
freshmen and sophomores walked through the gym doors for tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our best turnout ever," Herron said. "I guess success breeds success." 
* 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian's biggest success came last season with what Herron called 
his best team. 
</P>
<P>
 With Beard, a 6-foot-4 outside hitter, and Jon Habben, a 6-5 outside hitter, 
the Heralds had a potent attack. Middle blockers, Tim Willey, who is 6-3, and 
Peter Schrock, who is 6-2, anchored the front line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hyde, a right-side hitter, and setter Chris Keife rounded out the squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could side out with every rotation," Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 But coming into last season, Herron faced numerous question marks because the 
Heralds had lost 10 of 14 players from a team that defeated Calvary Chapel for 
its second consecutive Southern Section title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And this season, Herron is a little apprehensive about talking about what 
could be a Southern Section-record fourth consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 Willey, Hyde and Keife return, but Beard, the school's first player to receive 
a Division I college scholarship, is at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be competitive, but I think Calvary Chapel should be the favorite in 
the Olympic League this year," Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Philip Schildts return for the Eagles, as does all-league setter 
Matt Wright. But Calvary Chapel Coach Chuck Wright thinks Herron might be 
sandbagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been such a good team in the past, you have to unseat them," Wright 
said. "They're innocent until proven guilty of not being the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave is a class guy and he's built a strong program. We've built ours up like 
theirs so we can compete with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The backbone to Whittier Christian's success is the success of its lower-level 
teams. Herron usually keeps about 40 players in his program during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teams in our league have trouble fielding just a varsity team," Herron 
said. "We've been fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids at our school want to play volleyball and there's a friendly rivalry 
between the sports here, but not more so than any other school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the football players sometimes tease the volleyball guys, but then we 
can just point to the championship rings. People want to play for a winning 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Herron credits his wife, Barbara, for much of the team's recent success. 
Barbara coaches the freshman-sophomore team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She teaches them the basics I want them to learn, so it's so much easier when 
I get them up on the varsity," Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willey, Hyde and Keife came up together through the program, and they don't 
want the winning tradition to end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure I think we want to win another championship and continue the tradition," 
said Willey, a returning all-league player and team captain. "But we know it 
won't be easy and it will take a lot of hard work to get back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Herron: "These guys want to win and they know how, ever since they were 
freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
 Willey, Hyde and Keife have never lost a varsity match. . .and they don't want 
to start now.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Oz Simmons (12th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 7-10, 5-5 in the South Coast League. Finished fourth in league and did 
not qualify for Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Matt Clem, 6-4, middle blocker, Sr.; Jeremy Darner, 6-5, 
outside hitter, Sr.; Bob Hefty, 6-8, middle blocker, Sr.; Neil Hewko, 6-4, 
outside hitter, Sr.; Wesley Tsai, 5-9, setter, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Chris Lacher, 6-0, outside hitter, Jr.; Troy Meyers, 6-0, 
outside hitter, Jr.; Miah Watt, 6-5, middle blocker, Jr.  
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: It's put-up-or-shut-up time for the Dolphins. Dana Hills features one 
of the county's top outside hitters in Darner, and one of the best middle 
blockers in Hefty. Clem and Hewko are two other college prospects who give Dana 
Hills the core of what could be a championship team. But Simmons has heard it 
before. "We've had the same big guys for four years, but the bottom line is 
that we need to produce," Simmons said. "We have the outside package, but we 
need what's inside . . . the guts." The Orange County championships in March 
should provide a good indication whether the Dolphins will be contenders or 
pretenders this season.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; ON LETTERMAN, LENO AND OTHERS SEEKING LATE-NIGHT 
RULE; THE LATE SHIFT: LETTERMAN, LENO & THE NETWORK BATTLE FOR THE NIGHT BY 
BILL CARTER ; HYPERION $24.95, 299 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mental image most of us have of David Letterman is that of a buoyant, 
boyish man with the Alfred E. Newman, devil-may-care grin. 
</P>
<P>
 But as we see in this gripping account of the surprisingly heated struggle for 
the honor of chatting amiably and sipping coffee from "The Tonight Show's" 
homey desk, nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Often self-loathing in these pages, Letterman readily, almost eagerly, 
catalogues his list of "failed" life decisions. And in the moments when he's 
not self-loathing, he's merely self-critical, as on those frequent occasions 
when he would hole up in his office to review the tape of a show in which he 
felt he had stumbled. "The staff," writes New York Times TV reporter Bill 
Carter, "would then hear crashing noises coming through the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many great showmen, Letterman's idol, Johnny Carson, hid much the same 
fears behind his mask of equanimity: "The most confident, smoothest man on 
television," Carter writes, "would sometimes, among his closest associates, 
blurt out how terrified he was that it might all disappear at any moment."  
</P>
<P>
 It may be disquieting to learn that the people whose whimsical, reassuring 
perspective on the day's events has for years helped lull us into a good 
night's sleep themselves possess deep fears. But the happy truth is that Carson 
and Letterman's fear of failure also has been their secret to success. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he has written this book mostly as a business history, Carter never 
attempts to explain how the two men derive inspiration from insecurity. But 
their magic clearly has something to do with their hypersensitivity to their 
moods and to those of their audiences.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as Carson seemed to know when a joke was bombing moments before we did, 
so too does Letterman become acutely sensitive during a show.  
</P>
<P>
 In this fly-on-the-wall account, flawed only by Carter's tendency to lapse 
into the oversaturated hues of TV writing (e.g. "(Jay) Leno was . . . a prince 
among the stand up frogs"), we are vividly drawn into Letterman's 
hyper-vigilant world.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, for instance, is Letterman describing his first appearance on "The 
Tonight Show," the one that he says abruptly ended "all those years hanging 
around the Comedy Store and driving around in your truck and heating up 
burritos at the 7-Eleven, and drinking warm quarts of beer": 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat down, and Johnny Carson is sitting right there, and you're just talking 
and talking and praying to God that it's over soon, and you're looking around 
and you're seeing stuff that you've seen on TV for years. And you can't let 
yourself think for a second or, you know, your head would explode. So you're 
talking and talking and just praying, 'Oh please go to a commercial, please go 
to a goddamn commercial!' And the next thing you know you're out of there and 
it's just, Holy Christ, I was on 'The Tonight Show!' " 
</P>
<P>
 In telling contrast, Leno is portrayed as the less-inspired comedian largely 
because of his unflappability. To "Tonight Show" staffers who confessed to 
feeling bothered or blue, Leno would ask, without irony: "What does that mean, 
stressed? I've never been stressed. . . . Down? . . . I've never been down." 
</P>
<P>
 If Leno harbors deep emotions, he keeps them under tight rein. Just minutes 
after witnessing his manager and friend scream at his show's producer, for 
example, Leno delivered a monologue as thoroughly hip and laid-back as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Leno may profit as much from his hard shell as Letterman does from 
his thin skin. It has enabled him to endure and accept a broad range of 
criticism, whether in his old Comedy Store nights (he'd hide in a bathroom 
stall after his gig to hear audience reaction) or in his "Tonight Show" days 
(he once sneaked into an NBC executive's closet to eavesdrop on a call in which 
the network's executives discussed whether to dump him for Letterman). 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Leno has weathered that storm (like Saddam Hussein, he told one 
reporter, "I think I have a bunker"), the new question is whether Letterman, 
the man whose entire comic identity seems founded on being the hip, ironic 
outsider, can hold onto his comic genius now that his 11:30 show on CBS has 
become the late-night ratings leader.  
</P>
<P>
 Will he be able to adapt to the constraints of Establishment television, which 
for decades he has called "scheming" and "sleazy"? Can this man who delights in 
steamrollering over Smurf dolls and smashing Energizer Bunnies to smithereens 
with baseball bats be as receptive as Leno is to the "focus groups" and 
"demographic master plans" that now rule so much of the mainstream media?  
</P>
<P>
 And last but not least, can he conduct kinder, gentler interviews with Cher 
and the other stars who have damned him with all sorts of four-letter words? 
</P>
<P>
 Only time, of course, and Mr. Nielsen's black box, will tell.

STREET SMART: A RED ALERT: TURNING RIGHT AGAINST RED ONTO ARTESIA IS WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I wish to bring to your attention a serious traffic problem in Buena Park at 
the southbound entrance to the Santa Ana Freeway. This intersection consists of 
the east and westbound traffic on Artesia Boulevard; the southbound Artesia 
off-ramp from the Santa Ana Freeway; Knott Avenue; and the southbound on-ramp 
onto the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 I refer only to the portion of Artesia Boulevard, about 250 feet, that is west 
of the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles westbound on Artesia need to cross the eastbound lanes of Artesia 
Boulevard from a left-turn lane to enter the southbound entrance to the Santa 
Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 This is possible because there is a portion of the westbound Artesia Boulevard 
to southbound Knott's left-turn signal cycle to permit this entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is with northbound vehicles on Knott Avenue making right-hand 
turns on red, particularly during the aforementioned left-turn cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 I observed that there are posted three "No Turn on Red" signs for the 
northbound traffic on Knott. The regularity with which the signs are ignored 
leads me to believe that their placement may not be most effective.  
</P>
<P>
 I would hope that additional enforcement might be considered during the 
morning commute hours and late morning to mid-afternoon and a review of the 
sign placement might be made. David G. Connett La Mirada Caltrans responded to 
your letter in two parts. First, they informed the Buena Park Police Department 
of your concerns and recommendations for additional law enforcement at Artesia 
Boulevard and the Santa Ana Freeway, Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem said.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also conducted an investigation of the area and concluded that the 
three "No Turn on Red" signs are prominently placed for all right-turning 
motorists to see, Orem said. The findings agreed with your suggestion that 
additional enforcement is needed to cite the drivers who ignore these signs, 
Orem said.

 The Orange County Transportation Authority has received a $450,000 grant from 
the Federal Highway Administration to develop a countywide electronic traveler 
information system.  
</P>
<P>
 The system will give drivers up-to-the-minute traffic conditions on freeways 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will enable drivers to switch on their televisions or make a phone 
call to plan their commutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, plans call for the technology to be used to gather traffic 
information from the freeway system and from the county's Smart Street network. 
The cost of that is estimated at $3 million. Full development of the system is 
expected over the next 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The $450,000 grant is being used for design and engineering.

MTA FACING HARD CHOICES ON SUBWAY; TRANSIT: AGENCY MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP 
USING BUILDER AND MANAGEMENT FIRM WHOSE WORK WAS FOUND DEFICIENT. LIABILITY FOR 
NEEDED REPAIRS IS UNRESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After five months of waiting for outside specialists to render judgments on 
the quality of the construction and supervision of the $1.45-billion Los 
Angeles subway, the results are in. For members of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, now comes the hard part. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency must decide whether to continue awarding lucrative contracts to a 
subway builder whose work was found deficient, and whether to entrust the 
supervision of future construction to a management firm that oversaw the 
defective work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board clearly is troubled with going forward with the primary 
(construction) contractor involved in this matter," said Marvin L. Holen, an 
MTA board member and Los Angeles attorney. He said the board is similarly 
concerned regarding the future role of the construction management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two reports issued last week by outside specialists concluded that the 
tunnels were structurally safe, but recommended extensive repairs -- including 
grouting to fill air voids in the concrete and sealing of deep cracks, some of 
which are conduits for corrosive water. 
</P>
<P>
 The other report said the company that oversaw the construction fell short of 
"acceptable industry practice" in seven key categories of performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies were conducted in response to a Times article reporting that 
numerous sections of the tunnel walls were built thinner than designed. The 
subway's construction and costs remain under investigation by the FBI and the 
inspector general's office of the U.S. Department of Transportation. State and 
county health authorities are conducting a separate inquiry of elevated levels 
in the subway of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic sulfur-smelling gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the builder whose tunnel work was found deficient, Tutor-Saliba Corp., is 
the low bidder on $118 million in new contracts that could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham, the firm that oversaw Tutor-Saliba's work, remains the 
MTA's management firm for ongoing subway tunneling on Hollywood and Vermont 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledged that the continuing roles of the two companies 
complicate the difficult choices that the outside experts' findings pose for 
the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there are the repairs. Who will pay for them? Who will perform and 
inspect the work? 
</P>
<P>
 MTA staff members are proposing to open the repair work to competition and to 
have it performed by someone other than Tutor-Saliba. Then, they said, the 
agency should seek remuneration from Tutor-Saliba and Parsons-Dillingham.  
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation has not yet been submitted to the board. But one official, 
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said: "This (repair work) is going 
to come at tremendous expense to the taxpayers -- and they (Tutor-Saliba and 
Parsons-Dillingham) ought to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimate of the repair costs has not been made -- and the MTA has yet to 
negotiate agreements with Parsons-Dillingham or Tutor-Saliba to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Ronald N. Tutor said he would agree to perform some repairs 
without charge -- but he called "ludicrous" any proposal to bill him for 
someone else's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would anybody in their right mind consider using anybody else?" Tutor 
said. "I don't think it would be appropriate to send me the bill if they 
haven't given me the opportunity to do the work."  
</P>
<P>
 The outside experts found defects in much of Tutor-Saliba's construction of 
1.8 miles of twin tunnels between Union Station and Pershing Square, including 
thin walls and air voids in the crowns of the structures. Tutor-Saliba was paid 
$89 million -- 45% over its original bid -- to build the tunnels in question, 
plus part of the Civic Center station. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Alatorre, the Los Angeles City Council member who is chairman of the 
MTA, said he would await more detailed analyses of the experts' reports before 
deciding whether to challenge Tutor-Saliba's hold on two of three new contracts 
for which the firm submitted the lowest bids. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first two contracts, totaling $73 million, were awarded in November, 
officials did so with the special condition that they could terminate the 
awards if the experts' findings were critical of Tutor-Saliba. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to those conditions, Tutor told the MTA board on Nov. 17 that he 
expected the experts "will give us the clean bill of health we're entitled to." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, six MTA commissioners -- one short of a majority -- opposed 
awarding the third contract, for $45 million, to Tutor-Saliba. Further action 
on the contract, to build a station at Sunset Boulevard, was postponed until 
the agency's meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre voted in favor of awarding the contract to Tutor-Saliba. "I am 
disappointed in the work they did on the initial (tunnels)," he said in an 
interview. "It's very disheartening. Do you eighty-six somebody? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Parsons-Dillingham, the firm paid in excess of $170 million to oversee 
subway construction, representatives have pledged cooperation -- but have 
stopped short of saying they will pay for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One report issued last week said that Parsons-Dillingham's performance in 
overseeing two more recent construction contracts was improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do our share to implement the recommendations from the reports," said 
Ray W. Judson, special assistant to the chairman of Parsons Corp., parent of 
Parsons-Dillingham. "Our intention is to be part of the solution, and as such 
we will continue to cooperate with the MTA to the fullest extent to resolve 
these issues."

QUAKE OPENS UP NEW GROUND FOR POLITICIANS; CONGRESS: HOUSE MEMBERS FROM 
NORTHRIDGE-AREA DISTRICTS SHARE IN THE PAIN. THEY ALSO GET A CHANCE TO FORGE 
CLOSER TIES TO CONSTITUENTS AND BOOST THEIR PROFILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For congressmen whose communities were devastated by the Northridge 
earthquake, it has been the worst of times and the best of times. 
</P>
<P>
 They have faced the double whammy of being displaced from their own 
quake-damaged offices at a time when they were scrambling to help constituents. 
But in a few intense weeks, they have also had an extraordinary opportunity to 
forge closer ties to their districts and boost their public profiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite operating out of makeshift quarters in the old San Fernando police 
station, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said that what he and 
"primarily my staff have been able to do in the last month may exceed what we 
have been able to do for our constituents over the last 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 First-term Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), whose district 
includes Northridge, has played tour guide to President Clinton, Vice President 
Al Gore and various Cabinet officials visiting quake-ravaged sites. And he has 
been interviewed by CNN, the Washington Post and local television and radio 
stations -- all of which is noted in an "internal memo" on McKeon's quake 
response that his office sent to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) reports that his office has 
fielded more than 2,500 quake-related calls, and that he and his wife have 
dispensed hugs to dozens of people. For him, the "spirit people find in 
themselves and each other" has been the tragedy's silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually too far away to be involved with the daily lives of those they 
represent, the lawmakers have been jolted into expanded roles as ombudsmen for 
the distressed. Their work clearly has aided them politically, but they insist 
that those benefits mean far less than the chance to directly help people in 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the congressmen were in California for their midwinter break when the 
quake occurred. Initially, they acted as eyes and ears for federal and state 
officials pouring in to provide emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the representatives have toured shelters, disaster centers and 
neighborhoods, and commiserated with constituents. Beilenson was struck by the 
many residents whose homes and businesses were demolished, a one-two punch that 
he said left "a lot of people in tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman recalls a night at a shelter in the Van Nuys High School gymnasium 
packed with hundreds of people -- Jewish seniors from North Hollywood, 
immigrants from Iran and Armenia, Latinos from San Fernando, blacks from 
Pacoima -- "a microcosm of Southern California all thrown together by this 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Washington, the lawmakers helped pass the $8.6-billion emergency 
relief bill, the biggest disaster aid package ever adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Clarke, a Northridge corporate political consultant and former chief 
congressional aide, said such a catastrophe offers elected officials a golden 
opportunity to appear effective as well as concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to deal with this than a smaller problem," where results may be 
harder to come by, Clarke said. "So it seems to me that this is the type of 
thing you hop on." 
</P>
<P>
 Relating to constituents' hardship came naturally. The lawmakers shared some 
of the physical and mental trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 The chimney at McKeon's home was destroyed, his Santa Clarita district office 
was trashed and several Western clothing stores that he and his brothers own 
were temporarily closed. His brother Joe's home was so badly damaged that Joe 
McKeon and his family moved in with the lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman's fifth-floor office in a Panorama City high-rise was turned 
topsy-turvy. The building was condemned initially, but may be reopened. The 
lawmaker is making arrangements to move to new quarters while making due in 
temporary facilities. "We've gone back to the horse-and-buggy days of plain old 
typewriters," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is sharing space with other government agencies that were ousted from their 
offices by the quake. Some are working in the former San Fernando police 
building's graffiti-covered jail cells and holding tanks. Papers and files are 
strewn throughout Berman's office. 
</P>
<P>
 His staff has been able to retrieve only some constituent case files and other 
documents. In the days immediately after the temblor, he and other lawmakers 
operated out of aides' homes, relying on cellular phones to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon had to be ferried from the Santa Clarita Valley to the San Fernando 
Valley by Los Angeles County sheriff's helicopters because the Golden State 
Freeway had collapsed. Berman and his aides obtained vital water and medicine 
for displaced people throughout San Fernando, Sylmar and Van Nuys. Beilenson 
lobbied for emergency tents to be erected in parks throughout his district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath, the congressional staffs report an explosion of constituent 
calls for earthquake-related assistance. They poured into McKeon's office at a 
rate of 200 a week -- five times the usual flow. Beilenson sent out a letter 
with information about aid programs; earthquake problems have kept his district 
office phones ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers said they were deeply impressed by the resilience they observed. 
Such was the case when Berman came across Mary Isabella Kidd at the Sylmar High 
School shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, 80, who uses a wheelchair, and her adult, brain-damaged son had lost 
their home. Prone on a green cot, the spirited Kidd told Berman that she was 
philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm half Chinese and my father used to say not to worry when we had an 
earthquake," she said with a smile. "It was just a dragon turning over. And now 
the dragon's done turning." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, a conservative critic of big government, emerged from the post-quake 
experience with respect for the performance of a federal bureaucracy he had 
disparaged as a morass of red tape and unresponsiveness. And he was 
uncharacteristically complimentary of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a fantastic job at all levels," McKeon said.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside a shelter after the quake, Berman encountered Margaret Leeseman, 72, 
who said she had fled her trailer park home when "my hair caught on fire." The 
lawmaker inquired about her needs and gave her phone numbers to call for 
disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's buttering his bread," Leeseman said after Berman departed. "I don't mean 
to be mean about it, because a lot of people will be helped. I think it's 
smart. In times of trouble maybe there's nothing wrong with being 
political-minded."

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: TO EXPLAIN TRAFFIC, THEY AVOID IT

 From Rudy Grande's vantage, the afternoon commute doesn't look all that bad. 
It is actually kind of pretty: a shimmering string of brake lights winking red 
along the Ventura Freeway through Sherman Oaks as a fiery sun sinks below the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what is beautiful from a helicopter at 1,000 feet is, at street level, 
nothing more than yet another clutch-mangling, teeth-gnashing commuting 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 As an airborne radio traffic reporter, Grande spots the bottlenecks and 
bumper-thumpers on Southern California freeways and helps drivers steer clear 
of them. Thousands of commuters -- from San Bernardino rock 'n' rollers to 
Westside National Public Radio types -- depend on Grande's daily observations 
from on high to get them home in time for dinner. Or at least in time for, 
well, bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in post-quake Los Angeles, where damaged freeways have turned 
commuting into a crapshoot, Grande and others like him act as eyes in the sky 
to warn drivers of trouble ahead and spy alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different every day," said Grande, who broadcasts live reports from the 
air an average of every two or three minutes during the morning and afternoon 
commutes. He works for Metro Traffic Control, the largest traffic reporting 
service in Southern California. "It's a fun gig." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The flight takes off at 4 p.m. sharp from Van Nuys Airport. As pilot Al Davis 
checks the gauges in his preflight routine, Grande dashes across the Tarmac, 
hops in the back seat of the Bell JetRanger and slams the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, Davis lifts the aircraft off the ground and points it north 
toward the beleaguered Newhall Pass. As Davis chats with the airport tower, 
Grande slips on his headphones and adjusts the radio equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lap rests a clipboard to jot down problem areas. Notes at the top of 
the page remind Grande of which of seven radio stations is carrying his 
broadcast at any given time. Over the next two hours, he constantly monitors 
the stations, listening for his cues and changing from straight man to 
funnyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasting for oldies station KRTH 101.1 FM, he remarks on the sunset, made 
blood red by a shroud of smog. But for public radio station KCRW 89.9 FM, his 
reporting is spare and tight. Same goes for his spots on news station KNX 1070 
AM. 
</P>
<P>
 In the front seat next to pilot Davis, another Metro Traffic reporter, Jorge 
Jarrin, files dispatches in the same frantic pace for a handful of English- and 
Spanish-language stations.  
</P>
<P>
 With his laminated Thomas Bros. map spread across his lap, Grande, a former 
disc jockey from Albuquerque, peers down at the Santa Monica Freeway and looks 
for less-congested surface streets. He suggests Washington Boulevard on his 
next report. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tricky business. Traffic is fluid and it changes from minute to 
minute. Because it is impossible to monitor all the freeways, Grande and other 
airborne reporters swap information over their radios. For instance, a reporter 
over the San Bernardino Freeway reports a tie-up, which Grande includes in one 
of his dispatches -- even though he is over the Long Beach Freeway at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notice," he says, "I didn't say I saw it. But somebody did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the ground, Grande talks about the service he and other traffic 
reporters provide for commuters. "Maybe by listening to my report, someone will 
make it home a little less likely to kick the dog," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a USC professor believes that the way Grande and others present their 
information reinforces aggressive driving attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is like being in one of the those carnivals with bumper cars," 
said Sandra Ball-Rokeach, a communications expert at the Annenberg School of 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ball-Rokeach does not argue that traffic reports make people drive like 
maniacs, she does believe that humanizing the reports could make motorists more 
careful as they drive. 
</P>
<P>
 That is fine for a classroom, Grande said. But from his vantage at the top of 
the world, the bottom line is telling freeway drivers how to get from here to 
there with the least hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to identify with the guy on the street," said Grande, who, like 
everyone else, hates traffic jams. "What I would want to hear is what I'm going 
to say."

TUG OF WAR OVER REVITALIZING VERMONT; DEVELOPMENT: A POLITICAL FEUD HAS 
ERUPTED. COUNCILMAN RIDLEY-THOMAS BACKS A HOUSING AND RETAIL COMPLEX ON THE 
AVENUE. REP. WATERS SAYS LOW-INCOME HOUSING SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bank's plan to finance an ambitious low-income housing complex in 
South-Central Los Angeles is swiftly emerging as a battle royal between two of 
the city's top African American political heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner stands City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who hails the 
$10-million-plus First Interstate Bank proposal as the largest single private 
investment along blighted Vermont Avenue since Pepperdine University departed 
for Malibu more than two decades ago. Ridley-Thomas, who envisions the 
development as a housing and retail complex that would function as a flagship 
for the neighborhood, is serving on a judging panel for a statewide 
architectural competition to design the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition is Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who says a 
strictly commercial use is essential for the 75,000-square-foot parcel, located 
just two blocks from her Spanish-style home in the middle-class Vermont Knolls 
neighborhood. Waters has sponsored community meetings and led the first of what 
she says will be a series of noisy public demonstrations. She has spearheaded 
an effort to offer funds received from the federal government by a riot 
recovery agency to buy up the bank's option on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has led to charges of a "not-in-my-back-yard" mentality in a 
neighborhood far removed from the suburban communities that generally raise a 
stink about low-income housing being built in their neighborhoods. It has also 
provoked simmering questions about the relative responsibility of urban and 
suburban communities to house the poor, raised planning issues concerning the 
best means of redeveloping a chronically depressed commercial corridor, and 
cast a spotlight on a long-festering political feud between Ridley-Thomas and 
Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the relationship was such that our constituents would benefit in ways 
they are not currently benefiting," Ridley-Thomas said. "The community deserves 
new housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters counters that the councilman is misguided, that "my neighborhood has 
plenty of low-income housing already," and that Vermont Avenue should be the 
subject of a sustained redevelopment effort that would turn the thoroughfare 
into a South-Central version of Old Town Pasadena or Santa Monica's equally 
popular Third Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gotten caught in the middle," said First Interstate spokesman Rich 
Wyler. "Our intention is to sponsor a project the community will welcome. That 
doesn't necessarily mean we'll have 100% support anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we remain committed to the project." 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, one of many banking institutions long criticized for a 
dearth of inner-city investment, has pitched the 130-unit development as a 
centerpiece for the South-Central neighborhood and a model for projects that 
would spur private investment in neglected communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're forging new ground here," Wyler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel in question consists of an empty lot and the long-vacant Pepperdine 
administration building at 81st Street and Vermont, an Art Deco landmark that 
will almost surely be incorporated into the final design of the housing and 
commercial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 To enhance the project's quality, First Interstate launched a design 
competition last month headed by architect Donald Stastny, who has managed 
competitions to design the imposing Beverly Hills Civic Center and the far-out 
Walt Disney Concert Hall now under construction in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A judging panel will trim the field of 66 architects who have expressed 
interest. Three finalists, who would link up with affordable housing 
development organizations to produce joint entries, will each receive $25,000 
from First Interstate to develop proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner is scheduled to be selected in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which has pledged to finance the construction contract of $10 
million to $14 million, would be paid back through government subsidies and 
rents on the low- and-moderate income units. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept fits into the broad guidelines of a 1992 Urban Land Institute 
report that recommended a mix of commercial and residential development to 
revitalize the Vermont corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically felt that just a strip of commercial development is not the best 
approach," the institute panel's chairman, Smedes York, a former mayor of 
Raleigh, N.C., said in an interview. "(And) certainly affordable housing is a 
key component of any plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's report suggested that the former Pepperdine building could 
become the focal point of a theater, dining and entertainment district along 
Vermont. But York said the panel was not wedded to any specific use for each 
building on the wide thoroughfare, which divides the well-kept Vermont Knolls 
enclave from a scruffy neighborhood of blighted apartments and houses to the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city, the county and many organizations have been very supportive" of the 
project, said First Interstate's Wyler. "It's interesting that someone who can 
be so critical of lack of investment in the community now is so critical of 
investment in the community," he added without referring to Waters by name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, Waters, who as an assemblywoman urged increased state funds for 
low-income housing, maintains that residents are staunchly opposed to this 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 With an 11% rental housing vacancy rate in her neighborhood, Waters said, 
government funds instead should go to rehabilitating structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got low-income housing to the south of me," she said. "And to the north 
of me. We just don't need any more piled up on us." 
</P>
<P>
 For too long, Waters added, inner-city neighborhoods have been saddled with 
the burden of accepting subsidized housing for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to do is spread (new) low-income housing throughout the greater 
Los Angeles area," she said. "The earthquake has just created a need for 
housing and the possibility of new locations for low-income housing. They have 
a great opportunity to go north to Reseda and Granada Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting that her beef is with the bank rather than Ridley-Thomas, 
Waters said the councilman "is doing what elected officials normally do." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a private individual comes along and says they want to do a project, 
elected officials will say sure. What they envision is they're going to be able 
to cut a ribbon and say we've put in housing. They don't think about or care 
whether it's commercial land or whether they should be doing some planning." 
</P>
<P>
 With the median family income of Vermont Knolls roughly equivalent to the 
citywide average (more than twice the $14,000 annual figure of the census tract 
to the east), Waters said the neighborhood can support additional commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need and would like to have things such as a bookstore, a bakery, a floral 
shop, restaurants, a mini-theater," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Waters and residents of her neighborhood met with Mayor Richard 
Riordan and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and won 
pledges of city and federal assistance to help prepare an overall community 
development plan for the Vermont corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said Community Build Inc., the agency she created and for which she 
helped win $3 million of funding after the 1992 riots, could serve as the 
vehicle for undertaking development projects. Recently, Waters introduced 
neighborhood groups to a Cleveland-based developer interested in putting 
together a multimillion-dollar financial package to fund extensive commercial 
development along the Vermont corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to First Interstate last month, Community Build President Brenda 
Shockley offered to purchase the bank's option on the former Pepperdine lot and 
suggested that the bank "join with Community Build and others to design the 
most attractive and feasible commercial development for the site." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said last week that the offer is still on the table. "They can take my 
check for $90,000," she said. "I'll give it to them tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters added that there would be no problems using the federal monies granted 
to Community Build -- which has yet to develop a significant project -- to 
purchase the option. "It's exactly what it's for -- economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas counters that the offer is, at best, just talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem to date is that Community Build has not performed," the 
councilman said. "So what level of confidence ought we have that they can 
deliver?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said the First Interstate project is a major step in stimulating 
commercial investment and for improving living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my council district, most housing is pre-World War II," he said. 
"Revitalization means you build modern structures. The biggest impediment to 
building is financing. And here we have a bank that has guaranteed up to $14 
million of first-class affordable housing and commercial development."

STREET SMART: TRAFFIC REPORTER SEES BEAUTY AND THE BEAST FROM THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Rudy Grande's vantage, the afternoon commute doesn't look all that bad. 
It's actually kind of pretty: a shimmering string of brake lights winking red 
along the Ventura Freeway through Sherman Oaks as a fiery sun sinks below the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what is beautiful from a helicopter at 1,000 feet is, at street level, 
nothing more than another clutch-mangling, teeth-gnashing nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 As an airborne radio traffic reporter, Grande spots the bottlenecks and 
bumper-thumpers on Southern California freeways and helps drivers steer clear 
of them. Thousands of commuters -- from San Bernardino rock 'n' rollers to 
Westside National Public Radio types -- depend on Grande's daily observations 
from on high to get them home in time for dinner -- or at least in time for, 
well, bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in post-quake Los Angeles, where damaged freeways have turned 
commuting into a crapshoot, Grande and others like him act as eyes in the sky 
to warn drivers of trouble ahead and spy alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different every day," says Grande, who broadcasts live reports from the 
air an average of every two or three minutes during the morning and afternoon 
commutes. He works for Metro Traffic Control Inc., the largest 
traffic-reporting service in Southern California. "It's a fun gig." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The flight takes off at 4 p.m. sharp from Van Nuys Airport. As pilot Al Davis 
checks the gauges in his preflight routine, Grande dashes across the Tarmac, 
hops into the back seat of the Bell JetRanger and slams the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, Davis lifts the aircraft off the ground and points it north 
toward the beleaguered Newhall Pass. As Davis chats with the airport tower, 
Grande slips on his headphones and adjusts the radio equipment at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lap rests a clipboard to jot down problem areas. Notes at the top of 
the page remind Grande which of the seven radio stations to which he reports is 
carrying his broadcast at any given time. Over the next two hours, he 
constantly monitors the stations, listening for his cues and changing his style 
from straight man to funny man. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasting for oldies station KRTH 101.1-FM, he remarks on the sunset, made 
bloody red by a shroud of smog. But for public radio station KCRW 89.9-FM, his 
reporting is spare and tight. The same goes for his spots on news station KNX 
1070-AM, which run every six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the front seat next to Davis, another Metro Traffic reporter, Jorge Jarrin, 
files dispatches in the same frantic pace for talk station KABC 790-AM and a 
handful of Spanish-language stations. 
</P>
<P>
 With his laminated Thomas Bros. map spread across his lap, Grande, a former 
disc jockey from Albuquerque, N. M., peers down at the Santa Monica Freeway and 
looks for less congested surface streets. He suggests Washington Boulevard on 
his next report. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tricky business. Traffic is fluid and it changes from minute to 
minute. But monitoring all freeways is impossible, so Grande and other airborne 
reporters swap information over their radios. For instance, a reporter over the 
San Bernardino Freeway reports a tie-up, which Grande includes in one of his 
dispatches -- even though he is over the Long Beach Freeway at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notice," he says, "I didn't say I saw it. But somebody did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the ground, Grande talks about the service he and other traffic 
reporters provide for commuters. "Maybe by listening to my report, someone will 
make it home a little less likely to kick the dog," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But a USC professor thinks that the way Grande and others present their 
information reinforces aggressive driving attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is like being in one of those carnivals with bumper cars," 
said Sandra Ball-Rokeach, a communications professor at the Annenberg School. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball-Rokeach does not argue that traffic reports make people drive like 
maniacs. But she does believe that humanizing the reports could make motorists 
more careful as they drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Identification mechanisms -- such as a person's age and sex -- often are not 
there," she said. "The reports often send out the message that cars get hurt -- 
not people. Think of the reports that describe a crash as 'five cars off to the 
side' or a 'jackknifed truck.' But you don't hear about what's happened to the 
passengers in the car or to the truck driver." 
</P>
<P>
 She wants radio and television traffic reporters to make their dispatches more 
sensitive and refer to values such as responsibility, health, politeness and 
self-control. This could be done, she said, without making reports wordy or 
boring or preachy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can do it in a very efficient and entertaining way," she said, 
explaining that it may take several years for her ideas to catch on. "It has to 
be a community effort." 
</P>
<P>
 All that's fine for a classroom, Grande said. But from his vantage point at 
the top of the world, the bottom line is telling freeway drivers how to get 
from here to there with the least amount of hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to identify with the guy on the street," says Grande, who, like 
everyone else, hates traffic jams. "What I would want to hear is what I'm going 
to say." 
</P>
<P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am part of a group that discusses urban folklore and legends, and a variety 
of rumors and puzzling questions about traffic laws pop up in our discussions 
from time to time. I'm hoping you can settle one of the more frequent points of 
debate within our group. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people claim that if a police car, fire engine, ambulance and mail truck 
all pulled up to a four-way intersection at the same time, the mail truck would 
have the right of way over the other three vehicles. Reasons for this answer 
range from the mail truck's being a federal vehicle to the possibility that the 
mail truck could be carrying a declaration of war. Could you please explain 
whether the mail truck would have the right of way, and if so, why? 
</P>
<P>
 David Mikkelson, San Fernando Valley Folklore Society, Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yours sounds like an exciting group. And although it took some doing, we at 
Street Smart found the answer to your query. However, it may only provide more 
fuel for your debates. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the mail truck does not have the right of way. Like other vehicles 
and even pedestrians, it must pull to the side of the road to let the emergency 
vehicles pass. After that, it gets a little more complicated. Our answer comes 
from Bill Madison, a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else we queried thought the question was unique, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about the craziest thing I've ever heard," said an officer with the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. "I don't even know how 
people have time to think about stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, we pressed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," a California Highway Patrol officer said in a tone that suggested he 
didn't take the question seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Madison responded. "The mail truck is not even in the running, unless 
the guy is a complete idiot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely, in fact, that the President and the Congress would post a 
declaration of war through the regular mail. ("Hillary, do you have a stamp?") 
Even a U. S. Postal Service spokeswoman said diplomatic couriers are the more 
likely route. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the mail truck is safely to the side of the road, the question 
becomes trickier. Madison speculated that dispatchers would solve the situation 
before it arose. If they did not, he said it would make sense for the police 
car to go first and then the firetruck. The ambulance would go last, he said, 
because if "five seconds makes a difference, you probably aren't going to save 
the guy anyway." 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What constitutes a speed trap, and are they legal? From time to time on the 
northern down slope of Barham Boulevard, heading toward Burbank, an officer 
with a radar speed detector is stationed to catch those going over the 
35-m.p.h. speed limit. Insofar as almost everybody (except me, of course) goes 
at least 45 m.p.h. after leaving the Lake Hollywood intersection at the top, 
it's rather like shooting fish in a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 And in view of the wide boulevard and the long stretches without side roads, 
such a speed is not, in my opinion, dangerous. In spite of the fact that I use 
Barham a number of times each week and am aware of the possibility of the radar 
trap, I find it difficult to remember that it might be there and inadvertently 
go with the flow, but fortunately I have not forgotten and have not fallen 
afoul of the radar. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward P. Ancona, Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 To answer the second part of your question first, speed traps are not legal. 
But the situation you describe along Barham Boulevard is not a speed trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us probably think of speed traps as some small-town cop hiding on his 
motorcycle behind a Dairy Queen sign waiting for interstate travelers to zip by 
at Daytona speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to CHP Officer Tito Gomez, the vehicle code defines a speed trap 
as a section of highway that is measured so patrol officers can calculate a 
driver's speed by timing how long it takes to travel between Point A and Point 
B -- such as between two over-crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, the officers never really drive alongside the speeder. This is 
illegal. They are supposed to either calculate the speed by literally following 
the speeder or by using radar. 
</P>
<P>
 A speed trap can also mean an officer is using radar on a stretch of road on 
which a speed limit is posted but has not recently been reviewed by traffic 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of a road that was last determined to have a speed limit of 25 m.p.h. 10 
years ago. In the meantime, the road has been widened or improved in some way 
to make faster travel safe. But the speed limit stays 25. If an officer nails a 
driver with radar on that street for driving faster than 25 m.p.h., it can be 
considered a speed trap. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Officer Tom Souza said that all city streets on which radar is used are 
surveyed regularly. Even then, he said, the officer probably won't ticket a 
driver for driving just a little fast. Souza said surveys are done to determine 
a street's safe speed, and that may be a few miles over the posted limit.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: FORMER OWNER OF QUARTER HORSES OPERATES BED AND BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ginger Hyland went from being a pampered princess to champion quarter-horse 
breeder and trainer, but now is running a bed and breakfast in a restored 
Victorian-style farmhouse in the tiny community of Lake Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 She misses her horses, but she loves living in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyland was born in 1947 into a family of privilege, and grew up in a mansion 
in Holmby Hills. Her late father was L. A. (Buzz) Hyland, credited with 
discovering radar, a distinction that caught entrepreneur Howard Hughes' eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes hired Buzz Hyland after he served in the Navy and brought him to 
California to run the Hughes aircraft empire. Hyland was president and then 
chairman of the board from 1954 until his retirement in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Hyland attended posh Westlake School where she was two years behind 
Candice Bergen. But a life-changing experience occurred in December, 1959, when 
the Hylands took a drive out to the wilderness of what was then the even tinier 
community of Lake Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents wanted a little weekend getaway where we could have horses and 
some beautiful scenery," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hylands drove to the northern end of Los Angeles County to look at a ranch 
for sale, but ended up at another property. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little girl was selling apples by the roadside so we stopped to buy some 
and chat with her and her father," Hyland recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her father told us about another property we might want to look at since it 
was on the way to the one we'd originally set out to see. We drove to the White 
Oaks Ranch where my parents took one look and bought it on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 The family has owned the White Oaks Ranch ever since, moving into it full time 
after Buzz Hyland's retirement. Her mother still lives there. After Ginger 
Hyland attended Cal Poly Pomona and the University of Lexington she also came 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking the pre-veterinarian course but didn't stay because that wasn't 
what I wanted," she said. "What I wanted was to breed and raise quarter 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Hyland was forced to sell her own horses for financial 
reasons, but still trains other people's horses. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has a new passion to help keep her occupied, one that was sitting 
next door to her for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victorian next to the Hyland ranch was built in 1892 by members of the 
Manzana Colony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The colony was a group of Midwest farmers who had come out in the later part 
of the 1800s and grew fruit trees, mostly apples, apricots and plums," Hyland 
says. "But a drought forced them to sell the property, which was then bought by 
three brothers from Yugoslavia who stayed until the last brother died in 1977." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyland bought the house in 1979 when it was in bad shape. "Everything needed 
doing," Hyland says. 
</P>
<P>
 She brought to the restoration some of the same enthusiasm she poured into 
breeding champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked with Linda Allen from . . . Tennessee, who is a master at antiquing 
and restoring antique things," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the local interest shown in the house, Hyland now allows visitors 
to tour the property. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who would like a longer stay, there is a new bed and breakfast in 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The front porch of the Victorian looks out on the lawn and the gazebo, where 
we hold weddings. In back there is a stream, meadow, duck pond and the National 
Forest," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyland, who never married, says she loves taking people through the Victorian 
and has received many letters from people saying how much they enjoyed the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she enjoys sharing her beautiful new architectural baby with the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I invite people to come out and spend a day 100 years ago," she says. 
Alcoholism for the Elderly Can Be Life-Threatening 
</P>
<P>
 What's the harm in grandpa taking a few sips too many? 
</P>
<P>
 What if grandmother is nipping in the sherry and it's starting to nip back? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, haven't old folks earned the right to overdo it? 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the harm, after all? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Al Jeffries, executive director of the National Council on 
Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, headquartered in Van Nuys, the harm can be 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about people who are going to jeopardize their marriages or 
jobs or go out and kill someone driving," Jeffries says. The problem is that 
these people may be killing themselves by putting their already frail bodies at 
risk of injury and malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries, head of the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley area 
council offices, says many elderly people who slip over the edge from social 
drinking to alcoholism do so because of loneliness, isolation and fear of 
illness and death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once drinking increases, so does the chance of dangerous falls and loss of 
appetite," says Jeffries. "Alcohol also blocks the body's ability to absorb 
nutrients that the frail older body desperately needs." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that many elderly are in denial. "They don't want to hear what we have 
to say." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't stop Jeffries and his staff from trying to help older people 
protect themselves from the problems that accompany alcoholism. And they keep 
trying to develop new ways to reach this group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Clarita office, C. W. Frost is part of an intervention team that 
gently confronts elderly alcoholics upon request from family or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Frost and Jeffries say the elderly will continue to be a target 
population for their ongoing efforts, but that reaching them is the hardest 
part. Lancaster Man Helps Others Only Because It Feels Good 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Towner was born with cerebral palsy in Lancaster 50 years ago. He 
struggled through school, then held a number of low-paying jobs. His last job 
lasted only one day after he fell off a construction-site elevator, injuring 
his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lift was one of those open things they use to take workers up and down. 
Another man on the lift jumped off and Charlie fell off," his mother, Theresa 
Towner, says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that being on disability hasn't slowed him down any more than his 
disease has. "He's got a good attitude and he enjoys life," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also one of the most active members of the Lancaster community. "No 
matter what's going on, Charlie is there to help," Connie Wilson, of the 
Chamber of Commerce, says. 
</P>
<P>
 Towner helps get trees for needy families at Christmas. He lines up tractors 
to pull floats for the annual Lancaster parade. He helps local service groups, 
like the Elks, with their charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie knows everyone in town, and knows how to get things done, Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the chamber honored him at a dinner with its Unsung Hero of the Year 
Award. Since then, he's stepped up his efforts to be a positive force in the 
Lancaster community. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he does all the community service work, he says, "It makes me feel 
good." Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I love eating here. It's so reassuring. It makes me feel as if the '80s might 
come back after all. Don't you agree?"

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; TOUGH DECISIONS IN TOUGH TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1980s were a period of rapid incorporation of cities in Orange County, 
where new municipalities were fueled by the heady promise of local control and 
buoyant local tax bases. The 1990s have proved to be something else again.  
</P>
<P>
 In these new times of budget crisis, the decisions to go it alone have put 
residents in the position of having to decide whether to dig deep for their own 
services or to make the best of what they have. The debate over a library for 
Mission Viejo is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County library within the city's borders is too small for the 
population it serves, but finding money for a new building has been a problem. 
The answer is not, as some Mission Viejo officials seem to think, picking the 
pockets of a financially strapped county. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mission Viejo rode the wave of incorporations in Orange County in the 
1980s like so many others, the future seemed bright. Continuing development and 
ever-increasing home prices meant new residents and more revenues to pay for 
police, fire and other services. Newly incorporated cities received sales tax 
revenues from malls and flourishing businesses. The loser was the Orange County 
government, which saw its tax base eroded at the same time it was required to 
keep administering state programs for health and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1991, Mission Viejo had $20 million in reserves, seemingly 
plenty of money for a host of community projects. But after several years of 
recession, the possibility of a deficit looms. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the city did pay $2.5 million for land for a new library. The 
current building was built in 1972, when Mission Viejo had 15,000 residents. 
Today it has 82,000, and the building falls well short of state and county 
standards for library size. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo voters were given the chance to pass a $5-million bond issue, 
which we supported, in 1992. It would have financed building a library on land 
the city had bought. But only 56% of the voters said yes. That was short of the 
constitutionally required two-thirds margin, admittedly an awfully tough 
standard to meet. It might be wise to bring local bond issue measures in line 
with the state, which requires a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials have claimed that Orange County should have spent some of 
the special district money it collected from Mission Viejo and other 
communities for a library in the city. That is unrealistic. With Sacramento 
diverting funds from counties so the state could balance its own books, Orange 
County was forced to plug holes in its budget in recent years. The special 
district funds went for county fire services, with supervisors correctly 
believing that while it would be nice to have both, in a fiscal crunch, 
taxpayers cared more about public safety than libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo is now considering leaving the county library system and running 
a municipal library itself. That's worth studying. City officials have received 
a consultant's report but need more research on operating costs and tax 
revenues. Tough economic times require tough decisions, and city residents must 
decide what services they are willing to finance.

JAZZ REVIEW; BAZOOKA FIRES AWAY WITH HUMOR, ORIGINALITY AT SYSTEM M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though its music may be acidic, Bazooka is no acid jazz band. In fact, the 
aggressive sax, bass and drums threesome that's often billed as an acid band 
has more in common with traditional jazz trios than it does with the current 
wave of monotonously rhythmic, riff-swiping acid aggregations whose main 
attraction is the hypnotic quality of their sound. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Bazooka doesn't rap, sample or steal from other musicians' recordings. 
They play real instruments on strangely assembled, sometimes convoluted themes 
that often change chords and rhythms (something apparently taboo in the world 
of acid jazz). Improvisation, something that comes off as contrived from acid 
bands, is a major factor in their presentation. But the real difference is the 
edge they bring to their music, an often stunning declaration that expresses 
the pace and uncertainty of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 But this approach isn't without humor. Just when its attack threatens to 
become overbearing, the band throws in some laughs in the form of saxophonist 
Tony Atherton's bird squawks or drummer Vince Meghrouni's offbeat delivery. In 
short, this is a band you've got to love. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times during their first set Friday at System M that Bazooka 
recalled rock bands in the vein of Jimi Hendrix's "Axis Bold as Love" period. 
More often, they brought to mind the slant of outside jazz ensembles, such as 
those of saxophonist Ornette Coleman, drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson, M-Base 
movement leader and saxophonist Steve Coleman or the 1970 edition of drummer 
Tony Williams groundbreaking Lifetime trio. But most often, Bazooka sounded 
like no one else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turkey Tenders" was typical of the material aired this night. A slightly 
sinister, minor-key theme based on an ascending line gave way to a passage of 
suspended rhythm through which Meghrouni groused his way across the drum set. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a punchy, five-note chorus played with snap and certainty. The tune 
then folded back into the opening theme, this time with Atherton's tenor 
battling Bill Crawford's electric bass for center stage. The cycle was repeated 
a couple of times with dynamic ebbs and flows before the band drove hard into a 
dramatic close. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tunes, including "Painful Therapeutic Process" and "Scrucifer" followed 
suit, with a series of caustic vamps and tooth-gnashing themes firing into 
point-blank, single-shot climaxes. This is not a band for those who want to 
hear music that leaves a warm glow. Rather, the conclusion of a Bazooka number 
leaves listeners wiping their brows and feeling slightly agitated. 
</P>
<P>
 As relevant as this approach may be, Bazooka still leaves something to be 
desired in its execution. Through breakneck passages and against sudden stops 
and turns, drummer Meghrouni often sounded like he was playing catch-up with 
his band mates, and the free-form melding of sax, bass and percussion often 
failed to fall together. Still, this rhythmic sloppiness contributes to the 
band's attraction, though there were times when one couldn't help but desire 
the kind of tightness and seamless performance that the bands of Coleman or 
Shannon Jackson bring to their hellbent electric sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Atherton's most cohesive moments came on alto as he squealed and squirmed 
through twisted tales of Angst and heartbreak. On tenor, his delivery was less 
narrative, his power-packed improvisations carrying less depth though just as 
much sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The only respite from the head-banging rhythms came during a bass sax 
interlude while Meghrouni repaired some trouble with his snare drum. And when 
the band came back with "Painful Therapeutic Process," introduced by Crawford's 
wah-wah colored bass lines, they were as tight as any time during the set.

 On Steady Ground: Steven Seagal's "On Deadly Ground" held its ground in the 
No. 1 spot at the nation's box office during a generally slow weekend. The 
action film from Warner Bros., which was also in first place for its premiere 
weekend a week earlier, took in $6.5 million, according to early industry 
estimates. Warner Bros.' "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," starring Jim Carrey, was 
close behind with $6.4 million. Wesley Snipes' new urban drama from 20th 
Century Fox, "Sugar Hill," took third with $5.8 million. Paramount's "Blue 
Chips" and Disney's "Blank Check" were battling it out for fourth and fifth 
with $4 million each. A box-office note: "Midnight Cowboy" was still a big draw 
after 25 years. The anniversary re-release of the movie starring Jon Voight and 
Dustin Hoffman did swift business over the weekend, despite competition from 
the Winter Olympics on CBS, taking in $35,000 in just two theaters, the Mann's 
Bruin in Westwood and one in New York City.

 Voila, the Cesars: The French film world chose "Smoking/No Smoking," a 
Franco-British comedy, as best film at its annual Cesar awards in Paris on 
Saturday. The French cinema academy also named the movie's director, Alain 
Resnais, as best director and star Pierre Arditi as best actor. In the film 
written by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn, each actor plays six different 
roles. Juliette Binoche of France won best actress for her performance in 
"Blue," from Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski. And best foreign film went 
to Jane Campion's "The Piano." TELEVISION

 Ratings Roundup: Mired in third place in recent months, "The CBS Evening 
News," boosted by its Winter Olympic coverage, tied ABC's "World News Tonight" 
for the week of Feb. 21-25, according to figures released Saturday by the A. C. 
Nielsen Co. Both shows averaged an 11.7 rating. "NBC Nightly News" had an 8.2. 
"The CBS Evening News" has not been in first place since the week of Aug. 24, 
1992. . . . CBS' coverage of Wednesday's Winter Olympics, which included Nancy 
Kerrigan and Tonya Harding in the women's figure skating technical program 
competition, now ranks as the fourth most-watched program of any sponsored 
program in U.S. television history. Updated figures revealed that more than 126 
million people were tuned-in. That places it behind three Super Bowls -- 
XXVIII, XXVII and XX. Original figures had placed it as the eighth most-watched 
program.

about a mixed-up family composed of reunited identical-twin girls and their 
single parents, previews at 8:30 p.m. April 1, followed by a second episode 
that same evening in the series' regular 9:30 p.m. Friday time slot. The series

 NBC Says Sorry: Comedian Martin Lawrence yukked it up about the Bobbitts, oral 
sex and feminine hygiene. NBC didn't even crack a smile. The network apologized 
for Lawrence's raunchy humor on the Feb. 19 "Saturday Night Live" show, which 
prompted at least 177 viewer complaints. "We can announce that last week's 
program will not be repeated on the NBC network even in an edited form," NBC 
executive Don Ohlmeyer said in a fax sent to station affiliates. Lawrence's 
jokes were not in his script. NBC edited the offending material from its

and Phil Hartman on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in a strange twist of fate, NBC is 
hoping that Kinnear's debut at 1:35 a.m. will get a special boost from its lead 
in, "Late Night With Conan O'Brien," because the guest on that show tonight

MUSIC REVIEW; AN UPBEAT CHAMBER OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony opened its second season of chamber music concerts at the 
Bowers Museum of Cultural Art on Friday. And the results were largely happy. (A 
repeat performance was scheduled for Sunday afternoon). 
</P>
<P>
 One work -- Hindemith's 1939 Sonata for Clarinet -- was played in the narrow, 
bright, airy and vaulted downstairs Freedman Gallery, in which a series of 
helpful acoustical baffling panels hung in a line down the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The 85 attendees at the sold-out performance heard the remaining three works 
in the upstairs California Room, notable for its heavily paneled wooden ceiling 
decorated with WPA-type murals in pastel colors and for its glass-encased wall 
exhibits of World War I and other historical memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians included clarinetist James Kanter, violinist Sheryl Staples, 
cellist Timothy Landauer, and pianists John Novacek and Bright Sheng. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter and Landauer are principals in the orchestra. Staples, known for her 
work as concertmaster of the Japan America Symphony, has been one of the guest 
concertmasters with the full orchestra this season as it seeks to fill the 
position left vacant last summer by Endre Granat. 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek, who studied with the late Jakob Gimpel, is a local young luminary and 
competition winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheng played only in his own Four Movements for Piano Trio, an ingratiating 
series of short impressionistic scenes incorporating original or parodistic 
Chinese folk tunes and traditional instrumental techniques, all capped by a 
sparsely textured lament. 
</P>
<P>
 Staples distinguished herself with the seeming ease and mellowness she brought 
to her formidable duties in Stravinsky's own 1919 arrangement of five movements 
from his "L'Histoire du Soldat", for violin, clarinet and piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter proved again he is incapable of anything less than masterly playing, 
whether in exploiting the various ranges of the instrument for Stravinsky or 
the dynamic and melodic challenges in the appealing Hindemith Sonata, despite a 
glitch with a reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, what should have been the emotional peak of the program, 
Mendelssohn's Piano Trio No. 1, turned out to be an oil-and-water affair. 
Novacek's brilliant but cold pianism suited neither the music nor Staples' and, 
especially, Landauer's expressivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The next and final pair of programs in the short chamber series at the Bowers 
will take place on May 13 and 15.

WEEKEND REVIEWS / DANCE; JENKINS CO. BREACHES 'THE GATES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although created in 1993, Margaret Jenkins' imposing, plotless dance-spectacle 
"The Gates" embodies all the features of deluxe Reagan/Bush-era collaborations 
-- including the mission of court art to be primarily a display of 
magnificence. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced locally on Saturday in Thorne Hall, Occidental College, this 
monument to Jenkins' 20th anniversary season in the Bay Area offered secure, 
dedicated dancing by the seven members of her company, an inspired score by 
Paul Dresher, a striking panoramic set by Alexander V. Nichols, plus 
atmospheric texts by poets Michael Palmer and Rinde Eckert. 
</P>
<P>
 With "choreographic direction" credited to Jenkins and dancer Ellie Klopp, 
"The Gates" spent nearly 90 minutes investigating what one might call the 
outsider sensibility. Most of the texts involved responses to exotic locales, 
but even when a place proved familiar to the writers, their descriptions 
highlighted alienating sights or experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 This estrangement from events and other people prompted Palmer and Eckert to 
focus on self-inspection -- a process physicalized in the central choreographic 
image of the work. Spotlighted in the opening ensemble and later reiterated, it 
showed a woman ignoring the tumult around her to intently touch her own groin, 
waist, chest, neck and head. Over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the spectacle of people obsessively analyzing their own reactions 
proved only one component of "The Gates." Elsewhere, one could admire the 
surging group movement that almost always terminated in heroic sculptural 
friezes. In these ensembles, Jenkins emphasized shared energies and rhythms but 
left the patterning free and open. This approach again physicalized a key 
concept: showing the qualities of community that might create an ideal city. 
</P>
<P>
 Punctuated with pyramid pylons, Nichols' airy, three-sided set represented a 
never-never land free from congestion, pollution or mean streets. Scarcely "the 
state of things." Ancient Ankor Thom or contemporary Udiapur might come close 
to this seductive illusion. Even there, however, Jenkins and her poets might 
not find enough ivory towers -- since room for artists to publicly display 
their sensitivity seemed to count as much as physical splendor in their 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care for citizens of the ideal city? Gun control? Racial harmony? 
Somehow, Jenkins bypassed those gates, only distantly touching on the reasons 
cities become uninhabitable, en route to more comfortable perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Splendidly crafted and executed, "The Gates" boasted genuine urgency only when 
it abandoned navel-gazing and fantasy sociology to embrace the imperatives in 
Dresher's passionate music: a survey of contemporary styles realized with 
spectacular flair. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recorded performance by his ensemble, Dresher took the listener through 
the gates of rock 'n' roll, of minimalism, of chamber music virtuosity, of 
tonal washes, of manipulated sound effects and more until he made this whole, 
strangely remote project sound like a celebration of artistic diversity in the 
here and now. Who needs Angkor Thom with such vistas as these?

WEEKEND REVIEWS / JAZZ; HARP SOARS, BUT BAND DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the opening magic in Everette Harp's appearance at the Baked Potato 
Pasadena on Friday was dispensed by sleight-of-hand master Kevin Pinnell, who 
worked the room during the Harp band's delay in getting started. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harp and his five-piece group finally took the stand, it was the leader 
-- generally playing alto and soprano saxophones, with an occasional foray on 
an electronic wind instrument -- who provided the wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp plays in a familiar '90s jazz genre, alternating fast, blues-drenched 
runs with soaring flights into high harmonics. But on pieces such as "You Made 
It Better" and "Let's Wait a While," Harp revealed an ability to reach beyond 
the sometimes tired musical platitudes of the contemporary style into a more 
demanding kind of improvisation.  
</P>
<P>
 The most pervasive question that was raised by Harp's performance was why such 
a gifted young artist chooses to limit his creative options by using an 
accompaniment dominated by predictable, rhythm-machine-like routines and 
mindless back beats. DON HECKMAN

WEEKEND REVIEWS / JAZZ; QUARTET SHINES AS ENSEMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jokingly calling themselves "the bad boys of ethnocentric alternative 
improvisational chamber music," the members of the Turtle Island String Quartet 
dug into a wealth of music on Friday at Marsee Auditorium of El Camino College, 
playing the music of Thelonious Monk, Jimi Hendrix and others with brio. 
</P>
<P>
 Darol Anger and Tracy Silverman (violins), Danny Seidenberg (viola) and Mark 
Summer (cello) scored with the ensemble passages, which were as thick, plush 
and colorful as a handmade Oriental carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 On McCoy Tyner's "Blues on the Corner," the group captured the pianist's 
shimmering densities. Hendrix's "Gypsy Eyes" and "Fire" found the quartet 
managing to mimic both the guitarist's trademark melodic-statement whine, and 
the thack-a-whack punch of his rhythm guitar work. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians were less successful as jazz soloists, though Anger and Summer 
showed that their ability to develop a groove is growing. "Tonight Show" band 
member Vicki Randle added a guest vocal on "You've Changed," delivering some 
perky wordless passages but getting overly emotional during the lyric reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the playful band crossed over into the world of cute, as in the 
employment of a mule-walk passage from "On the Trail" as part of Monk's "Ruby, 
My Dear." Such silliness undercut the power of an otherwise first-rate affair.

MUSIC REVIEWS; FLUTIST RAMPAL SATISFIES FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucky man, Jean-Pierre Rampal, to have retained the loyalty of an audience 
that first noticed him over three decades ago and to have that audience pass on 
its appreciation of his artistry to a subsequent generation. 
</P>
<P>
 This thought seemed particularly pertinent when observing the parents who 
brought children, including a surprising number of attentive preteens, to 
Ambassador Auditorium on Saturday for a daunting program by the revered French 
flutist and his trusty colleague, harpsichordist John Steele Ritter: seven 
sonatas by J. S. and C.P.E. Bach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to belabor the obvious, a 72-year-old (the robust-looking Rampal reached 
that age a few weeks ago) is not a 40-year-old. There was some effortful 
playing on this occasion, exemplified chiefly in smudged -- but never faked -- 
passages in the more convoluted allegros. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rampal tone, particularly in slow movements, is as appealing as ever: 
firm, rounded, richly varied within the natural scope of the instrument's 
capabilities which, in fact, Rampal has redefined and expanded for modern 
audiences and for other flutists. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, this old master showed that he is not content to repeat hoary 
interpretive formulas. His ornamentation, in repeats and elsewhere, exhibited 
lively imagination and a familiarity with Baroque practice rare among senior 
virtuosi.

<P>
 Still, one might have wished for the presence of a continuo cello in certain 
works to add timbral variety and, possibly, to elicit some rhythmic daring from 
the accomplished but somewhat rigid Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's not get picky. This was an evening for Rampal initiates and their 
progeny, and they were clearly satisfied. HERBERT GLASS

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; OSCAR D'LEON SURPASSES BOUNDS OF SALSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar D'Leon is regarded as one of salsa's most exciting performers and 
singers, but the term salsero is too limiting for the veteran from Venezuela. 
His fast-paced show on Friday before a full house at the Mayan dance club 
proved again that he's an all-around tropical musician, capable of excelling in 
all areas of Latin dance music. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Leon, 51, refused to stick with the safe old salsa-only formula, mixing 
things up with both his own songs and all-time classics and an unpredictable 
selection of cumbia , merengue , cha-cha-cha and even Mexican rancheras . 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by his unusual 13-piece orchestra -- one of the few salsa ensembles to 
still include acoustic bass and Venezuelan percussion -- D'Leon shared the 
microphone with his son Yorman and his two other singers, managing to remain in 
charge either with his masterful trademark soneos (vocal improvisations), his 
occasional bass playing or his dancing. He didn't even slow down while signing 
autographs onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Leon, whose career began in 1973, seems to be at his peak, even though his 
musical talent is often overshadowed by the tremendous energy of his live 
performances. He returns on Saturday for a double-header with Puerto Rican 
singer Tito Nieves at the Westin Bonaventure's California Ballroom. ENRIQUE

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MOZART NOT UP TO ITS NAME

<P>
 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would be turning over in his grave if he had witnessed 
Friday's Palace show by the band that purloined his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A.-based operatic rock band Mozart scored a big-bucks record deal in 
1991 and was being touted as the next Queen.By 1992 they were out on the 
streets, still forging ahead with their brand of ultra-theatrical rock mixed 
with old standards, sampling and extravagant productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Friday's concept concert was titled "Requiem for a Heavyweight," the 
only manifestation of that theme was a boxing exhibition a good half-hour 
before the performance, in a ring set up on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the songs were non-originals, from Elton John to campy '30s 
cabaret to the Guess Who's "No Sugar Tonight." Singer Adam is charismatic and 
has a powerful, trained voice, but when he primped in front of the onstage 
mirror, tinkled the ivories on the white grand piano and posed on the tiered 
drum riser, his self-consciousness was almost a parody. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 The makers of this bombastic pomp are talented musicians, but Mozart's 
humorless extravaganzas are probably better suited to the stages of Las Vegas 
than the rock venues of Los Angeles. KATHERINE TURMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BAY AREA'S GREEN DAY WILTS AT PALACE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Green Day is a fairly new arrival, you got the feeling on Saturday at 
the Palace that you'd seen it a hundred times before. The San Francisco trio, 
whose major-label debut has caused a buzz among KROQ listeners, slammed out 
speedy, initially inviting tunes, but eventually came off as an ode to pop-punk 
pioneers the Buzzcocks and the Jam.The bouncy tunes lacked a spontaneous or 
gruff edge and seemed to dissipate before they could make any lasting 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, accustomed to playing in the constricted spaces of San Francisco's 
tiny clubs, clustered in a tight triangle on the big stage while the mostly 
teen-age audience moshed and even pogoed to the sound. Between songs, the 
musicians cracked jokes and poured beer on their heads, and singer Billie Joe 
asked the quintessentially snide punk-rock question, "Are there any hippies in 
the audience?" Pretty gratuitous, considering that A) half the fans at the 
Palace had long hair, and B) the band looked straight out of 1979 with their 
short, spiky hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Day went on to do a medley mocking music from the past, from spacey 
Grateful Dead-like jams to cheesy '80s metal. Before they make fun of dated 
genres, they should realize that they've built a career on one. LORRAINE ALI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MURRAY TAKES A WALK ON THE SWEET SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an interview years ago, Frank Sinatra dubbed them "the sweet singers" -- 
women, like Karen Carpenter, Doris Day and Olivia Newton-John, with sweet 
voices who sing romantic pop songs with sweet melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last decade or so, the queen of the sweet singers has been Anne 
Murray, who appeared in the round at the Cerritos Center for the Performing 
Arts on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who's been recording since the late '60s, has a stockpile of pop and 
country songs boasting sweet melodies -- among them "Snowbird," "You Needed Me" 
and "Broken Hearted Me." With her slightly brawny, incredibly sweet-toned 
voice, Murray slices away any hard edges or dark undercurrents lurking in her 
ballads. What's left is invariably wholesome and uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who was accompanied by seven musicians and a backup singer, is 
strictly a ballad singer -- and she knows it. She wisely steered clear of any 
gritty songs and rarely resorted to up-tempo tunes. She sang songs from her 
latest album of oldies, "Croonin' " without putting a new spin on any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's show, the first of three nights at Cerritos, was vulnerable to 
charges that it offered little variety and was neither creative nor 
challenging. Though guilty on all counts, it was still rather entertaining. 
Chalk it up to the infectious whimsy of her droll humor and the relentless 
charm of some of those sweet-as-honey songs. DENNIS HUNT

WILKINS DOESN'T DISAPPOINT, BUT SEATTLE DOESN'T PLAY ALONG; CLIPPERS: HE SCORES 
34 POINTS AND MAKES SPECTACULAR SHOTS IN DEBUT, BUT SUPERSONICS RALLY, 122-118. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dominique Wilkins, nicknamed the Human Highlight Film, provided plenty of 
highlights in his Clipper debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, acquired from the Atlanta Hawks Thursday for All-Star forward Danny 
Manning, scored 34 points, making 11 of 21 shots on a variety of acrobatic 
shots and dunks Sunday night against the Seattle SuperSonics at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Wilkins era opened much as the Manning era ended, as the Clippers 
missed nine of their last 11 shots and lost for the sixth time in seven games, 
122-118. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had played his entire 11 1/2-year NBA career in Atlanta, didn't 
take long to adjust, scoring 21 first-half points as the Clippers took a 71-66 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange," Wilkins said. "I'd had a Hawks' uniform for 11 1/2 years, 
but once I hit the floor all that stuff left me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to move on, you can't worry about the past. In a lot of ways, I 
think this is a very positive move for me in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, 34, whose departure was met with disapproval from Hawk fans and even 
inspired a cartoon on the editorial page of an Atlanta newspaper, got a warm 
welcome to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced last, Wilkins received a standing ovation from the crowd of 15,080, 
the Clipper' second largest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Injured New York Knick guard Doc Rivers, who played with Wilkins at Atlanta 
before he was traded to the Clippers, thinks the trade will motivate Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hungry. It's good to see him play like this," said Rivers, who watched 
the game from a courtside seat next to Clipper owner Donald Sterling and 
Wilkins' agent, Steve Kauffman. "For the first time in a long time he thinks he 
has to prove something again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really doesn't, but he probably feels that way. He's going to do it. He 
wants to prove the fans that he worth the trade and I think he's proven that 
already. L.A.'s a fickle town, it doesn't take long for them to fall in love 
with you. They'll love Dominique because they love flashy scorers, and that's 
what he is." 
</P>
<P>
 And he supplied plenty of flash as he made his first three shots and scored 11 
points in the first 10 minutes. Wilkins, who brought the crowd to its feet with 
a reverse scoop layup in the first quarter, also displayed a nice passing 
touch. He set up teammate John Williams for a layup with a beautiful pass 
through traffic, but the pass seemed to surprise Williams, who fumbled away the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he makes this team better," Clipper guard Mark Jackson said of 
Wilkins. "He's a Hall of Famer and he just makes everybody better." 
</P>
<P>
 But Seattle All-Star forward Shawn Kemp didn't let Wilkins steal the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, who had 27 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots, 
made a blindside block of an attempted dunk by Wilkins in the first half and 
then dunked at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone by Wilkins and Kemp, Clipper guard Ron Harper made his first 
eight shots, including five three-pointers, and scored 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who was suspended for a game last week for making negative comments 
about the team, even said something to Sterling and Rivers as he ran back to 
play defense after making a three-pointer in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who has declined public comment since his suspension, had nothing to 
say after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 113-109, with 4:57 remaining, the Clippers missed six shots in a row, 
including three layups, and were outscored, 9-0, as Seattle made four shots in 
a row and took a 118-113 lead with 2:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers cut it to 118-115 when Jackson made a hook shot with two minutes 
left, but Kendall Gill, who had 23 points, answered with a 19-foot jumper for 
120-115. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilkins, who had missed three shots in a row, made a layup and a free 
throw with 22.2 seconds left for 120-118, Kemp made two of four free throws in 
the final 18 seconds as Seattle (39-14) beat the Clippers (18-35) for the 
second time in three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the end result was the same, the arrival of Wilkins seemed to 
energize the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a different Clipper team than I've seen in a long time," Wilkins said. 
"Guys were complimenting each other out there and excited. It was a game we 
should have won, but if we play this way against all the other teams down the 
stretch, we're going to beat a lot of them. I see a lot of potential."

SEVENTH HEAVEN IS GOLDEN FOR SWEDEN; HOCKEY: FORSBERG'S GOAL BRINGS A 3-2 
VICTORY AFTER AN OVERTIME AND SIX SHOOTOUT ROUNDS AGAINST CANADA END IN A TIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Kariya skated around in tight circles, knowing he alone would determine 
whether Canada would win the Olympic gold medal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three periods of hockey before 9,245 at Haakon Hall had left Canada and Sweden 
tied at 2, and a 10-minute sudden-death overtime had failed to separate them. 
They were still tied after the first best-of-five shootout round and remained 
even after the sixth, when two of hockey's most promising young players took 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Peter Forsberg -- the seventh Swedish shooter -- stunned Canadian 
goaltender Corey Hirsch with a daring, pull-back shot that gave his team a 3-2 
lead. Kariya had to get the puck past Tommy Salo for the game to continue, and 
he had already beaten Salo in the first shootout round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I picked the top corner, and I felt the second time, if I came 
back (to the same spot), he wouldn't expect it," Kariya said. "I had it. I just 
didn't get the puck up." 
</P>
<P>
 Salo threw himself across the goal mouth, his legs scissor-kicking. When the 
puck bounced off his leg and out of the crease, Sweden had won its first hockey 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting in my room, just thinking about it, I always imagined playing Sweden 
for the gold medal," said Kariya, selected fourth by the Mighty Ducks in last 
June's NHL draft. "For some reason, it was always Sweden. I just wish it would 
have ended a different way." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams wished it had been decided in a different way. Neither liked the 
shootout, calling it a skill contest unrelated to a game like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair," Swedish defenseman Tomas Jonsson said. "They should have 
sudden death until someone wins. I guess they have to settle it somehow. I was 
really happy when Peter scored. If he didn't score, I was supposed to go out 
there, and I didn't want to go out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Naslund: "The shootout is too much a case of luck, but time was running 
out on the Olympics, so they had to end the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But the international career of Forsberg is only taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebounding from a flat performance in Sweden's first few games, he led his 
team past Germany and Russia and into the finals. His performance Sunday was 
better still. He initiated Sweden's first goal, a power-play slap shot by 
Jonsson at 6:10 of the first period, and the tying goal, by Magnus Svensson 
from the blue line with 1:49 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsberg was chosen sixth in the 1991 NHL draft by the Philadelphia Flyers, 
who traded his rights to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal. 
Although his play-making skills and speed made him a star at the 1993 World 
Junior Championships, he has been criticized for indifferent play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he can disappear," Jonsson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year, $6.9-million contract he signed with Quebec intensified the 
pressure he carried here, but he thrived under it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Nancy Kerrigan didn't win the gold, they should make a movie in 
Hollywood with him instead," Naslund suggested. "He was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 As the fourth player up in the first go-round of the shootout, Forsberg had 
beaten Hirsch with a close-in backhander to bring Sweden even at 2-2. Petr 
Nedved and Kariya converted their chances before Svensson lifted a shot over 
Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's Dwayne Norris and Naslund each missed, and then Salo stopped a shot 
by Canada's Greg Parks with his right pad. Forsberg succeeded, and Greg Johnson 
and Roger Hansson were each stopped to start another shootout round. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch forced Svensson wide to the left and stopped him, giving Nedved a 
chance to win the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hair was standing on end," Nedved said. "I went to deke and the puck just 
slid a little ahead of me and I couldn't stuff it right in." 
</P>
<P>
 That brought up Forsberg, who decided to try a move he had seen Kent Nilsson 
make for Sweden against the U.S. in the 1989 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a legend goal in Sweden," Forsberg said. "I saw it on TV, and I wanted 
to try it, but I didn't make it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goalie was standing on one side so much. I noticed that after the first 
penalty shot. So I thought about doing this. I came a little bit wrong in the 
beginning, but it was a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 He skated in almost too close to get off a shot before he cut to his left and 
shifted to his backhand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him all the way," Hirsch said. "He wasn't going to beat me. But he made 
a questionable move. He kind of tight-turned. I think you're supposed to keep 
moving forward with the puck, and I'm not sure he did. But it must have been 
legal, because they allowed it . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're such skilled, talented players, it's basically 50-50 when you get 
into that kind of situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Coach Tom Renney had no quarrel with the legality of Forsberg's shot, 
but he wished the game hadn't come to that. Renney's team began the tournament 
seeded fourth, but won the silver with a 5-2-1 record. Canada hasn't won a 
hockey gold medal since 1952, in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, being inches away from the gold medal constitutes a hell of an 
effort," he said. "I'm extremely disappointed. I think our team deserves a gold 
medal, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swedish defenseman Roger Johansson, who played for the Calgary Flames 
last season: "I feel sorry for the Canadian guys. There should be more overtime 
(instead of a shootout), but what can you do? Those are the rules. We won by 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, there will be another team that wins the gold medal for Sweden, 
but this is the first time ever, and this is very special. Right from the start 
this year, people were on us, giving us criticism. This must be great for the 
coaches. Only the strong survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest survived the shootout Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of our effort. We had a great tournament," Kariya said. "But this 
is a tough way to win or lose."

 Meet Tom Watson, diplomat.

 When the Ryder Cup captain met President Clinton, he offered to give him a 
lesson. Clinton didn't say if it was for golf or politics. The President told 
the story to Golf Digest: 
</P>
<P>
 "When they (the Ryder Cup team) came to the White House . . . Watson says to 
me, 'Hold this golf club, Mr. President. Now, look at your grip. If you move 
your grip too far to the left, it gets you in trouble on the right. If you move 
your grip too far to the right, it gets you in trouble on the left. The trick 
is to keep your grip balanced in the center.' "

 "We'd be called 'Micks' and 'fisheaters' (during games) and had to stand and

STADLER WINS ONE AT HOME; GOLF: SAN DIEGO NATIVE SHOOTS 66 AND HOLDS OFF LOWERY 
FOR HIS FIRST VICTORY AT TORREY PINES AS A PRO.

 Craig Stadler, playing Indiana Jones-style golf, did everything but tiptoe 
through rattlesnakes and dodge falling boulders en route to a final-round 66 
and a victory in the Buick Invitational Sunday at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Stadler's first victory in his hometown, excluding the 1971 Junior 
World Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played here for so long," he said, "that it's so nice, so special, to 
win here." 
</P>
<P>
 To win, he had to overcome the steady play of third-round leader Steve Lowery, 
an early challenge from Hal Sutton and a stretch run by Phil Mickelson. All 
four either led or shared the lead at some point during the final round, but 
Stadler took the lead for good with a birdie on the 15th and added another on 
the 17th to get to 20 under. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured this morning I needed to get to 19 under," Mickelson said. "It 
looks like that might not be good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler and Lowery, playing four groups behind him, were on the 15th hole when 
Mickelson birdied the 18th to finish an eight-under round of 64 and get to 
minus-18. The three were tied for the lead as long as it took Stadler to get to 
the green and sink a 20-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, who shot a 68, broke the tie for second with Mickelson when he birdied 
the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton, who birdied four of the first five holes to take a brief lead at 17 
under, lost his momentum and finished fourth at 16 under. 
</P>
<P>
 With challengers lurking, it seemed most of the day a matter of whether 
Stadler would win it or lose it. The birdies on 15 and 17 broke the tie and 
gave him the lead and the victory, but his three most important holes might 
have been what he called the "point" holes: 11, 12 and 13.  
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve especially," said Stadler, who had taken the lead with an eagle on the 
ninth hole from 20 feet. "I always have problems with that hole." 
</P>
<P>
 He parred all three Sunday. What was critical was how he parred them. 
</P>
<P>
 He was short on No. 11, a difficult par-three into the wind, and he needed a 
four-foot putt to salvage his par. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 is a nightmarish 468-yard par-four, uphill and into the wind. Stadler 
needed to make a six-foot putt after missing the green to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 His second shot on No. 13, normally an easy par-five, was yanked left into the 
rough down a hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "My worst shot in a decade," Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 He reached the green and two-putted for another adventurous par, keeping him 
in the lead at 19 under. 
</P>
<P>
 It was starting to look like a matter of whether he could survive himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned to hate that hole," Stadler mused. "For good reason." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1987 tournament, played during wet weather, Stadler hit a ball under a 
tree along the right side of the fairway. He took a towel out of his bag and 
knelt on it as he punched the ball out onto the fairway. He was later 
disqualified for an equipment violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost got it under that same tree today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His tee shot was to the right of the tree, in the rough. His approach flew 
wide left and he ended up with a bogey to slip back to 18 under. Mickelson, at 
about that time, was making his putt on the 18th to create a three-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kicked myself in the butt after No. 14," Stadler said, "and hit a nice 
drive on 15." 
</P>
<P>
 After the birdie on the 15th put him on top, he stayed out of trouble until 
the 18th. His tee shot found a fairway trap to the right, but he had a two-shot 
lead by then. It did not even make any difference when he missed a two-foot 
birdie putt. The tournament was his. 
</P>
<P>
 That last little putt would have been consequential if Lowery had been able to 
make a 35-foot eagle putt from the back of the 18th green. It was a prayer of a 
putt and it never really had a chance, but he had stayed alive until the end 
under the pressure of leading after the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just wouldn't go away," Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with the way I played," said Lowery, who has never won on the 
PGA Tour. "I didn't make a bogey all day and he had to play a real good round 
to beat me."

LAKERS RALLY TO BEAT THE SLUMPING CELTICS; PRO BASKETBALL: DIVAC SCORES A KEY 
LATE BASKET AS BOSTON'S LOSING STREAK REACHES 12 GAMES, 100-97. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Lakers and Boston Celtics, linked through glory days and now the gory 
days, stayed close to each other again Sunday night at the Forum, proving that 
misery loves company. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Coach Randy Pfund was so intent upon reminding his players of what once 
was that he showed a three-minute tape before the game of highlights from the 
storied rivalry during the '80s. Then he got one for the early '90s when Vlade 
Divac and Sedale Threatt led a fourth-quarter rally that produced a 100-97 
victory before 13,063 and sent the Celtics to their 12th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this rivalry is well-remembered from the days when we played the 
Celtics for the world championships," Pfund said. "But for me, the last three 
minutes, it didn't make a difference. It was a close game, they wanted to win 
and we wanted to win. . . . They were still in green and we were still in 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
 If this wasn't one for the ages, it was at least one for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, looking to build some momentum before starting a four-game trip 
that includes a stop in Boston, trailed, 95-90, with 2 1/2 minutes to go. 
Consecutive baskets by Elden Campbell, Divac and Threatt, the latter an 
off-balance 18-footer with two seconds left on the shot clock and 33 on the 
game clock, then gave them a 96-95 lead. Sherman Douglas, left wide open after 
a blown defensive assignment on a pick and roll, scored from the left side with 
23 seconds remaining to put the Celtics back on top. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers called a timeout. The clock was down to 6.2 seconds when Boston, 
with a foul to give, fouled Threatt. The Lakers called another time out, their 
last. James Worthy got the ball into Divac a few feet behind the top of the 
three-point line. Knowing that Divac had been scoring from the outside, Robert 
Parish came out to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief played the pressure on me and I had the opportunity to drive," Divac 
said. "It was in my mind to go to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 So he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the open paint," Divac said. "It was in my mind, 'C'mon, Vlade, go 
strong to the basket.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Divac started right and went right. When he got close to the basket, Ed 
Pinckney stepped up to block his path and even made contact. But Divac, 
twisting slightly, banked in the four-foot shot with 2.5 seconds left. He 
didn't get the foul, having to settle for what became the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics, who shot 56.2% but committed 24 turnovers that led to 27 Laker 
points, had two chances at the finish. The first ended when Threatt intercepted 
Rick Fox's entry pass from the sidelined intended for Dee Brown underneath, was 
fouled immediately and made both free throws with 1.2 seconds to go for a 
100-97 lead. The second, when they needed a three-point play to send the game 
into overtime, was turned back when George Lynch knocked away another pass 
intended for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good win," Pfund said. "It was one we really wanted to get before 
going out on the road trip. There have been different times during the year 
when we've got to step up and make big plays. We've done it before, and we did 
it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially Divac, who had a season-high 28 points along with 13 rebounds, and 
Threatt, who played 44 minutes and had 26 points. Threatt is averaging 23 
points and shooting 56.9% while starting the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schayes, acquired Thursday from Milwaukee for a conditional second-round 
draft choice, was in uniform, but did not play. "It was so out of the blue," he 
said of the trade. "My first reaction was to try and figure what the angle was. 
The Lakers had not shown interest in me in the past, and I knew they were 
rebuilding like we were in Milwaukee. That was the initial question -- the why. 
Aside from that, I was excited." Schayes, who will wear No. 26, said the Lakers 
told him that the trade was made primarily for salary-cap purposes. Without the 
deal, the $1.75-million slot that once belonged to A.C. Green would have 
expired June 30. Now it goes to June 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the talk of the Lakers being a young team, they also have a wealth of 
experience. A contradiction? Not really; the majority of the minutes goes 
toward youth. Consider that Sam Bowie is in his ninth season, Sedale Threatt in 
his 11th, James Worthy in his 12th, Kurt Rambis and Schayes in their 13th and 
James Edwards in his 17th.

GRAF MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY; TENNIS: AMANDA COETZER IS NO FACTOR FROM BASELINE 
IN 6-0, 6-4 FINAL. 
</P>

 Steffi Graf wrapped up career title No. 82 by winning the Evert Cup on Sunday, 
packed up the Golden Retriever puppy she bought last week at a local shopping 
mall and headed to Delray Beach, Fla., where she is expected to dominate yet 
another tournament field. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it becoming boring? 
</P>
<P>
 "To you?" Graf asked a reporter. "I'm not bored." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who has not dropped a set in 17 matches this year, earned another 
$80,000 by defeating Amanda Coetzer, 6-0, 6-4, in 57 minutes in the final at 
Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really have too much difficulty this week," said Graf, who spent 
more than an hour on the court in only one of five matches, needing 79 minutes 
to eliminate Ginger Helgeson in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf spent most of her time pampering her puppy, which she named Joshua in a 
nod to the trees that dot the Mojave Desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, sometimes you want to be in a tighter situation or have to work a 
little bit harder, but if that's not the case, you've just got to concentrate 
and continue your match," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
 She does that better than anybody else in women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 In three finals this year, the WTA Tour's top-ranked player has yet to spend 
more than an hour on the court, routing second-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 
in 57 minutes at the Australian Open and defeating fourth-ranked Martina 
Navratilova in 60 minutes at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last three tournaments, I haven't really been close to feeling I'm not 
playing well," Graf said. "I've been very confident, I've been playing so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been three tournaments without having problems with my matches. I think 
that's a pretty good accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-seeded Coetzer upset second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez, the defending 
champion, in the quarterfinals and third-seeded Lindsay Davenport in the 
semifinals to advance to the final for the second year in a row, but neither of 
those players prepared her for Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 The South African all but acknowledged as much afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her strategy against Graf, Coetzer said, was to "just be patient and 
not be intimidated by the way she plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I was really thinking of beating her. I was more focused on 
every point and just trying to stay with her, at least for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 As a baseliner, Coetzer realized she was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "To beat her from the baseline, you really have to hope for a bit of an 
off-day (by Graf)," she said. "You're not going to beat her often from the 
baseline. I really think you have to be able to come to the net and attack the 
backhand, which is not really one of my strong points." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to change her style, Coetzer took her lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody tries to do what they're used to and what they're best at," Graf 
said. "It's difficult for some players to change. For example, Amanda, she's 
not someone who's going to hit the balls away (for winners) or can come in (to 
the net). She's not that type of player. Unless you're somebody who's used to 
doing the right thing against me, it's difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf closed out the first set by winning the last 14 points and led in the 
second, 5-2, before faltering slightly. Coetzer's service break in the ninth 
game of the second set was only the second of the week against Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't finish (the match) very well," said Graf, ever the perfectionist. 
"But when it mattered, I played well again." 
</P>
<P>
 The German has won 65 of her last 67 matches and 11 of her last 12 
tournaments, including all four Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning $2,821,337 last year, she already has won $544,063 this year. 
Only Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Evonne Goolagong Cawley have won more 
tournaments, but Graf is only 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy about the way my life is going for quite some time," Graf said. 
"The last thing I was missing was being injury-free and I've got that this 
year. So, I'm lucky and happy." 
</P>
<P>
 And not at all bored.

SAMPRAS, COURIER HEAD ELITE FIELD AT INDIAN WELLS MEN'S TOURNAMENT

<P>
 Top-ranked Pete Sampras and defending champion Jim Courier lead a strong field 
in the Newsweek Champions Cup, which runs today through Sunday at Hyatt Grand 
Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the top 10 and 14 of the top 18 players in the world are entered. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first of nine Championship Series events on the ATP Tour, the Newsweek 
Champions Cup is guaranteed a top field each year, but Brad Gilbert, at 32, the 
oldest player in this year's field, said the tournament has long been a popular 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great event," Gilbert said. "It's a nice time of year, especially 
if you've been playing indoors and been in cold weather. It's such a festive 
atmosphere: in the day, full crowds. And enthusiastic people. You can't ask for 
much more from a tennis tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sampras, who has won the last three Grand Slam events, the 
field includes Sergi Bruguera of Spain, who defeated Courier in last year's 
French Open final; and up-and-coming Todd Martin of Lansing, Mich., who lost to 
Sampras last month in the Australian Open final.  
</P>
<P>
 "Todd Martin's coming real hard," Gilbert said. "He's playing excellent 
tennis. He can make results on clay, hardcourt, grass, indoors. If you can make 
results on all four surfaces, your future is looking great. I suspect by the 
end of the year, he'll be in the top four in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, though, Martin is only fourth among the Americans in a stellar 
field -- behind Sampras, Courier and Michael Chang. JERRY CROWE

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; ALBERTO TIES UP SOME LOOSE ENDS WITH A SILVER 
THREAD; ALPINE SKIING: TOMBA GOES OUT IN STYLE WITH SUPER SECOND RUN IN SLALOM. 
HE LOSES GOLD MEDAL TO AUSTRIA'S STANGASSINGER BY 0.75 SECONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What Alberto Tomba may lack in grace he certainly makes up for in race, with a 
flair for the dramatic that borders on unworldly, even if it is sometimes a 
byproduct of his own miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba's magnetism on a ski slope is such that the lasting image of Sunday's 
slalom at Hafjell will not be of the stoic, calculating Austrian, Thomas 
Stangassinger, in victory, but rather a seat-of-the-pants Italian from Bologna, 
in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The record will show that Stangassinger took the gold with a two-run time of 2 
minutes 2.02 seconds, that Tomba won the silver, 0.75 seconds behind, and that 
Slovenia's Jure Kosir claimed the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 It will proclaim that Tomba, competing in his last Olympic race, was knocked 
to the slalom canvas with the 12th-fastest first run (1:02.84), and had 
Stangassinger on the ropes at the final bell after a second run of 59.33 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba made up 1.69 seconds on the Austrian with a hair-raising second run that 
was almost a classic rerun of his Olympic slalom charge two years earlier at 
Albertville, where he made up 1.30 seconds on Norway's Finn Christian Jagge, 
only to fall 0.28 short of the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Casey Puckett, an unsung American who finished seventh, a stunning result 
for him, won't forget to record Sunday in his race diary, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say he was the most incredible skier who ever was," Puckett said. 
</P>
<P>
 This, for the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was a reflection of personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stangassinger did not miss a trick. He put a gold-medal plan into motion and 
carried it through. He arrived in Lillehammer only four days before the race so 
that he could relax and train on softer snow at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Once here, Stangassinger took meticulous notes, charted the course, checked 
weather reports -- really did his race homework. While his peers fought for the 
lowest starting number possible, Stangassinger selected bib No. 8, deducing 
from earlier results that he who started first did not necessarily finish 
first. Stangassinger had the course pegged, and had a first run of 101.00, 0.80 
faster than his nearest challenger's. The bulk of his work done, he dared 
anyone to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, on the other hand, did not miss a party. He came to Lillehammer on Feb. 
18, promptly moved out of the Olympic village into a private cottage, continued 
his pursuit of figure skater Katerina Witt and complained about the cold. He 
said he wore out his legs training on the hard Norwegian snow. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top-ranked slalom skier, Tomba chose bib No. 1 because it was the 
number he had worn when he won his first gold medal at the 1988 Calgary Games. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba made his adjustment mid-race, after bombing out on the first run of a 
killer course on which only 22 of the 57 racers finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba is so good he's often compared to himself. But at 27, he admits he is no 
longer the skier who so easily swept the slalom and GS at Calgary in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tomba from Calgary would have for sure had a better first run," Tomba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's course actually was two courses: the snow marble-hard on top and soft 
and "grabby" on the bottom. Skiers who sharpened their edges to make sure turns 
on the ice lost time on the lower section. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, skiing on fumes, changed to new skis between runs and dulled his edges 
with sandpaper. "In the Olympics, you have no choice," he said. "You just have 
to take all the risks you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing fourth in the afternoon, Tomba guessed that if he could survive the 
top, he could make up time near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Going for broke, he survived a near fall at the second gate and fled the scene 
on his way to the fastest second-run time. Still, Tomba figured his great run 
could not save the day. He was only renting first place. 
</P>
<P>
 He waved his hands in disgust and told his entourage, in Italian, "Let's go 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 No one left, though. The next seven racers could not better Tomba's time. With 
each failure, he inched closer to a medal, and the Tomba freaks waved their 
Italian flags with more conviction and incrementally increased the decibel 
levels in their chants of "Tomba! Tomba! Tomba!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba was still first with the fastest four yet to ski. He would need two 
breaks to win bronze, three to win silver, four to win gold. 
</P>
<P>
 He got three. He called this occurrence, "Magic Alberto." 
</P>
<P>
 Some others might call it a hex. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Sykora of Austria crashed. One down. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Peter Roth skied off course. Two down. Tomba had the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing between Tomba and silver was Kjetil Andre Aamodt, 22, of Norway, who 
had already won more Olympic medals -- five -- than any other male skier in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt was staring at medal No. 6 when he shot out of the start, dived into 
the treacherous cut around Gate 2 and felt the skis slide out from under him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba couldn't believe his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tomba sharks suddenly smelled gold, but Stangassinger, the 28-year-old 
tactician, had a solid plan. Knowing he had time to give, he carefully carved 
his way through the danger zone and made a safe, sure run to the finish. His 
second-run time was 1:01.02. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomba made a perfect second run," Stangassinger said. "And I had a perfect 
first run. It was very close in the finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, who had announced this was his last Olympics, paraded around the finish 
corral like a boy on the last day of school. Several Norwegian hostesses, 
dressed in traditional costumes, lifted Tomba onto their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in an aqua-blue Italian warm-up suit, he made the rounds to his 
various cheering sections. After shaking one Italian flag off its pole, he 
pitched the shaft like a javelin aimlessly into the stands. Tomba again, 
throwing caution to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fifth medal of his career -- three gold, two silver -- Tomba tied 
Aamodt and Switzerland's Vreni Schneider for most Alpine medals in Olympic 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba loves to act the clown, flirt with women. He sometimes gets into the 
darndest predicaments. Yet, Sunday, Tomba danced like a man who had been 
relieved of a great burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he said. "There was a lot of pressure on me. Everyone wanted me 
to do well, and I wanted to do well. I didn't sleep at all last night." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, it was Italy's turn.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; SHIMER IS TOO HOT, WILL ISN'T; BOBSLED: ONE 
U.S. TEAM IS DISQUALIFIED, THE OTHER FINISHES 15TH. GERMANY II WINS THE GOLD. 
</P>

<P>
 The Winter Olympics ended prematurely for Brian Shimer when his cold-weather 
runners came up too hot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer was disqualified before the start of the third heat of four-man bobsled 
when three of the four runners -- the steel blades on which the sled rides -- 
failed to meet the required temperature standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in shock," said Shimer, who isn't responsible for the sled's final 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I'm not sure I know what happened. I went to the line (as the third 
starter in the third heat) and the sled wasn't there. It's the first time in my 
nine years I've been disqualified over a runners problem." 
</P>
<P>
 If the disqualification of the three-time Olympian seemed to be the ultimate 
embarrassment for the U.S. Skeleton and Bobsled Federation, traditionally beset 
by controversy and confusion, there was more on the final day of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Will, driving his own Italian-made sled as USA I, finished behind the 
Jamaicans of "Cool Runnings" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Will was 15th in his final race and would not talk about it. The Jamaicans, 
having improved vastly since their much-spoofed debut in the 1988 Olympics, 
were 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 Harald Czudaj, driving Germany II, won the gold, upsetting two-man winner 
Gustav Weder in Switzerland I by 0.06 seconds, and countryman Wolfgang Hoppe, 
in Germany I, by 0.23. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sport decided by milliseconds, Shimer, 11th after the first two heats, 
was eliminated by degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hot runner reduces friction and makes the sled go faster," said Matt Roy, 
executive director of the U.S. bobsled federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why everyone tries to come as close to the limit as possible. We 
definitely took some risks and pressed the limit. Our engineers felt we were 
within (the allowable) range, but it's the staff's responsibility to make sure. 
Shimer is preparing to compete. It's not his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was his hot-runner disqualification an Olympic first. 
</P>
<P>
 It has happened in both bobsled and luge. It has happened in World Cups and 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception has long been that the sledders, when heating their runners, 
stretch the limits whenever and wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of cheating," said David Kurtz, assistant U.S coach and 
team leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone heats runners overnight in electric blankets, but they have to be on 
the sled 30 minutes before the race and can't be touched again." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to discourage cheating, the international federation hangs a 
test runner near the start house. Runners on the competing sleds cannot be more 
than four degrees warmer than the test runner as the sled comes up to the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The test runner was a minus-9.5 degrees, according to U.S. coach Joey Kilburn, 
and the U.S. sled was disqualified for being 0.3, 0.7 and 0.9 over the 
minus-5.5 at which the runners could have come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys went ballistic, and I don't blame them," Kilburn said. "We did 
everything by the book. I mean, our gauge showed we were within the limits, and 
we borrowed the Swiss gauge and it showed we were within the limits. We're 
still trying to figure out why there was a discrepancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kurtz: "This happened before the second heat yesterday with one of the 
Shimer runners, but we asked the jury to check (the temperature of) the test 
runner again, and it had changed enough to put Shimer's runner within range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were right on the limit today, but our gauge and the Swiss gauge 
were running consistent, and they're the same gauges the jury uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, they're the same brand but they had different temperatures, and this 
time we didn't get a chance to ask for a recheck of the test runner. They 
pulled the sled so quickly we had no recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurtz shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bitter slice of medicine to digest," he said. "I think our athletes 
are of such high caliber that they'll regroup and refocus and bounce back, but 
for those of us responsible, myself in particular, it will take some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer was using runners rented from driver Bruce Rosselli because they have 
been particularly effective in extreme cold. He had been excited about posting 
the ninth-best time in Saturday's second heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heated runners to a point where you can't touch them, but I don't see 
how they stay hot when it's 10 below," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you never attempt to take a sled to the line with hot runners. If 
they're not cooling down properly, you put snow or ice on them. In this case 
three gauges said we were within the limit, but the one that didn't was in the 
hands of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every time we come up with something new (like the Bo-Dyn 
sled), the U.S. gets the short end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if they have their eye out for us. I'm tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer enunciated a long list of international interventions. There are rumors 
the U.S. Olympic Committee has wearied of a comparably long history of bobsled 
blundering and plans to force a major shake-up in federation personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of it, the bobsled office in Lake Placid, N.Y., might be put under the 
USOC umbrella in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's events could prove to be the final blow. They clearly brought a 
sudden and frustrating conclusion to Shimer's disappointing season only a year 
after he had won the World Cup championship, but he is determined to be back in 
'98, at 35, and thinks this will simply "fuel the Bo-Dyn fire that much more." 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to come back and dominate the sport," he said. "This is kind of 
the icing on the type year I've had, and maybe I should have expected it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, but I hope to grow from it. Life goes on. A hundred million 
Chinese don't care, and the sun still rises in the East." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as bobsled press liaison Dmitry Feld said, "It was just a technical mistake 
-- of Biblical proportion."

 Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan, who spent most of his time here finishing 
second to Norwegian skier Bjorn Daehlie, won the gold medal Sunday in the final 
cross-country event of the Games, the men's classical 50-kilometer race. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnov, regarded almost as a countryman by Norwegians because of his close 
friendship with Norwegian skier-adventurer Vegard Ulvang, drew wild acclaim 
from the 31,000 in the stands at the Birkebeineren stadium. The entire crowd, 
including those who watched from vantage points along the course, was estimated 
again at more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnov finished the 31.3-mile race in 2 hours 7 minutes 20.3 seconds. Mika 
Myllyla of Finland was second in 2:08:41.9 and Sture Sivertsen of Norway third 
in 2:08:49.0, bumping Daehlie to fourth as Norwegians took four of the top 10 
spots. Erling Jevne was fifth and Ulvang 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvang, who won three gold medals and a silver medal two years ago in 
Albertville, France, finished with only a silver here, that earned as a member 
of the second-place 40k relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie tired badly toward the end of Sunday's race after having sat out two 
days of practice last week because of fatigue and a cold. He finished with four 
medals in these Games, two gold and two silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Smirnov led nearly all the way after taking the lead from Myllyla early in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite fading a bit down the stretch, the U.S. Alpine team can look back on 
one of its best Olympics ever. Paul Casey Puckett's surprising seventh-place 
finish in Sunday's slalom gave the United States at least one top-10 finisher 
in nine of the 10 events. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett's excitement was dampened only by the fact that his brother, Chris, 
who had made the U.S. Olympic team in 1992, was not on the 1994 team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Alberto Tomba said he will probably ski through the 1995 World 
Championships at Sierra Nevada, Spain, then decide how much longer to extend 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of ups and downs the last few years," said Tomba, who capped 
his Olympic career with a silver in the slalom. "It's nice to finish the 
Olympics with a nice medal. I have a good feeling about it."

 Peter Mueller, the choice of Dan Jansen and Bonnie Blair as U.S. Olympic 
speedskating coach, said he is quitting because he's "just fed up with a lot of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller was quoted by the Milwaukee Sentinel in Oslo as saying he decided not 
to wait for a new contract from U.S. Speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in positions of power aren't helping the skaters and I'm tired of 
dealing with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His contract expires at the end of April. He declined to say which officials 
displeased him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get results, you're not appreciated," he said. "You would think 
that, after the past three years, that they would want to have you. I love 
speedskating. It has been my life, but I don't need these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller, 39, of suburban Mequon, is a three-time Olympic medal winner.

 The Games drew about two million visitors, nearly half the population of 
Norway. Eighty-eight percent of the tickets were sold, breaking the Olympic 
record of 83% sold at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Petter Roenningen, deputy managing director of the Lillehammer Olympic 
Organizing Committee, said the biggest problem in a nearly trouble-free 
Olympics was not having a recording of the Ukrainian national anthem ready when 
Oksana Baiul won the women's figure skating. A Ukrainian team member provided a 
cassette of the anthem so the medals ceremony could take place.

 Hundreds of thousands of Norwegians celebrated Sunday as the host nation 
finished the Games with 26 medals, the most by any country. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany, with its first- and third-place finishes in the four-man bobsled, was 
second in the medal standings, ahead of Russia, with 24. Russia finished with 
23 but had the most golds, 11, to 10 for Norway and nine for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States finished tied for fifth with Canada with 13, behind Italy, 
which had 20. It was the United States' best performance at a Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the U.S. medals were gold, two by speedskater Bonnie Blair, and one 
each by speedskaters Cathy Turner and Dan Jansen, and Alpine skiers Diann 
Roffe-Steinrotter and Tommy Moe.

 Paul Kariya, you've just won an Olympic silver medal. What are you doing next? 
</P>
<P>
 Um, he's not going to Disney's Mighty Ducks. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya of the Canadian hockey team says he hasn't made a final decision yet, 
though even the Ducks expect him to return to Maine for the rest of this 
season. He was selected fourth by the Ducks in last year's NHL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira said last week he believes Kariya will 
return to the University of Maine, where Kariya won the Hobey Baker Award last 
season as the best player in college hockey, but Kariya offered no hints 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to Boston to see my girlfriend and I'm going to relax," he said. "I 
really haven't made a decision yet. . . . I'm just exhausted. I have no energy 
left. I have nothing left to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya played double shifts in Canada's last three games, after wing Todd 
Warriner suffered a knee injury. He blossomed during the extra playing time -- 
he had about 25 minutes Sunday, including more than 10 in the third period -- 
and got stronger as the tournament progressed. Kariya scored Canada's first 
goal Sunday, at 9:08 of the third period, and finished with a team-high seven 
points, on three goals and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest things here I've learned is I have a long way to go to be 
the type of player I want to be," he said. "There are a lot of great players 
here, and I learned from them." 
</P>

 Viktor Tikhonov coached some of the Soviet Union's greatest hockey teams, but 
his Olympic finale was less than glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Tikhonov, who has coached the Soviets, Unified Team and Russians since 1978, 
apparently coached his last game Saturday in Russia's 4-0 shutout loss to 
Finland in the bronze-medal game. It was the first time since the Soviets began 
playing in the Olympic hockey tournament that a Soviet or Russian team failed 
to win a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on Tikhonov is sketchy, but journalists from Russia say his 
contract expires March 15 and will not be renewed. They said Boris Mikhailov, a 
former Soviet player, will coach the Russian team at the World Championships in 
April, to be held in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's possible to love him or not, but the history of world 
hockey is connected with his name," said Tikhonov's assistant, Igor Dmitriev. 
</P>
<P>
 Tikhonov, 64, had promised to attend Saturday's postgame news conference, but 
backed out. Dmitriev gave no explanation for that, but talked at length about 
his team's disappointing performance and the depleted state of Russia's hockey 
reserves. More than 50 players from the former Soviet Union have left to play 
in the NHL and European leagues, and the program has been battered by poor 
economic conditions in Russia and a power struggle in the hockey federation. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Eight players from the silver-medal Canadian Olympic team will rejoin their 
NHL clubs after the Games. Returning to the NHL are David Harlock with Toronto, 
Corey Hirsch and Jean Yves Roy with the New York Rangers, Greg Johnson with 
Detroit, Dwayne Norris and Todd Warriner with Quebec, Brian Savage with 
Montreal, Brad Schlegel with Calgary, and Brad Werenka with Edmonton.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; KNIGHT SUFFERS IN SILENCE AS INDIANA LOSES A GAME 
FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No outbursts, no tirades, nothing thrown. Not even too much yelling, at least 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Knight could only wince, slump and occasionally cover his eyes to keep 
from seeing Indiana's worst loss in 89 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota, 20th-ranked and struggling with a two-game losing streak, scored a 
106-56 victory over No. 12 Indiana in Minneapolis on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It has never been worse for Knight in 22 seasons at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, it hasn't been worse for the Hoosiers since March 12, 1905, 
when Ohio State beat Indiana, 66-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight called it part of the education process of a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't how they played today, it's how the team plays from this point on," 
he said. "Any time you play, you have to learn something. . . . I don't know 
how much of an obstacle we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much, actually. The Hoosiers (17-6, 10-4 Big Ten) were riding a three-game 
winning streak with nothing untoward in view until midway through the first 
half. Minnesota (19-9, 9-6) then used a 31-5 run to turned a six-point lead 
into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gophers got a career-high 35 points from Voshon Lenard, and their 32 
assists was a school record. Minnesota had six players in double figures, made 
11 three-pointers -- another team high -- and shot 64%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can predict a game like this," Gopher forward Randy Carter said. "But 
we got beat by 46 at Bloomington once, and that always stuck in the back of our 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers made only three of 12 shots to close the half. They got their 
last field goal of the period with 4:42 remaining, then had four of their 11 
first-half turnovers and two air balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was over after about 10 minutes," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's leading scorer, Damon Bailey, had 13 points and did not play the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 Duke 59, No. 8 Temple 47 -- On the day they retired his number, Grant 
Hill came up with the big plays for the Blue Devils, who won their 88th 
consecutive game over a nonconference opponent in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill finished with 13 points, but blocked a shot and set up a field goal by 
Cherokee Parks in the second half to help Duke (21-3) to its fourth victory in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple (20-6) finished its regular season with two losses. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Kentucky 80, Georgia 59 -- The Wildcats ran off 18 consecutive points to 
open the second half, 14 of them off nine consecutive turnovers by Georgia at 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky (22-5, 11-3 Southeastern) avenged a 94-90 overtime loss at Georgia 
(12-14, 6-8) and pulled into a first-place tie with Florida in the Eastern 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington 77, No. 11 Massachusetts 66 -- Yinka Dare and Kwame Evans 
scored 24 points each to lead the Colonials to a victory at home.

NORTHRIDGE'S SHOTS WAY OFF IN 80-43 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WAYNE MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Consistency proved the undoing of Cal State Northridge's basketball team 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors shot below 30% from the field, the free-throw line and the 
three-point line as Alabama Birmingham took an 80-43 victory before 3,963. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horrible wasn't it?" Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "We missed too many 
layups and we gave UAB too many second shots. We simply didn't play with enough 
enthusiasm to compete with a team of UAB's caliber." 
</P>
<P>
 The game, originally scheduled for Saturday at Northridge, was moved to 
Birmingham because of earthquake damage at the Northridge campus. Before the 
game, Alabama Birmingham Athletic Director and Coach Gene Bartow presented Cal 
State Northridge with a $5,000 check from Rust International Corp., for 
earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham (20-6) made its first five shots and 10 of 11 while the 
Matadors (7-18) hit two of their first 12 shots. The Blazers had a 26-2 lead 
with 12:32 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Long led Alabama Birmingham with 21 points. Peter Micelli led 
Northridge with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were 17 of 60 from the field and five of 17 on free throws.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; ROOKIE DREIFORT IS A QUICK LEARNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right-hander Darren Dreifort pitched in his first game as a Dodger Sunday at 
Vero Beach, Fla. And even though it was merely an intrasquad game, he pitched 
impressively enough to earn great reviews from both pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski and catcher Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a great slider and I know it's still early, but he's right there," 
Piazza said. "He has been working on a pitch, the curveball, and he threw it 
for the double play -- that was impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort came into camp with an impressive sinking fastball, but no curveball. 
Perranoski started teaching Dreifort a curveball about five days ago, along 
with working on the arm angle in his delivery. Dreifort has already shown 
improvement in both.  
</P>
<P>
 "His arm angle was very consistent today and his fastball away to a 
right-handed hitter is virtually unhittable," Perranoski said. "He looked 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, 21, was a reliever at Wichita State, but might have been changed to 
a starter had he not chosen to sign with the Dodgers as the club's top draft 
pick in 1993. "It doesn't matter to me what I do, as long as I pitch," he said. 
"I had never thrown to Piazza before, and I was confident in what he was 
calling. He's a big target." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort pitched two innings in relief for the regulars, giving up one run on 
one hit. Tim Wallach hit a home run against John DeSilva to win the game, 3-2. 
* 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry is hitless in two intrasquad games, but he says that won't 
happen after Friday, when the Dodgers' exhibition season begins against the New 
York Mets. "I just can't get motivated to hit against my own pitchers," he 
said. . . . Billy Ashley had X-rays on a strained left wrist and they were 
negative. . . . Kevin Gross, who has mild tendinitis in his right shoulder, 
threw from the mound and is continuing to show improvement. . . . The Waseda 
University baseball team from Japan has been staying at Dodgertown this spring 
at the invitation of Dodger President Peter O'Malley. They plan to travel to 
Los Angeles and play games March 2 against USC and March 3 against Cal State 
Fullerton before returning to Japan. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; JACKSON'S BLASTS LEAVE THE PARK

<P>
 Bo Jackson shrugged his shoulders and watched his teammates with their mouths 
agape. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson conducted a hitting exhibition Sunday that became the talk of camp in 
Tempe, Ariz. He hit three towering home runs that not only sailed over the 
center-field fence, but landed in the parking lot at Tempe Diablo Stadium. 
Estimated distance: 475 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else in baseball can do that," Angel executive Preston Gomez said. "He 
can't use his hip, so he uses all arms. His strength is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said first baseman J.T. Snow: "You can't even describe it. I just kept 
watching and watching, and all I could say, was, 'Wow!' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some flee Southern California because of earthquakes, mudslides or fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Troy Percival can handle all of nature's evil deeds, but it's 
mankind that has finally exhausted his tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had it, I'm moving out," said Percival, who was grew up in the Moreno 
Valley area. "This winter was the last straw. I don't know where I'm going, 
maybe to Arizona, but I'm definitely getting out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Percival, 24, made up his mind this winter when he found himself with a gun 
pointed at his face. He was sitting in his car at a gas station, minding his 
own business, he said, when a carload of kids pulled alongside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just kept looking at me," Percival said, "and when they got close, 
that's when I knew they were gang-bangers. The next thing I knew, they pointed 
the gun right at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they wanted, or if they were going to shoot, but I didn't 
want to wait around to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very lucky nothing happened, but it was enough to scare the crap out of 
me. That's when I decided enough is enough." 
</P>

 The Angels are expected to sign reliever Mike Butcher to a one-year contract 
today for about $160,000. They also are expected to sign shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina to a one-year contract for about $350,000 by Wednesday. The Angels, 
meanwhile, continue to negotiate multiyear contracts with right fielder Tim 
Salmon and center fielder Chad Curtis. . . . Manager Buck Rodgers left practice 
early to participate in a charity golf tournament sponsored by the widow of 
Harvey Kuenn, former manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, and took along pitchers 
Mark Langston, Shawn Hillegas and Percival. "I didn't want to play favorites," 
Rodgers said, "so I took a veteran, a journeyman and a rookie." . . . Salmon 
(jammed thumb) and pitcher Bob Gamez (tender elbow) were kept to limited 
activities Sunday. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 The United States' six-year hold on the PGA Senior Tour's Chrysler Cup ended 
Sunday when the International team won by two strokes at Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The International squad had led by 12 shots after the first day and began the 
final round 10 shots in front. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States had rounds of 66 by Al Geiberger, 67 by Tom Weiskopf, 
68s by Dave Stockton and Jim Colbert and Mike Hill's 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and we were only four in front at No. 12," South African Simon 
Hobday said. "That's when the first ice cubes went down my back. I knew they'd 
come at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had eight players, with its five lowest rounds of each day scored. 
</P>
<P>
 George Archer had a par 72 and did not contribute to the final day's score, 
but finished the 54-hole event at 13-under 203 and won the individual title by 
defeating Hobday with a birdie on the first playoff hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The International team had a 1,022 total, 58 under par, for the three days. 
</P>
<P>
 It won for only the second time in nine tries.

 With the World Cup about four months away, only 20% of Americans realize it's 
being played in the United States, according to a Harris Poll released Sunday, 
which also showed that only 25% of Americans know that the event involves 
soccer and only 8% are aware it will be played in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three percent of Americans said they aren't interested in watching a 
World Cup game on television, and 62% said they have no interest in attending 
one of the games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20% who are aware the tournament is in the United States represents an 
increase, upfrom 13% in a similar poll last October.

LADY BLESSINGTON BARELY BEATS SKIMBLE IN BUENA VISTA HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Daily Racing Form chart says a nose, but Lady Blessington's victory margin 
was really about a quarter of an inch in the $111,300 Buena Vista Handicap on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Lady Blessington, said he would have been 
satisfied with a dead heat."She ran a winning race, but just got beat by a 
whisker," jockey Corey Nakatani said of Skimble, who has been second six times 
with only one victory in her last 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Skimble finished 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Hero's Love, who was a half-length in 
front of the 13-10 favorite, Possibly Perfect, who lost a couple of shoes in 
the race. Possibly Perfect hadn't run since winning the Yellow Ribbon at Santa 
Anita on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Blessington ran a mile on grass in 1:34 4/5 and paid $22.80. This was the 
6-year-old French-bred's 12th victory in 26 starts and her earnings increased 
to $628,992. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Irwin, president of Team Valor, mapped out this schedule for Lady 
Blessington: the $150,000 Santa Ana Handicap on March 19, breeding to Summer 
Squall and then resume racing, before being sold at a Keeneland breeding-stock 
auction in November. BILL CHRISTINE

NBA ROUNDUP; BARKLEY'S EJECTION SPARKS THE SUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, Charles Barkley slapped New York's Charles Oakley in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Suns slapped the Knicks around, 92-78, Sunday in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley and Oakley, two All-Star forwards, were ejected, and Kevin Johnson 
took over in the fourth quarter as the Suns pulled ahead to pin a fourth 
consecutive loss on New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored 10 points during a decisive 14-1 run in the final quarter, but 
didn't take any bows. 
</P>
<P>
 "They missed a lot of shots, got in foul trouble early and that allowed us to 
take them to the basket," said Johnson, who had 12 of his 29 points and four of 
his five rebounds in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley slapped Oakley with 45 seconds to play before halftime, and Oakley 
missed a retaliatory swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos had 16 points and 12 rebounds. He said Barkley might have 
slapped Oakley to fire up the Suns, whose 107-87 loss to Utah on Friday night 
marked their lowest point total this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was deliberate, but Charles is a team player. He'll do 
whatever it takes to help the team," Ceballos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said he wanted to let Oakley, who wrapped him up on the baseline, know 
that he shouldn't hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the ref overreacted," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley said Barkley told him he wasn't serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't joke around like that on the court," Oakley said. "If he called me 
before the game, I could joke around, but during the game I like to try to be 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied, 68-68, before Ceballos converted a free throw and Johnson 
scored the next 10 Sun points, boosting them into a 79-69 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played our game until the fourth," said Patrick Ewing, who had 29 points 
and 17 rebounds for the Knicks. "Then we let it get away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks' four-game losing streak has allowed Orlando to get back into the 
Atlantic Division race. New York leads the division by two games after having a 
7 1/2-game advantage on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 114, Charlotte 103 -- Shaquille O'Neal, playing on a sore knee, scored 
21 points and had 11 rebounds and five blocks for the Magic at home in its 
seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Anderson added 18 points and eight rebounds for Orlando, and Anfernee 
Hardaway had 15 points and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte has lost five in a row and 13 of 14. Dell Curry led the Hornets with 
26 points. Frank Brickowski, playing his first game for Charlotte since being 
acquired from Milwaukee, had 23. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 117, Dallas 90 -- Chris Morris scored a season-high 27 points and 
the Nets held Dallas to 12 points in the second quarter at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Edwards had 17 points and Kenny Anderson 14 points and nine assists as 
the Nets won for the 15th time in 21 games and denied the Mavericks their first 
three-victory trip since March 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks, 2-3 on their five-game, seven-day trip, were led by Jamal 
Mashburn's 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 107, Golden State 100 -- Isaiah Rider scored 25 points as the 
Timberwolves overcame a 32-point, 16-rebound effort by the Warriors' Chris 
Webber in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Smith scored 21 points and made six free throws in the final 14.7 
seconds as the Timberwolves snapped a five-game losing streak despite 10 
turnovers by Christian Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber scored 14 points in the fourth quarter as the Warriors closed to 97-93 
with 2:59 to play, but Minnesota's Doug West hit three key baskets down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 104, Denver 97 -- Clyde Drexler scored 22 points and Rod Strickland 
19 at Portland as the Trail Blazers won their sixth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf led all scorers with 28 points.

SANTA ANITA; HE ISN'T TAKING WEIGHTS LIGHTLY

 Even though Bien Bien would carry one of the lightest highweights in the 
57-year history of the Santa Anita Handicap, his trainer is dissatisfied with 
the weight assignment and might skip Saturday's $1-million race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weights are not fair," trainer Paco Gonzalez said Sunday. "Bien Bien's a 
grass horse and this is a dirt race. Take a look at his record on dirt. It's 
not very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might keep the horse in the barn. I don't know. I'll have to talk to John 
(Toffan), who's been out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien, owned by Toffan and Trudy McCaffery, was assigned 120 pounds by the 
Santa Anita racing department for the 1 1/4-mile Big 'Cap. The lightest 
highweight for the Big 'Cap was that for Terrang, who won while carrying 116 
pounds in 1959. Three horses led the weight list with only 120 pounds, with 
Cravat finishing seventh in 1939, Great Circle running fifth in 1951 and Farma 
Way winning the race in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four horses were weighted for this Big 'Cap, but only 11 may run. These 
are the weights for the probables:

 Bien Bien, 120; Kissin Kris, 119; Slew Of Damascus, 119; Diazo, 118; The 
Wicked North, 118; Nonproductiveasset, 116; Region, 116; Hill Pass, 115; 
Megan's Interco, 115; Stuka, 115, and Myrakalu, 113. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bien Bien has earned $1.6 million with seven victories in 22 starts, 
his only victory in seven dirt races came in the Swaps Stakes, a weak 
five-horse race at Hollywood Park in July of 1992. Bien Bien frequently trains 
on dirt, but he hasn't raced on that surface since a last-place finish in the 
Super Derby at Louisiana Downs two months after the Swaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't even planning on running the year we won the Swaps," Gonzalez 
said. "The plan was to go to Arlington for the Secretariat. But when we saw how 
light the Swaps came up, it was a chance to win a race without having to ship." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bien Bien's last race, on Feb. 21, the 5-year-old carried 124 pounds while 
finishing second to Fanmore in the San Luis Obispo Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who had estimated Saturday that Bien Bien's weight for the Big 'Cap 
would be 117 pounds, was also puzzled about the weights of some of the other 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kissin Kris drops five pounds and Slew Of Damascus drops a pound," he said. 
"Kissin Kris didn't win his last race, but he's still the horse that ran third 
in the Breeders' Cup (Classic). Slew Of Damascus dropped a pound without 
running. I guess I don't understand handicappers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissin Kris ran sixth in the Strub Stakes, finishing about four lengths behind 
the winner, Diazo. Slew Of Damascus took a four-race winning streak into the 
San Antonio Handicap, but broke through the starting gate and was scratched. 
Trainer Bill Shoemaker deferred a decision on running Diazo in the Big 'Cap 
after the 4-year-old colt worked a mile Sunday in a slow 1:44 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of Bien Bien will affect the riding assignments for the Big 'Cap. 
Gonzalez said that he felt Chris McCarron would ride if Bien Bien runs. Without 
Bien Bien in the race, McCarron probably would get the mount on Hill Pass, who 
finished second behind The Wicked North in the San Antonio before being 
disqualified to third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said that if Bien Bien didn't run in the Big 'Cap, he would keep him 
on the grass for the $250,000 San Luis Rey Stakes on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards suspended Pat Valenzuela for five racing days, starting Thursday, 
after his mount, Salmino, was disqualified from second to third place in a race 
Saturday. . . . Chris McCarron will be at Golden Gate Fields Wednesday to ride 
trainer Neil Drysdale's Laabity, who ran second to Fly'n J. Bryan in a maiden 
race at Santa Anita on Jan. 22. . . . Gracious Ghost, second to Flyin' J. Bryan 
in the San Vicente Stakes, drew the inside post in a six-horse field of 
3-year-olds for Wednesday's $75,000 Bolsa Chica Stakes at Santa Anita. Others 
entered are Jabbawat, Troyalty, King's Blade, Meritation's Sword and Subtle 
Trouble.

NHL ROUNDUP; NEELY BIDS FOND ADIEU IN CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cam Neely made his last visit to Chicago Stadium a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
 Neely took over the NHL goal-scoring lead with his 45th and 46th goals and Jon 
Casey extended his unbeaten streak to 11 games with his fourth shutout of the 
season as the Boston Bruins defeated the Chicago Blackhawks, 4-0, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks will move to the new United Center beginning with the 1994-95 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were 93-141-44 in Chicago Stadium dating to 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in Chicago "is similar to playing in Boston," Neely said. "The ice 
surface is the same and the history in the two buildings is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked down the famous Stadium steps for probably the last time I 
remembered well one of my greatest moments here, the 1991 All-Star game," he 
said. "It was electrifying and incredible. I don't think I'll ever get that 
atmosphere again." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Oates, who had three assists, helped Neely score his second goal, at 
15:07 of the final period, as Neely took over the lead from Buffalo's Dave 
Andreychuk and Detroit's Ray Sheppard. Neely fired the puck past Ed Belfour 
from in front during a power play. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place Bruins, finishing a seven-game trip (5-1-1), moved three 
points ahead of Montreal in the Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey stopped three breakaways in the second period and made 20 saves in 
extending his string of games to 9-0-2 and ending Chicago's four-game unbeaten 
string (3-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 3, Hartford 1 -- Forwards Keith Jones and Mike Ridley scored within 
a 2:46 span of the third period as the surging Capitals rallied at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jones tied the score at 1:45 of the final period, Ridley got the 
game-winner at 4:31. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvain Cote completed the scoring for Washington, which won its third in a 
row and improved to 11-3-2 under Jim Schoenfeld, who took over as coach Jan. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, 31-26-6, moved five games above .500 for the first time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenfeld downplayed his contributions since taking the helm, but hinted that 
the players have grasped what he has tried to employ. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is staying patient and not abandoning what has been working," 
Schoenfeld said. "You work and work and hope the bounces go your way. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Quebec 2 -- Pierre Turgeon capped a three-goal first 
period with his 23rd goal of the season and the Islanders won at Uniondale, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec ended Ron Hextall's home shutout streak at 249 minutes 39 seconds when 
Chris Simon scored with a high 10-foot wrist shot at 2:39 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hextall, who finished with 31 saves, had full shutouts at Uniondale against 
Ottawa, Washington and Philadelphia, plus a 13:00 scoreless stretch against 
Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty McInnis, Keith Acton, Ray Ferraro and Benoit Hogue had the other goals 
for the Islanders, who scored their first three goals in a 3:43 span in the 
opening period. 
</P>
<P>
 New York has won five consecutive games at home. Including all six chances 
against the Nordiques, the Islanders have killed 46 consecutive penalties on 
home ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Lapointe also scored for Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 3, Tampa Bay 2 -- Shjon Podein had two goals and assisted on the 
game-winner as the Oilers won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Pearson scored what proved to be the game-winning goal in the second 
period, 21 seconds after Podein's second goal, as Edmonton won its third in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson, playing for the first time after missing 11 games because of a knee 
injury, also had two assists. Dean McAmmond, recalled from the minors eight 
days ago, assisted on all three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gord Gallant and Rob DiMaio scored for the Lightning.

MOTOR RACING; SAME OLD STORY FOR WALLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Excuse Rusty Wallace if he says "been there, done that" with no sign of 
boredom whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Wallace crashed in the season-opening Daytona 500, then won the 
Goodwrench 500 at North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed the scenario again Sunday, leading 346 of the Goodwrench 500's 
492 laps and leading Sterling Marlin's Chevrolet across the finish line by 5.15 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace had crashed on the 61st lap at Daytona a week ago, finishing 41st. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at Rockingham was no problem at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told everybody, 'Man, we could probably win in a Jaguar,' " Wallace said. 
"It's the race team, not the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew did a perfect job on the car. The chassis was great and the motors 
flew -- a lot of power. I don't think I've ever put my foot in that much 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first victory in a Ford after winning 10 races in a Pontiac a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people said we were making a mistake (switching to Ford)," he said. 
"I made this move because I wanted to have a little better power plant and a 
little better aerodynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to dominate. I wanted to lead all the laps and do it in a big way." 
</P>
<P>
 He did. Wallace led the last 60 laps, and even a late caution flag that 
allowed the field to close in on him didn't help the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had such a big lead all day, I didn't care," Wallace said. "Every time I 
looked behind me, I couldn't even see the second-place guys. This Ford is 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Mast was the only other driver on the lead lap at the end, with Mark 
Martin and Ernie Irvan finishing fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace averaged 125.239 m.p.h. over the 1.017-mile oval and earned $50,385 
for his 32nd victory. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tommy Kendall, driving a Ford Mustang Cobra, raced to a wire-to-wire victory 
at the Grand Prix of Miami, despite racing an extra lap because of an 
electrical problem with the scoring computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall, from La Canada, held off Dorsey Schroeder by 0.434 seconds and 
averaged 68.764 m.p.h. on the 1.87-mile, 11-turn street course. 
</P>

 Chevrolet driver Rick Johnson made it two victories in a row to start the 
Mickey Thompson Stadium Off-Road Racing Series, beating Ivan Stewart in the 
Grand National Sport Truck main event Saturday night at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium.

ANN CONWAY: HARVESTING COMPASSION; SUPPORT GROUP HAS BECOME MAJOR FUNDER OF 
FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why was an organization that was giving so much getting so little?  
</P>
<P>
 That was the question Jill Johnson-Tucker asked herself last year after 
touring the Orange County Food Distribution Center, a nonprofit agency that 
provides food for 260 local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old center in Orange had a slew of volunteers -- people who helped 
collect and distribute surplus food supplies to the needy -- but no supporters 
to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson-Tucker asked center board President John Heffernan what she could do 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Organize a support group, he told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson-Tucker was willing, but fearful. "I didn't think I had enough contacts 
to pull it off," she said. "I had a small group of friends; would they be 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 How many of us have asked ourselves that question and then done nothing 
because we were afraid, or didn't know how to begin? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Johnson-Tucker. She called her close pal, Jennifer Van Bergh. Together, 
they came up with a core group of about 10 people. "Enough to put on a little 
fashion show that we would co-chair. We hoped to raise about $5,000," said 
Johnson-Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they were finished, the duo had founded the Harvesters, a 
45-strong women's support group that staged a fashion show netting $48,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without them, we would have been in the hole last year," said Heffernan. 
"Their success was a very pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 How did they do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little overwhelming at first," admits Van Bergh. "But Jill and I 
kept on meeting, having lunches, drawing up lists of what we wanted to try to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 And they ended up with a plan: Appoint members of their core group as 
sub-chairpersons of their fashion show and have an infomercial kind of party 
about the Food Center at Johnson-Tucker's home in Big Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the party guest list by asking each member of our core group to come 
up with about 10 names," Johnson-Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 They sent out a letter to potential Harvesters, introducing the Food Center 
and inviting them to come for a 5 p.m. get-together. 
</P>
<P>
 They served wine, sparkling water, salmon mousse, swordfish on endive leaves 
and a pesto and sun-dried tomato torte. They put jazz singer Basia on the 
stereo, a video about the Food Center on the tube. And, after guests had warmed 
up to each other, they invited them to hear talks by Food Center officials. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved an irresistible cause. "Not one person left without signing up -- 
committing to $100 per year dues," Johnson-Tucker said. "After all, what's more 
important than feeding the hungry?" 
</P>
<P>
 Next: the fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 Their support group had snowballed into proportions beyond their dreams. They 
needed a name, a fashion vendor that could draw a crowd. Van Bergh had a 
connection with St. John Knits. Why not go for the gold? 
</P>
<P>
 "Five of us had lunch with the chairman of St. John," Van Bergh said. "We 
basically told him that the Food Center needed us and we needed them. He said 
they would love to help; they really went out on a limb for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest is Food Center history. More than 400 guests attended the St. John 
fall fashion show staged in July at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $48,000 they made basically gave Orange County's needy 850,000 meals," 
Heffernan said. "Of the county's 2.4 million people, about 390,000 go to bed 
hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Food Center links businesses with surplus food -- grocery stores, 
restaurants, caterers -- to charities that help the hungry. "For example, 
Disneyland has 42 restaurants," Heffernan said. "We have linked them with the 
Salvation Army. We have linked the Hard Rock Cafe to the Someone Cares Food 
Kitchen. Presently, we are feeding 180,000 people per month." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Harvesters met at the Center Club for their first meeting of 
the year. Members paid for their own lunches, saw a fashion parade by Chanel 
and made tentative plans for this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still talking to retailers at this point," said Johnson-Tucker. "We 
have not yet decided where the event will be held or whose fashions will be 
featured." 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing they know. "We're determined to even make more money," Van Bergh 
said. "And we will. How can we miss with an enthusiastic group of women who 
share a fundamental feeling they should give back to the community?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson-Tucker: "We're a fortunate group of people who don't have a need 
and feel for those who do. We're really inspired by the feeling that we can 
make a difference."

CULTURE WATCH; THE FAULT IS NOT THE HIGHWAY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE TICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for occasional traffic snarls, commuters used to zoom past the 
interchange of California 14 and Interstate 5 with no reason to notice the 
rugged notch where two freeways and two mountain ranges meet. But before dawn 
on Jan. 17, the Santa Susanna Mountains rose more than a foot, reminding us 
that earthquake faults lie beneath the area, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Two centuries ago when Spanish and Mexican colonists traveled north out of the 
San Fernando Valley, they followed a Chumash trail. It followed a pass to Santa 
Clarita Valley that was below 2,000 feet in elevation but narrow, windy and 
steep -- a maze of deep canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wagon road using Beale's Cut, a 250-foot-long, 90-foot-deep passage, 
to conquer the final ridge was not completed until 1862. The first highway to 
Gorman and beyond was not completely paved until 1919. The speed limit along 
parts of "the ridge route" was 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1934, the two-lane California 99 was widened to four lanes and divided by 
1953. Finally, Interstate 5 was built between 1965 and 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, since the quake, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley commuters have had 
plenty of time to ponder the rugged nature of the pass as they creep along the 
four-lane, undivided Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same capricious way a megalopolis sprang from a semi-desert prone to 
drought, fire, flood and earthquakes, Newhall Pass is a heck of a place to put 
a superhighway -- fault lines are one of the main things that create mountain 
passes. STEVE TICE

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: LIZ TAYLOR IS SWEETHEART OF AMFAR'S RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: The American Foundation for AIDS Research's Two-Steppin' for the 
Cure country-Western dinner-dance Saturday at the Beverly Hilton. The evening 
also celebrated co-founder Liz Taylor's 62nd birthday. "I feel every year of 
it," said the actress, who was making her last public appearance before having 
hip replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Among the 800 urban cowpersons were AmFar's Mathilde Krim and 
Mervyn Silverman; Marvin and Barbara Davis, Justine Bateman, Oscar nominee 
Angela Bassett, Linda Gray, Wendy Goldberg, Jane and Marc Nathanson, Sidney 
Poitier, Penny Marshall and Disney's Michael Eisner, who emceed. Also on hand 
were honorees David Mixner, Joel Weisman, Richard Munro for Time Warner and 
Pediatric AIDS Foundation co-founders Elizabeth Glaser, Susie Zeegen and Susan 
DeLaurentis. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Country-Western attire that included Nashville gay, "Twin Peaks" 
hip and Fresno cattle broker. There was big hair, big chaps, blue jeans, face 
lifts and rhinestones. "I borrowed the boots. I borrowed this thing," said a 
studio exec handling his bolo tie. "Now I'm a cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "If I'd known there were this many gay cowboys," said talent manager 
Barry Krost. "I would have learned to ride at an earlier age." 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets went from $300 each up to $100,000 for a table of 10. 
With underwriting from Guess? and Carole Little, $850,000 was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: Speeches and a stellar half-hour performance by Clint Black. There 
was also a crash course in the Texas Two-Step that filled the dance floor. Gene 
Weed, the show's producer, said a country theme works because "the reality is, 
who needs another black-tie dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: At the photo opportunity, the paparazzi were given a written warning 
not to photograph Taylor until she was seated before a black curtain on a small 
stage. The instructions stated that if any photos were taken before then Liz 
would, "cancel the photo opp. and you will most likely be beaten by the other 
photographers -- see, we do have your safety in mind."

STREET SMART: LEFT TURNS ARE LEGAL AS LONG AS THE LIGHT IS STILL GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We all know that it is permissible to make a right turn on a red light. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about turning left when the green arrow has gone off and the light 
for traffic going straight is green? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm particularly interested in the intersection of Telephone Road and Johnson 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walsh, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes left turns are allowed when the green arrow is off, and other times 
they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that some green left-turn arrows are followed by red 
left-turn arrows, while others are followed by a regular green light, Ventura 
traffic engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 If a green left-turn arrow goes off and a regular green light remains, 
motorists are allowed to turn left -- after yielding to oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, the green left-turn arrow turns red, motorists must wait for the 
next green arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 On Telephone Road at Johnson Drive, don't even think of turning left once the 
arrow turns red. "You'd be in violation of the law," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 You are not the only one who wonders about the rules of left-turn traffic 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura has prepared an entire brochure on the subject as part of 
its series of traffic information brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 For a free copy, call 654-7887.

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to make a left turn from Hillcrest Drive into the Circuit City parking 
lot in Thousand Oaks is extremely dangerous and getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The median on Hillcrest off Lynn Road has some very attractive landscaping. 
But as the plants and trees grow, they are obstructing the view of cars coming 
in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Can these plants be trimmed to make this turn safer? 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Carlson, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to your tip, Thousand Oaks street maintenance workers will check out 
the potential plant problem within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 If the unruly plants are obstructing traffic on Hillcrest Drive, they will be 
mercilessly chopped into compliance with traffic safety codes, says Roy Myers, 
assistant traffic engineer for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those codes, no plant in the median strip may measure more than 2 
1/2 feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
 On Hillcrest at the entrance to Circuit City, where the speed limit is 45 
m.p.h., the plants could be hacked even more to provide the required 495 feet 
of visibility.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing in response to a gentleman who wrote a few weeks ago complaining 
about the lack of lighting on the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to agree that there are stretches that are extremely dark and 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans responded to his concern by saying the lights had been burned out and 
were replaced. But I drive to school three nights a week from Newbury Park to 
Simi Valley on the Moorpark Freeway and lighting is still a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a 2 1/2-mile stretch between Collins Drive and Madera Road that has no 
lights or light poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes when I'm driving home from class and I'm the only driver on the 
road, it can get pretty creepy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than my headlights, it's pitch black. I'd hate to have a flat tire and 
be stuck in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of safety, lights should be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Mudgett, Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation does not agree with you. 
</P>
<P>
 State highway safety codes do not require that lights be placed along the 
roadway, senior Caltrans engineer Tony Colella says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lights are mandatory only at on- and off-ramps, interchanges, bridges and 
"anything that has a special or unusual feature to it," Colella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darkness does not count as an unusual feature. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the highways are dark," Colella said. "Just being dark isn't enough to 
make lights necessary."

PROGRAM GIVES HEALTHY START TO YOUTHS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dalia Felix, a fifth-grade student at Oxnard's Cesar Chavez School, had been a 
B student for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, after receiving a semester's worth of tutoring in math, reading 
and writing, Dalia was thrilled to open a report card with straight A's. "Look 
what I got, look what I got!" Dalia shouted as she ran to her tutor with the 
pink piece of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalia is one of more than 200 students at three Oxnard schools who has 
received tutoring through a program dubbed the Healthy Start Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, nearly 3,000 students at Fremont Intermediate School, and Rose Avenue 
and Cesar Chavez schools are eligible to receive a range of academic, health 
and social services through Healthy Start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of the program is to meet the needs of the students and their 
families related to health, dental and social services," said Richard Duarte, 
administrator of curriculum and instruction for the Oxnard Elementary School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was started in January, 1993, with a $400,000 state grant. Since 
1992, California has made such grants available for schools with high numbers 
of low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We selected the schools that historically had the greatest number of students 
in need of those kind of services," Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, only one other district has such a program -- Santa Paula 
Unified, which operates a Healthy Start program at Webster School. 
</P>
<P>
 During its first year in Oxnard, the program has performed more than 400 
physical exams, Duarte said. The number of students having dental emergencies 
at Cesar Chavez School has decreased 98% since January, 1993, said Linda 
Butcher, the district nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "One child in pain versus 50 in pain is a tremendous improvement," Butcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Healthy Start during its first year has been so great that the 
school board has decided to expand it to two other elementary schools -- Norma 
Harrington and Driffill. 
</P>
<P>
 The program works through a referral system in which teachers identify 
students who need assistance and refer them to the appropriate Healthy Start 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul Perez, a student at Cesar Chavez, was performing poorly on exams. A 
teacher referred him to the Healthy Start clinic for a physical. It was 
discovered that Perez was nearsighted and needed glasses, which were provided 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been extremely difficult for us to pay for the eye exam and the 
glasses," said Saul's mother, Maria Perez. "I don't think we would have been 
able to afford that." 
</P>
<P>
 Most services are provided by existing county social agencies. For example, 
health services are provided through the Ventura County Child Health and 
Disability Program. Counseling services are available through the county's 
Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of this program is that everyone in the community, every social 
agency collaborates," Butcher said. "We work as a big team." 
</P>
<P>
 Also participating in the program is the Assistance League of Ventura County, 
which has clothed more than 500 children in the last year, and St. John's 
Regional Medical Center, which has conducted health seminars for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutoring service, which employs students from Hueneme High School, 
conducts three-hour sessions three times a week at the site of closed Ramona 
School. Pupils typically go to one session per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobi Schwenk, coordinator of the tutor program, said parents are grateful for 
the help that their children get with homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents are not academically prepared to help their children with 
their homework," Schwenk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children also appreciate the help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children feel a lot better about themselves. They want to turn their 
homework into their teachers because they feel secure that they have it done in 
the correct way." 
</P>
<P>
 After each tutoring session, students have an opportunity to socialize. Most 
spend about an hour jumping rope, playing cards or just talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the children don't want to go home," Schwenk said. "Many don't have 
the luxury of television or computer games at home, so they prefer to stay here 
where they have something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the children are not the only ones receiving assistance through Healthy 
Start. The parents also get help. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a week, social worker Lilia Trujillo meets with a group of mothers to do 
a variety of arts and crafts and talk about common problems while their 
children are tutored in a nearby classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our meeting, we discuss a variety of issues, and the mothers have an 
opportunity get away from their daily household chores," Trujillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really convenient for me," said Raquel Pimentel, 44, the mother of 
three Cesar Chavez students who are in the tutoring program. "I can enjoy 
myself here while I know that they are enjoying themselves in the next room." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a parents' group meets once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through our work with the parents, we hope to make the various social 
services in the county available to them and to teach them how to function 
independently," Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the program seems successful, not all school officials are pleased 
with it. School board member Jack Fowler strongly opposes the district's 
participation in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is the business of schools to be involved in social 
programs," Fowler said. "The objective of schools by nature is to educate 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said he recognizes the needs of the families that take part in Healthy 
Start, but said schools are not prepared to handle those needs. Eventually, he 
said, the schools will be so overwhelmed by the social problems that the whole 
system may collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 But like a majority of her colleagues, school board member Mary Barreto said 
she sees the program as a way of investing in the future. With the kind of help 
provided by Healthy Start, children are more likely to stay in school and not 
get involved in antisocial activities such as gangs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing else, it is a message to the teacher saying we are going to help 
you," Barreto said. "If you don't provide that type of help, it can be very 
overwhelming for the teachers."

NUNS HOPE FOR DELIVERANCE FROM DUMP; ENVIRONMENT: SISTER SERVANTS OF MARY WILL 
PRESENT COUNTY SUPERVISORS WITH A PETITION URGING THE CLOSURE OF NEIGHBORING 
BAILARD LANDFILL OR RELOCATION OF THEIR CONVENT AT PUBLIC EXPENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ventura County officials convene Tuesday to settle the fate of the 
Bailard Landfill, they will be confronted by an emerging political force intent 
on reversing current solid waste plans: the nuns of Sister Servants of Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 Their convent sits only about 500 feet away from the dump on Oxnard's western 
edge. Fed up with noise, odor and dust from the landfill, the sisters have 
hired a lawyer to ensure that the county looks out for their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, they will deliver to supervisors a petition with more than 3,000 
signatures demanding that the landfill be closed or the convent be relocated at 
county expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that the supervisors have a legal responsibility and a 
moral responsibility to the people in their community," said Jodi Rupp, an 
administrator at a Newbury Park nursing home run by the Catholic order. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were elected to take care of the public," Rupp added. "Laws must be 
justified by more than the will of the majority. They must rest on 
righteousness and consider the concerns of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The brewing legal battle is the latest wrinkle in a long-running effort to 
extend the life of the landfill another three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit to operate the dump north of Gonzales Road and west of Victoria 
Avenue expired in December. Area residents and the city of Oxnard have long 
urged closure of the landfill as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the June defeat of a proposal to open a new landfill in Weldon Canyon 
near Ojai, waste officials say the west end of the county has few other options 
for dumping the 1,000 tons of trash it produces each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city opposes the continued operation of that facility," said Oxnard City 
Councilman Andres Herrera, the city's representative on the county's waste 
commission. "But there are certain realities we have to face. Where is the 
trash going to go if we close Bailard?" 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the Ventura County Planning Commission earlier this month 
voted to extend the landfill until May 30, 1997, or to the future date when the 
landfill is filled, whichever comes first. The landfill will be considered full 
when it either accumulates 3.15 billion tons of trash or when its wall of 
refuse reaches 119 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by supervisors, the extension would next be considered by the 
Local Enforcement Agency, which makes recommendations to the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit extension appeared easily on its way to approval at the county 
level until the nuns spoke out, said Stanley E. Cohen, an Oxnard-based attorney 
who is representing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was going along very smoothly; at least all of the issues that 
were being dealt with were other than those that affected the sisters," Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 22 nuns, who range in age from 19 to 94, say they are suffering 
health problems they attribute to the landfill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board needs to be empathetic to the health plight and the 
environmental plight that these 22 nuns face," Cohen said. "If they want to 
have a landfill, maybe they better do something about getting the sisters out 
of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard said she has asked for more information on the health 
concerns raised by the nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is a matter for consideration," she said. "I've asked them to 
verify for me any health problems they have encountered that could be 
attributable to the landfill site." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said he and other parishioners were asked Feb. 20 to 
sign a petition in support of the nuns at Santa Clara Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nuns have raised an issue in the 11th hour, that's for sure," said Flynn, 
who didn't sign the petition to avoid a conflict of interest. "But they are 
pretty close to the landfill. I think it has to be treated seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the issue is resolved and the permit extension is granted, Howard 
and Flynn said they will continue to press for a long-term solution to the 
county's trash problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a county with a landfill on the west end that may be extended for 
three years, but with no plan in place to deal with this issue in the future," 
Flynn said. "We are going to have to put the garbage someplace. We better start 
making plans for the very near future."

FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS, A PLACE TO BE LOOKED AFTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, 89-year-old Sophie Kraft can't remember 
much these days. 
</P>
<P>
 She takes a shower, then thinks that it's time to bathe again. She takes off 
her sweater, then gets confused about whether she's dressing or undressing. She 
learns a name, then promptly asks to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow, Kraft has branded into her increasingly failing memory the name 
of the driver who transports her to the Alzheimer's Day Program at Fitzgerald 
House in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "She recognizes the lady in the Dial-a-Ride taxi who takes her there and calls 
her by name -- I'm floored," said Kraft's daughter, Irene Shelton. "She thanks 
the people there all the time for helping her. She's really enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 To the program coordinators at Fitzgerald House, such testimony provides ample 
motivation to continue working at Ventura County's only day-support program 
specifically geared toward Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
 A progressive, degenerative disease, Alzheimer's attacks the brain, destroys 
memory and impairs thinking. Patients may become combative and cantankerous, or 
they may wander day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease afflicts 4 million Americans and, so far, researchers have found 
neither a cure nor a fully effective treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their memory and behavioral problems, Alzheimer's patients need 
constant care. They often cannot remember their phone numbers or addresses, and 
may become confused or exhausted if they wander off unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Fitzgerald House comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they're leading the patients in an ultra-low-impact exercise class or 
helping them put seed in an outdoor bird cage, staff members try to keep the 
elderly participants engaged and interested. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they fulfill an equally important goal -- giving the patients' 
family members a much-needed respite, a chance to go grocery shopping or see a 
movie or sneak out to lunch with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Alzheimer's program at Fitzgerald House, which charges $6 an hour, can 
take care of only a few patients at a time. The program accepts just 10 
participants a day for the sessions from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other centers, Oak Tree House in Ojai and Club Camarillo, offer some 
day-support services for the memory-impaired as part of their general programs 
for the frail elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even counting those slots, only a fraction of the county's estimated 5,000 
Alzheimer's patients can find day care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It blows my mind," said Lynn Lewis, project director at Oak Tree House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, people will realize it's more economical to keep Alzheimer's 
patients in their homes with day programs, rather than put them in a 
board-and-care facility and let the state pick up the tab," she said. "But we 
just aren't there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Lewis, local Alzheimer's experts expect more day-support programs to 
spring up around the county sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't want to wait for "eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 To raise awareness of the disease -- and the need for better care -- the 
Ventura County chapter of the Alzheimer's Assn. has launched a fund-raising 
campaign. Executive Director James Wortman has set no target goal; the more 
money he gets, he says, the more good he can do. 
</P>
<P>
 As he travels around the county trying to drum up support, Wortman gives 
speeches heavy on facts, hoping to shock people into donating by the force of 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're more than 80 years old, you have a 1-in-2 chance of getting 
Alzheimer's, and there's no cure yet," Wortman said, echoing one of his stump 
speeches. "The baby boomers have got to get with it. It's time to give money to 
research, time to give money to support day-care programs." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, few individual donors open their wallets for Alzheimer's 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley day-support program squeaks by on a budget of $84,000 a 
year. Most of that money comes from grants, including federal funds funneled 
through the city of Thousand Oaks and the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real credit to the Conejo Valley Senior Concerns that they have opened 
the first Alzheimer's unit and are so innovative," said Sue Tatangelo, a 
programming assistant at the Ventura County Area Agency on Aging. "They're 
working like crazy over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Alzheimer's patients generally require closer supervision, programs 
directed at memory-impaired senior citizens often cost more than general adult 
day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet cost alone does not account for the lack of programs in Ventura County. 
Often, experts say, the victims' families feel so overwhelmed by the disease 
that they have little time to join support groups -- much less lobby for more 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're financially struggling with the medical bills; they're emotionally 
struggling with losing a family member," Lewis said. "They're not in a position 
to be a strong voice for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, it took a group of senior citizens unaffected by Alzheimer's to 
identify the need for a day-support program in Thousand Oaks. Prompted by their 
recommendations, the nonprofit group Senior Concerns opened the Alzheimer's 
wing of Fitzgerald House a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now well-established, the program has a short waiting list and a full roster 
of activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory-impaired Alzheimer's patients mingle with other senior citizens in 
sing-alongs, do-it-yourself craft hours and short walks. Staffers -- one for 
every three participants -- give the Alzheimer's patients special attention as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing in a sunny courtyard after leading half an hour of coordination 
exercises, caretakers Stella Silverest and Mary Kay Lee watched over four 
elderly women, talking to each one in turn and nodding enthusiastically despite 
the disjointed responses. 
</P>
<P>
 They beamed when one patient, Lillian Hurd, told them: "I'm doing all right" 
as she sipped water from a Styrofoam cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a staffer who has waived her salary and now works for free, said she 
loves the program for its emphasis on "the holding hands, the hugs, the 
smiles." 
</P>
<P>
 And the participants, aged 56 to 98, seemed equally pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive Dugan, an enthusiastic exerciser in a pale purple dress, held Lee's hand 
throughout the rest break. Next to her, Helen Donovan clucked over her friend, 
fellow participant Ella Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the families and friends who care for them outside Fitzgerald House 
enjoyed a few free hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt if you can imagine what it's like (to care for an Alzheimer's 
patient)," said Walter Babchuk, whose wife, Deana, attends the program three 
days a week. "You have to be attentive constantly, just constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 With Deana engaged at Fitzgerald House three days a week, Babchuk has time to 
tend to his investments and work on his hobbies, knowing that his wife is 
safely and happily listening to music, making crafts or chatting with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just incredibly wonderful that a community has made provisions for this 
kind of care," he said.

ATHLETIC LEADERS FORM FUND-RAISING TEAM; RECREATION: CONEJO SPORTS FEDERATION 
INVOLVES MORE THAN 30 REPRESENTATIVES. THE GROUP WILL TACKLE THE DAUNTING TASK 
OF FINDING MONEY FOR EXPANDED PROGRAMS AND BETTER FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Carpenter always knew that he would have a tough time persuading the 
masses to support his obscure passions: fencing and pentathlons, a jumble of 
five sports from equestrian jumping to pistol shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing his isolation, the 29-year-old writer never bothered lobbying 
Thousand Oaks officials for places to train. He made do with what he had, or 
traveled to Los Angeles in search of better facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Carpenter sees a chance to gain recognition for his favorite sports 
-- and, perhaps, gain some new training gyms in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 With considerable optimism, Carpenter has joined the Conejo Sports Federation, 
a team of more than 30 athletic leaders dedicated to improving recreational 
opportunities for children and grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 As he explained: "United we stand, divided we fall." 
</P>
<P>
 From basketball to swimming, adult softball to youth soccer, the new 
federation boasts members representing every sport played between Camarillo and 
Calabasas. Together, they will tackle the daunting task of raising money for 
expanded athletic programs and better facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will absolutely have clout," Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 First on the federation's game plan: identifying each sport's priorities and 
raising funds to meet those needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving well beyond the bake sales and carwashes that support most club sports, 
the athletic leaders plan to tap corporate donors, national foundations and 
even local voters for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials have talked vaguely of issuing bonds to help finance 
an Olympic-sized pool, a new multipurpose gym or spiffy playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 And federation leaders intend to fight hard for such aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "To build facilities, you need money, and to get money, you need as many votes 
as you can. If everybody bands together and agrees on a wish list, we have more 
of a chance to get widespread support," said Dennis McGurk, a federation member 
and vice president of the Newbury Park Pony Baseball League. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for more recreational opportunities have echoed in the Conejo Valley for 
years. Better sports facilities routinely crop up as a priority for residents 
on the city-sponsored attitude surveys. But as Thousand Oaks approaches 
build-out, the issue has gained new urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do it now, in the next 10 years, all of Thousand Oaks and Newbury 
Park will be developed and we'll have lost our window of opportunity," McGurk 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the federation still has not fully organized, some members have already 
identified possible funding sources. In particular, they are eyeing the Los 
Angeles Olympic Committee, which they said offers substantial grants to 
regional sports groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about this because I've seen the need for a long time," said 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who sits on the federation steering committee with 
Schillo. "There's always strength in numbers."

FIGHTING IS BECOMING THE METHOD OF CHOICE; SOCIOLOGY: STUDENTS WITH A SCORE TO 
SETTLE ARE RESORTING TO A CODE OF STREET-GANG BEHAVIOR THAT PUSHES THEM TO 
CONFLICT RATHER THAN TALK, PEERS AND OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 Despite the slow creep of deadly weapons into Ventura County's schoolyards, 
students and school officials say there are no signs that students have begun 
to show more interest in backing away from fights. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, students and officials echoed a point that was driven home by the 
fatal stabbing of a Simi Valley ninth-grader Feb. 1, and the shooting of three 
Westlake High students Feb. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, students with a score to settle are resorting to a code of 
street-gang behavior that pushes them to fight rather than talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The code says: Take no disrespect, complain to no one and don't back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Thousand Oaks High students stare each other down, daring each other to 
flinch, and indulge in threat-flinging sessions of "trash-talking," student 
peer counselors there say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, some girls talk behind their rivals' backs, and rumors get blown 
out of proportion and erupt into screaming matches, said Mary Jo Del Campo, a 
Moorpark High School guidance counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Oxnard, a multiracial group of high school students agreed in 
interviews that racist hatred often sparks fights that can range from 
slur-riddled arguments to after-school gang rumbles of 20 students or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of schoolyard fights remains relatively low, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, among the 18,000 students in Simi Valley schools, there were 
only 676 suspensions for fighting last year, according to school statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the severity of the fights is on the rise, students and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed," said Anna Merriman, an assistant principal who oversees 
the student-to-student counseling program at Thousand Oaks High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone stared at me when I was 15, the very worst thing that could happen 
is a fistfight," she said. "Unfortunately, today, we're talking about their 
life, their safety. There are no more fair fights." 
</P>
<P>
 The types of fights in junior high differ from those in high school, said 
Leslie Crunelle, director of secondary education in the Simi Valley Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the junior high level, it frequently starts out with play," Crunelle said. 
"I bump into you playfully, or I knock your hat off playfully. You turn around 
and maybe not as playfully shove me back, then I come back and, all of a 
sudden, one of us is not playing any more." 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, fights are rarer, but more serious, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stem from situations in which at least one of the parties feels truly 
aggrieved," Crunelle said. "In that sense, it's more serious. . . . Those 
fights tend to come out of anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Anger builds from several sources -- rivalry between social cliques or gangs, 
arguments over boyfriends and girlfriends, and any kind of disrespect, real or 
imagined, students and school officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, kids push each other to fight by staring each other down in bouts 
of "mad-dogging" or just "dogging," a game of brinkmanship borrowed from gang 
members, said Wayne Toscas, who oversees discipline for the Ventura Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's an entirely new phenomenon," Toscas said. "The fact that 
it continues on the school ground or in the classroom is the new phenomenon." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks student counselors Maya Kwiat, A. D. Mathur and Shannon 
Hermanson agreed that in clothing, behavior and music, more students are 
adopting gang culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole gangster crowd has become popular," said Hermanson, a 16-year-old 
junior. "Gangs are in now." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got the style of dress and tough attitude," Mathur added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the walk," Kwiat said. 
</P>
<P>
 And "there's a lot of trash-talking," Mathur added. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for conflicts vary. In some cases, race is the catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Charleen Morla, 16, a Filipino-American and junior at ethnically diverse 
Channel Islands High School, said Latino students have hurled ethnic slurs at 
her several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Harper, an African-American senior at Channel Islands, agreed that 
bigotry often leads to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Name-calling, that's how most things start," said Harper, 18. "Sometimes it's 
done jokingly. Then it might go too far, and they'll go back and tell their 
friends, and they might pump it up a little bit more than what it was, and then 
there's a conflict between a lot of people calling each other names." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the fights stem directly from gang rivalry, said Jose DeHaro, 19, a 
Channel Islands High senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Students say young gang members have the gang code of violence imprinted on 
them by friends -- or by parents who either fondly remember their own gang 
camaraderie or just do not care what their kids do. 
</P>
<P>
 And gang members do not fight alone, DeHaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't fight one-on-one; they all gang up with their friends," added 
DeHaro, who said he joined the school's inter-gang counseling group after 
punishment for his own fighting and a commercial robbery cost him a year of 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not let each other back down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rarely see that," DeHaro said. "People start talking crap at them, saying 
that the guy chickened out." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, physical or verbal abuse comes from one of the oldest sources 
in the world -- the bully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had bullies in schools," said Jean Ferguson, a youth counselor 
and family therapist in the Conejo Valley. "Bullying has become very cool. (It) 
has become a kind of elevated-hero thing. I work with the victims and I work 
with the bullies, and the victims are terrified." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Williams, a 15-year-old freshman at Channel Islands High, said he is 
often picked on because he has one kidney and could die if he gets punched in 
the wrong place in a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'There's that handicapped sucker; let's go wail on him,' " Williams 
said. But he said he has never been in a fight because he has just put up with 
the insults. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Perry, 18, a senior at Camarillo High, said: "I personally had a 
problem with someone, and they just kept coming after me, bugging me, bugging 
me. I managed to avoid this person as much as I possibly could and, over time, 
it just dwindled." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students said the chemistry brewing between cliques or individual rivals 
can start fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at somebody wrong, that's enough to start a fight," said Pat 
Evans, 16, a junior and peer counselor at Camarillo High. "People are very 
touchy, that if you look at their girlfriend, that becomes a problem. It's all 
small things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people talk enough," he added. "They just find fighting to be a 
way out. If you talk about things, it just makes things easier." 
</P>
<P>
 "But isn't that losing face?" asked JoAnn Ranchie, a 16-year-old Camarillo 
High junior. "They think talking is an easy way out of it, so they don't talk. 
. . . And even talking, they'll second-guess and not listen to what (the 
others) are saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Volatile disputes can turn dangerous, as in the case of three Westlake High 
students injured by gunfire when a group of youths jumped out of cars in 
Thousand Oaks on Feb. 3 and attacked a group of students gathered to watch a 
fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can turn deadly, as in the stabbing of Chad Hubbard, 14, a student at 
Valley View Junior High in Simi Valley. Phillip Hernandez, 13, who reportedly 
had a long-running feud with the 14-year-old, has been charged with murder in 
the Feb. 1 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley police often investigate tips about weapons, said Officer John St. 
Laurent, who patrols the schools. Often, the tips are empty talk, but sometimes 
teachers confiscate knives and realistic fake guns that could prove to be 
almost as dangerous as the real thing if they were pulled out in a fight 
against another armed student, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While few students bring weapons to school, many more bring them to parties, 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parties are out of control here. Nobody knows who's at their party. . . . 
There's weapons, alcohol," said Hermanson, the student peer counselor at 
Thousand Oaks High. "There's a lot of knives. Knives are a dime a dozen." 
</P>
<P>
 While police and school disciplinarians work to filter weapons out of the 
students' hands, and school officials try to teach new curricula of tolerance 
and communication, the kids often make up their own minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwiat said she approves of Thousand Oaks High programs focused on teaching 
students to resolve conflicts before they turn violent. But, she said, they do 
not help everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're effectively getting the information, but the people that are getting 
the information are not the ones who need to be hearing it," Kwiat said. "The 
students who are in trouble don't go" to the voluntary meetings, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 All the students agreed that the best advice they can offer to someone facing 
a fight is to try to talk it out first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not just talking it out, but being open to what's said," said Harper of 
Channel Islands High. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening is vital, said Travon Baker, an 18-year-old senior at Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times (a fight) happens because one person or the other is not 
really willing to listen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students are reluctant to tattle, but they should consider telling a 
teacher or parent about their trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid himself should go and tell his parents the problem," said DeHaro, of 
Channel Islands High. "Your friends will think bad of you, saying you're a 
momma's boy," but parents may be able to offer advice to defuse the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 And parents should be willing to listen to their children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask them, 'So, how you doing? How's it going in school?' " he suggested. 
"That'll help bring out the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 If the dispute is one-sided, the student being picked on should try to avoid 
the antagonist, said Kimberly Perry, of Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every conflict I've ever had in high school was solved by just ignoring it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if talk fails or a fight seems imminent, students should try to just 
walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just walk away -- you'll walk away with your life," Hermanson said. "Let's 
say you lose some of the ego you have in high school, but so what?" Avoiding 
Fights 
</P>
<P>
 Students from three high schools -- Camarillo, Channel Islands and Thousand 
Oaks -- were asked by The Times for their advice on how to stay out of fights. 
This is what they suggest: 
</P>
<P>
 Talk it out. Whatever the disagreement, violence will not solve it, and may 
only bring retaliation from the other person's friends or harsh discipline from 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen. Try to understand the other person's point of view, even if you do not 
agree with it. Be willing to admit it when you are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not act on rumors. Sometimes, things you hear that someone said about you 
or about a friend have been taken out of context. Go to the source of the 
information and learn the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignore insults or hard looks. Eventually they will stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus on the problem, not the person. Talk about the disagreement itself. 
Insults accomplish nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid bullies. If you stay away from them long enough, they will leave you 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to a parent or teacher. They can offer you advice your friends cannot, 
and they may be able to intervene and give you room to talk out your 
disagreement with the other person. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignore friends who urge you to fight. If they are truly your friends, they 
will respect your decision to avoid violence.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW LAW TO AFFECT CLOSED MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County residents who like to know what their local school boards are 
up to will soon be able to learn in advance what trustees plan to discuss at 
closed meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under revisions to the state's open-meeting law scheduled to take effect April 
1, all elected panels such as school boards are required to publish agendas for 
their closed sessions, in addition to their regular meetings, said Ventura 
County Deputy Dist. Atty.Don Coleman, an expert on the Ralph M. Brown Act. 
</P>
<P>
 School boards generally go behind closed doors to discuss matters such as 
disciplining teachers, expelling students, filing lawsuits or negotiating with 
employee unions. 
</P>
<P>
 But most school board agendas refer to such items only by the number of the 
relevant state code, with no explanation whether the subject is an expulsion, 
lawsuit or other matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Brown Act amendments, agendas will have to explain precisely what 
issues will be discussed during a closed session. 
</P>
<P>
 But school boards will still be free to withhold names of teachers or students 
discussed in closed session to protect their privacy. MAIA DAVIS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAREER DAY SIGN-UPS FOR GIRLS UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Registration is open for a math and science career day that will be open to 
sixth- through 12th-grade girls from private and public schools throughout 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the American Assn. of University Women chapters in Ventura, 
Camarillo and Oxnard, the career day will be held from 8:45 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. 
March 19 at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to encourage girls to prepare early for careers in math and science, 
the conference will feature presentations by about 35 women professionals in 
fields ranging from banking to medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 AAUW organizers are recommending that girls who want to attend the event 
register in advance to get their pick of three presentations they want to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the career workshops for girls, the conference will include a 
presentation for parents who want to know how they can help their daughters 
prepare for careers in math or science. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration forms listing the various workshops are available at schools 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Forms can also be obtained by calling AAUW members Sally Dunham at 485-6358, 
Betty Nilmeier at 642-7102, Terry Lisagor at 484-3928 or Sallye Gilbert at 
484-4054. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks AAUW branches hold their own math 
and science career days. But the Thousand Oaks event had been scheduled for 
Jan. 17, the day of the Northridge earthquake, and was not rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley event had been scheduled March 5 at Simi Valley High School, 
but was canceled because of earthquake damage to the school. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; FUTURE FOUNDATION SEEKS PUBLIC INPUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Conejo Future Foundation, a nonprofit group of volunteers dedicated to 
charting the region's course into the 20th Century, has reorganized after an 
18-month hiatus and is seeking public comment on proposed undertakings. 
</P>
<P>
 At a brainstorming session earlier this month, the group's trustees outlined 
three target areas to study this year: public safety, open space maintenance 
and youth needs.The trustees will select one topic as a focus after considering 
public input. 
</P>
<P>
 In dealing with the priority issue, the Conejo Future Foundation "could set up 
a new task force to issue a report or simply hold a public forum," said Carolyn 
Kopp, who heads the 30-member board of trustees. "We need to look at where we 
could have the most impact and where our resources match up with the needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's last major effort, dubbed Vision 20/20, took 2 1/2 years to 
complete. Bolstered by $300,000 in grants from local governments, the 
foundation issued six thick reports exploring the Conejo Valley's future needs 
and priorities in the environment, housing, water resources, regional 
government, transportation and solid waste management. After Vision 20/20, the 
trustees "took a break, because it was exhausting," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's membership has dropped by half, from a peak of 300 during Vision 
20/20. Memberships are issued on a sliding-fee scale, starting at $15 for 
senior citizens and students. Individuals, families or corporations can buy 
memberships. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley residents wishing to advise the foundation on priorities should 
call office manager Carol Wisniewski at 495-8711. STEPHANIE SIMON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CUTTING 2 BUS LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council today will consider cutting bus service from the 
Buenaventura Mall to Ventura Harbor and from Ventura to Ojai because of the 
high cost of subsidizing the rarely used routes. 
</P>
<P>
 City Transportation Engineer Nazir Lalani said too few people use the two bus 
lines, which cost the city nearly $150,000 a year to operate.The fares from the 
Ojai bus line make up about 4% of its costs, and the fares from the mall bus 
line make up about 8% of its costs, he said, adding that the city's goal is to 
subsidize 80% of a bus line's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheaper to pay people cab fare," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council decides to cut the service, the South Coast Area Transit board 
of directors must also give final approval in April, Lalani said. Bus service 
would be eliminated July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related action, the council is expected to recommend that SCAT officials 
limit the purchase of buses next year and put together a five-year financial 
plan that evaluates how much it would cost to implement accommodations for the 
disabled called for under the American with Disabilities Act. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; BICYCLIST SOUGHT BY POLICE IS HIT BY 
CAR

<P>
 A 34-year-old Oxnard man was listed in critical condition Sunday at St. John's 
Regional Medical Center after being hit by a car as he was escaping police on a 
bicycle, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Acuna, who Port Hueneme police said was wanted on a misdemeanor bench 
warrant, was struck by a dark-colored sedan about 12:45 a.m. Sunday in the 700 
block of Halyard Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna was first spotted by police minutes earlier in the parking lot of Champs 
Restaurant, 1900 S. Victoria Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could be arrested, he sped off on a bicycle, heading toward the 
Marina Village condominium complex, Port Hueneme police said. Officers now are 
looking for the driver of the sedan, which failed to stop after striking Acuna, 
who suffered major head injuries. Police would not disclose Sunday what Acuna 
is charged with under the warrant. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Santa Paula police have arrested three men and a 16-year-old boy on suspicion 
of armed robbery after witnesses told investigators that the group had robbed 
two men of a wallet and money, and beaten one of them severely. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responding to a report of men fighting in the 500 block of East Main 
Street about 1:45 a.m. Saturday found two men who had been robbed and beaten by 
the suspects, who later fled, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, police spotted a vehicle matching the description of the 
one driven by the suspects and recovered a rifle, the victim's wallet and an 
unspecified amount of cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers arrested Miguel Angel Zamora, 19; Juan Mendoza Ramirez, 18, and 
Robert Villanueva, 19, all of Santa Paula, and a 16-year-old Santa Paula boy on 
suspicion of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The three adults were booked at Ventura County Jail, with bail set at $20,000 
each, a jail official said Sunday. Police investigators would not identify the 
victims or provide further details. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; REDUCTION IN CITY REVENUES IS FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of the continuing slow economy, the city of Oxnard will receive $2.5 
million less in revenues this year than previously anticipated, according to a 
midyear budget report to be reviewed Tuesday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the losses will be partly offset by a new surcharge of more than $800,000 
on utility shipments within the city, higher sales taxes, motor vehicle fees, 
and savings from staff reductions and debt refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the adjustments will result in a loss of $523,572 in net 
revenues out of a $65-million budget for the present fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, Oxnard will receive $1.8 million less in property 
taxes for the present fiscal year than previously forecast. Slower than 
expected development in Oxnard also will result in a $340,000 decrease in 
planning fees. Because of the slowed activity, the council will consider 
eliminating three vacant inspector positions for an estimated savings of 
$125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While the slow economy is blamed for the drop in revenues, a change in state 
law governing utility companies led to the unexpected payment of $818,808 by 
Southern California Edison for gas shipments in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment was ordered by the Legislature last year to replace the loss of 
local government franchise fees when the state Public Utilities Commission 
terminated the "targeted sales program" for local utilities. The council will 
review the midyear budget revisions at its Tuesday meeting, which begins at 
1:30 p.m. PATRICK McCARTNEY

BOY, 15, ATTACKED OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old Oxnard boy was attacked by a shotgun-wielding assailant as he 
was sitting in a parked car outside a Ventura club early Sunday, Ventura police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, was inside a friend's car 
outside Club Deja Vu, 6635 Ventura Blvd., about 12:45 a.m. Sunday when a man 
drove up and got out of his car carrying a shotgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man confronted the boy, who attempted to flee, then pointed the weapon to 
the boy's head and hit him with the barrel of the shotgun, causing minor 
injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the assailant fired the weapon, striking the hood of a nearby 
vehicle, and fled in an unidentified automobile, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the suspect as a brown-haired man in his 20s, about 5 feet, 
10 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 No one besides the boy was injured in the incident, which is still under 
investigation, police said. JEFF McDONALD

VALLEY-AREA DIGEST: TOP-SEEDED CLU SCHEDULED TO OPEN ON ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran will enter the NCAA Division III men's basketball playoffs as the 
West region's top-seeded team, but the Kingsmen are scheduled to play on the 
road in a second-round game Saturday after a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division III selection committee announced Sunday that Cal Lutheran (24-2) 
would play at the winner of Thursday's Pomona-Pitzer-UC San Diego game in the 
second round, but Kingsmen Coach Mike Dunlap was appealing that decision Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed, but it's not a dead issue yet," Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran was expected to play host to a second-round game, but the size of 
the court (smaller than the standard 94 x 50 feet) and the small seating 
capacity (800) at Cal Lutheran's gymnasium did not meet the NCAA's 
specifications for a playoff site. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College was available as a substitute court, but it could be 
guaranteed only for an afternoon game as Moorpark could be playing host to a 
Southern California regional basketball final that night if the Raiders defeat 
Southwestern on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division III playoff committee believed it was unfair for the 
Pomona-Pitzer-UC San Diego winner to have to play Saturday afternoon after 
playing its first-round game Thursday night so they determined that the winner 
of that game will play host to Cal Lutheran at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap proposed that the site be changed to Occidental College, which played 
host to Saturday's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
playoff game between Cal Lutheran and Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not optimistic, but that's what we're proposing," Dunlap said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My big complaint is that the NCAA did not give us a window of opportunity to 
select a different site. If the site we chose was going to be a problem, they 
should have given us until a certain time to come up with an alternate site." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran will be favored wherever the game is played. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen defeated UC San Diego, 100-79, at home earlier this season and 
they split the regular-season series with Pomona-Pitzer before winning the 
SCIAC playoff game, 83-62. JOHN ORTEGA

QUAKE MAY GIVE SCHOOLS CHANCE TO UPGRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before last month's earthquake, students at Audubon Middle School in the 
Crenshaw area read 12-year-old textbooks beneath brown-stained ceilings. 
Classrooms at Rosemont Avenue Elementary had not been painted in decades. 
Lawrence Middle School students used computers so outmoded they are no longer 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 But with state and federal quake relief, these and other Los Angeles schools 
will be able to paint and replace aging materials. It is an unlikely benefit 
from the quake for the Los Angeles Unified School District, where nothing gets 
fixed or upgraded unless it poses a significant health or safety risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sort of serendipity thing," said Richard Morley, assistant principal 
at the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, a magnet school in the Mid-City 
area. "It was unfortunate the quake happened but the equipment that will be 
replaced will be superior." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with promises of an infusion of cash from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and the state, hopeful school officials are surveying 
campuses to determine the necessary repairs and the supplies that need 
replacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from paper and crayons to re-plumbing bathrooms and replastering 
auditoriums will be included on their wish lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal rules require that damage be quake-related and not just the wear and 
tear from years of use. But the school district intends to argue for a liberal 
definition of quake damage, hoping to repair its aging infrastructure and make 
campuses safer for the next earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials will contend that it is fiscally sound to paint a whole 
classroom, not just the single wall that has cracks, and to replace aging 
equipment even if it is repairable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it really worth the money to repair gas lines and boilers when they are 
already 30 or 40 years old?" asked Margaret Scholl, director of the district's 
maintenance and operations division. "If we have to paint a classroom wall, why 
do we have to match it with 40-year-old paint? These are serious questions 
we're raising with FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 Although FEMA policy requires the agency only to repair facilities to their 
pre-disaster conditions, FEMA officials say they will use good fiscal sense. If 
it is cheaper to replace an aging pipe rather than repair it, the agency would 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress didn't tell me to come here and be stingy," said Leland Wilson, a 
FEMA special assistant. "I was told to come out here and pay the money to make 
earthquake repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions will be made case by case, he said. "We wouldn't want them to paint 
a pink wall in a classroom that has yellow walls," Wilson said. "It's just how 
far do you go in trying to make everything look nice again." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials said they are concerned whether a years-long inattention to 
maintenance led to more severe quake problems at schools. If inspectors find 
that schools were badly damaged because of a lack of routine maintenance, FEMA 
officials say they will issue a warning to the district that future earthquake 
damage will not be reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district, with a $3.9-billion annual budget, has a $600-million 
maintenance backlog on the books. During budget cuts over the last several 
years, the maintenance division was slashed by a third -- leaving 500 fewer 
positions and ending routine maintenance to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district stopped painting classrooms about six years ago and paints school 
exteriors only every 20 years. Maintenance workers make only those repairs 
needed to ensure the health and safety of employees and students. Leaky pipes 
are fixed, but playground cracks are rarely filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had 1,600 maintenance workers in 1986. Teams of electricians, 
plumbers and carpenters spent a week at each school every year, fixing broken 
lights, unclogging water fountains and repairing window blinds, among other 
things. The district had 14 trailers for tools and equipment that the workers 
parked on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also had specialists in furniture refinishing and repair of 
window blinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the district has sold the trailers. Schools rely on parents and 
community support to paint classrooms and spruce up campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a preventive maintenance program; we have a breakdown 
maintenance program," said Doug Brown, the district's facilities director. "If 
ceiling tiles never present a safety or health hazard, they're never going to 
be fixed or painted." 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake represents an opportunity, several school officials 
acknowledged. Many schools finally will get modern texts that reflect the 
latest educational trends, including more literature and culturally sensitive 
narratives. Apple computers, most of which were donated, will be replaced with 
newer models that reflect technological advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, which reopened Feb. 22 in temporary 
classrooms, needs to replace $1.5 million in such materials. It is likely to 
get science equipment, such as scales, that now are computerized and new charts 
and maps that are more up-to-date -- showing recent changes in Eastern Europe 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers across the city are eager to replace old books -- some of which have 
gone through 15 generations of students -- and other materials. They are 
dismayed that it took a disaster to spur the district into buying the latest 
materials and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain irony in that it takes an earthquake to improve the schools 
that have been so cash-starved for so long," said Gregg Solkovits, a teacher 
and union representative at Monroe High School in North Hills, where thousands 
of books were lost to water damage. "We will be getting some needed repairs and 
needed materials as a result of a disaster. It's a pity it took an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, teachers and school principals say even a fresh coat of paint or 
sparkling, white ceiling tiles will go a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 The deep cracks in the classroom walls at Audubon in the Crenshaw area are 
being repaired and textbooks have been ordered. "We have sparkling ceilings 
already," said David Balok, assistant principal at Audubon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a new coat of paint or a new ceiling will improve people's feelings, we'll 
take it," Balok said, adding that the school lost about $8,000 in teaching 
materials. "It's too bad it has to take a disaster. . . but sometimes through a 
disaster comes benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake-damaged walls at Rosemont Elementary in the Echo Park area will be 
replastered and painted to repair the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ever remember these walls being painted," said Rosemont Principal 
Wayne Langham. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials estimate that about $5.5 million will be needed for new 
teaching materials, including computers and textbooks. Officials are figuring 
out the total damage estimate, but preliminary reports show that it could range 
from $300 million to $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, FEMA has agreed to reimburse the state for 90% of the 
earthquake damage and the state would be responsible for 10%. Gov. Pete Wilson 
has indicated that the school district might have to pay part of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 District lobbyists say they are working on a variety of levels to ensure that 
the cash-strapped district does not have to pay out of its funds. About 10,000 
classrooms suffered damage, ranging from fallen ceiling tiles to shattered 
windows and broken cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education members say the district needs to be completely reimbursed 
for repairs because of its tight budget. And, they say, the schools should reap 
some benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a lighter side to this disaster, it's that the schools will be in 
better shape," board member Julie Korenstein said. "But schools were in such 
bad shape before the earthquake that it will take a lot (of money)." 
</P>
<P>
 The district also is attempting to get money from FEMA to replace lights, 
ceiling tiles and lunch shelters, among other things, at schools that did not 
suffer quake damage. By upgrading those campuses, future earthquake damage 
could be minimized, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to replace things across the district, like metal-frame doors that 
jammed and lights that came crashing down on desks and window screens that 
couldn't be opened," said Brown, the facilities director. "We need to bring our 
facilities up to code." 
</P>
<P>
 To the administrators, teachers and students, the quake's benefits will not go 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the equipment we lost -- when it was purchased -- was state of the 
art," said Morley, of the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. "But that 
was 10 or 15 years ago. Now we'll have higher quality equipment that could 
improve education."

EXTREMISTS PAY TRIBUTE TO KILLER OF 48 AT FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several hundred extremist Jews gathered here with their automatic rifles, 
their anti-Arab slogans and their deep anger Sunday to eulogize Baruch 
Goldstein as a righteous hero for slaying 48 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque 
two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 While the massacre continued to trigger street clashes across Israel, and to 
bring strong condemnation from Jews and Arabs alike, the funeral of the 
Brooklyn-born doctor responsible for the latest Mideast crisis became a 
rallying point Sunday for right-wing Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "The act itself was one of greatness. It was a great act of sanctifying the 
Name (God)," said Noam Federman, a spokesman for Kach, the relatively small 
extremist group that counted Goldstein among its members. "And me, a little 
man, compared to him, the great, can't condemn it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Yaacov Perrin, in paying homage to Goldstein, told mourners that even 1 
million Arabs "are not worth a Jewish fingernail." And angry voices in the 
congregation shouted, "We are all Goldsteins!" and "Arabs out of Israel!" 
</P>
<P>
 The extremists defended Goldstein's actions on religious grounds, setting off 
a wave of religious self-examination by shocked rabbis and other Israeli 
leaders Sunday. Leading rabbis rejected the suggestion that killing 
Palestinians with an automatic rifle was, as some claimed, part of a mission, 
sanctioned by Scripture, to destroy the descendants of the Israeli nation's 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ashamed that a Jew did this," said Eliahu Bashki-Doron, one of two chief 
rabbis in Israel. "And it hurts to see that he did this as a religious man. A 
religious man has to account for his acts." 
</P>
<P>
 After the eulogies in Jerusalem, a white ambulance, with the blue Star of 
David on the front, carried Goldstein's coffin slowly through the winding, 
rain-swept streets. The atmosphere was surreal, with some mourners wearing 
traditional black suits and hats covered with plastic to protect them from the 
rain -- and others decked in clown suits, gorilla outfits and colorful masks, 
as part of the celebration of Purim. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was transported under army escort along a 25-mile stretch of road 
south through the occupied territories, passing Palestinian shops in the West 
Bank that had closed for three days to mourn Goldstein's victims and 
Palestinian cars from which black flags fluttered. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kiryat Arba, Goldstein's home, where 7,000 Jewish settlers live next door 
to Hebron and its 65,000 Palestinians, he was buried by several hundred 
mourners after dark. No violent incidents were reported, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Goldstein said the body would later be moved to the old Jewish 
cemetery in Hebron, near the Cave of the Patriarchs, where the 38-year-old 
father of four opened fire on the kneeling Palestinians during morning prayers 
Friday and was subsequently beaten to death by survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Extremists represent only a fraction of the 130,000 Jews who live among 1.2 
million Palestinians in the West Bank. Yet, as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
admitted Sunday, "they are the focus of friction." 
</P>
<P>
 But the extremists also reflect a wider anger among settlers, many of whom 
strongly oppose the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and believe that the 
Israeli government has lost its will to protect them against Arab attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Few places have seen greater friction between Jewish settlers and Palestinians 
than Hebron, where Jews' and Muslims' rival claims to the Holy Land converge. 
Nearly 4,000 years ago, Abraham, founder of the Jewish religion, paid 400 
shekels of silver for a plot of land there to bury his family. King Herod built 
a synagogue on Abraham's tomb in AD 60 and, 650 years after that, Arab Muslims 
turned the majestic stones into a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Muslims and Jews regard themselves as sons of Abraham. And the Cave of 
the Patriarchs is today shared by both. Israel took possession of Hebron in 
1967, nearly 40 years after 67 Jews were killed there in Palestinian riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, Jewish families settled there, first on the hills outside of 
town and later in a small enclave a few hundred yards from the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been a traditional center of activity for the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, known as Hamas, as well as right-wing Jewish groups. And it was the 
killing of two of Goldstein's friends in December, apparently by Palestinian 
guerrillas, that triggered his rampage last Friday, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, many Jews in Kiryat Arba were deeply saddened by the massacre, 
which refueled anti-Jewish feelings and threats of bloody reprisals. A young 
man stood outside Goldstein's home on Sunday, holding a sign denouncing the 
killer as "a man with a twisted goal." 
</P>
<P>
 And residents said Goldstein and the Kach movement, whose leaders were being 
sought Sunday by the authorities, do not represent the majority of Jews there.

 Hagai Stein, a teen-ager in the Jewish settlement, told state television 
Sunday night that the massacre "doesn't suit a Jew. It's written that 'Thou 
shalt not kill' -- and that means thou shalt not kill."

BOMB KILLS 9, INJURES 60 AT CHURCH IN LEBANON; TERROR: CATHOLIC WORSHIPERS WERE 
TAKING COMMUNION IN BEIRUT SUBURB. NO ONE CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY.

<P>
 A bomb exploded in a packed Maronite Catholic church on Sunday, killing nine 
worshipers and wounding at least 60 as they lined up in front of the altar to 
take Communion, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses at the Our Lady of Salvation church in this suburb north of 
Beirut stared petrified as the bomb tore icons from the walls, splintered pews 
and ripped apart Bibles and prayer books. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors screamed at the sight of blood running on the church's marble 
floors. Worshipers' umbrellas, shoes and handbags lay scattered as Lebanese Red 
Cross volunteers rushed to administer first aid to the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dead was a 4-year-old girl. The priest celebrating the Mass, Father 
Antoine Sfeir, was among the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese security forces found an even bigger bomb planted in the church organ 
and dismantled it. One witness saw the forces carry away four old artillery 
shells bound together with a detonator. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene of carnage was carried live on Lebanese TV within minutes of the 
explosion, adding to the shock felt across the city. Even in the worst days of 
Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, places of worship were rarely targeted by the 
country's rival militias. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon's Cabinet called an emergency meeting Sunday night as investigators 
worked to establish a motive and identify the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but some government officials 
speculated that the bombing could be linked to an upcoming visit by Pope John 
Paul II or to a lone gunman's massacre of 48 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque 
early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon's Muslim Prime Minister Rafik Hariri went to the church after Sunday's 
bombing and said it was carried out by "foreign hands" to "cover up" the 
massacre in Hebron. A similar charge was made by Foreign Minister Faris Bouez, 
a Maronite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a coincidence that whenever Israel finds itself isolated . . . it 
resorts to such harsh actions," Information Minister Michel Samaha said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Samaha also entertained the possibility that the blast was aimed at 
foiling the Pope's scheduled visit to Lebanon in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be aimed against the Pope's visit, and we hope that it was not 
carried out by those who were against this visit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Muslim fundamentalist groups and clerics have expressed reservations 
about the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope, speaking in St. Peter's Square, denounced the bombing, telling 
pilgrims and tourists that he was suffering together with Maronite Christians 
over what he called "a crime that offends Lebanon and its noble traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton called the attack "an outrage against faith 
and humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as Friday's massacre in a Hebron mosque was aimed at the peace process, 
this bomb attack seems clearly aimed at Lebanon's reconciliation process," he 
said. "The people of the Middle East deserve a peaceful future. They deserve 
the right to pray in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The Our Lady of Salvation church is unaffiliated with any Christian political 
figure, and no Christian dignitaries were attending Sunday's service. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian fears of violence have run high since the Dec. 20 bombing of the 
headquarters of the Falangist Party, Lebanon's largest Maronite political 
organization. No suspects were apprehended in the crime, which killed three and 
wounded 130. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's 1 million Maronites, Lebanon's largest Christian sect, dominated 
the country's political scene since its 1943 independence from France. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, however, considered the main losers in the 1989 Arab League-brokered 
peace treaty that ended the country's civil war by redistributing power among 
the sects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's visit will be a major challenge for the Lebanese government, whose 
ability to guarantee security has been in question since the blast at Falangist 
headquarters and since the still-unsolved assassination of a Jordanian diplomat 
in Beirut on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing is also a setback for Hariri's government, which desperately needs 
stability to attract investment from foreigners and Lebanese expatriates for 
its reconstruction plans.

ZEALOTS' DREAM FALTERS IN WHITES-ONLY S. AFRICA TOWN; RACISM: BASTION OF 
INTOLERANCE SEES ITSELF AS MODEL. BUT GLIMPSE OF FUTURE DISAPPOINTS SOME 
SEPARATISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Their living room furniture was still parked in the driveway, but Chris and 
Ina Smit stopped unpacking one sunny day last week to cheerfully explain just 
why they had decided to become the newest residents of one of this country's 
strangest towns. 
</P>
<P>
 God had appeared to him in a vision, Smit said. "I only saw his backside. He 
spoke to me in a telepathic way. . . . And he told us to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than his strict Calvinist faith, Smit shares one other crucial belief 
with the 350 other whites in Orania: virulent racism. Only whites may live or 
work in this 3-year-old community, a bastion of intolerance that considers 
itself a model for a racially pure Afrikaner homeland in the post-apartheid 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-described pioneers probably would be called zealots and misfits 
anywhere else. But Orania is in South Africa's spotlight as right-wing 
separatists increasingly threaten to sabotage the country's first all-race 
elections unless they are allowed to secede and create an independent state for 
whites. Many say Orania should be the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the neo-Nazis, neo-fascists and other militants in the far 
right can't agree on the borders of their proposed volkstaat , or people's 
state. Or that polls show few whites would move there anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 And never mind that dozens of grim-faced, khaki-clad whites -- many sporting 
Nazi-like insignia and waving guns -- marched through several rural towns last 
week and declared them part of the volkstaat. Despite the demonstrators' 
bellicose bluster, the towns did not secede. 
</P>
<P>
 Orania is different. In 1991, a Pretoria newspaper advertised a "town for 
sale." It was deep in the rocky Karroo badlands, more than 600 miles away to 
the southwest -- about 150 prefabricated homes, plus churches, shops and 
schools, all built for engineers and workers who had constructed nearby dams 
and canals. The nearest neighbor was 25 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Carel Boshoff, a professor and former missionary, decided Orania could be the 
nucleus of a volkstaat. All he had to do was persuade whites to move to one of 
the country's most desolate, thinly populated areas. He and 30 other Afrikaners 
pooled their money and bought the tumbledown, tumbleweed town for $567,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they owned it, they could make the rules. The first was revolutionary: To 
keep blacks out, whites would have to do all the work, sweeping streets, 
cleaning toilets and toiling in the hot sun in a land where manual labor always 
was reserved for poorly paid blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started this town as an example, an experiment to demonstrate to the 
Afrikaner that he can do his own work," explained Boshoff's wife, Anna. "That 
sounds hilarious in Europe or the U.S. But it's new here. In South Africa, when 
an Afrikaner says, 'I'm going to do something on my own,' he's talking about 
himself and 20 black people." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Boshoff is the daughter of South Africa's most infamous prime minister, 
Hendrik F. Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid who was stabbed to death in 
Parliament in 1966. At least 15 members of Verwoerd's family have settled here, 
including his 92-year-old widow, Betsie. 
</P>
<P>
 Frail and white-haired, Orania's oldest resident sat primly beneath an oil 
portrait of her late husband in her living room. She defended his dream of 
apartheid, the legalized segregation of the races enforced by a web of 
repressive laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "His policy of apartheid is the only way of solving our problems today," 
Betsie Verwoerd insisted. An Afrikaner homeland, she added, is "consistent with 
my husband's ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others say a white homeland is necessary if the country's 3 million 
Afrikaners, descendants of 17th-Century, mostly Dutch settlers, are to preserve 
their conservative culture, religion and language against what they fear is 
inevitable revenge from blacks once they take power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see no future for us in the new South Africa," said Danie van Rensburg, 
69, a retired civil servant who is one of the town's founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial homelands are not new, of course. Verwoerd created black homelands, 
usually in the poorest areas, to separate the races. And his son, Hendrik Jr., 
tried to create an Afrikaner commune in Morgenzon, about 100 miles southeast of 
Johannesburg, in the 1970s. It collapsed when his followers hired so many black 
laborers that a slum township was spawned. 
</P>
<P>
 Both President Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress leader 
Nelson Mandela have insisted that they will not dismember the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But both men recently agreed to establish a parliamentary panel after the 
election to consider allowing a volkstaat as long as other races have equal 
rights there. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Afrikaners are a fractious lot, and many of those who moved to Orania 
hoping to glimpse the future have been disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tiny population, the town is bitterly divided, with three 
competing schools for only 90 pupils and at least seven churches and sects that 
differ on such thorny theological issues as whether blacks have souls and go to 
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 There is open class conflict between middle-class whites who live on a hill, 
complete with tennis courts and pool, and lower-class whites who do most of the 
work. Most of the latter have been forced into flimsy, tin-roofed homes built 
in a gully subject to floods. There are few jobs, and many families have left. 
</P>
<P>
 To a visitor, Orania seems a mix of Norman Rockwell and Norman Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid out on tree-shaded streets, every home has a neat flower garden, some 
with red roses draped over picket fences. Telephones are cranked by hand, and 
the whole town shares one operator and six party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Another town's bank sends a teller each Wednesday afternoon. No liquor is 
sold. And the deserted streets are so safe that newspapers are delivered 
door-to-door by a 5-year-old barefoot boy and his 3-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Community standards are strict. The town council, elected by the 80 property 
owners, recently told three unwed couples they were living in sin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council said this is not right," said Rensburg, deputy head of the 
council. "It is not biblical. Please. Become married or try to find another 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Two couples married, he said, and the other left. 
</P>
<P>
 Other standards are harder to understand. The only American resident, for 
example, Los Angeles native Tim Vaughan, said he was arrested in California for 
beating his young son. A judge sent him to a psychologist for counseling, but 
Vaughan had had enough of America's ways. He emigrated instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't even give your child a hiding there anymore," the 33-year-old 
father of five complained. His pregnant wife, Brenda, looked on silently as he 
spoke in their living room. Three toddlers, barefoot and in filthy T-shirts and 
shorts, sat silently as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-rearing techniques of the huge, red-bearded American were never an 
issue in Orania. He's a respected member of the town, active in the church and 
right-wing causes and hopes to gain his South African citizenship this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem arose when word got out that Brenda Vaughan is 3/16th Cherokee 
Indian. She was nearly run out of town -- until "I threatened to beat a few 
people up and it died down," her husband explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bitterness remains. "This was supposed to be a pure white homeland," 
complained carefully coiffed Desire Adendorff, her face flashing with anger, as 
she served lasagna at the whites-only guest house. "Now we're going to have all 
these half-breeds running around." 
</P>
<P>
 Many here insist they are not racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not racist in the sense we have nothing against blacks," said Nico van 
der Berg, 38, a jeweler who now runs the small supermarket. "We want them to 
have every right that we have. But we want them to have it separately. We want 
to determine our own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less circumspect. Frederik Christoffer, 39, for example, is a big, 
burly, black-bearded man with an easy laugh and a "Born to Die" tattoo on one 
of his hamlike legs. As the setting sun bathed his garden in a golden glow, he 
poured glasses of sweet dessert wine and talked of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 A construction contractor, Christoffer and his family had lived in a home 
owned by a mining company in the Eastern Transvaal. Then, suddenly, they and 46 
other families were evicted so the company could give the houses to black mine 
workers. Soon after, he lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they put white people in there, I could understand it," he said bitterly. 
"But to kick whites out just for the blacks, that was unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Warming to the topic and the alcohol, he suddenly launched into a racist 
screed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like animals," he ranted. "You can't live with a black as a neighbor. 
Never. Never. Never in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are all white," he added. "All white. That's the important thing."

U.S. TRADES IN ON ITS KNOW-HOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fears of an impending U.S.-Japanese trade war obscure it, and worrisome 
reports about America's global trade gap may make it hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the increasingly important arena of services -- from finance to 
electronic data to health care to tourism -- the United States enjoys a 
growing, multibillion-dollar trade surplus with Japan and the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. edge, which could exceed $50 billion when 1993 statistics are 
released next month, dramatically improves the picture of America's trade 
performance at a time when attention is fixed on frustrations with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it highlights U.S. strength in knowledge-intensive fields that are 
increasingly rewarded in the global marketplace and at the heart of continuing 
trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about the trade deficit, but it's like having your left shoe on 
and not your right shoe on" when they omit services, said Margaret S. 
Wigglesworth, executive director of the Coalition of Service Industries in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the dramatic numbers, the Commerce Department announced that 
starting next month, it will include services in its monthly trade summary for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a danger that somebody's going to come along and say that the reason 
we're doing this is to make the trade numbers look better," said Larry Moran, a 
research economist at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real reason for overhauling the widely followed monthly trade report, 
he said, is "to give a better look at our competitiveness in today's world -- 
which includes both goods and services." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States ran a $100-billion trade deficit in goods for the first nine 
months of 1993, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That means 
Americans bought $100 billion more in goods from other countries than they sold 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 But toss in the U.S. $43.2-billion services surplus for the same period and 
the picture is altered markedly: the $100-billion gap narrows to $56.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan alone accounted for $43 billion of the U.S. deficit in goods traded in 
that period, but U.S. service industries managed to tote up a $9.5-billion 
surplus with Japan despite ongoing disputes about insurance, banking and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese "perceive the quality of our services more highly than they 
perceive the quality of our products," said Richard King, an international 
trade adviser in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While the statistics are quirky -- a European visitor's hotel bill in San 
Diego counts as a U.S. export -- they nonetheless tell a story: "Lo and behold 
-- yes, we're competitive," said Patrick T. Harker, director of a center on the 
service sector at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
 That competitive standing comes at a price. Firms in communications, 
insurance, banking and finance have dominated this year's layoff announcements 
as corporate America continues to slash costs in a quest for greater 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our airlines fly more people per employee," Harker said. "Our financial 
institutions have more accounts per employee than other institutions around the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, international trade frictions centered on things that come 
packed in crates and boxes, such as factory products and farm commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 But changes in the global economy have pushed the service sector -- often 
derided as the dreary world of hamburger flippers and minimum-wage cashiers -- 
into the international spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. demands that Japan open up its insurance market -- the world's second 
largest -- to American firms helped torpedo recent U.S.-Japanese trade talks 
and sparked fears of a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 * Late last year, much-ballyhooed international negotiations in Geneva almost 
ground to a halt when France insisted on restricting imports of U.S. movies and 
television programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 117 nations involved in those talks also failed to agree on rules for 
financial services, an area of strong U.S. competitiveness. Future talks will 
cover expanding global issues in financial services, telecommunications, 
maritime services and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a global game -- no question about it," said Isaac Shapiro, 
international coordinator at the New York-based Skadden, Arps law firm, which 
has opened up 12 foreign offices since 1987, when the firm expanded into Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 But protectionist barriers continue to complicate the game, even as services 
trade expands. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, for instance, does not allow foreign law firms to register in the 
country under their official name (the managing partner's name is used) or 
appear in court. Rules even limit the display of firm names on office doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign law firms cannot even hire Japanese attorneys to do the local legal 
work that is off-limits to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, those firms vie for much narrower opportunities, such as advising 
Japanese clients on overseas business investments and financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring restriction "is our principal competitive disadvantage in Japan," 
Shapiro said during a telephone interview from his firm's office in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 But many business executives and economists say they view such barriers as 
temporary headaches on a path that is leading toward expanded opportunities 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the U.S. 1992 global services surplus of $56 billion reflects the 
country's popularity with well-heeled foreign tourists. The money they dole out 
for hotel rooms, airline tickets, meals and assorted amusements is counted as a 
U.S. export -- and added up to more than a third of the nation's overall 
surplus, government figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, tuition paid by foreign students in U.S. colleges is reflected as a 
U.S. export. Education exports soared from $3.8 billion in 1987 to $6.1 billion 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in other cases, U.S. know-how is the precious commodity for sale overseas, 
offered by U.S. investment banks, advertising agencies, architects, software 
writers, consultants and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports of computer and data-processing services rocketed from $649 million to 
more than $2 billion from 1987 to 1992. Engineering, architecture and 
construction tell a similar tale. Overall, U.S. service exports soared 84% in 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go to Japan for health care. We don't go to Japan for education," 
Wigglesworth said. "The U.S. service sector is the most productive and 
competitive in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts forecast that Japan's purchase of U.S. services will continue to 
grow in a variety of areas once that nation emerges from a painful recession. 
The U.S. services surplus with Japan jumped almost fourfold between 1987 and 
1992, to $12.6 billion from $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to find American health care management companies . . . moving 
in to own and manage hospitals," predicted King, whose firm specializes in 
advising Asian and U.S. firms doing business overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Another promising area, he said, is entertainment technology. Los 
Angeles-based firms are already participating in such emerging fields as 
virtual reality, a world of illusion created with the help of computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising importance of services is not universally hailed. Many economists 
argue that manufacturing is more valuable to an economy than services because 
it fuels more job creation, including such services as transportation, retail, 
finance and design. 
</P>
<P>
 But other economists say they believe that a globally competitive service 
sector should ultimately spawn many new job opportunities as today's 
cost-cutting mania subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Engineering, consulting, Americans designing buildings in other countries -- 
you're selling people's labor," said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw 
Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Services suffer from a bad rap, argued Harker, who directs the 
Fishman-Davidson Center for the Study of the Service Sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Research suggests that service-sector wages are just a few cents-an-hour below 
those in manufacturing, he said, if the vast retail sector is left out of the 
calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is skilled jobs and unskilled jobs," he said. "Whether they're 
service or manufacturing really doesn't matter. How many poorly paid bankers do 
you know?"

COLUMN ONE; CHASING THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE; AFTER YOU HAVE HELPED CRACK THE CODE 
FOR DNA, WHAT'S NEXT? AT 77, FRANCIS CRICK -- SCIENTIFIC FREE SPIRIT -- SAYS HE 
IS ON TO SOMETHING EVEN BIGGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who discovered the secret of life is having his makeup done. He 
tolerates it with good humor, like the proper British gentleman that he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Harry Compton Crick smoothes his wispy white locks as the television 
makeup artist brushes his face with peach-colored powder, evening the tone of 
his perpetually ruddy cheeks. "The thing that I have to watch," he says, 
recalling an earlier admonition from his wife, Odile, "is that my tie is 
straight, and that this side of my hair doesn't stick out. My wife cuts my 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a rare step into the spotlight for Crick, one of the world's most 
renowned, most publicity-shy -- and most free-spirited -- scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of life, by the way, is DNA. Forty-one years ago, Crick and James 
Watson cracked the code for this mysterious molecule of heredity. Their story 
is a scientific legend: Two young men -- Crick, then 36, and Watson, a mere 24 
-- made the most significant contribution to biology since Darwin's theory of 
evolution and earned a Nobel Prize. All with an article just 900 words long. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery that DNA is built like a double helix was nothing short of 
revolutionary. It has filtered into every aspect of modern life, spawning an 
entire industry (biotechnology) and prompting raging ethical debates about the 
perils of genetic tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA is ubiquitous. It is in the courts, where DNA "fingerprints" can set the 
innocent free. It is in the supermarket, where designer tomatoes are for sale. 
It is in the operating room, where doctors insert healthy genes into sick 
people. It is in the bedroom, where couples scrutinize their genetic histories 
in deciding whether to have a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, at age 77, the adventuresome scientist who helped bring about this 
revolution is off on another jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Crick's journey takes him to the realm of neuroscience, where he is 
attempting to piece together a puzzle far more complicated than DNA: the 
workings of the human brain. (He has already tried to tackle the origin of life 
on Earth and the meaning of dreams.) In a field where most scientists are 
knee-deep in the minutiae of this receptor or that neuron, Crick is the 
big-picture guy, seeking to answer the unanswerable: What is the root of human 
consciousness? 
</P>
<P>
 And so what if he wanders off into philosophy and religion, or if some of his 
ideas are a bit wacky? 
</P>
<P>
 He's Crick. He can say what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Crick is doing more talking than usual, which accounts for the 
rare TV appearance. After four decades of refusing to grant interviews, he is 
reluctantly on a media tour -- a handful of 90-minute chats with America's top 
publications and a few public television interviews (hardly Oprah or Geraldo) 
to promote his new book. In it, he attempts to do for the study of the brain 
what the double helix did for DNA -- lay out a basic theory that those who come 
after him may prove. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not escaped his notice that, at his age, he may not live long enough to 
find out whether he is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, of course I have asked myself that question," he confesses in his 
impeccable accent, over a room service lunch at the Century Plaza Hotel. "It 
may turn out that one is looking at it quite from the wrong point of view, and 
everybody will say, 'Poor chap, when he went into a new field, he couldn't do 
it again.' " A Full-Time Thinker 
</P>
<P>
 As a research professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La 
Jolla, Crick is not a typical scientist in that he does not maintain a "wet 
lab" -- meaning he does not do experiments. Nor has he ever been a full-time 
university professor, with the exception of a short stint at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Crick is a theoretician. What he does is think. 
</P>
<P>
 "He invites people to stay with him a week, a month or sometimes several 
months," said Christof Koch, a Caltech neuroscientist and Crick's collaborator 
for seven years. "And then there's this very intensive period where you talk 
with him all day and evening and then you go out and socialize and talk about 
science. It's a very unique working style." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a style that only someone of Crick's stature could get away with. 
And whether his theories prove correct seems to matter less to him than that 
they are thought-provoking, and that he has fun dreaming them up. Once, a 
colleague of Crick's asked his wife whether he works a lot. "No," she replied. 
"I don't think he works a lot. But he thinks a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Crick does not see anything extraordinary in what he does. "I don't think it's 
anything particularly virtuous on my part, it's just that I have reached an age 
where I can do what I like. Not all scientists can." Besides, he added, doing 
experiments is "more expensive than just sitting and thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Such self-deprecating repartee is a hallmark of any conversation with Crick. 
His blue eyes, shielded by unruly white eyebrows, dance as he speaks, revealing 
more than a hint of mischief. He seems to enjoy amusing himself, both at work 
and at home. He drives a white Mercedes with the license plate ATCG -- the 
initials of the four chemical base pairs that compose the structure of DNA. It 
tickles him when the garage mechanics get the joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a real charm . . . He's sexy," said his longtime secretary, Maria 
Lang. "I mean, he has this energy, a magnetism." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this energy that prompts often reticent scientists to share their 
thoughts and findings with Crick, which serves him well as he cruises the 
cerebral landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Crick performs an unusual function in neuroscience. David Hubel, a Harvard 
University neurobiologist who has his own Nobel Prize, describes him as "kind 
of a clearinghouse for ideas." He picks the brains of the nation's top minds 
and, in his own brilliant way, synthesizes their ideas into novel theories of 
his own. "He has very good taste in the people that he picks out to talk to," 
Hubel said. "People are always delighted to talk to Francis." 
</P>
<P>
 In the ordinarily cautious world of science, where nothing is accepted as true 
until experiments have proved it so, Crick does not hesitate to go out on a 
limb. "He's got a very free-ranging mind," said neuroscientist Bill Newsome of 
Stanford University, "and he's not afraid to talk about what's on his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hubel, a bit more bluntly: "Sometimes his ideas seem to be off the wall, 
and other times his ideas are terrific." Astonishing Hypotheses 
</P>
<P>
 Off the wall or not, people listen. 
</P>
<P>
 About a decade ago, Crick joined those trying to debunk the classic Freudian 
theory that dreams have a deep psychological meaning. Dreams, he suggested, 
have little significance at all. Rather, he argued, they play the role of 
mental housecleaner, reorganizing the brain in the middle of the night so that 
the memory can store information more efficiently. The theory has not been 
proved, but nonetheless it made news -- if only because Crick proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Crick weighed in with his version of the origin of life. He and a 
colleague at the Salk Institute wrote a book proposing that life began when 
microorganisms from another planet were dropped here from a spaceship sent to 
Earth by a higher civilization. They called this theory "directed panspermia"; 
panspermia means "seeds everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I would like to write a book about the origin of life," Crick said. 
"Most people think it's something spiritual. No! It's much worse than that! 
It's chemical! Most people, you must have noticed, hate chemistry. So you have 
to find some way of discussing what is basically a chemical problem without 
burdening them with the chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 The result was directed panspermia -- a far-out notion Crick says he is not 
wedded to. But the book, "Life Itself," was a kick to write, a fun adventure 
with just enough scientific footing -- and Crick as its author -- to get it 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a theory," he said. "People seemed to think that I was a fanatical 
believer. . . . There was a lot of reaction to the idea from people who didn't 
actually read the book who think that I must have gone a bit soft in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Crick's current book is a tad less far-fetched, though it is creating ripples 
just the same. It is called "The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search 
for the Soul." (He picked the name; it's kind of catchy, if he does say so 
himself.) If the cover is any indication of the relative importance of topic 
and author, Crick's name is at the top, in much bigger print than the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Astonishing Hypothesis," Crick writes, "is that 'You,' your joys and your 
sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and 
free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve 
cells and their associated molecules. As Lewis Carroll's Alice might have 
phrased it: 'You're nothing but a pack of neurons.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have suggested that the hypothesis is not really all that astonishing 
-- at least not to neuroscientists, who generally accept it as true. Crick 
agrees, but says he wants to convince the public that brain chemistry -- as 
opposed to some intangible divine spark from God -- is responsible for human 
thought, character and free will. 
</P>
<P>
 So he uses the book to take potshots at two of his favorite targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophers have had such a poor record over the last 2,000 years that they 
would do better to show a certain modesty rather than the lofty superiority 
that they usually display," Crick writes. "The record of religious beliefs in 
explaining scientific phenomena has been so poor in the past that there is 
little reason to believe that the conventional religions will do much better in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Skewering philosophy and religion in a book that is supposed to be about the 
study of the brain might be awkward for other scientists. But Crick pulls it 
off, and incorporates the nitty-gritty of science to boot. Crick and Koch -- to 
whom the book is dedicated -- believe that vision is a logical starting point 
for studying the brain. The latter part of the book is devoted to experiments 
that Crick says might help researchers learn more about the way neurons 
interact to create sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most colleagues give Crick high marks for doing his homework, some 
see him as sort of an odd duck outsider whose work is of little relevance to 
what goes on in the lab. In the tight-knit fraternity of science, of course, 
this is not openly admitted -- not, at least, for publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard-core laboratory people have a tendency to think, 'Here's an old man who 
was bored with molecular biology and tried to do another big stunt in 
neuroscience and it really didn't work out,' " said Franz Hefti, a USC 
professor who is also director of neuroscience at Genentech, a biotechnology 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," Hefti added quickly, "that would not be my opinion. I think 
neuroscience has a need for strong thinkers. Is running to the lab each morning 
and working on some tiny protein in the brain really making a contribution to 
our understanding of human consciousness?" The Road Less Traveled 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Crick faces the dilemma that every Nobel laureate must face: What 
do you do after you've done it all? It is a problem made all the more 
burdensome by the fame, at least within scientific circles, that the Nobel 
brings. As Andre Lwoff, who won the 1965 Nobel Prize for medicine, once 
lamented: "We have gone from zero to the condition of movie stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Different people respond in different ways. The names Watson and Crick are as 
intertwined in molecular biology as Laurel and Hardy are in comedy. But the two 
could not have chosen more different post-Nobel paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson wrote a book, "The Double Helix" -- a breezy, insider's account of the 
race to beat out famed chemist Linus Pauling in decoding DNA. It was an instant 
bestseller, but it was published over Crick's protestations; he thought it a 
tad unseemly, and not scholarly enough to be published by the Harvard 
University Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was as much about scientific pursuits as it was about the personal 
adventures of this odd couple -- Watson, an American with an appetite for 
tennis, champagne and ogling young women, and Crick, a charming (and married) 
conversationalist who spent World War II doing the mundane work of developing 
torpedoes for the Royal Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 And few could forget Watson's famous opening line: "I have never seen Francis 
Crick in a modest mood." (Says Crick now: "I think, apart from this curious 
opening sentence, I come out rather well in the book. I think he had the wrong 
word. I think he wanted to say 'in a lively mood.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 Watson remained in molecular biology, although he is no longer a working 
scientist. For more than a quarter-century, he has directed the respected Cold 
Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island. And as the first director of the Human 
Genome project, an ambitious effort to map the entire genetic blueprint of the 
human body, he was smack in the center of the DNA revolution. He is now on 
sabbatical in England, writing his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Crick, meanwhile, has watched from the sidelines as genetic research exploded. 
As a result of his and Watson's work, scientists are pinpointing genes for new 
diseases with such alacrity that they joke about the "gene of the week." Yet 
the man who some have called "the grandfather of molecular biology" says he 
does not regret leaving it all behind -- even as others capitalized on his 
discovery, striking it rich in biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he does not consider himself wealthy, Crick and his wife of 44 years 
travel often, and have two homes -- one in La Jolla and another in Borrego 
Springs. It is a long way from Crick's starving student days, when they shared 
a tiny flat next door to a pawnbroker. "When things got tough financially," he 
said, "we used to go and pawn the typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing Crick never wanted to be was a celebrity. He is not. For many, 
his name is but a fuzzy memory from some high school biology class. Some might 
say this is a function of American society, of a culture that puts actors and 
sports stars -- not scientists -- on the covers of its magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also a function of Crick himself. For 41 years he has gone to 
extraordinary lengths to keep himself out of the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, requests for Crick's time and attention have been uniformly declined 
with polite note cards. "Dr. Crick thanks you for your letter but regrets that 
he is unable to accept your kind invitation to . . . ," the cards announce, 
followed by a checklist with the appropriate item marked off: send an 
autograph, provide a photograph, cure your disease, be interviewed, talk on the 
radio, appear on TV, etc. Crick's secretary says keeping reporters away has 
been her most important job in the 17 years she has worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not accept honorary degrees -- not even from Cambridge, which had 
hoped to fete Crick and Watson last year, upon the 40th anniversary of their 
famous discovery. Watson went. Crick stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 He did make one exception to his no-awards rule, when the Queen of England 
bestowed on him the Order of Merit -- an accolade one notch above knighthood 
and one below lordship. But that, he said, was only because his wife and his 
secretary insisted he not pass up a chance to meet the Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus those who are close to Crick were, to borrow a word from the scientist 
himself, astonished that he agreed to do the book tour. The publicist says it 
has been a bit of a disaster: ice and snow cutting interviews short on the East 
Coast, an earthquake in California commanding reporters' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter to Crick. He is having a grand time. Today's science journalists, he 
said, are smarter and far more interesting to talk to than those of the 1950s. 
And the East Coast was so cold he mostly stayed in his hotel, reading and 
writing instead of rushing about. Wonderfully restful. As to whether he is 
selling any books, he has not the foggiest idea. 
</P>
<P>
 He is looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet back in La Jolla, to a 
return to his garden and his daily swim. But 41 years after he earned a page in 
the history books, Francis Crick says he is finally getting used to the idea 
that people recognize his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they will recognize it 41 years from now, for his contributions to 
neuroscience, is another matter. It is the one big question that does not seem 
to weigh on the mind of the man who discovered the secret of life. A Brief

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON AS 'REAGANESQUE'? JUST ASK THE REPUBLICANS; PRESIDENCY: 
GOP INSIDERS SEE PREDECESSOR'S 'TEFLON' COAT AND UPBEAT OUTLOOK. BUT SOME SAY 
HE TESTS LIMITS.

<P>
 They still call him "Slick Willie" and seldom miss an opportunity to criticize 
his policies or attack his personal character. Yet to their own surprise and 
frustration, some of Bill Clinton's Republican critics are applying another 
label to the President these days: 
</P>
<P>
 They say he is "Reaganesque." 
</P>
<P>
 What they mean is not that Clinton has adopted former President Ronald 
Reagan's conservative ideology but that he has the "Great Communicator's" 
seeming ability to defy political gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a drumbeat of controversy over his private conduct, the President has 
risen markedly in the public opinion polls. And, despite outspoken 
congressional opposition from Democrats as well as Republicans to key proposals 
such as health care reform, Clinton's foes no longer discount his capacity for 
an effective counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lesser politician," said Republican pollster Richard B. Wirthlin, would 
have "crashed and burned a long time ago." Wirthlin, a close adviser to Reagan 
while he was President, says that while he disagrees with Clinton on most major 
issues, he is "a superb politician." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's standing in the polls can be attributed partly to a rebounding 
economy. Also, many Americans who viewed him as a loser after his early 
setbacks in Congress have begun to change their mind following his successful 
uphill fights for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Brady 
gun-control law. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some Republicans, as well as Clinton's own aides, attribute a large 
part of his political resilience to his personal style and skills. The former 
Arkansas governor has projected himself as an activist President who tackles 
major problems no matter how controversial. He has also been quick to exploit 
issues that start to zoom high on the public's agenda -- whether they are 
traditionally associated with Democrats or with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, for example, Clinton has irritated some liberals and stirred 
indignation among conservatives by championing the "three strikes and you're 
out" proposal for convicted felons and other hard-line measures that were once 
the almost-exclusive property of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 He also maintains an optimistic attitude in public, even in the face of 
setbacks, mistakes and negative news stories. Americans tend to find that a 
likable quality in a President, political strategists agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael K. Deaver, Reagan's chief image-maker, used to say he didn't worry 
about negative news "if I could just get Reagan's smiling face on television." 
Deaver says Clinton "has the same kind of appeal -- normally with a smile on 
his face and an attitude of enthusiasm about what he's doing. And that goes a 
long way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyn Nofziger, a GOP political consultant who was also a top aide to Reagan, 
rates Clinton as "damn good" at making speeches and says he is a better 
explainer than Reagan. "He's like down-home folks, and he's always talking in 
terms of helping people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reagan was always pretty self-deprecating, which people appreciated, but 
Clinton's every bit as good, and he's smoother at kidding himself without it 
appearing contrived." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some Republicans -- and some Democrats -- see Clinton's political 
skills in a less flattering light. In this view, he uses his persuasive manner 
and personal charm not just to advance his programs but to manipulate and 
deceive. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP Chairman Haley Barbour calls Clinton "very bright, a good talker and 
tremendous performer," but he adds that "the people in Arkansas gave him the 
name 'Slick Willie' because he's very nimble, agile, in getting a conversation 
back to what he wants to talk about -- and what he says often has nothing in 
common with what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Most recent polls show Clinton with relatively strong approval ratings, 
somewhere above 50%, although much of his support is soft. Wirthlin's current 
surveys show about one-third of the electorate passionately dislikes Clinton 
and another third strongly backs him. In Wirthlin's polls, the President wins a 
58% overall approval rating by gaining the conditional support of most of those 
who are somewhere in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The softness of his support among these swing voters could become a serious 
problem for Clinton. He is heading into some of the biggest policy fights of 
his presidency, including efforts to overhaul both the health care and welfare 
systems. Next fall's congressional elections will inevitably be read as a 
referendum on his performance. And he faces all this with at least two question 
marks hanging over his head: 
</P>
<P>
 Character: The recurrent allegations of Clinton's extramarital sexual exploits 
do not fit easily with traditional ideals of what a President should be. 
Moreover, Clinton's apparent impulse to try to talk his way out of difficult 
situations, to equivocate and be less than fully candid when he feels 
pressured, could yet erode public confidence in his trustworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater: The Arkansas real estate deal involving the First Family remains a 
serious distraction and could become very damaging if the special counsel 
investigating the matter turns up legal or ethical violations. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, a majority of voters apparently have not construed these issues as 
indicative of Clinton's fundamental character. Concerned about the economy and 
their own futures -- and predisposed to think well of their President -- they 
have taken him as he presents himself: An imperfect but well-meaning leader who 
is determined to confront long-festering national problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But that assessment is far from secure, in part because of the intensity of 
his opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not since the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration has a President 
stirred such personal animosity. Other political leaders have been subjected to 
far greater indignities and personal ridicule -- most recently Vice President 
Dan Quayle. But Clinton, like Roosevelt, stirs a degree of sustained outrage 
among some opponents that amounts to contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Democratic Party Chairman Robert S. Strauss, who served as President 
George Bush's ambassador to the former Soviet republics, said in a recent 
interview: "I was a young man during Roosevelt's time, but I can tell you 
Clinton's political detractors dislike him with even more intensity than they 
disliked Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say he doesn't deserve the presidency. The hatred has a moralistic and 
militaristic dimension. And they can't stand for him to succeed. When he pulled 
off the Saudi plane sale, it drove his enemies crazy. They said, 'The son of a 
bitch ought to be a salesman, that's all he can do.' They terribly resent his 
wife being involved in the Administration, and they direct a lot of venom and 
fire at her." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, these foes have sought to capitalize on Clinton's avoidance of 
military service during the Vietnam War and the allegations of extramarital 
affairs to brand him as an untrustworthy womanizer and a draft-dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most tireless of Clinton's pursuers is Little Rock lawyer Cliff 
Jackson, a former classmate of Clinton's at Oxford University. Jackson was 
instrumental in bringing forward the Arkansas state troopers who charged that 
Clinton, while governor, used them to arrange and cover up affairs with several 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson says his crusade is driven by what he sees as Clinton's "casual 
willingness to deceive, to exploit and to manipulate in order to obtain 
personal and political power." Clinton, Jackson has said, "is very, very good 
at appearing sincere" but has "a drive to power unsurpassed by any individual 
I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) is another Clinton foe who argues that 
the President's political skills are in service to a deeply flawed character. 
Radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh and the conservative magazine American 
Spectator also have made Clinton-bashing a staple of their offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the President, in an interview broadcast Friday night on PBS' 
"Washington Week in Review," said: "There is not one single shred of evidence 
that anybody here has tried to abuse the authority of the presidency, tried to 
use it for personal gain -- not me, not any of my top aides. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no scandals in this Administration. And I was governor for 12 
years -- not a hint of scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Clinton tends to slough off the personal attacks as part of what he 
calls today's "highly competitive political environment." He compares himself 
to a TV cartoon character, saying: "I'm a lot like Baby Huey . . . if you push 
me down, I keep coming back. I just keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), who is credited with coining the phrase 
"Teflon President" to describe Reagan because negative news seldom stuck to 
him, likens Clinton and his top White House aides -- most of them also quite 
young -- to the "Energizer bunny" in the TV commercials for batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just pound, pound, pound, and keep right on going," she said. "You can 
say a lot about this President, but you can't say he's lazy." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Schroeder and other Democratic supporters of Clinton say they worry 
that in his hyperactive mode he "flirts with danger." At times, they say, he 
may be too flippant and impulsive in discussing his own personal conduct and 
raising subjects that could tarnish his image. 
</P>
<P>
 They cite the recent incident when he regaled assembly line workers at a 
Shreveport, La., General Motors plant with reminiscences about the pickup he 
drove as a youth. Clinton said he covered the truck's metal bed with Astroturf, 
adding: "You don't want to know why, but I did." He later told disbelieving 
radio talk-show host Don Imus that he put the Astroturf down to protect his 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have done without the Astroturf talk. He ain't paid to be funny. But 
it does show that while he can be as intellectual as anyone; he still can talk 
to Bubba or Joe Sixpack," a senior aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, after hearing Clinton on the Imus show, Nofziger said: "I was 
impressed as hell with the guy. He came across as a very likable guy who 
doesn't appear to be too impressed with himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Others see a greater potential for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, says Doug Bailey, a veteran Republican political strategist, "is like 
the moth and the candle. He gets as close as he can to the flame. But he's got 
energy and commitment and is an incredible salesman, and in that sense he's 
Reaganesque. The passion is certainly there. But the way he likes to get close 
to the flame, God knows what might happen down the road."

ISRAEL WILL DETAIN EXTREMIST JEWISH LEADERS, SEIZE ARMS; MIDEAST: IN REACTION 
TO THE MASSACRE OF PALESTINIANS AT HEBRON, CABINET ORDERS SECURITY MEASURES 
SIMILAR TO THOSE USED AGAINST PALESTINIANS. ARAFAT CALLS THE ACTIONS 'HOLLOW 
AND SUPERFICIAL.'

<P>
 The Israeli government, shocked by last week's massacre of 48 Palestinians by 
an Israeli settler, Sunday ordered the detention of extremist Jewish leaders in 
the occupied West Bank and the confiscation of their followers' weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In actions unprecedented since Israel captured the West Bank in 1967, the 
Cabinet directed military commanders to apply to "radical elements among 
Israeli residents" of the region many of the same Draconian security measures 
that have been used against Palestinians there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have taken these decisions knowing our responsibilities under 
international law and under our own laws for the well-being of all residents of 
the territory," Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared, saying the army would 
arrest and hold in preventive detention those believed to be a threat to 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat dismissed the moves 
as "hollow and superficial." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are empty decisions which have no relation with the seriousness of the 
crime or with the basis of resolving it," said Arafat, who was in Tunis, 
Tunisia, to meet with Palestinian negotiators and determine the conditions 
under which the PLO would return to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. State Department praised the Israeli Cabinet's actions, calling 
them "an important step toward assuring the security of Palestinians and in 
preventing the recurrence of such horrific acts of violence in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet's decision, made after a heated debate, permits military 
commanders to bar Israelis from the West Bank or to restrict their activities 
there. The ministers also called for "the disarmament of specific individuals" 
among the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Cabinet ordered a state inquiry into the massacre. And it 
directed Atty. Gen. Michael Ben Yair to lay the legal groundwork for the 
outright banning of Kach, an extremist movement that seeks to drive all Arabs 
from the biblical land of Israel, and similar groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Baruch Goldstein, the settler who carried out the massacre at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs in Hebron on Friday, was a prominent member of Kach, an Israeli 
offshoot of the Jewish Defense League founded in the United States by the late 
Rabbi Meir Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet decisions constitute "a fundamental shift, a real turning point" 
in the government's relationship with the settler movement, according to a 
senior official who was present. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a conviction that these people, and not just the most wild-eyed 
among the settlers, can bring disaster down upon the whole Jewish nation if 
they go too far, and the government must act decisively, here and now, to 
control things," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The detention of the extremists, the restrictions on their supporters, the 
disarming of some of them and probably the banning of the most radical groups 
-- all this is very strong symbolism for Israelis. It is the loss of legitimacy 
for the settlers, and probably the beginning of the end of the settlement 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, the military commander of the West Bank, immediately 
ordered the detention without trial of five leaders of the Kach movement for 
three months. The national Itim news agency said two of the Kach activists were 
already detained. Two of the three who remained at large appeared on national 
television to mock the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 more activists from Kach and its allied groups will be served with 
restriction orders, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we know he did it on his own," Rabin said of Goldstein, who was 
beaten to death by worshipers who survived his fusillade during early morning 
prayers at the Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron on Friday. "But I am ashamed about 
others who came up and publicly supported his act. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Goldstein tried not only to kill innocent Palestinians while they were 
praying in a holy place," Rabin added, "but he joined Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
(Palestinian radicals) in their common purpose of killing the peace 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to quell the Arab anger over the Hebron massacre, the Cabinet 
moved up by 10 days the release of 800 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were 
to be freed in a traditional goodwill gesture marking the end of the Muslim 
holy month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a former general who had called for 
tough measures to curb settler violence, said that extremists had to be 
prevented from using "their own brand of terrorism" to undermine peace talks 
with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is determined to reinforce and to speed the peace 
negotiations, and hopefully this will happen this week," Ben-Eliezer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has invited Israel and the PLO to Washington this week to 
resume negotiations on Israeli withdrawal from Jericho in the West Bank and 
from the Gaza Strip. But the PLO has indicated the talks may be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hebron massacre also had repercussions for the broader Mideast peace 
process, as negotiators from Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, acting in solidarity 
with the PLO, on Sunday withdrew their negotiators from separate talks with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli President Ezer Weizman, paying his condolences in Hebron on Sunday, 
appealed to Palestinian leaders there not to allow the desire for revenge to 
overtake efforts to implement a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should, all Arabs and Israelis, show enough wisdom to control the 
situation and go forward to a better life," Weizman told Hebron's elders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some ministers from the leftist Meretz Party wanted to go even 
further in the crackdown on Kach and similar groups, Rabin rejected demands for 
removing Israeli settlers entirely from Hebron, Kiryat Arba and other 
Palestinian population centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea was that a series of decisions were taken that will allow . . 
. the security forces and the legal authorities to do whatever is needed to 
achieve security for both Jewish and Arab people in the territories," Industry 
Minister Micha Harish said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, the leading 
settlers group, criticized the government decisions as "punishing Israeli 
citizens without a trial" and putting some settlers at greater risk in the West 
Bank and Gaza by confiscating their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain and sorrow caused by Friday's attack do not warrant the endangering 
of the lives of all the Jewish residents due to the actions of one man," the 
group said. "Making people more vulnerable is no way to calm the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud Party, supported the 
crackdown on the extremists. "They should be dealt with swiftly and very, very 
harshly," he said, adding that "the overwhelming majority of settlers have 
acted very responsibly" in the face of terrorist attacks against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. for Civil Rights in Israel, the country's leading human rights 
group, said the government had a duty to deter terrorism but described 
preventive detention as "a particularly severe measure" and urged that lesser 
measures, such as house arrest, be used where possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent protests continued Sunday through much of the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
and spread further within Israel. Four Palestinians were reported killed in 
clashes with troops, and an Israeli Arab was shot dead by police during rioting 
in the town of Rahat. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hebron, about 2,000 Palestinians tried to enter the mosque where the 
massacre occurred, but were turned back by troops. The Cabinet ordered the 
mosque and the synagogue at the Cave of the Patriarchs closed until new 
security measures are worked out.

FUGITIVE MEXICAN OFFICIAL FIGHTING EXTRADITION; CRIME: FERNANDO HERNANDEZ, 
CHARGED IN $3-MILLION EMBEZZLEMENT, SPENT FIVE YEARS UNDETECTED IN CHULA VISTA. 
HE RAN AFOUL OF THE INS IN A VISA SCAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 During almost five years on the run, a fugitive Mexican official accused of 
embezzling more than $3 million lived comfortably in a suburban house guarded 
by security cameras a few miles north of the border, according to federal 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Fernando Rodolfo Hernandez Martinez stumbled, authorities say. He applied 
for a special clergy visa to legalize his status, one of dozens of applicants 
who posed as ministers in an immigration scam broken up by investigators this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only were they not working on Sundays, they were not men and women of the 
cloth," said Rudy Murillo, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Baja California state prosecutors want to extradite Hernandez, 55, on 
charges of engaging in a massive land fraud while he was manager of a state-run 
resort development. The INS is trying to deport him. The former official has 
asked for political asylum on the grounds of government persecution in Mexico, 
a claim that Baja officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a charge pending since 1989," said Gabriel Rosas Guzman, a 
spokesman for Baja Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel. "The criminal case will proceed 
like any other." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Hernandez's arrest this month, his lawyer said the charges were 
false. The lawyer, George Siddell, has declined further comment. Hernandez will 
go before a U.S. immigration judge for a hearing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The case represents one strand of a web of scandal that brought down former 
Baja Gov. Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera of Mexico's dominant Revolutionary 
Institutional Party in 1989. Allegations of rampant corruption and incompetence 
forced Levya's resignation, helping to bring about the historic election that 
year of Ruffo, the first governor from the opposition National Action Party. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent investigation by Baja California authorities targeted Hernandez 
and more than 20 other Leyva administration officials, including several who 
reportedly fled across the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican authorities alleged that as manager of San Antonio Del Mar, a 
state-run coastal development south of Tijuana, Hernandez sold properties to 
politically prominent cronies at undervalued prices and pocketed more than $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez owns a jewelry store and real estate in the San Diego area, 
authorities said, and he told investigators that he owns restaurants in 
Tijuana. He used a legal border-crossing card to enter the United States, 
Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez lived in Chula Vista during much of the past five years and crossed 
back and forth into Baja occasionally despite his fugitive status, according to 
Jeff Casey, a U.S. Customs Service official. Customs conducted a brief 
investigation, but it was closed because too much time has passed to trace the 
embezzled funds, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
 INS agents ran across Hernandez's name recently while investigating a scam in 
which a Pentecostal minister charged at least 82 illegal immigrants up to 
$4,000 apiece. The applicants posed as assistant pastors of a small barrio 
church to obtain special expedited visas granted to foreign clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that Hernandez was wanted in Mexico, agents arrested him Feb. 10 at 
a house registered to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got out there and the house had security cameras. We sensed immediately a 
lot of security," Murillo said. "But he did come to the door. He was pretty 
talkative and forthright." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez admitted paying $4,000 for the bogus visa application and asked for 
political asylum, Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans in the United States rarely gain asylum, which is granted in cases of 
fear of persecution based on political affiliation or other grounds. Hernandez 
will be deported if his petition is denied.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; GOP SINGS IN HARMONY FOR A CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the last night of their state party convention, and the Republicans 
were playing Joe Friday's song. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary from two days of relentless democratizing, hundreds of men and women 
gathered at a "Dragnet Revival" gala to toast their favorite crime-fighters, 
Gov. Pete Wilson and Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 The familiar four-note opening of the theme song -- dum, da-dum-dum -- blared 
from two huge speakers. A series of oversized wanted posters showed the faces 
and aliases of some high-profile Democratic would-be governors: "Clemency 
Kathleen" Brown, "Johnny Come Lately" Garamendi and "Anti-Vietnam Tom" Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson nodded toward the mock mug shots. "Why do they call them 'wanted 
posters'?" he asked his adoring audience. "Who the hell wants them? " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Grand Old Party-ers who took over this bayside hotel had little 
use for Democrats. This bunch stood relatively united against what many called 
the "socialist" policies of President Clinton. And Wilson, who at one past 
convention had been tarred and feathered in effigy, was the prime beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more bullish on Wilson's prospects than at the beginning of the weekend," 
said Joe Gelman, a state party official from Los Angeles County, as the 
convention wound up Sunday. And he wasn't the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign aides, who appeared almost giddy with optimism, said Wilson 
got a morale boost out of the three-day convention, where the governor's 
reelection effort was framed as an important step toward the GOP winning back 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to rebuild a Republican base in California if we ever want to elect 
a Republican president again," said U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), a probable 
contender for Clinton's job in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm didn't waste his chance to chat up the faithful in the state with the 
most electoral votes. He has a knack for skewering the opposition, and 
Clinton's health care plan was his chief shish kebab. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he compared it to a runaway freight train. "We have to blow up this 
train, the trestle it's on and kill everybody in it," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he invoked Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference between Elvis and the President's health care plan," 
Gramm said. "Elvis may still be alive out there. The President's health care 
plan is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of Presley, the musical performers who were the talk of the 
convention were a best-selling rap group called Too Short. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelist, Sacramento Assemblyman and former sheriff's deputy Larry Bowler told 
a panel discussion entitled "The Culture of Violence" that too much of popular 
culture incites "sexual deviancy, violence and a pro-dope lifestyle." He 
lambasted MTV's cartoon "Beavis and Butt-head" and called Rep. Maxine Waters 
(D-Los Angeles), a supporter of rap artists, a "co-conspirator in the 
distribution of smut." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he whipped out the lyrics to "Cuss Words," by Too Short, and began to 
read aloud. The verse included references to former First Lady Nancy Reagan and 
a sexual act that was once widely illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of several hundred sat in stunned silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to face this stuff," Bowler explained later. "Nancy Reagan is a lady 
of dignity and poise. I thought it would go over well with this crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan Revolution was popular inside the convention meeting rooms and out. 
In the hotel lobby, vendors sold T-shirts that said: "Stop the Liberal Media 
Lynch Mob! Tell the Truth about the Reagan Legacy!" 
</P>
<P>
 Their goods also offered glimpses of various futures: buttons and bumper 
stickers touting likely or merely hoped-for presidential candidates: Baker, 
Bennett, Buchanan, Cheney, Dole, Dornan, Gramm, Kemp, Hatch, Limbaugh, Wilson 
and, yes, Nixon. But the hottest item, according to vendor Mary Stanley, was 
the pin promoting the presidential prospects of the former chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm selling more Powell than anything else -- I guess it's wishful thinking," 
said Stanley, who also sold buttons that said, "Lorena Bobbitt for Surgeon 
General" and "Packwood for President: How Does that Grab You?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Artigo, a volunteer and 27-year-old college student who served in the 
Persian Gulf, wore Powell on his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a man of impeccable character who has the leadership skills . . . we're 
gonna need to get us out of this hole," Artigo said. And what if Powell, whose 
party affiliation remains a well-guarded secret, turns out to be a Democrat? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be hard-pressed not to vote for him," Artigo said. "But somebody like him 
will only go into public life if the people draft him. And the Republicans are 
the ones to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The question of who was and who was not a bona fide Republican came up again 
and again, and more than a few candidates found themselves under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 It started the first night, when William E. Dannemeyer, running for U.S. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein's seat, tried to paint Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara), the man he faces in the primary, as a liberal in conservative's 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 John G. Morris, who is seeking the Republican nomination for state controller, 
was the target of a resolution entitled, "Asking John Morris to Stop 
Contributing to Democrats." The resolution, which noted that Morris had given 
small sums to Democrats' campaigns, was tabled in committee -- but not before 
Steve Frank, a Simi Valley party activist, spoke up: "The Republican Party and 
its candidates are indeed Republicans. Don't give money to Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 The party did amend its by-laws to prohibit the California Teachers Assn. from 
taking part in any state GOP convention until at least 40% of the union's 
political contributions go to Republican candidates. (Mike Arata, author of the 
resolution, claimed that although 42% of the CTA's membership is Republican, 
the group gives 13 times more money to Democrats.) 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the bitter attack on the political consulting firm of 
Robert Nelson, who served as national director of Republicans for Clinton. In 
one resolution, Nelson and his colleagues were metaphorically strung up as 
traitors, "political soldiers of fortune" who had sold out their party in order 
to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a slimeball," said one party member who supported the proposal to deny 
Nelson's firm even a penny of future Republican campaign business. 
</P>
<P>
 Another GOP comrade was more practical. "If we're going to attack everyone who 
works in the political consulting business for being driven by dollars," he 
said, "we won't have anyone to help us in our campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution failed. But by convention's end, many delegates wore buttons 
that said "RINO" -- Republicans In Name Only -- with a slash through it.

FUMES AGAIN SICKEN PEOPLE TREATING EMERGENCY PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an incident reminiscent of a baffling Riverside case, doctors and nurses 
treating an emergency room patient here became dizzy and had difficulty 
breathing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency room of Mercy Hospital was evacuated and decontaminated Saturday 
night by firefighters wearing protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics brought a 44-year-old woman to the hospital with breathing problems 
and a low pulse rate, hospital spokesman Barry Ginsbarg said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After medical personnel inserted a breathing tube, they noticed strong fumes 
that appeared to come from the patient, Ginsbarg said. Doctors and nurses 
complained of headaches, nausea and burning eyes from the fumes, which had a 
chemical odor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient was conscious but in critical condition Sunday, and in isolation, 
Ginsbarg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsbarg said hospital officials do not know whether the odor came from the 
woman, and they have not been able to determine the nature of her illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical workers' symptoms subsided quickly, except in the case of one worker 
with asthma, Ginsbarg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has some similarities to that of Gloria Ramirez, 31, who died Feb. 19 
in the emergency room of Riverside General Hospital. Seven doctors and nurses 
were hospitalized after breathing fumes that appeared to come from her blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Two remain hospitalized. Dr. Julie Gorchynski was in fair condition Sunday in 
the intensive care unit of Loma Linda University Medical Center, eight days 
after the incident. Nurse Sally Balderas was in good condition at Parkview 
Community Hospital Center, an official said.

GOP PINS '94 HOPES ON CRIME ISSUE; POLITICS: STATE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION CLOSES 
IN HOPE THAT ANTI-CRIME SENTIMENT WILL REELECT GOV. PETE WILSON. PARTY WANTS TO 
BREAK DEMOCRATS' GRIP ON SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California Republicans concluded an unusually harmonious convention Sunday, 
united by hopes of using the crime issue to reelect Gov. Pete Wilson and of 
breaking the Democrats' 23-year lock on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The 668 delegates wrapped up their business by shouting approval of a 
resolution applauding Wilson's "tireless effort to bring order and justice to 
our streets" and accusing Democrats of getting tough on crime only after it 
became a hot campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats "are stumbling over each other trying to reposition themselves as 
tough on crime," Tirso del Junco of Los Angeles, the state party chairman, said 
in an address to delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi are trying to pump up their liberal, 
soft-on-crime images," said Del Junco, referring to the two major Democrats 
competing for the right to challenge Wilson this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Junco said the crime issue was instrumental in Republicans winning six of 
seven special legislative elections during 1993. Those victories have helped 
boost GOP hopes for rebounding from a 1992 election debacle in which Democrats 
took both U.S. Senate seats as well as California's electoral votes for 
president for the first time since 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working together, searching for those things that unite us rather than those 
that divide us, catapulted us back to victory in 1993," Del Junco said. "These 
same ideas will bring us success this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's next opportunity comes April 12, when longtime state Senate leader 
David A. Roberti of Van Nuys faces a recall election. The campaign was forced 
by a coalition called Citizens Against Corruption and financed primarily by gun 
owner groups angered by the Democrat's sponsorship of a law banning the sale of 
assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 The party formally supported Roberti's recall in a resolution adopted Sunday 
that claimed that his stance on gun control "is nothing more than a smoke 
screen to hide his opposition to California's death penalty and its support of 
the ACLU's criminal-coddling policies." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Democratic Party promptly responded in a statement issued by 
Chairman Bill Press, who said the GOP had allowed itself "to be taken over by 
right-wing gun zealots." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the Republican Party to take sides with a band of yahoos that advocate 
the right to own military-style assault weapons isn't just irresponsible 
partisan politics," Press said. "It's political arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 A separate GOP resolution declared that the right to bear arms "supersedes the 
power and authority of any government." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans spoke out Sunday on a variety of other issues, with a resolution 
on abortion sparking some controversy because it supports the principle of "the 
fundamental individual right to life for the unborn." Some delegates protested 
the wording because it did not provide for a mother's rights if she risked 
death in childbirth. An attempt to amend the measure failed. 
</P>
<P>
 But being tough on crime and criminals was the overriding theme throughout the 
three-day-long meeting at a hotel near San Francisco International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In his keynote address Saturday, Wilson chided Democrats for being slow to 
react on issues such as the death penalty, drive-by shootings, victims' rights 
and mandatory life prison terms for three-time felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson asked rhetorically: "When we were fighting to protect the state's 
corrections budget and keep dangerous criminals behind bars, where were they? 
</P>
<P>
 "To lead the war on crime, you've at least got to be on the battlefield," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the GOP has an unprecedented opportunity to elect more Republicans 
in 1994. In particular, he held out hopes for seizing control of the 40-member 
state Senate for the first time since 1971. The GOP can do this by holding all 
its seats at stake this year, and by winning five of the 14 Democratic Senate 
seats up for grabs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor was less optimistic about winning a majority of the 80 seats in 
the Assembly, saying only that 1994 offers the chance of giving "more support" 
to Assembly GOP Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. Democrats increased 
their margin in the Assembly in 1992 in spite of a realignment of legislative 
districts that was considered more favorable to Republicans. The Democrats' 
current edge is 46 to 33 with one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP also faces a formidable task in achieving domination of statewide 
offices. Republicans hold only two of the seven partisan posts: Wilson as 
governor and Dan Lungren as attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats will not have the advantage of incumbency as they did in 1990. 
No Democrats are seeking reelection to posts they hold. Lt. Gov. Leo T. 
McCarthy is retiring, Controller Gray Davis is running for lieutenant governor, 
former Secretary of State March Fong Eu resigned to accept an ambassadorial 
appointment, and Treasurer Brown and Insurance Commissioner Garamendi are 
giving up those jobs to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The other statewide post, superintendent of public instruction, is officially 
nonpartisan.

STATE STREET GETS A MORE POLISHED LOOK; SANTA BARBARA: SEISMIC RETROFITTING LAW 
FORCES SOME MERCHANTS TO RELOCATE OR GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE 
CITY'S MAIN COMMERCIAL AVENUE IS LOSING SOME OF ITS SMALL-TOWN FLAVOR.

<P>
 After 75 years of doing business here, Diedrich Auto Parts is moving out of 
its graceful, arching building on State Street and leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a town for the newly wed and nearly dead," store owner John Diedrich 
said, quoting a local aphorism. "Rents are too high and it's not a town for my 
kind of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich's exit and other departures by dozens of businesses on this coastal 
town's main commercial street have been prompted by the city's efforts to 
strengthen about 250 unreinforced masonry buildings before the next big 
earthquake strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgrading effort, along with other recent upheavals and disasters, is 
changing State Street's character, giving it a more polished look -- but at the 
cost of losing some of its small-town flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last seven years, the mix of businesses along State Street has been 
reshuffled and refined. Many of the longtime mom-and-pop shops and diners have 
closed or left town. In their places stand department stores, national chain 
outlets and tonier, more specialized retailers and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're seeing is a face lift," said Steve Cushman, director of the 
Downtown Organization, a group of lower State Street merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent round of musical stores was inspired by state legislation 
passed in 1986 that required all cities to deal with unreinforced masonry 
buildings. It led to Santa Barbara's 4-year-old ordinance, which requires 
owners of unreinforced structures to either obtain a permit to retrofit their 
buildings or tear them down by July, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about half of the building owners have improved their properties while 
reinforcing them, said Charles Evans, the city's program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the sound of hammers and drills rings along this retail row. 
Dust, dirt and 2-by-4s clog the sidewalks. Confusion reigns as patrons search 
for favorite businesses that have left town, moved or just temporarily closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to meet someone here," said Ray Briare, who stood befuddled 
one afternoon in front of Chase's Bar and Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's seismic safety program is projected to cost about $50 million. 
Because it comes on the heels of a string of man-made messes and natural 
disasters, some residents say the timing could not be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sequence of events here has been unbelievable," Cushman said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Street has been in turmoil for the last several years. In 1987, the 
local redevelopment agency bought and relocated businesses to make room for the 
city's first downtown mall. The next year, construction began on downtown 
parking garages. At the same time, the lower part of the street was torn up and 
renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1989, work started on the $150-million, three-story Paseo Nuevo mall, 
which now houses Nordstrom, the Broadway and other national chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Other disruptions were not man-made. During this period, an eight-year drought 
parched this tourist town of 80,000 people and forced businesses to ration 
water. In 1990 -- while the drought was in full force -- the city suffered its 
worst fire in history. The Painted Cave fire raged for four days and destroyed 
$500 million in homes and businesses, some of which are still being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Caltrans crews had removed the mid-town signals along U.S. 101, 
closed portions of State Street, and forced many businesses to move. (The 
freeway project was completed in the summer of 1992, after four years and $60 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after seven years of nonstop hammering, comes the seismic program. A 1925 
earthquake had razed this town's commercial district, but many landlords denied 
that it could happen again, Evans said. And many landlords, stuck in a down 
economy, were reluctant to pay for the safety project. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, the Northridge earthquake jolted people here into reality. Frank 
Breckenridge, a building official for Santa Barbara County, said: "There was no 
sense of urgency or drama until people actually saw others dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's seismic program is designed to save lives, not buildings. In a 
typical retrofit, walls and ceilings are bolstered to install steel columns. 
Cement anchors, or grade beams, are laid beneath floors. Walls are bolted to 
floors and ceilings, forming a sturdy box. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to help buildings stand long enough so people can exit safely 
during an earthquake. "All we're doing is buying a few minutes to save lives," 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 The steep expense of retrofitting has driven out some businesses. It can cost 
between $15 and $40 a square foot, and that does not include lost income during 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Phinney operated Ruby's Cafe for eight years before he closed last year. 
"The building owner would have raised my rent $800 a month to cover his costs," 
Phinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other landlords cannot secure bank financing for the work. With the real 
estate slump, commercial property values have fallen as much as 20%. "Many 
owners are over-leveraged," Cushman said. 
</P>
<P>
 To assist them, the city organized a bond issue in which 25 building owners 
with $10.7 million in retrofit costs participated. Pledging their properties as 
collateral, the landlords agreed to pay down the bonds in biannual payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider this a last-ditch resort for people who have no other resource," 
said John Bridley, city redevelopment director. The bonds are considered liens 
against the property and precede other debts. 
</P>
<P>
 But 17 months into the program, the largest participant in the pool fell 
behind on payments. The owners had used $5.4 million in bond proceeds to 
fortify a $16.5-million building, Bridley said. Now, the city is foreclosing on 
the historic El Paseo shopping and office complex, which is more than 200 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobero Theatre has fared better. As a state and city historical landmark, 
the Spanish Colonial Revival style theater was designed in 1924 by architect 
George Washington Smith. The cost to upgrade the theater was $3 million -- all 
of which was donated by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bank loan was not an option for us, and as a nonprofit we don't have the 
excess revenue to pay off bond debt," said Nancy Moore, executive director of 
the theater's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is working on reinforcing the building, the foundation will modernize 
the theater's lighting, sound and technical features. "The improvements bring 
the project to life for donors," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these improvements, some pundits claim that Santa Barbara will have 
a more polished face once the debris is swept away. Already, pubs are replacing 
pawn shops and clothiers are moving into hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Diedrich's Auto Parts. He is leaving the 4,000-square-foot building and 
will concentrate on his stores in Santa Paula, Oxnard and Ventura. "It's kind 
of a shame to see some of the old-time businesses go, but what are you going to 
do?" a resigned Diedrich asked. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother-in-law, contractor Dan Modisette, will retrofit the building. Come 
April 1, a local clothing manufacturer, Territory Ahead, will move its flagship 
store into the space. Modisette said he will increase the rent 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's a financial burden to upgrade the buildings, it's a time of 
renewal," he said. "The new look should help the entire neighborhood."

FREED YELTSIN FOES SIGNAL FUTURE TUMULT; RUSSIA: AMNESTY GAVE OPPOSITION MORAL 
VICTORY, ANALYSTS SAY. THEY SEE PRESIDENT WEAKENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just hours after President Boris N. Yeltsin's worst political foes got out of 
jail under a special amnesty, some were already sending signals Sunday of the 
opposition-run turmoil they could unleash on Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor I. Anpilov, the hard-line Communist who organized many Moscow street 
protests, gathered a few hundred supporters before the Bolshoi Theater and 
called for the creation of a powerful new working-class party. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first task will be to raise workers' collectives to fight against the 
regime," he told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander V. Rutskoi, the former vice president who pronounced himself 
Russia's leader during the anti-Yeltsin rebellion in October, will most likely 
run for president, aide Andrei Fyodorov told the British news agency Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ilya V. Konstantinov, head of one of the opposition groups that 
spearheaded the violent resistance, said he would remain its leader. "I was and 
remain the chairman of the National Salvation Front," he told the Russian NTV 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the former Parliament chairman, said he did 
not plan to take up politics again, saying he "greatly loathed contemporary 
politicians." He told Interfax there are no political leaders "with whom it is 
possible to agree with on any matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian analysts said the Parliament-approved amnesty, which freed all those 
facing charges for their roles in the 1991 Soviet coup attempt and the October 
clashes, hurt Yeltsin not only because the released prisoners could prove 
dangerous but also because it gave the opposition a resounding moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is undoubtedly a blow to Yeltsin, but the point is not the release of 
those particular people," said Nikolai Svanidze, a Russian Television 
commentator. "The fact of their release and that the president couldn't oppose 
it in any way speaks to the fact that he is weaker than he was some time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president now is once again in a state of disarray, and the moral 
advantage is definitely on the side of the opposition," Svanidze said. 
</P>
<P>
 That disarray could reach startling levels. In a glimpse into how the Kremlin 
works -- or does not work, as the case may be -- two presidential advisers 
admitted on NTV on Sunday night that the release of Yeltsin's foes from 
Lefortovo Prison on Saturday afternoon had taken them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's top prosecutor had led them to believe that nothing could happen 
before today, they said. So they began to work with the Duma, the lower house 
of Parliament which had approved the amnesty on Wednesday, by challenging the 
legality of its decision and asking that it be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 But as aides Georgy Satarov and Yuri Baturin were meeting with the head of the 
Duma on Saturday, the Lefortovo prisoners were already stepping through the 
prison's gates and heading home, released on order of the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "In household language, that's called deception," Satarov fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Satarov and Baturin actually appeared more upset about the poor coordination 
in their administration than about the possible political consequences of the 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 If he were to calculate cynically, Satarov said, he might even argue that the 
release of the October rebels could work in Yeltsin's favor, because while they 
sat in prison they were replaced on the political scene by a far more appealing 
opposition that could present greater problems for the president. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this cynical calculation is, unfortunately, less significant here because 
we cannot ignore their political practices, which are simply dangerous for the 
people and the country," Satarov added. 
</P>
<P>
 When Yeltsin declared the old Parliament dissolved last fall, Rutskoi and 
leading deputies refused to yield. They eventually called for armed attacks on 
government buildings, which led Yeltsin to storm their White House headquarters 
with tanks and artillery. The released prisoners are expected to rely once 
again on "the street" -- mass protests and marches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Russian politicians have urged Yeltsin to demand some kind of guarantee 
from the October rebels that they will refrain from political activity for a 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
 However, legal experts say that would deny the released prisoners their 
constitutional rights as citizens of a democracy.

 Feuding Yemeni leaders signed a new cease-fire accord providing for the 
integration of northern and southern troops in a bid to save the country's 
almost 4-year-old union and end the threat of civil war. Previous agreements 
have failed to stop the conflict between the Red Sea nation's northern and 
southern regions, but there were no reports of fighting after the truce took 
effect at midafternoon.The latest round of fighting erupted last Monday, a day 
after the signing of a reconciliation agreement. Col. Ali Salah, a northern 
army officer leading a joint military commission, said the new accord was 
signed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh and Vice President Ali Salim Bidh. Saleh 
led conservative North Yemen and Bidh headed Marxist South Yemen when they 
merged in May, 1990.

 On the fifth anniversary of major riots against price hikes, the government 
put together a new economic plan that aims to defuse social unrest.President 
Rafael Caldera suspended a portion of the constitution, which allows free 
commerce, thus possibly setting the stage for reimposing price controls. 
Caldera also suspended an unpopular value-added tax at the retail level. That 
means only importers and wholesalers have to pay the full 10%.

AMERICAN ALBUM: DIVE! DIVE! IDEA HATCHED FOR SUNKEN U-BOAT PARK; THE 
RUBBER-COATED GERMAN SUB LIES IN THE POTOMAC. HISTORY BUFFS COULD COME CALLING 
IN SCUBA GEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheathed in a layer of black rubber to avoid sonar detection, the German World 
War II U-boat known as the Black Panther served as a model of hit-and-run 
efficiency, always able to evade Allied counterstrikes thanks to clever German 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 That same U-boat now sits dead on the floor of the Potomac River near the 
coast of Maryland, a victim of U.S. experimentation and study that scuttled the 
submarine in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet efforts to bring life to the sunken U-1105 are under way as Maryland state 
officials work with the Navy to develop the country's first underwater diving 
park featuring a sunken WWII vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let the word park fool you. The actual 85-foot dive will be restricted 
to experienced divers because of the swift currents and low visibility in the 
Potomac River, said Maryland Historical Trust archeologist Richard Hughes, who 
is responsible for the park's development. 
</P>
<P>
 Divers will not be allowed inside the vessel out of concerns for their safety 
and preservation of the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to protect the Navy heritage," said Dr. William S. Dudley, senior 
historian at the Naval Historical Center. "We really are dealing here with 
elements of the past." The U-boat is the property of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease history buffs who are not divers, a small visitors center probably 
will be created at a nearby lighthouse, featuring exhibits, historical 
information, artifacts, photos and diver-made videos of the submarine, Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched on April 20, 1944, the Black Panther was one of only 10 U-boats 
coated with four millimeters of synthetic rubber designed to absorb sonar 
instead of reflecting it back to Allied ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The U-1105 patrolled the west coast of Ireland on its only war patrol in 
April, 1945, engaging enemy destroyers several times in attacks that left one 
ship badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid detection, the U-boat descended to the ocean floor. Allied vessels 
engaged in a furious search, setting hundreds of depth charges, but the 
submarine survived. 
</P>
<P>
 At the war's end a month later, the U-boat surrendered to British forces and 
was eventually turned over to the United States for study. The vessel was 
scuttled as part of a Navy explosives research test. 
</P>
<P>
 To create the park, the trust is seeking $100,000 from a Defense Department 
fund for preserving historical sites. A number of states already have 
underwater parks featuring shipwrecks caused by war or accidents. The trust is 
examining those parks as possible models for the U-boat park. 
</P>
<P>
 The dive probably would begin with a trip to the location, marked by a buoy, 
where divers would be able to follow a single line 85 feet down in muddy water 
to the sunken vessel, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, divers would see the 50-year-old submarine's conning tower, still 
in good condition and the only portion of the U-boat not extensively covered in 
silt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of the submarine most likely will be marked off for easy 
identification, and there is a possibility of installing a surveillance system 
to protect the vessel from vandals and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for a resourceful Virginia computer technician, the sub's 
location would remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredericksburg resident Uwe Lovas, who said he became interested in shipwrecks 
as a child, discovered the sunken sub after stumbling upon a Navy error in 
records of the vessel's location. Lovas happened upon the mistake in early 1985 
while searching for a possible shipwreck that he and two other divers could 
explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovas wondered why the Black Panther would have been sunk in waters several 
hundred miles off the coast of Virginia, where the U.S. Naval Ordinance 
Disposal Unit and School recorded it. 
</P>
<P>
 To Lovas' excitement, he determined that the report had transposed the 
longitude figure, from 76 degrees to 67 degrees. The U-boat, he found, was 
actually just 70 miles from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovas, his brother, Ron, and a friend, Alan Russell, searched in the area 
three times before being able to tie a line onto the wreck and explore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most shipwrecks decay rapidly, but this has not suffered that kind of decay," 
Lovas said, noting that the fresh waters of the Potomac have been gentler than 
the seawater enveloping most wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
 The divers kept quiet about the discovery for five years before inviting 
U-boat historian Henry Keatts and a photographer to explore it with them. 
Keatts then documented the find in a diving magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 That article subsequently found its way to Maryland state officials, who began 
working with the Navy to establish the park. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the park's opening, although Hughes said it could 
occur sometime in the next 18 months.

PLO DEBATES WHETHER IT WILL RESUME PEACE TALKS; MIDEAST: A DELAY SEEMS LIKELY. 
THE LEADERSHIP BELIEVES THE ISRAELI CRACKDOWN DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH.

 The PLO leadership, visibly dissatisfied with Israeli plans to crack down on 
Jewish settlers and release Palestinian prisoners, began debate Sunday about 
whether to resume negotiations with Israel or heed popular calls to pull out of 
the troubled peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization sources said the Executive Committee, which 
began meeting late Sunday and was scheduled to resume deliberations today, will 
almost certainly reject President Clinton's invitation to begin peace talks 
Wednesday in Washington, though it was prepared to leave the door open to 
commence the talks at a later date.

 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said the Israeli Cabinet's decision to arrest 
Jewish extremist leaders, disarm hard-core settlers and release 800 to 1,000 
Palestinian prisoners is "hollow snf superficial." He demanded further security 
measures in the wake of Friday's massacre of 48 Palestinians at a West Bank 
mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are cosmetic measures only aimed at containing the crisis rather than 
reaching real solutions to the existing tension," added Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head 
of the PLO Information Department. "What is requested are measures to stop the 
killing of Palestinian citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Related Mideast peace talks in Washington were suspended after delegates from 
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan decided to withdraw to show solidarity with the PLO 
and to return home for consultations, U.S. and Israeli officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arab parties to the bilateral talks informed the United States Sunday 
that due to the current circumstances and environment, they thought it best to 
forgo their talks scheduled for the next three days," said a State Department 
official who asked that his name be withheld. "They made it clear they remain 
committed to the process." 
</P>
<P>
 With popular demonstrations breaking out in many parts of the Arab world in 
response to the massacre, PLO officials are insisting that they will not accept 
a return to the peace talks under current conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has really broken this peace process is the massacre in Hebron, and that 
massacre cannot be undone, it cannot be forgotten so that business can go back 
as usual," said Nabil Shaath, who has headed the PLO's negotiating team on 
security talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO is insisting that all Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip be disarmed when they leave the settlement property, and that 
hard-core settlers be under "very strict" surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the PLO has urged the appointment of a commission of inquiry to 
look into the massacre and the links between hard-core settlers and the Israeli 
army. On Sunday, Israel's Cabinet ordered a state inquiry into the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials said they are also seeking a broad package of assurances from 
Israel, possibly including: 
</P>
<P>
 * A re-evaluation of some settlements in the Gaza Strip and parts of the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guarantees that there will be a rapid withdrawal of Israeli troops and 
hand-over of authority to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank district of 
Jericho once a final peace agreement on Palestinian autonomy is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immediate release of all Palestinian prisoners, numbering 10,500, by PLO 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some concessions on remaining points of dispute in the peace talks, 
preferably an increase in the size of the Jericho district. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such measures, PLO officials said, Arafat cannot maintain popular 
support for continuing the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials said the Executive Committee is likely to reject Wednesday's 
date for resuming the talks and present a list of points that need further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 A key question in whether to resume talks in Washington is how active the 
Clinton Administration is prepared to be in producing an agreement, Shaath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, bringing us to Washington does not evoke very happy memories. We 
spent two years in Washington without any results, while in Cairo we were doing 
really well," he said.

S. AFRICA VILLAGERS CROWD INTO TENT TO MOURN YOUTHS SLAIN OVER ELECTION WORK

 The entire village of Mahehle crowded into a tent with African National 
Congress leaders Sunday to mourn young ANC supporters massacred in violence 
linked to April's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at these boxes here, my strength leaves me," Walter Sisulu, ANC 
deputy president, said as he gazed at a row of 14 coffins.A 15th victim from 
the Feb. 19 massacre was to be buried later. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 2,000 mourners were subdued, though there were occasional calls 
of " Amandla awetu! " -- "Power to the people!" 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 victims were preparing to conduct a voter education program in Mahehle, 
in southern Natal province, for South Africa's first all-race election when 
they were attacked by killers armed with automatic weapons and knives. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bisho, near the site of a 1992 massacre of ANC supporters, ANC leader 
Nelson Mandela used a campaign rally to call for peace and reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thursday that they had arrested an official of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party in connection with the Mahehle massacre. Two other officials of Zulu-led 
Inkatha, which opposes the election and is the ANC's main black political 
rival, were detained for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only crime committed by these children is that they said the people of 
Mahehle, the people of Natal and the people of South Africa should go to the 
polls," said Harry Gwala, a regional leader of the ANC.

WACO VERDICTS SEEN AS TIME OF RENEWAL FOR ATF; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE AGENCY'S 
SURVIVAL WAS RECENTLY IN QUESTION. NOW IT HAS A BROAD GUN-CONTROL MISSION, 
BIGGER BUDGET, GROWING ESPRIT DE CORPS. 
</P>

<P>
 The verdicts in the Branch Davidian trial were a painful final chapter of a 
difficult year for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- a 
year officials say has brought a good deal of soul-searching and changed the 
nature of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in San Antonio on Saturday acquitted 11 cult members of the most 
serious charges against them -- murder and murder-conspiracy -- in the deaths 
of four ATF agents in the failed assault against the group's compound. Five 
Davidians were convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Two were convicted on 
weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 With the trial's outcome behind them, officials say they view today as a 
symbolic turning point for the ATF: It is the first anniversary of the bloody 
siege in Waco, Tex., that left the agents and six Davidians dead, and it is the 
day that the agency will assume broad new responsibilities as the Brady 
gun-control law becomes a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important firearms regulation law in a quarter of a century will go 
into effect, and ATF is central to the success of the new law," said Ronald K. 
Noble, who oversees the bureau as assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the ATF has won a budget increase from the Clinton Administration at 
a time when other agencies are struggling under severe cuts. It is also a 
central part of a recently announced effort by the Treasury Department to 
dramatically tighten regulations on gun dealers, and it is moving into new 
technologies that could revolutionize the way in which evidence of gun-related 
crimes is collected. 
</P>
<P>
 And if cigarette taxes rise as a result of the Administration's health care 
reform effort, the ATF is also likely to face new challenges in preventing 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than five months ago, the very survival of the agency was in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, it had been seen by other law enforcement agencies as second-rate, 
with agents who lacked the training, breadth and polish of their counterparts 
in the FBI and the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, seeking ways to make government more efficient, called 
last fall for merging the agency's functions into the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a blistering Treasury Department report on the botched raid in Waco 
had alleged that individual ATF officers had tried to cover up their mistakes, 
that they had not given sufficient consideration to less confrontational 
options, that they had relied upon obviously flawed intelligence and that they 
had failed to coordinate and organize their operations properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid produced a 51-day standoff at the cult's compound. It ended in the 
deaths of more than 80 Davidians, including their leader, David Koresh, in an 
inferno that was set after FBI agents tried a tear-gas assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of the ATF was a major issue in the trial. Defense attorneys, 
adopting a strategy of putting the ATF on trial as well, apparently persuaded 
the jury that federal agents were also to blame for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 From Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on down, the Administration tried to put the best 
face on Saturday's verdict, noting that most defendants were convicted of some 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, legal scholars said the voluntary-manslaughter verdicts suggested 
that jurors believed that the Davidians were provoked into killing the ATF 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The verdict was surprising. I think it was a defeat for ATF and the 
government generally," said Yale Kamisar, a professor of criminal law at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamisar suggested that the verdicts will fuel skepticism about "how often the 
public is misled by government officials. . . . Obviously, the jury was very 
troubled by the performance of the ATF and everyone else who was involved. It 
makes you wonder what else the government isn't telling us the truth about." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, one of the main jobs ahead for the ATF is rebuilding its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, new top management has been brought in, and officials said the 
agency has revamped its training and its procedures in crisis situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Its new director, Secret Service veteran John W. Magaw, has likened the 
process to the rebuilding effort undertaken by the Secret Service in the wake 
of the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ATF received credit for helping to track down the defendants in 
last year's World Trade Center bombing in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has also benefited from the recent political surge behind the crime 
issue that led Congress last year to enact the Brady measure, which would 
require background checks on handgun purchasers and impose a five-day waiting 
period on gun sales. Virtually all enforcement of the new law will fall to the 
ATF. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Clinton White House has put an emphasis on curbing the 
proliferation of firearms, which is one of ATF's major areas of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Administration's GOP predecessors were hostile to anything 
that smacked of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of ways, you see a certain pride developing in ATF. They don't have 
to be embarrassed about what they are doing," one Administration official said.

HOUSE FIRE KILLS 7 CHILDREN, 2 ADULTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire engulfed a row house, killing seven children and two adults, because 
the residents were burning candles after their electricity had been cut off, 
fire officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 21-year-old woman dropped her 2-year-old son to safety from a second-floor 
window and then jumped, breaking her ankle, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other survivor was a 14-year-old boy who told investigators that he 
was awakened by the heat and screamed to wake the others upstairs. All of the 
dead were found upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that the fire late Saturday started in the downstairs 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was shut off Oct. 11 after the electric bill for the row house had 
mounted to $1,400, Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. spokesman Kevin Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company offered to allow the bill to be paid off over a one- to four-year 
period, but the residents never responded, he said.

<P>
 Blacks and Latinos attend college in increasing numbers but are less likely to 
stay in school and graduate than whites, the American Council on Education 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACE found that blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans 
gained in enrollment from 1991 to 1992, but the number of white students 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said 41% of Latino students, 32% of African American students and 
30% of Native American students earn a bachelor's degree within six years. 
Rates for Asian Americans and whites are 63% and 56%, respectively.

CALLS TO FREEZE RUSSIAN AID TONED DOWN; ESPIONAGE: LEADERS IN CONGRESS TEMPER 
OUTRAGE OVER KREMLIN SPYING. BUT THEY STILL PLAN TO REASSESS DONATIONS. 
PARTNERSHIP POLICY FACES SCRUTINY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leading members of Congress on Sunday scaled back their demands for a freeze 
on aid to Russia but said they still want to reassess the $2.5-billion program 
in the wake of the espionage scandal that erupted last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who called 
for an aid freeze after a veteran CIA officer was arrested on charges of spying 
for the Kremlin, said he now merely wants a new look at the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question nations are going to spy on each other," DeConcini said 
on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." "We're going to continue to do it, and Israel may 
still be doing it with the United States . . . and we are a big donor to 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying stop aid," he added. "Reassess our aid and look . . . (at) 
what aid is really in our best interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress reacted with outrage after federal authorities arrested 
CIA official Aldrich H. Ames and charged him with spying for the former Soviet 
Union and then Russia for as long as 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many demanded that Russia be punished for spying on the U.S. government at a 
time when the United States is sending aid to help reform Russia's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like DeConcini, suggested that the U.S. aid program, which President 
Clinton has cited as one of his major foreign policy accomplishments, be 
suspended entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton reacted on two fronts: ordering the expulsion of the man U.S. 
officials say is the chief intelligence officer at the Russian Embassy in 
Washington, but also defending the Administration's aid program as founded on 
"clear American interests." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, sources said, CIA officials privately told members of 
Congress that they did not consider Russian espionage activities in the United 
States a violation of the law of the jungle that still prevails in the world of 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements by DeConcini and other senators over the weekend indicated that the 
Administration's arguments were making some headway. But they also suggested 
that Clinton's policy of large-scale aid programs aiming at "partnership" with 
Russia is in for tougher scrutiny than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has already approved $2.5 billion in aid for Russia and other 
republics of the former Soviet Union this year, and the Administration has 
requested an initial commitment of $900 million for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This use of aid to Russia really has to be broken down as to what that's all 
about," Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), another member of the Intelligence 
Committee, said on the NBC program. "We have to get over the idea, I think, 
that this is a partnership. This is a tough rivalry, and that is an important 
distinction to make. These are tough people with whom to deal. And we're not 
going to be involved in handouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the senior Republican on the Appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, said he wants to "take a good, hard 
look" at U.S. assistance to Russia -- not because of espionage but because of 
Russia's increasingly independent foreign policy in Bosnia, the former 
republics of the Soviet Union and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that money would be better spent in some of these countries under 
Russian dominance," he said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing here -- and it's perfectly apparent to everyone except the 
Clinton Administration State Department -- is that they intend to be rivals," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said the spy case had revealed a serious problem in security at the 
CIA, "and that really is more of a problem in my judgment than the relation 
with Russia. We have to deal with our own house first." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the CIA and the FBI had investigated the possibility that a Russian 
mole was inside U.S. intelligence beginning in 1985, but they did not fully 
join forces until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first step, he said, his committee will recommend a change in regulations 
that would allow the CIA access to credit reports and other financial records 
of CIA officers in sensitive positions, a proposal the panel considered but did 
not act on in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities charge that during his later years as a Russian spy, Ames 
paid $540,000 cash for a house outside Washington, bought a Jaguar automobile 
and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on credit card bills -- but the CIA 
had no easy way to check whether he was receiving outside income.

U.S. JUDGES DROP SUPPORT OF TASK FORCE ON RACE, GENDER BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican-appointed majority on the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District 
of Columbia has denounced the work of a task force looking into race and gender 
bias in the federal courts and voted last Friday to withdraw its support for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Three appeals judges -- Stephen F. Williams, Laurence H. Silberman and Douglas 
H. Ginsburg -- led the challenge, assailing a task force committee on gender 
that is looking into a wide range of issues, including how many women are hired 
as law clerks by federal judges, according to internal court memos and 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle has been fought in a flurry of judges' memos, shooting back and 
forth between critics and supporters of the Task Force on Gender, Race and 
Ethnicity. Williams fired the first salvo in a memo Feb. 7, and later called on 
the 10-member court to vote that it "no longer has confidence" in the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Saturday, Chief Judge Abner J. Mikva said the court majority's 
denouncement of such the project was "unfortunate," but would have no effect on 
the task force's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't allow them to have a heckler's veto and not go ahead," he said. The 
project involves both the appeals and trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is part of a nationwide effort to determine whether female lawyers, court 
employees, defendants and women involved in lawsuits face bias in the 
profession or the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Feb. 7 memo, Williams challenged much of the focus of the committee 
looking at gender issues. For example, he objected to questions about whether 
gender affects law firm assignments on federal cases because they delve into 
the actions of the private bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also suggested that the task force "proceed warily" with questions 
about the hiring of law clerks, noting that judges consider those decisions as 
"tightly tied" to their constitutionally guaranteed independence.

FREIGHT TRAIN DERAILS IN SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen cars of a Southern Pacific freight train derailed Sunday in San 
Bernardino, leaving rail cars jackknifed and strewn in zigzags along the track, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the earlymorning derailment that shut down the main 
north-south freight rail line from Palmdale to Southern Pacific's huge freight 
yard in Colton, spilling building materials next to the rails. The line is not 
expected to reopen until late this afternoon at the earliest, a railroad 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the derailment -- the second in a week on the busy line -- is 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about three miles from the scene of a spectacular 
derailment on the same track in May, 1989, when a runaway freight train 
barreled off the rails and slammed into seven homes, killing two trainmen and 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, a 14-inch gasoline pipeline next to the track exploded, 
igniting a fireball that killed two people, injured 31, and destroyed or 
damaged 18 homes. Since the explosion, additional check valves have been 
installed along the pipeline, San Bernardino Fire Department Battalion Chief 
David Parke said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's derailment, the Fire Department examined the 14-inch pipeline 
that parallels the track, transporting gasoline from Colton to the Las Vegas 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors for Calnev Pipeline Co., which operates the line, were also 
checking the high-pressure pipeline, Parke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 89-car train, carrying mostly plywood and lumber products, was en route 
from Eugene, Ore., to the Colton yard when two flat cars, 10 boxcars, three 
empty tank cars and three empty grain cars left the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first six or seven cars that derailed wound up in "a pretty neat little 
accordion" -- some at 90-degree angles to the track -- with the other cars 
tumbling off the rails in a zigzag pattern behind them, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they had no idea what caused the derailment at mid-train, 
but Parke said the train may have been "dragging a car" to the rail yard, that 
is, pulling a car that has one set of wheels off the track. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was traveling less than 30 m.p.h. at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney said crews clearing the rail line are 
taking extra precautions to avoid damaging the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, several cars carrying crude oil from Bakersfield to a Los 
Angeles refinery derailed a few miles to the south, where the rail line crosses 
beneath Interstate 10 near Colton. Furtney said that derailment resulted in the 
leak of about 100 gallons of crude oil.

 A 53-year-old man was killed Sunday when he ignored a safety gate and flashing 
lights in South-Central Los Angeles and walked in front of a southbound Blue 
Line train at 55th Street and Long Beach Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samouem Long was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, which occurred 
about 12:20 p.m. just north of the Slauson Avenue station. The gates, warning 
lights and bells at the crossing were operating properly, said Bill Heard, 
spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

2 ORANGE COUNTY STREET RACES END IN 4 DEATHS

 Four men were killed in two weekend car crashes that apparently involved 
illegal racing, authorities said Sunday. The dead ranged in age from 17 to 29. 
</P>
<P>
 A race early Sunday morning between a Chevy Camaro and a Ford Mustang ended in 
death for Vahey Shahinian, 17, of Downey, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, the cars were weaving in and out of traffic at speeds 
nearing 100 m.p.h. on the eastbound Riverside Freeway. As the cars approached 
Imperial Highway in Anaheim, the Mustang's driver cut in front of the Camaro 
and slammed on the brakes, CHP officials said. Shahinian swerved the Camaro to 
avoid the Mustang and lost control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camaro ricocheted off a guardrail and a light pole and plunged down a 
30-foot embankment, CHP officials said. Shahinian was killed instantly. 
Passenger Chris Sarkissian, 15, of Anaheim Hills was treated for cuts and 
bruises. Both wore seat belts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP is looking for the driver of the Mustang who fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, three people were killed when they decided to race some friends 
to a party, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends were speeding south on Grand Avenue in a Dodge and a Buick, when 
one car -- police were unsure which -- hit a third car and sent it spinning out 
of control. The driver of the third car was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodge and the Buick kept racing down Grand Avenue and both drivers lost 
control and struck a power pole, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodge ripped apart. Three of the four people inside were killed and the 
fourth was seriously injured. Police identified two of the dead as Alberto 
Valdez, 29, and Abraham Perez, 26. The third was unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the three occupants of the second car later turned 
themselves in. Valentine Cruz Rodriguez, 24, was booked on felony hit-and-run 
driving charges.

'QUAKE REUNION' LIFTS THE SPIRITS OF FORMER NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Most people are trying to forget the earthquake. But for 35 people who 
attended an unusual "earthquake reunion" Sunday, seeing former neighbors from 
their severely damaged apartment complex and recounting their experience was an 
emotional and ultimately healing affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've seen each other in five weeks," said Ruben 
Hernandez, who organized the event for former neighbors of the Matilija 
Apartments, which are located at 4334 and 4346 Matilija Ave. in Sherman Oaks. 
"We were a real close-knit unit. We all looked out for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Former neighbors said the reunion not only assured them that their friends and 
acquaintances had recovered from the temblor, it provided the comfort of 
sharing with those who experienced a similar trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to know we're not alone," said Ryan Augustine, a student at Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understood what you went through," agreed social worker Dee Dee 
Shulman. Neighbors greeted one another with warm embraces and tearful smiles on 
the patio of Stanley's Restaurant & Bar on Ventura Boulevard, where the reunion 
was held. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you?" one woman asked another as they hugged. "Doing better, at 
last," the second answered. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the event would be helpful, Hernandez invited a psychiatrist 
from Valley Medical Center in Van Nuys to speak with his former neighbors about 
how to deal with recurring anxiety after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky answered tenants' questions, along with 
representatives from the Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 
the Los Angeles Department of Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake seemed light years away as the former neighbors got 
reacquainted over omelets, fresh fruit and salads. White muslin umbrellas 
shaded them from the bright afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat feeling at the reunion was due in large part to the unusual 
friendship and familiarity among the Matilija tenants. Neighbors said it was 
easy to meet because their apartments are built around a courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex was vacated after the earthquake and city inspectors 
declared the building as safe for only limited entry. Most who attended the 
reunion have found new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But they credited Hernandez with bringing them together again, even if only 
for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took care of us that morning," said Nyla Rogers, a Pepperdine University 
psychology student. "He took control." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone at the table recalled that Hernandez provided mouthwash to neighbors 
the morning of the quake because there was no water for toothbrushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the former tenants, such as Karen Hare, 37, a legal secretary, spoke 
of the emotional and physical problems that they have encountered since the 
temblor. She said the quake unleashed painful memories of past hurts and 
losses, including the deaths of her father and brother when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 One moment, Hare said, she is calm and collected and the next she is screaming 
at someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the time I feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," said Hare, who dabbed at 
her eyes with a tissue as she described her experiences to Dr. Robert 
Kahn-Rose, a psychiatrist and medical director of Valley Medical Center's 
Special Care Unit. Others in the group reported insomnia, nightmares, fatigue 
and migraine headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn-Rose explained that people undergo a biochemical reaction during a 
traumatic experience such as a natural disaster. Because the release of some 
hormones in the body causes anxiety, quake victims should not feel guilty or 
inadequate for being unable to shake these feelings off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 50% and 80% of those who have been through an earthquake experience 
fear and anxiety, Kahn-Rose said. And even now, five weeks after the quake, 
about two-thirds of those people continue to have those feelings, he said, 
based on his own patients' experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychiatrist said the reunion was an important step toward resolving those 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be here as an expert in how to deal with the aftershocks, so 
to speak, of an earthquake," he said. "Really, you are doing the right thing 
here, trying to show that 'Hey, life is getting back to normal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't given up on the neighborhood or each other. That's the message."

FEAR COMES TO TOWN AFTER MAN DISAPPEARS; MYSTERY: RANCHER LARRY KUHN, KNOWN IN 
THREE POINTS FOR HIS GENEROSITY, VANISHED IN SEPTEMBER ON THE DAY HE WAS TO 
LEAVE ON A GAMBLING TRIP. HIS CAR LATER WAS FOUND IN THE EAST VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Kuhn, for 40 years a rancher in this isolated mountain town, loved to 
wash down a good day's work with a few beers and tell war stories about his 
days in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days Kuhn's favorite bar stool sits empty, and people in this 
community about 20 miles east of Gorman spend much of their time talking about 
what could have happened to him. The 83-year-old rancher hasn't been seen since 
Sept. 26, the Sunday he was supposed to leave for a two-day gambling trip to 
Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 His disappearance has spooked this community of 150 people, prompting some to 
fret about big city problems invading a place that is little more than a dot on 
the map. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never locked our doors before this happened," said Suzie Gardner, standing 
up to smoke a cigarette after a hearty breakfast at Nancy's Up The Road Cafe, 
the only business in Three Points. "These days, we're all locking our doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband Ralph, wearing a cowboy hat and boots, chimed in, "I don't care if 
they (police) stop me, I've started carrying a side arm since that happened." 
Cafe owner Nancy Green, a round-faced woman with bright blue eyes, said she too 
had purchased a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Affectionately dubbed the "Commander" because it was his naval ranking, Kuhn 
was reported missing Sept. 29 when he failed to return from Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives Lynn Reeder and Woodrow West, who are investigating Kuhn's 
disappearance for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, talk about the 
case too. "We think he's dead," Reeder said. "We think his body is buried 
somewhere out in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't hold much hope of finding a body. "Even the quake didn't make 
him rise to the surface," Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last slaying anyone can remember anywhere near these parts was almost 11 
years ago, when a 16-year-old inmate escaped from a county probation camp and 
killed a local rancher in Lake Hughes, a town about 10 miles to the east. But 
that was different, folks say. The culprit was an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit here, if there is one, could be local. "We had a murder here," 
said Merlin Pinnell, who helps run Nancy's, to no one in particular one 
afternoon. "Could have been one of our own. Hmmm." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kuhn was a popular man in Three Points, a generous man who often picked 
up hitchhikers and lent a hand to folks down on their luck. "He was the kind of 
guy that, even though he didn't know you, he'd give you something to do," said 
a former employee. Even if Kuhn really didn't need any work done on the ranch, 
friends and family say, he would hire someone anyway just to give them a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But in January, 1993, Kuhn really needed help and took out a newspaper ad 
asking for caretakers to run the ranch, which became too much of a chore after 
his wife of 54 years, Fran, became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 He hired James and Linda Keck, a married couple who had moved to California 
from Kentucky. Nearly a year later, sheriff's deputies would announce that they 
had arrested the Kecks on suspicion of murder in the old man's disappearance. 
The pair was released Dec. 4 and the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office declined to file any charges, citing lack of evidence, not to mention 
the lack of a body. Reeder considers the case open and says the Kecks remain 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their arrest, the Kecks were a barely noticeable addition to Three 
Points, located a few miles below the southern edge of Kern County, in the 
mountains overlooking the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were described by local residents as quiet people who never engaged 
in small talk and kept to themselves. They rarely visited the cafe, and Jeff 
Jones, Kuhn's hired hand, said they showed no interest in establishing a 
friendship with him or neighbors. In fact, Jones recalls, Linda Keck, who is 25 
years younger than her 71-year-old spouse, hardly ever left the ranch and spent 
most of her time inside Kuhn's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and investigators say James Keck is a slightly built man who 
suffered from Parkinson's disease, which caused his hands to shake 
uncontrollably at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's weak and doesn't walk very well," said Laurie Keck, his daughter-in-law, 
of Barstow. "He's had heart attacks in the past, and sometimes his hands shake 
so badly he can hardly hold silverware." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife Linda is a wide-shouldered woman who, despite her California 
upbringing, spoke with a thick Southern accent. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was another side to them that people in Three Points didn't see, 
according to investigators and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spoke to me of loving to play craps," said Laurie Keck. "I also know that 
he went to Atlantic City several times and she said that they both loved to 
gamble." Dixie Clifton, of Erlanger, Ky., where the Kecks lived for about two 
years, remembers several trips the couple took to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 And like most gamblers, the couple often asked relatives for loans, said 
Laurie Keck. The couple borrowed money from relatives on several occasions -- 
including Laurie Keck's family -- and she told investigators that Kuhn had 
loaned them money at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had worked for Kuhn a few months when Kuhn placed his wife in a 
convalescent home in late May. Shortly after her death on June 23, say friends 
and authorities, his life began to unravel with small, seemingly insignificant 
things that grew bigger with each incident. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nancy Green tells it, Kuhn walked into her cafe one sunny morning last 
summer confused and angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy, what do you see?" Kuhn said as he opened his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing, Commander," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right, and I had a whole bunch of money in there earlier today," he 
told her. 
</P>
<P>
 First, relatively small amounts of money were missing, and when Green and 
others at the cafe tried to warn Kuhn about befriending strangers and picking 
up hitchhikers, he shrugged off their concerns, saying, "Oh, you worry too 
much," Green recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn was mentally alert and maintained immaculate business records, said 
Reeder. For instance, Kuhn took and filed meticulous notes about conversations 
he had with auto mechanics. John Kuhn of Prescott, Ariz., said his father had 
been like that all his life, a habit developed from a regimented and 
well-ordered military career that began when he was graduated from the Naval 
Academy in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of his penchant for order, investigators cannot find any of Kuhn's 
financial records dating from July until his disappearance, Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of last summer, strange things seemed to happen that would 
separate Kuhn from his cash. On one occasion, Jones remembers Kuhn finding his 
wallet up in a tree in the front yard. It was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 On another, Kuhn pulled out what he believed was a $20 bill at Nancy's only to 
find that it was a $1 bill with the ends of a $20 bill taped on the corners. He 
showed the bill to everyone there. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said another distinct departure from Kuhn's traditional way of 
doing things was a postdated check for $3,000 made out to the Kecks -- a loan 
the Kecks claim that Kuhn made to them to help them purchase a new truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives called such a check out of character. "My father never postdated a 
check in his life, and when me or my brother borrowed money from him, he made 
us sign a contract and pay interest," John Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhn never publicly confronted the Kecks about the losses, but once walked 
into a crowded Nancy's and accused Jones, the hired hand, of stealing his 
money. Jones denied it. And then three weeks before his disappearance, his son 
says, Kuhn canceled all of his credit and bank cards and had new cards issued. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kuhn disappeared, investigators discovered that about $8,000 in 
automatic teller withdrawals and questionable checks had been drawn against 
Kuhn's account, leaving him with a negative balance of about $900 by late 
September, the month he vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder soon launched a search at the Kuhn ranch, but the dogs and deputies 
turned up nothing. A few weeks later investigators found Kuhn's car, a 1987 
Pontiac Bonneville, abandoned in the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Kecks were arrested and released, they left Three Points in 
mid-December. The last anyone heard from them was a phone call received by 
Laurie's husband, John Keck, placed from Las Vegas a few days before Christmas. 
They needed money, he said, because their trailer had been destroyed in a 
traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keck refused and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Life's just not the same in Three Points these days. People sadly reminisce 
about the Commander, and the rustic decor at Nancy's includes a poster asking 
for information on his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has certainly changed for Jones, who was interviewed by deputies and is 
not considered a suspect in Kuhn's disappearance. Even so, he was eighty-sixed 
from Nancy's some time ago, a cruel fate in Three Points, and now claims he's 
been blacklisted and is having trouble finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jones spends time in the Quonset hut at the Kuhn ranch and says he has one 
friend who lives nearby. Green says Jones is not welcome at her cafe because of 
his behavior, but Jones says simply, "She never did like me." 
</P>
<P>
 So why not leave? "I like it here," said the 42-year-old ranch hand. "And I 
really have no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ken and Connie Stanley, residents of Three Points for 33 years, and 
neighbor Dave Rozum, Kuhn's eerie disappearance is a dramatic shift from the 
days in the 1960s when the Kuhns operated a summer 4-H camp at the ranch, which 
was then a sprawling 200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't expect it out here," said Connie Stanley. "I don't feel as 
safe as I did when we first moved here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there really any likely place?" asked her husband, Ken, referring to the 
random nature of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Gerald Newbold, whose patrol area from the Gorman substation 
includes Three Points, also has noticed the change in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that they're spooked -- almost like a superstitious kind of spooking," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, people here just want the investigation to end, however it turns 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants it to go away because it's driving people crazy," said Green, 
the cafe owner. "People here are looking at each other going 'Hmmmmmmmmm.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the folks at Nancy's still hoist a beer in the air and raise 
a toast to Kuhn, one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think that he's in Panama sitting on the beach sipping a mai tai 
and laughing it up," said Pauline Metcalfe, 63, as she sipped down a 10-ounce 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's where he is, but I hope that's where he is."

ONLY HALF OF ALL VOUCHER RECIPIENTS FIND NEW HOMES; EARTHQUAKE: 12,000 RECEIVE 
THE EMERGENCY AID. OFFICIALS CITE TRANSPORTATION AND RELUCTANT LANDLORDS AS TWO 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 One month after the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development started 
its emergency housing voucher program for low-income Los Angeles earthquake 
victims, only half of the 12,000 voucher recipients have found new homes, 
according to a city official. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Kandell, spokesman for the Los Angeles Housing Authority, said that 
as of Wednesday, the authority had issued 18-month rental assistance vouchers 
to 12,183 families and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 3,390 applicants have tentatively found housing, but are waiting for 
approval from the housing authority to move in. Another 2,706 already have 
signed contracts with landlords. That leaves 6,087 with vouchers but not 
permanent shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers with a San Fernando Valley legal group said the numbers reflect the 
difficulties that poor people are having in finding housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty major problem at this point," said Ruth Zacarias, a housing 
attorney with San Fernando Valley Legal Services in Pacoima. "People are still 
out there homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Kandell: "I can't say they're wrong. We're addressing the problem as 
we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the low success rate of house-hunters are multifold, Kandell 
and housing lawyers said. Kandell named transportation problems as the main 
culprit, along with a quake-related housing shortage in certain areas, and the 
reluctance of landlords to take in tenants with vouchers. He also speculated 
that some people may not be actively looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacarias and fellow Legal Services lawyer Mona Tawatao said they believe the 
principal explanation is a housing shortage, followed by discrimination against 
large families, a reluctance to rent to subsidized tenants and HUD restrictions 
on the types of apartments -- based on their rent -- that people can secure. 
For example, HUD will not subsidize rent for a one-bedroom unit if it exceeds 
$683 per month. There is an $864-per-month ceiling for two-bedroom units, 
$1,167 for three-bedroom units and $1,391 for four-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of landlords are wary of renting to people with these certificates, 
because they don't know how the program works," Zacarias said. "Some of them 
are not even sure how they're going to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles has said there is no housing 
shortage despite quake damage to 23,000 apartment units, saying there are 
60,000 empty units in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the housing authority addressed the mobility problem that has 
hampered some in their housing search by kicking off a $1.5-million program in 
which teams of workers drive house-hunters to homes and apartments owned by 
landlords willing to participate in the housing-assistance program. The workers 
are trained to answer questions about the program, and interpreters will be 
provided, Kandell said. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros has been meeting with Los Angeles property owners 
associations to urge members to accept tenants who have vouchers. Cisneros' 
department has set aside $200 million for the vouchers, which assure a landlord 
rent for 18 months. The tenants give 30% of their monthly income to the 
landlord and HUD pays the rest of the rent, which can come to 90% or more of 
the monthly payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The voucher program, unprecedented in scope, was announced Jan. 20, just three 
days after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, the housing authority -- which has run the HUD-funded 
project -- had issued 8,000 vouchers, Kandell said. That means that many of the 
voucher recipients have been unsuccessfully house-hunting for three weeks.

 Five weeks of unemployment, and for electrician Sam Romeo it was shaping up to 
be another long day at home -- one spent making pork sausage instead of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Then nature brought home the bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 For Romeo and thousands of other unemployed workers, the Northridge earthquake 
was an instant jolt out of the boredom and worry that dog the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody likes to crow over a disaster, but in the first two weeks alone, the 
60-year-old electrician earned almost $5,000 working 12-hour shifts, seven days 
a week helping repair Canoga Park's Rocketdyne plant, where tens of thousands 
of downed light fixtures and twisted electrical lines have thrust Romeo from 
the sidelines into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy who was taking home $230 a week in unemployment benefits 
before the quake crunched homes and factories like a runaway roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as it hit, I knew there was going to be a lot of work," said Romeo, a 
green-eyed, barrel-chested man with gray hair. "I'm happy because the more 
hours I work, the better my pension will be. I might even buy a new truck." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is still too early to tell just how big a boon the quake will turn out 
to be for the more than 25,000 construction workers who were unemployed 
beforehand, officials said. And whatever gains those workers make will have to 
be measured against the loss of thousands of retail jobs, officials and 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Feb. 19, the latest date for which figures were available, 25,750 people 
had lost their jobs or a portion of their wages because of earthquake-related 
damage to businesses, said Suzanne Schroeder, spokeswoman for the state 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lost jobs were in the retail sector, including shopping centers 
and restaurants, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development 
Corp. of Los Angeles County, a private, nonprofit agency affiliated with county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall job picture in Los Angeles County for the month of January will 
not be known until March 5. Even then, officials will not be able to analyze 
the true impact of the disaster on the construction industry because many 
workers were hired in February, said Jay Horowitz, an analyst with the state 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employment has got to jump up by the thousands for construction workers," 
Horowitz said. "Of course, what's good for them won't help the others who have 
lost their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,500 construction workers such as Romeo who were unemployed before the 
quake are now working overtime to repair quake damage, said Ron Kennedy, 
executive secretary of the Building Trades Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But that still leaves unemployed about 23,000 of the association's 85,000 Los 
Angeles County members and countless others who are not unionized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, out of someone's bad luck or ill fate, something good has 
come," Kennedy said. "But our industry, whether you're in a union or not, has 
been in dire straits for years." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's unemployment rate dipped to 8.9% in December, down nearly a 
percentage point from the year before, said Jay Horowitz, an analyst with the 
state Employment Development Department. But despite the upturn, the 
construction trades continued to suffer, with about 4,300 fewer jobs last year 
than the 104,200 in 1992, a drop of 4%, Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Romeo is counting on having work for months to come. The 
contractor who hired him after the quake, Regal Electrical Construction Co. of 
Oxnard, has entered bids for several post-earthquake jobs, said co-owner Kevin 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 Regal, which has done work for Rocketdyne in the past, was called by the firm 
almost immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out the first day and snapped up two contractors," said Rocketdyne 
spokesman Paul Sewell. "We understand that other people who didn't move as fast 
as we did have had problems" finding skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell declined to say how much the damage will cost the company, which 
manufactures space shuttle engines. But the losses are clearly in the millions, 
judging by the mess that greeted Romeo and the other Regal workers when they 
first arrived. There was no significant structural damage, but more than 23,000 
light fixtures were dashed to the cement floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The main factory, which takes up almost as much space as 17 football fields, 
was particularly hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Romeo tackled the mess with zeal. Construction work is sporadic by nature, but 
unlike some of his colleagues, Romeo says he has never managed to enjoy the 
slow periods. In past years, he used to tromp down to the union hall in North 
Hills every day at 8 a.m. when jobs are dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love being back on the job," said Romeo, who belongs to the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. "I don't like to lounge. If 
you got a hobby, it's OK. But how much of that can you do? Like my father used 
to say, he was from southern Italy, you got to be like a whale in the ocean. 
You gotta keep moving or you'll die."

TWO BODIES FOUND IN CAR ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bodies of two men who were apparently shot to death were found Sunday 
evening inside a car on the Golden State Freeway near the Hungry Valley Road 
exit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passing motorist discovered the bodies about 8 p.m. on the southbound side 
of the road and contacted authorities, said Deputy Diane Hecht, spokeswoman for 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives were en route to the scene late Sunday and further details were not 
available, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Santa Clarita station aided by California Highway Patrol 
officers secured the scene until investigators arrived, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated incident in North Hollywood, a 33-year-old man was killed and 
two other men injured in a shooting at a crowded park about 4:20 p.m., said 
Sgt. Robert Ontiveros of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not yet determined a motive for the shooting in Magnolia Park, but 
Ontiveros said it did not appear to be gang-related because the victims were 
part of "an older, working-class crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 The park, located at the corner of Tujunga Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard, was 
filled with picnickers, soccer players and others enjoying a sunny Sunday, 
Ontiveros said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man, whose identity was not immediately available, was taken to the 
Medical Center of North Hollywood, where he died about an hour after the 
attack, Ontiveros said.

DRIVER RAMS INTO HOUSE, CAR; 2 HURT; CRASH: SUSPECTED DRUNK MOTORIST IS 
ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY PLOWING INTO LIVING ROOM. HOMEOWNER CAPTURES HIM AND 
TIES HIM UP UNTIL POLICE ARRIVE.

<P>
 A suspected drunk driver who allegedly crashed his van into a house was 
arrested Sunday after the angry homeowner chased him down and tied him up until 
police arrived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito Sanchez, 43, of North Hollywood was booked at Van Nuys Jail on 
suspicion of felony drunken driving, said Los Angeles Police Officer Lee 
Glozer. Sanchez's bail was set at $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Sanchez allegedly rammed his van into a car, injuring one person. 
Police did not say how seriously the victim was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez then backed up and drove another 200 feet and crashed into a building, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing away again, Sanchez then plowed into the living room of a two-bedroom 
house owned by Manuel Bermudez in the 11500 block of Saticoy Street. Bermudez 
said his wife, Sara, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The van's impact produced a hole in Bermudez's living room wall about five 
feet square. Bermudez said his wife was hurt when a couch was knocked into the 
chair she was sitting in. She later was treated at a clinic for leg and back 
pain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bermudez said his two children and two young guests were also in the living 
room at the time of the crash, but were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that after hitting the house, Sanchez bolted from the van and 
began running west on Saticoy Street. Bermudez gave chase and caught the 
suspect about 100 yards from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 He tackled Sanchez and hauled him back to his home, where, fearing that the 
driver might escape before police arrived, Bermudez and a friend tied him to a 
post supporting the front porch, giving him a mild case of rope burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want him to try and escape, and when the police arrived they said it 
was OK that I tied him up," Bermudez said.

SCHOOL PLAN SPARKS BITTER DISPUTE; EDUCATION: A PROPOSAL TO CHANGE ATTENDANCE 
BOUNDARIES HAS RESIDENTS OF SAUGUS AND CANYON COUNTRY TRADING INSULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this quiet, affluent city in northern Los Angeles County, a vocal and 
sometimes vicious debate has been touched off between residents of two of its 
primary communities by proposed changes to school attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute, which some have termed class warfare, pits Saugus residents 
against their neighbors in Canyon Country, with both sides trading insults 
about the other's community. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the matter is a reconfiguration plan that the William S. Hart 
Union High School District must make to accommodate the opening of a new high 
school in Valencia and a junior high in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the district's initial plan, students living in Saugus' upper Bouquet 
Canyon neighborhood would shift in 1995 from Arroyo Seco Junior High School to 
Sierra Vista Junior High School in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has upset many Saugus parents who want their children to stay in 
their neighborhood schools -- including the wife of a city official. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we wanted our kids to go to Canyon Canyon (schools), we would've moved 
into Canyon Country. We would've paid $50,000 less for our homes and sent them 
to some of the worst schools," said Patti Kolin, whose husband, Jeff, is Santa 
Clarita's deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolin and other Saugus parents struck a spark to the powder-keg issue earlier 
this month when they strongly criticized Canyon Country at a public meeting 
held to discuss the boundary changes. Residents of Canyon Country -- the city's 
easternmost community -- were characterized as lower income, less ambitious and 
transient. 
</P>
<P>
 Their remarks created a hot wave of indignation among Canyon Country 
residents, who in turn harshly criticized their Saugus neighbors in phone calls 
to the city's mayor, the public works department where Kolin's husband works 
and the local Signal newspaper, which prints a column featuring anonymous 
call-ins from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The derogatory remarks made by Patti Kolin regarding the citizens who live in 
Canyon Country speak clearly to her lack of education, to say nothing of her 
lack of humanity," read one published call. 
</P>
<P>
 "And to read that her husband . . . is deputy city manager makes her ignorant 
and bigot-filled remarks highly intolerable. We would like to remind Mrs. Kolin 
that the citizens of Canyon Country, the same citizens she snubs her nose at, 
contribute greatly to her family's 'upwardly mobile' income." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson said he has received 15 to 20 phone calls on the topic 
-- more calls than any other single issue has generated in his two years on the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict is in sharp contrast to the cooperation among neighborhoods that 
followed the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, Pederson said. Nevertheless, he 
believes the conflict is an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reject the argument there is a class warfare going on between communities," 
said Pederson. "I don't think it has anything to do with one district thinking 
it has better schools than another." 
</P>
<P>
 As a city official, Jeff Kolin has been the target of much of the criticism. 
Kolin said he received about 15 calls and other messages passed on through the 
city switchboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The calls that I've received have been people who wanted to know if my wife's 
views are the same as my views or the city's views," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he does not agree with his wife's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolin said most callers have been understanding once he talks with them, 
explaining that the vehement responses demonstrate residents' deep feelings for 
their children, community and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of great concern for a lot of people through the community," he 
said. "This community and valley is a really unique place. It (has) much more 
community involvement, participation and pride than any other community I've 
worked in." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart officials are still wrestling with the emotional topic, modifying the 
original plan to give students more opportunity to transfer back to their old 
campus. A final vote on the new attendance boundaries is scheduled March 9 by 
the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Hart officials say their campuses are unique, but uniform in 
their quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canyon (High) is better than Saugus (High) in some ways. Saugus is better 
than Hart in some areas. Hart is better than Canyon Country in some ways," said 
Lew White, district facilities director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an obligation to make each one of our schools a good one. And, in 
fact, we have upheld that obligation."

4 DIE IN O.C. AS CARS IN 2 RACES CRASH

 High-speed street racing over the weekend killed four young men, authorities 
said Sunday, one after a competition on the Riverside Freeway and three others 
after a chase through the streets of Santa Ana ended in a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead ranged in age from 17 to 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first incident, three people were killed late Saturday night when they 
decided to race some friends in a second car to a party, and the vehicles took 
off south on Grand Avenue, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cars -- police are not sure which -- hit a third car that wasn't 
involved in the race and sent it spinning out of control. The driver of that 
car, who was not identified, escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two rival cars, a gold Dodge and a black Buick, continued along Grand 
Avenue, and eventually both drivers lost control and struck a power pole in the 
1000 block, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodge ripped apart on impact, killing three of its occupants and seriously 
injuring a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified two of the dead as Alberto Valdez, 29, and Abraham Perez, 
26. No addresses were provided, and the identity of the third man who died was 
not released. Jose Rocha Perez, 24, was reported in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the three occupants of the second car fled but later 
turned themselves in to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine Cruz Rodriguez, 24, whose address is unknown, was arrested on 
suspicion of felony hit-and-run driving. According to police, the survivors 
said they had been drinking before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the cars were traveling at a "high rate of speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no statistics on the numbers of people killed and injured 
in racing incidents, CHP officials said Sunday that they have investigated 
several deadly cases in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Angel Johnson said dispatchers receive calls virtually every day 
about motorists turning stretches of the county's busy freeways into speedways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a game of tag," Johnson said. "We see so many situations where one 
vehicle passes another. The driver of the second vehicle feels challenged and 
responds by racing the other" vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have other situations where friends get in separate cars and race each 
other to see who has the fastest car," Johnson said. "It's amazing that people 
risk their lives this way, but it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 The second fatal race happened early Sunday. CHP officers said the contest 
between a black Chevy Camaro and a white Ford Mustang ended in a 1:40 a.m. 
crash that killed Vahey Shahinian, 17, of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the two cars weaved in and out of traffic eastbound on the 
Riverside Freeway at speeds nearing 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cars approached the freeway's intersection with Imperial Highway in 
Anaheim, the Mustang suddenly cut in front of the Camaro and slammed on the 
brakes, CHP officials said. Shahinian swerved the Camaro to the right to avoid 
hitting the Mustang and lost control of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camaro ricocheted off a guard rail and a light post, then plunged down a 
30-foot embankment, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shahinian was killed instantly and his passenger, Christopher Sarkissian, 15, 
of Anaheim Hills, was treated for minor cuts and bruises. Both were wearing 
seat belts. It wasn't known Sunday whether participants in the first crash were 
buckled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkissian said later Sunday that he was horrified when he saw the Mustang 
swerve in front of his friend's vehicle before coming to a stop.

 "We had a choice of flying into him or trying to make the Imperial Highway 
exit," Sarkissian said. "My friend (Shahinian) tried to go for the exit but we 
flew off the side and flipped over. I was hoping that none of us were going to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the accident, my friend was stuck between the driver's and passenger's 
seat and his body was all the way to the back of the car," Sarkissian said. "I 
checked for his pulse. He was already dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkissian, a sophomore at Canyon High School in Anaheim Hills, said he and 
Shahinian were returning to Sarkissian's home when they were challenged to race 
by the driver of the white Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Shahinian sped up to about 85 m.p.h. to elude the Mustang, which later 
zoomed past at about 100 m.p.h. before its driver hit the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkissian described Shahinian as a junior at Montebello High School and an 
A-student who was making plans to study engineering at Claremont College. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a problem he would do anything in his power to help you," 
Sarkissian said. "He takes your problems on his own shoulders. He was so 
attached to his friends. We were like brothers, best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials are looking for the driver of the Mustang, who they said fled. 
CHP Officer Johnson, a traffic investigator, said it appeared that the drivers 
of the cars did not know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP is asking that anyone with information about the white Mustang 
involved in the Sunday crash contact Officer Ron Brame at (714) 547-8311.

PROJECT 'REACHES OUT' TO PREGNANT ADDICTS; INTERVENTION: O.C. PROGRAM SEEKS TO 
PREVENT ABANDONMENT OR ABUSE BY TEACHING MOTHERING SKILLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Four months pregnant and dangerously underweight, Kathryn Chinn called her 
husband from a Newport Beach motel and left a message on the answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, she told him, deep into her latest speed binge. She had been 
away the last few days partying with a couple who had hired her as their 
personal masseuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kenneth Chinn was worried about the welfare of his wife and unborn child, 
and called Orange County child abuse authorities for help. Social worker Raquel 
Amezcua went looking for Chinn at the motel that same day last September. But 
by the time she arrived, the 23-year-old Fountain Valley woman was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Amezcua continued to track the young woman from run-down apartment 
buildings to garages to city parks. Eventually, her doggedness paid off. Three 
weeks later, Chinn signed up for a little-known federal intervention program 
called the Abandoned Infants Assistance Project and began to turn her life 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 15, she gave birth to a healthy 6-pound, 15 1/2-ounce daughter named 
Koralynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of punishing pregnant addicts for past misdeeds, the program tries to 
prepare them for the rigors of motherhood in the hope they will be less likely 
to abuse or abandon their children once they give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Known locally as Advance Outreach, the program is one of four in Southern 
California and 32 nationwide. Administered by the Orange County Social Services 
Agency, the program also serves a small number of pregnant, HIV-positive women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reach out to the women and pursue them, and when we see a spark of a 
desire to do life differently, we are there to fan that flame and make it 
stronger," says project director Mary Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time, the social workers help women meet the most basic of needs, 
directing them through the bureaucracy toward food, shelter and clothing. 
During the women's pregnancies and after delivery, counselors teach parenting 
skills as fundamental as when to take newborns for medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 Where gentle persuasion fails, social workers use a more forceful approach. 
Some might call it coercion, but Kathryn Chinn says it has worked for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew she was there to take my kid away if I didn't stay off drugs," Chinn 
says. "But then she made me realize I really did want to stay clean for me -- 
not for no kid, not for no husband, not for nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 By helping women get off drugs, successful intervention programs give children 
a shot at healthy childhoods. They are spared the traumatic experience of 
bouncing between foster homes or spending parts of their childhoods in 
institutions -- a sometimes brutal existence that can be linked to criminal and 
other antisocial behavior later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 From a public policy standpoint, the $450,000 Orange County program and its 
counterparts around the nation save millions of tax dollars that otherwise 
would be spent on long-term care for drug-addicted babies, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are referred by law enforcement authorities, relatives, psychiatrists 
and hospitals; even bartenders have been known to call when they notice an 
obviously pregnant woman guzzling drink after drink. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome their clients' preconceived notions of them as uncaring home 
wreckers, Amezcua and other counselors act as mothers, girlfriends and 
therapists rolled into one. They carry beepers that put them just a phone call 
away when a woman is going through an emotional crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 They coax the women to doctors' offices for pre- and post-natal care -- 
sometimes driving them to their appointments and sitting in the examining room 
to reassure them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors might sometimes be prejudiced against a client that has a tattoo to 
hide the track marks on her arm," said Amezcua, explaining why some clients are 
hesitant to seek medical care. "So we try to help them get through that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinn said she was first introduced to drugs -- specifically marijuana -- in 
9th grade. She "lost control" later that year, she said, when she began 
experimenting with "crank" -- a derivative of methamphetamine. Chinn's 
relationship with her mother and stepfather grew increasingly stormy. She 
dropped out of school, ran away from home, and wound up in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, she met her husband, Kenneth, who drank heavily. Five months later, 
they married and in 1991, she got pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kathryn Chinn stopped taking speed during that first pregnancy, she 
said she continued to smoke marijuana. Her husband tried in vain to discourage 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would always make jokes about (the baby) coming out with a pot leaf on his 
thumb or that something would be wrong with him," Chinn said. "But I didn't 
even think about pot causing birth defects." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the birth of her son, Kory, in January, 1992, Chinn said she 
started doing speed again. Things came to a head about a year later, when she 
moved out, leaving her husband with Kory and $200. The child now lives with 
Kathryn Chinn's parents, who have legal custody of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Chinn -- who had become a Jehovah's Witness, stopped drinking and 
landed a job as a waiter at an upscale restaurant -- began calling every 
government agency he could think of to get help for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, someone at the county Health Department referred him to Amezcua. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no visible signs of pregnancy and she was well into her fourth 
month," Amezcua says, describing her first meeting with Kathryn Chinn. "She was 
living behind a Bank of America building." 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, suffering from a severe kidney infection, Chinn went to a 
local hospital and asked for something to eat. About three weeks later, she 
made an appointment to see Amezcua. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to helping Chinn with her health and social service needs, Amezcua 
began to advise the couple about their marital problems. "Raquel has been like 
a counselor between us and made us realize that we can be friends," Kathryn 
Chinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been just over three months since Chinn took her last hit of speed, she 
said. So far, says the pediatrician who delivered Koralynn, the baby appears 
perfectly normal. But the Chinns know that only time will tell. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Assn. for Perinatal Research and Education, about 
375,000 newborns were exposed to illegal drugs in the womb last year -- more 
than one-fourth of them in California. Many are born addicts and suffer from 
withdrawal, low birth weight, stunted growth, respiratory difficulties and 
congenital defects. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some estimates, medical treatment, foster care and special 
education for one of these children can average $400,000. In contrast, an 
outpatient treatment program for a pregnant woman on drugs runs about $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the women are a difficult population to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the women in the local program are addicted to hard-core drugs like 
heroin and cocaine, and have rap sheets dating back to their early teens. Quite 
a few have other children that the courts ordered placed into foster care 
because of neglect or abuse. Some are HIV-positive. And, as if that weren't 
enough, a lot of the women are also homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Program officials are still in touch with just over half the 107 women they 
oversaw in 1991, the first year of the program. They have lost contact with the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 In 67% of the cases that social workers are still monitoring, the child is 
still living with the mother, said Harris, the program director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aim for the hardest cases," she said. "These are not women pregnant with 
their first child who are getting involved with drugs for the first time. We 
get a lot of older women who have finally gotten tired of this lifestyle and 
realize they want to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Whitlock, a 38-year-old Santa Ana woman, is one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, I was just tired of being tired," Whitlock said recently, as she 
nuzzled her one-month-old son, Devin. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing on the couch in her Santa Ana apartment, the mother of five talked 
confidently about her progress battling a six-year addiction to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 She talked frankly about another son, now 3 years old, who lives with foster 
parents. He has a severe learning disability, she said, because she used 
cocaine during the pregnancy. She talked regretfully about the 6-year-old 
daughter who she has not seen in years because the child's father took her out 
of the state while Whitlock was in jail on narcotics charges. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the jail last June, Whitlock began attending a substance abuse 
workshop known as Great Escape. Amezcua was one of the discussion leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 When Whitlock was released in August, she joined Amezcua's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other parenting programs are not as effective because it's hard to sit among 
the same elements and go near the same places where you used to buy drugs," 
Whitlock said. "Mrs. Raquel is a one-on-one counselor. I consider her a friend 
and I can discuss anything with her." 
</P>
<P>
 But their relationship was put to the test one recent afternoon when the 
social worker showed up at Whitlock's apartment for a scheduled appointment and 
Whitlock wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative who answered the door said that Whitlock had left the baby in the 
care of family members. But, he said, he had no idea when she would be back. 
</P>
<P>
 When two days had passed and Whitlock still had not returned home, Amezcua 
began to fear the worst. According to social workers, the first 60 days after 
delivery is the time that a woman is most likely to abandon her child. 
</P>
<P>
 Amezcua and her supervisors held an emergency meeting. They decided that if 
Whitlock did not return soon, they would file a child abuse report recommending 
that Devin be removed from her home and placed in protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock returned the next day. She told Amezcua that she had left suddenly 
for Tennessee because of a family emergency. She said her sister in Chattanooga 
had almost overdosed on heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock went to Tennessee, where she grew up, to make arrangements for her 
sister's seven children. She was angry upon her return to learn that Amezcua 
had thought she might have started using drugs again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really got ugly about that and (when) I saw Raquel, I started chewing into 
her," Whitlock said. "But it's like she said, it's not like a relapse can't 
happen. I ended up apologizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some women's periodic relapses into drug use complicate the attempt to 
determine how successful the program has been. Critics dispute the notion, for 
example, that teaching women parenting skills will alter the complex web of 
social ills that leads to child abandonment. Even program supporters believe 
that the federal government should be doing more to monitor the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last few years there's been more and more money, but my concern is 
that a lot of it is being thrown out without a lot of specific questions being 
answered," says Dr. Ira Chasnoff, a Chicago physician who has studied the 
effects of drugs on newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, nobody has really decided what effectiveness means. Does it 
mean the mother is drug-free and she is keeping the baby? Does it mean she does 
not abuse the child? Or does it mean that the child has normal, long-term 
development?" But those questions aren't easy to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the programs are voluntary, none of the women undergo drug testing as 
they do in court-ordered drug treatment programs. Social workers can only hope 
the women are telling the truth when they insist they are drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Chinn considers herself one of the success stories. But despite her 
determination to stay clean, temptation lurks around every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every two or three weeks, it'll never fail, I'll run into someone from my 
past and (Kenneth) gets a little edgy. He thinks that maybe they'll say the 
right thing to get me back out there," she said. "But the first thing I say to 
them is 'I'm clean and sober.' " Helping Hand 
</P>

124 drug-addicted or HIV-positive pregnant women prepare for motherhood. More 
than half, 56%, completed the course. A profile of those in the federal

POSTAL CARRIERS UNLEASH FRUSTRATION OVER DOG ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Marching, chanting mail carriers were out in force making an unusual Sunday 
morning delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 They were delivering a message dear to postal carriers' hearts -- and other 
parts of their anatomy: "Keep your dogs locked up. They bite." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Postmaster Alyce Alford, who led the march of letter carriers and their 
families, said the protest was intended to heighten public awareness of dog 
attacks on mail carriers, which she said is on the rise in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in Garden Grove seemingly has a dog," Alford said, as the 100 
protesters quick-stepped a one-mile route through the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Garden Grove mail carriers have been bitten in as many months, according 
to Alford, who was once chased up a fence herself by a pursuing mutt that 
latched onto the seat of her pants. 
</P>
<P>
 A Garden Grove carrier suffered permanent injury to his leg in a 1989 attack 
that left him using a cane and reassigned to a desk job. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1993, 2,733 carriers nationwide were injured by dogs. Although 
injuries are on the decline nationally from a peak in the frantic dog-bite days 
of the 1980s, postal carriers have only their wits, their satchel and an 
apparently not-quite-effective pepper spray to keep the hounds at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They eat the spray, they drink the spray, the spray doesn't hurt them," 
Alford insisted as she led the marchers on a route through quiet residential 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the letter carriers bothered to bring their spray cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good would it be to bring the pepper spray? It's glorified salad 
dressing," Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most participants were from Alford's Garden Grove post office, but they were 
joined by some of their dog-weary brethren from Huntington Beach. Regardless of 
where they deliver mail, the carriers seem to share experiences like that of 
Laura LaMagna. 
</P>
<P>
 LaMagna displayed scars from a Weimaraner that clamped his teeth onto her 
forearm during a delivery last Christmas Eve. The dog was being led on a leash 
by a 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain was so excruciating," said LaMagna, 40, a four-year veteran of the 
Postal Service. "When I see a dog now, I don't take any chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal authorities can withhold mail delivery, even bypass an entire block, if 
a serious threat is perceived, Alford said. But such tactics are a last resort 
and can be avoided if pet owners keep their dogs inside or otherwise secured 
during mail delivery hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the early hour on Sunday (the protest march began at 10 a.m.) or 
maybe the chanting scared away the strays, but only one dog was spotted roaming 
loose, and the procession drew only an occasional bark from behind fences and 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine and Dale Weise came outdoors when they heard the marchers' commotion, 
but their pet Chihuahua and a chow remained behind a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dogs "get out once in while, like everybody's," Dale Weise said. "But 
the mailman and mail lady usually know our dogs by name." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, mail carriers like Jean Morby believe the dog problem in Garden 
Grove is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the nature of dogs," said Morby, 62, who has raised German shepherds, 
owning as many as 12 at one time. When she or her co-workers urge residents to 
keep their dogs secured, it's for good reason, Morby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog owners' "famous last words are: 'My dog won't hurt you,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not too long ago a pit bull on a leash in a front yard broke loose from 
its choke chain and knocked Morby to the ground, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started right up the ankle, five bites," Morby said. "When (I was) on the 
ground and fighting to reach the (spray), he's biting away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very painful."

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN FATAL STABBING; SLAYING: POLICE ANSWERING REPORT OF A 
BREAK-IN CHASE A MAN WHO FLED OUT THE WINDOW OF THE VICTIM'S APARTMENT IN 
HUNTINGTON BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder Sunday after police saw 
him jump out the window of an apartment where a man was fatally stabbed, 
according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the suspect as Anthony Paul Koudssi. He was being held 
without bond Sunday at the Huntington Beach jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's name had not yet been released Sunday afternoon pending 
notification of relatives. Police said he lived in a ground-floor unit at 
Woodlake Apartments, 6100 Edinger St. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the apartment complex at 9:34 a.m. when a caller 
reported a man trying to break into an apartment through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 The window is visible from heavily traveled Edinger Street. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, a window screen was on the ground and they heard a 
struggle inside the apartment, according to Lt. Charles Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness said he heard the police shout for whoever was inside the 
apartment to come out with hands up. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers prepared to force their way into the apartment, the suspect 
kicked out a second window, jumped out and ran, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police chased the suspect into another set of apartments behind the Woodlake 
complex. Poe said he was later found hiding in an apartment at 16072 
Springdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers entered the Edinger Street apartment and discovered the victim 
lying face down, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not have a motive in the case. It was not known whether 
Koudssi and the victim knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the well-tended apartment complex across the street from a strip 
shopping mall described the victim as a quiet man who lived alone and kept to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't speak a lot of English but he was a cool guy," said Vince Romer, 
17, an upstairs neighbor. "An old lady fell and broke her hip once out by the 
pool a couple of months ago and he helped carry her back inside to her 
apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were visibly shaken by the slaying, including a woman who had just 
signed a lease to move in April 1. She said she had come by Sunday morning to 
pay the security deposit. On the way out of the manager's office, she stopped 
to find out why policemen were standing guard outside one of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there's another vacant apartment now but there's no way I'd take that 
one," she said. "I'd never move into a place where I knew the person before me 
had died."

TRYING FOR A CLEAN BREAK; PERSUADING CHRONIC OFFENDERS TO GIVE UP DRUGS, GANGS 
IS AIM OF JUVENILE HALL PROGRAM, WHICH HAS HAD MIXED RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of Chuck's closest friends was strangled in a gang fight.  
</P>
<P>
 Two more of the 18-year-old's friends were poisoned with cyanide-laced speed. 
Another was shot and killed by a rival gang member. A fifth died of a drug 
overdose. And one died in a drunk-driving accident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chuck seemingly missed all those warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 While living out his teen years in Orange and Los Angeles counties, he 
threatened to kill others, took stolen cars on joy rides, and roamed the 
streets looking for enough speed to keep him awake for a week at a time. He 
dealt drugs and "was fascinated" when the people he had bilked of drug money 
hunted him. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Chuck was arrested about a year ago for the sixth time since the age 
of 14 -- this time on an extortion charge -- he broke down crying in front of 
authorities. The multiple felon had finally touched bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck's collapse was exactly what Norman Shattuck, 54, was waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck, assistant director at Juvenile Hall, placed the burned-out teen-ager 
in the Breakthrough drug treatment program. There he joined 21 other teens of 
both sexes whose lives ran on the fuel of drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with more than 11 months under his belt, Chuck is the senior member of 
Breakthrough, the only program operated inside the walls of Juvenile Hall that 
is designed to separate the county's hard-core drug addicts from their criminal 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has saved my life," said Chuck, whose real name is not being 
published because he is in the custody of juvenile authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County probation officials say they need this program to succeed 
because more than half of the county's juvenile crimes have been traced to a 
small number of chronic offenders -- most of them in gangs or drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the numbers show that 8% of youths who enter the Orange County 
juvenile justice system account for 55% of the crimes committed, Shattuck said. 
Breakthrough is tailored to that unfortunate 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Started with a $248,000 federal grant in 1992, the program singles out a small 
number of incarcerated youths. Those who have been admitted into the program 
have an average age of about 17 and have been arrested an average of about five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the program, the offenders are separated from the rest of the 
Juvenile Hall population and put into a special wing where their lives are 
regimented, monitored and kept free of drugs and gang rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different than anything that has been done before," said Shattuck, who 
has worked in the county Probation Department since 1964. "It is not the 
solution to everything, but it sure is helping a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Success has been mixed. Since the program's first day of operation 17 months 
ago, 75 youths have been placed in Breakthrough and 45 have "graduated." Of the 
graduates, though, about 30 have subsequently lapsed back into drug and alcohol 
use or were arrested again. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results, which Shattuck said are "a little disappointing," illustrate 
the difficulty of getting these teen-agers to free themselves from the two 
things -- drugs and gangs -- that have become obsessions in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers most likely to graduate are generally those whose lives have 
bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the kid does not want to try," Shattuck said, "then we can't do diddly for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will only take those who are serving at least a 140-day sentence 
because any less time in the regimented confines of Breakthrough is simply not 
enough to make a difference. Marla Hamblin, a public defender, has even agreed 
to a lengthier sentence for some of her youthful clients so that they can get 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is intense," Hamblin said. "They can accomplish some of the same results 
in four or five months that most drug treatment programs take a year to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have been through Breakthrough say it is no country club. Because it 
is drug free, there is a long list of rules and everybody has to attend school 
every day -- except Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis in this program is on education," Chuck said. "It is the key to 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have entered the program unable to recite the alphabet, but have left 
with the ability to read. Chuck and 19 others have earned their General 
Equivalency Degrees and six more are now attending college. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The world of Breakthrough is a sparse and sober existence: a common living 
area with a weight machine, books, couches and decorated walls. A community 
bathroom is next door. And a narrow concrete hallway lined with heavy doors 
leads to tiny cells, one for each person. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarm is set for 6 a.m., and everyone eats breakfast half an hour later. 
Classes start promptly at 7:50. After four hours of school and then lunch, 
afternoons feature "encounter sessions" in which the teen-agers seek to 
confront painful problems head on. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions amount to a series of emotional and confrontational exchanges 
among participants about common troubles, such as addiction, anger, guilt, 
deceased friends, pregnant girlfriends and abusive parents. The aim is to help 
youths confront their greatest obstacle to recovery: themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff is a new lifestyle marked by sobriety, honesty and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our counselors are really" confrontational, Chuck said. "They strip off all 
the armor that you have built up from years of drug use. You are naked." 
</P>
<P>
 Relationships between the youths and their counselors generally begin with 
manipulation and distrust, but develop into a tighter bond. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some leisure time left over for reading, lifting weights, and to use 
pay phones to make collect calls. But at 9 p.m., it's doors locked, lights out, 
eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first nights there, Chuck slept on the floor of his cell so that he 
could not fall out of bed when the speed withdrawals hit him with a sudden 
force. But during his yearlong stay, Chuck has undergone a physical and mental 
metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here, I was like a skeleton," he said. "I would look in the mirror 
and say, 'Is that me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 While he lived on speed, the tall, blond youth wanted it more than food. But 
once inside the program, he gained 40 pounds from eating three meals a day. 
Chuck is now two months from release. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every person like Chuck in the program, there is an anti-Chuck, the 
one who is jerked off the street while committed to gangs and drugs, and sees 
little reason to change. 
</P>
<P>
 These teens consider gangs glorious and drugs wonderful. With so many hours 
spent in various drug treatment programs, they "speak the lingo" that 
counselors want to hear, as if by rote, and are uninterested in snapping out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "About half of us make it, and about half don't," Chuck said. "I have been 
using drugs since I was 13. You cannot turn that around in 90 days." 
</P>
<P>
 As hard as it is inside, the real test comes when youths work back toward 
their freedom on the outside. Often, Shattuck says, minors become increasingly 
terrified as their release date nears. For a person who was raised in a violent 
home in a crime-ridden neighborhood, being sent back is like being "sent to 
hell," Shattuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the eight-person staff helps them find mentors and jobs, and 
will even buy them monthly bus passes once they get out so that they can attend 
Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Miller, assessment counselor who places youths in the program, said that 
a lack of support after release can undo months of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is always the Achilles' heel of the system," Miller said. "One thing 
about drug addict behavior is that they are used to taking shortcuts. We (get) 
them off drugs and dealing with their behavior only to send them back." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, it is up to each youth to keep clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck plans to move in with his volunteer mentor because his mother and two 
older brothers have never forgiven him for all the pain he has caused. He plans 
to take classes at a local college to become an emergency paramedic and write 
short stories. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, Chuck has cut his gang affiliations. He has let it be 
known among the homeboys in his street gang that he was banished to the 
California Youth Authority to serve a seven-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to sever all ties," he said. "They think I am gone." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a way, he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading chronic offenders to give up drugs, gangs is aim of Juvenile Hall 
program, which has had mixed results.

DEDICATED ORGANIZATION USES ITS CLOUT TO SUPPORT BLACKS; RACE: CALLED 100 BLACK 
MEN, IT SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT CONCERNS OF THE COUNTY'S SMALL AFRICAN AMERICAN 
COMMUNITY ARE HEARD. ONE OF ITS FIRST ACTS IS TO DEMAND PROBE OF DEPUTY'S 
SHOOTING DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 They appeared on the scene suddenly, startling many among Orange County's 
power elite and serving notice that racial insensitivity, especially toward 
African Americans, would no longer go unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 They call themselves 100 Black Men of Orange County Inc. Although currently 
they are only 29 in number, they have the clout to back up their words. Among 
them are judges, politicians, educators, lawyers, journalists, ministers, 
physicians and entertainment moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, they say, they have contacts across the nation and they aim to 
use those contacts to further the collective cause of the African American 
community in Orange County. But don't get them wrong, they say. They are not 
here to bully anyone into political correctness or blind acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, we want to enhance the quality of life of African Americans and other 
minorities in Orange County," said the group's president, Eugene M. Wheeler.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, one of 37 chapters organized in 24 states, received its charter in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 Black Men concept was born in New York in the early 1960s. Former New 
York City Mayor David Dinkins, then Manhattan borough president; baseball great 
Jackie Robinson, and other black men formed the first group to seek justice by 
using the political power of its members, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 Black Men of Orange County already has some influential members, said 
Wheeler, a health care administrator who owns his own business. Among them are 
UC Irvine Vice Chancellor Horace Mitchell; Warner Bros. Vice President T.C. 
Newman; corporate attorney David Fields; Baptist minister and magazine 
publisher Randall Jordan, and college professor Ernie Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's creation had gone largely unnoticed in the county until recently, 
when, together with other black organizations, the group demanded an 
independent investigation into the Christmas Day shooting death of Orange 
County Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, who was black, was shot by fellow deputy Brian Scanlan, who is white, 
during an impromptu training exercise behind a Lake Forest movie theater, 
authorities say. Investigators have looked at the possibility that he was shot 
in the head while he played the part of a suspect during a routine traffic 
vehicle stop. Scanlan was using a loaded weapon during the drill in violation 
of department policy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, investigators said the evidence indicated the shooting was 
an accident. But the black coalition, concerned that the lack of details coming 
out had fueled the perception that race could have figured in Robins' death, 
pressed authorities. The group also questioned whether there was a conflict of 
interest in the district attorney's office investigation of the Sheriff's 
Department because both agencies often work closely together. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members said their demands seem to have been answered recently when the 
district attorney turned over the probe to the Orange County Grand Jury. The 
19-member panel will begin its investigation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The newfound prominence of the black community in a county where blacks are 
outnumbered by whites nearly 100 to 2 can be traced directly to the involvement 
of the 100 Black Men of Orange County, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the group's creation, he said, rarely, if ever, were the voices of 
Orange County's black community raised in defense of a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Robins case, Wheeler said, "we've gotten results in ways we cannot 
yet totally appreciate. Those who are in charge of government (in the county) 
now know that we are not passive, know that we can make them accountable to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the group, however, say its approach to the Robins case has left a 
bad taste with the county's law enforcement community. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would resent it if the police started telling them how to run their 
business, yet they claim to know how police business should be run," said 
Robert McLeod, general manager for the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeod said the group hurt the families of the officers involved by 
insinuating that "this was some kind of a deliberate act." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for 100 Black Men say they only want justice to prevail in the 
Robins case. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the group, however, goes beyond being a watchdog, said member 
Jordan, who is the editor of the monthly magazine The Black Orange, which 
serves the county's black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be a plus for your community, you got to get your house in 
order, then you can look at other people in the eye and say, 'Can we fix that?' 
" said Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why, he said, "we're extending our hand, looking to build strong young 
black men and women" by providing scholarships, leader-training programs, role 
models and career planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said he hopes this will happen once the group gets on its feet. He 
said the group's involvement in the Robins' case came at a time when its 
members were preparing for their first retreat in April, at which time they 
expect to come up with a plan of action for scholarships and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious circumstances surrounding Robins' death pulled the group into 
the fray. What followed stunned the group's members, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started getting all these calls from parents, some school officials, the 
Asian community, Latinos," Wheeler said. "They all had problems they wanted us 
to help them with. It's like they were saying: 'Thank God, here's Moses!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has problems they would like to see resolved," he said. 
"Unfortunately, we're not geared up to do all the things we would like to do. 
Everybody has high expectations of us and we do too, but we have a timetable. 
We're less than one year old and we're in a period of organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said that in the meantime, the group is forming alliances with other 
black groups to push for changes in a regional society that he said has largely 
ignored black culture and where "subtle" racism rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between Orange County and Los Angeles or Detroit or Miami is 
that Orange County has, over the years, been very subtle about the racism that 
goes on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the county's schools as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black children in our schools are suffering experiences that are 
psychologically bad," he said. "The parents are trying to help their children 
get over (racism), but there's no support system in the schools when it comes 
to a racist situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher does not understand the black child. She reprimands him, then 
suspends him, and then, when the child becomes resentful and develops an 
attitude, he is tagged as a 'troublemaker.' It's a Catch 22 for the child, but 
not for the schools, which are supposed to know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Wheeler said, "if something doesn't (change) soon, Orange County 
is going to get a wake-up call worse than the 6.7 earthquake that hit Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some school officials in the county concede there are racial problems in the 
schools and say they are willing to meet with the group to work on solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Fleming is the superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School 
District, which has a student population of 32,000, 1% of which is black. He 
said recent problems at Aliso Viejo Middle School, where black parents have 
accused administrators of racial insensitivity, suggest the need for a new 
approach to cultural diversity throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to meet with the group and hear their suggestions," said 
Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, civil rights organizations in the county, black and white, 
have welcomed the group with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People 
honored the group as its African American Citizens of Distinction on Friday. 
And Fran Williams, chairwoman for the county's human relations board, said the 
group brings a new voice to the community "that hopefully will be a strong one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see (them) as a very positive force in the community and we anticipate 
working together with them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said David Fields, corporate attorney and group member: "My only hope is that 
our voice becomes better known within the community and that there's a greater 
understanding of who we are and what we aim to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully," he said, "as people get to know us a little bit better, the 
number of cooperative relationships -- as opposed to the counterproductive ones 
-- will increase and flourish."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY NEGOTIATING SPLIT FROM LIBRARY SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has authorized the city attorney to begin negotiating with 
the county to make it the first city to separate from the county library 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a rancorous four-hour special meeting last week that included an 
angry confrontation with a county library official, the council appointed City 
Atty. Peter M. Thorson to head the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorson's job will be crucial: He needs to persuade the county to turn over 
the portion of Mission Viejo property taxes that currently are spent to run the 
local branch library. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, some council members said, they will not support taking over the 
county branch library in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 A city study recently found the local branch is undersized and residents are 
not receiving adequate library services. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff was also asked to refine a recent city report on the county-run 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members asked staff to come up with more data on the costs of running 
the current facility and a planned 25,000-square-foot library. 
</P>
<P>
 The council spent the first three hours of the meeting discussing the report, 
which outlined problems caused by the tight confines of the 9,155-square-foot 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also gave a basic estimate of what Mission Viejo could expect to 
pay to run the current building and the planned library. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting heated up in the final hour when county librarian John Adams 
challenged some of the report's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, compiled by El Segundo head librarian Barbara Pearson, failed to 
mention several operating costs, including expenses for equipment maintenance, 
insurance, legal advice and burglar and fire alarms, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot missing in this model budget," he said to the council. "This 
report is incomplete. . . . You have not been provided with (the cost 
information) you need." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams added that it would be "significantly cheaper" for the county, with 27 
branches under its umbrella, to run the local library. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have produced conflicting figures on operating costs for the 
branch library. The city report estimated that the branch could be run for 
$837,000 annually, but Adams has said operating costs for the local branch run 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams has said city taxpayers paid about $800,000 into the library system 
during the 1992-93 budget year, while city officials put that figure at about 
$980,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members asked Adams to acknowledge that Mission Viejo taxpayers were 
supporting other libraries in the county system and criticized the county for 
not providing Pearson and city staff with exact cost figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never received the kind of service we have paid for," Mayor Susan 
Withrow said. "The truth is, Mission Viejo taxpayers have been subsidizing the 
(county library system) for a long time. We want you to admit that." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams maintained that local taxes earmarked for the library do not cover 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 When City Manager Fred Sorsabal pointedly asked him for "truthful" figures for 
the research requested by the council, Adams replied sarcastically: "Would you 
like me to stand on a Bible?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sorsabal indicated the research requested by council members would be ready in 
45 days. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; DISPATCHERS' SYSTEM GOES HIGH-TECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gone is the pen and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer do police dispatchers write down calls for service or type the daily 
log. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Police Department communications dispatch center has gone 
high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no more hard copy and the new computer-aided dispatch system makes 
their job a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went from Barney Rubble to the Jetsons -- we left the Neanderthal system," 
said Dominic Savino, a dispatcher for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer system went on-line earlier this month, streamlining the 
dispatchers' workload and improving police service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows them to process and manage the calls of services from citizens and 
the field patrol units in a much more efficient manner," said Police Chief 
Richard M. Tefank. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris O'Neal agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who has been a dispatcher for 12 years, said a dispatcher's priority 
is to get calls for service to officers quickly -- and the computer equipment 
is expected to improve response time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dispatchers save seconds and seconds save lives," O'Neal said. "I think now 
we're getting a handle on seconds to get those calls out." 
</P>
<P>
 With the computerized system, instead of tracking down an officer when a call 
for service comes into the dispatch center, the computer keeps track of where 
officers are in the field, their availability and how long they have been on a 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has eight full-time dispatchers and two part-time dispatchers 
who handle an estimated 350,000 incoming emergency calls and non-emergency 
calls for service a year, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Rich Ciampa, a watch commander, said the computer technology helps 
him do his job better. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciampa oversees patrol units and the day-to-day operations of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 He now has a computer terminal at his desk from which he can continually 
monitor the activities of patrol officers and crimes as they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 He can watch calls that are waiting service, calls that officers are working 
on and review calls from earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my standpoint, it makes things a lot more convenient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank also said the system soon will also be used to track and total 
statistical information and other data. 
</P>
<P>
 By this spring, the records-management system is expected to be in operation, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will allow us to capture all the information regarding crime reports we 
process and information on arrestees," he said, adding that police reports will 
be stored on optical disks, rather than written on a piece of paper and stored 
in a file. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, computers will also be placed in police cars to allow officers to 
"talk" to dispatchers electronically, access databases on suspected criminals 
and motorists or conduct other information searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank said the city spent about $1.2 million to computerize the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The new computer equipment was part of the overall plan to update the 
department's communications capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a new dispatch center was built and opened next to police 
headquarters to accommodate the high-tech equipment and improve working 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Memory is a good skill for a dispatcher to have," O'Neal said. "But I always 
felt people's lives shouldn't depend on that." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WORKSHOPS PLANNED ON DIAL-A-RIDE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Able-bodied senior citizens may be forced to ride buses instead of calling the 
county's Dial-A-Ride van if proposed cuts in van service are approved this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority is holding a series of public 
information workshops -- with the first sessions scheduled this week in 
Anaheim, Garden Grove and Laguna Beach -- to hear from the elderly and to 
provide information on the proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved in May, the cuts would discontinue Dial-A-Ride's door-to-door 
service for able-bodied senior citizens beginning in June and would increase 
the cost of van transportation for the disabled from $1.50 to $2 per ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts are the result of the increased demand for transportation from the 
disabled, OCTA spokesman John Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is required by the federal Americans With Disabilities Act to 
provide accessible public transportation to the disabled, and the high cost of 
the program makes it necessary to cut back on other services, Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first information meeting on the cuts was held last week in Fullerton, 
where 76 senior citizens attended to learn who would qualify to ride the 
disabled access van. 
</P>

 "They say if you can walk two or three blocks to the fixed routes, then you're 
not qualified for the disabled van," said Tom Schumacher, a senior citizen 
activist who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have heart problems, and it's hard for them to walk that far," he 
said. 
</P>

 Standiford said OCTA will try to help seniors determine if they are eligible 
for the disabled van and welcomes public comment on the proposed cuts during 
its May 9 meeting.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY WILL AWARD AMBULANCE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will award one of three competing ambulance firms a franchise 
to cover emergency services in a decision scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two points separating the three companies in a rating system 
developed by the Orange County Fire Department, city staff has recommended the 
contract be given to the incumbent vendor, Southland/Lifefleet Ambulance 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, city staff said that Southland's performance has 
been good and "because of the closeness of the scores that resulted from the 
(evaluation) process . . . staff is recommending that the City Council enter 
into an agreement with Southland/Lifefleet." 
</P>
<P>
 Southland's contract with the city, which allows it to bill customers directly 
for ambulance service, expired in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been operating on an interim basis while the Fire Department 
developed and carried out the evaluation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies applying for the franchise include Medix Ambulance Service and 
Doctor's Ambulance Service. 
</P>
<P>
 All three ambulance firms were rated on a 1,050-point scale that included 
performance categories such as response time. 
</P>
<P>
 Medix was rated the highest, with 996 points. Doctor's and Southland/Lifefleet 
each accumulated 994 points. FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 14th annual free tennis camp for disabled children will be held at 
Saddleback College from March 29 to April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Children between the ages of 7 and 18 are eligible for the Junior Wheelchair 
Sports Camp and must register before March 15 to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day event runs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and includes free lunch and bus 
transportation to the college for all campers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tennis, campers will learn or improve skills in other sports, 
including archery, basketball, track and field, and aquatics. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to participate should have good use of their upper body and 
self-help skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their counselors are disabled athletes who will serve as both role models and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis, the camp receives 
donations from the city, service groups and a handful of corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 youths from Orange and Los Angeles counties took part in the camp 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they need community and corporate sponsors for a benefit golf 
tournament that will be held in Coto de Caza on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Private donors and those seeking applications for the tennis camp may call 
(714) 361-6811 for more information. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; TONIGHT'S MEETING TO FOCUS ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Chief Manuel Ortega, County Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez and several other 
speakers will talk to parents about crime at a community information meeting 
tonight at 7 at Valencia High School. The scheduled topic is "Parents Against 
Crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The event had been planned for several weeks, but the recent slaying of former 
Valencia High student Cathy Torrez has heightened concern about crime in the 
city, and event planners are expecting a large turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's body was discovered Feb. 19 in the trunk of her car, which had been 
parked at Placentia Linda Community Hospital for several days. She had been 
missing since Feb. 12, when a co-worker saw her drive off about 8 p.m. from a 
parking lot near the Sav-On drugstore where they both worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cathy's death has so touched the community that I know we're going to have a 
lot of people here asking a lot of questions about crime in this town," event 
planner Shelle Bilhartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilhartz said organizers originally anticipated that about 300 people would 
attend, but now are setting up for 700. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was planned by the school's Parent, Teacher and Student Assn. to 
discuss ways parents can combat crime, Bilhartz said. Gangs and gang-related 
crimes were to be the focus of the evening, but Torrez's abduction and stabbing 
death may now dominate discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's slaying "has become the topic in town," Bilhartz said. "It will 
probably be the focus of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers include a former gang homicide investigator and Bert Blyleven, a 
former pitcher for the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be in the Valencia High auditorium, 500 N. Bradford Ave.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SCHOOL DISTRICT PICKS NEW SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Walter has been named superintendent of the Garden Grove Unified School 
District effective Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter, 58, was approved unanimously by the Board of Education at a meeting 
earlier this month. He replaces Ed Dundon, who retired in December after 20 
years in that job. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dick Hain said after the meeting that Walter's wide range of 
experience as a counselor, principal, administrator and business manager made 
him a perfect choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Walter fitted exactly what we need. We feel very confident in his 
capabilities. . . . He understands the diversity of the student population we 
have and is a student-oriented superintendent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter, a district administrator for more than 25 years, has served as acting 
superintendent since Jan. 1. Before that, he was the associate superintendent 
for business services. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he is looking forward to the challenge the job offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge job because it's such a large district. But it's a job that I 
think I've been preparing for for a number of years in terms of experience, 
educational background and my interest and desire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter will be responsible for the daily operation of Garden Grove's largest 
employer and the 11th-largest school district in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 41,340 students attending district schools in Garden Grove and 
portions of Santa Ana, Anaheim, Westminster, Cypress, Stanton and Fountain 
Valley, spokesman Alan Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter said his immediate goals include meeting with administrators, parents 
and teachers districtwide to discuss the district's strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 He said school programs and services are excellent but the district should do 
more to encourage parental involvement in children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on that with things like parent education classes and meeting 
with groups of parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter began his career in 1958 as a math teacher in Detroit schools. He moved 
to California as a guidance counselor in 1964 and later became assistant 
principal at Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as principal at several local schools and joined the district 
administration as a business manager in 1981, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from the University of 
Michigan and his doctorate in school administration from UC Riverside. JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY'S DECISION ON TRASH FEES POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a need for more information, the City Council has decided to postpone a 
controversial decision on whether to raise fees for sanitation services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was supposed to decide last week whether to tack on $1.87 to 
monthly sanitation bills, which average about $12 for a single-family 
residence. The fees would help pay for the city's material recovery program, 
designed to help the city meet a state mandate to divert 25% of its garbage 
from landfills by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to reconsider the fee increase on March 15. This is 
the second time in as many weeks the council has postponed a decision on the 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy presentation from city staff Tuesday night, council members 
said they needed more information before voting on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, council members said they wanted the staff to clarify how 
the city would use a material recovery facility in the future and whether the 
council has any latitude in setting the amount for a fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will bring back more information that is easier to understand," 
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said. "It's a very complex issue." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of the approximately 50 Orange residents in attendance spoke 
against the proposed fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxes are like termites," Betty Roberts said. "If you don't stop them, you 
won't have a home." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they probably will not charge residents to pay for a weed 
abatement program. If the council drops the weed charge, the proposed fee hike 
would fall to about $1. 
</P>
<P>
 The council warned residents, however, not to interpret the delay as 
opposition to the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at it," Councilman Mike Spurgeon said. "It's not going to go 
away. We can't just stick our head in the sand. We are going to have to pay 
some figure."MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY PASSES AMNESTY PLAN FOR BUSINESS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved an amnesty program that will allow 
business owners to pay a delinquent business license tax without penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which will be in effect from April to June, is also intended to 
encourage unlicensed businesses to obtain permits without fear of prosecution 
or payment of past penalties, officials said.The council adopted it last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city collected $8,500 under a similar program that also helped 
identify unlicensed businesses, according to Dana Ogdon, a senior planner at 
the Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogdon said there are about 5,500 licensed businesses in the city, but many 
more may be operating without a license, particularly those based in private 
homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A business license is necessary before a business is allowed to operate. The 
business license tax ranges from $25 to $100, depending on the estimated annual 
gross income of the business. The business license is renewable every Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The business license tax, which is different from a sales tax, goes to the 
city's general fund and helps pay for police, fire and other services, Ogdon 
said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY RELEASES REPORT ON QUAKE READINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The vast majority of city structures were built with seismic safety in mind 
and probably would fare well during a major temblor, city officials said in a 
report on earthquake readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was prepared in the wake of the Northridge earthquake and was 
presented to the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspectors did express concerns about the more than 200 
"concrete tilt-up" warehouse structures that could experience substantial 
damage during a large quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the "tilt-up" warehouses are in the Irvine Business Complex, a 
district of office towers, commercial buildings and industrial sites at the 
western edge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The concrete buildings can be retrofitted to resist a quake by bolting the 
walls, floors and ceilings together. Such retrofitting is required for 
warehouses that are converted into meeting rooms for churches and other groups. 
Retrofitting is voluntary for all other businesses. About 13 of the tilt-up 
structures have been retrofitted so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine probably would sustain decidedly less damage during a major quake than 
did the San Fernando Valley because most of the city's structures were built 
after 1974 and had to comply with strict quake building standards, City Manager 
Paul O. Brady Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no non-reinforced masonry buildings in the city and very few older 
single-family homes that are not bolted to their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residential parts of Irvine have little susceptibility to liquefaction, 
according to data from the California Division of Mining and Geology. Some 
parts of the Irvine Business Complex have a slightly higher susceptibility, 
according to the data.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; TWO MASSAGE PARLORS ARE DENIED PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has rejected permit applications for two massage parlors 
because they are too close to neighborhoods and areas used by children. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert J. Davis represented the owners of Oriental Therapy East at 
1525 Mesa Verde Drive and Mesa Acupressure at 2845 Mesa Verde Drive, which have 
been operating for two years without the proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his clients were unaware they needed special permits when they opened. 
Because massage businesses are considered adult entertainment, a 
conditional-use permit is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had tried to get the permits on Dec. 13 at the Planning Commission 
meeting but was denied. The Police Department recommended against giving a 
permit to either business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not one police problem," protested Davis to the council at a 
hearing last week. "Not one police complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents Arthur Goddard and Charles Robertson, president of the Mesa Verde 
Homeowners Assn., voiced their opposition to the massage parlors at the 
meeting. "Ignorance of these regulations is no excuse," Robertson said. He 
called the businesses "inappropriate in their present location." 
</P>
<P>
 City ordinances require adult-entertainment businesses to be at least 500 feet 
from houses and more than 1,000 feet from schools, parks, public buildings or 
places likely to be used by minors. Both businesses have until March 13 to 
close their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joe Erickson said he tried to visit Oriental Therapy East to see 
what services the business offers but was not allowed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also unanimously passed a temporary ordinance to make it harder to 
open an adult-entertainment business in the city. The ordinance is intended to 
be in effect until the council passes a permanent ordinance this summer.

 Hoping to deter high school students from throwing and attending parties where 
alcohol is available, the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District board 
has established a hot line for reporting such parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action came at the request of the Esperanza High School Parents, 
Teachers and Students Assn., which also is urging police to adopt a policy of 
breaking up parties where alcohol is served to minors and then notifying 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement agencies don't always break up parties" where alcohol is 
being served to minors, PTSA President Rose Howard told the school board last 
week. "And they don't usually report these parties to parents." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to asking police departments to toughen their enforcement of 
underage drinking laws, Howard said, the PTSA is enlisting the help of parents 
and local liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "One goal is to educate parents and ask them to take a zero-tolerance stance," 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization also has asked liquor store owners to require their employees 
to ask for identification for alcohol purchases from anyone who appears to be 
under 30 and to train employees to spot fake identifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the district hot line, (714) 996-6040, will be forwarded to police. 
The hot line also can be used to report graffiti on school property, students 
with weapons or drugs and other potential problems on any of the district's 
campuses. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; SCHOOLS TO EXPEL ANY CARRYING WEAPONS

 La Habra City School District board members last week gave final approval to 
revisions in a policy that prohibits students from bringing weapons to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the board's vote, students who violated the policy could face 
expulsion.Now violators will be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice now," board member Antonio Valle Jr. said. "If (students) 
have guns, they will be expelled even if we think they are good kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Added board President Nancy S. Zinberg: "The students have the choice. They 
don't have to violate" the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Two students have already been expelled since school began this year, district 
officials said: an 11-year-old for threatening to use a knife to hurt other 
children and a 13-year-old for carrying a knife hidden in a hand brace. MIMI KO

SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS RAISING BUILDING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District has narrowly approved an increase in 
fees for commercial, industrial and residential construction within its 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last week, the Board of Education voted 3 to 2 to raise 
fees on commercial and industrial projects from $1.65 to $1.72 per square foot 
and on residential building from 27 cents to 28 cents per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Mendoza, Audrey Yamagata-Noji and Robert W. Balen voted in favor of the 
fee increase. Trustees Rosemarie Avila and Tom Chaffee opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, Santa Ana Unified and other school districts that receive 
matching building funds from the state may collect fees from developers. 
However, the money raised must be given to the state, and districts that do not 
charge developers the maximum allowable rate must make up the difference, said 
Bob Giritz, district controller. 
</P>
<P>
 As it does every two years, the state recently increased the maximum rate to 
keep pace with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the district failed to pass that increased cost along to developers, it 
would have risked about $28,000 a year at the current rate of local 
development, Giritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot more riding on this than meets the eye," Balen said, 
pointing out that if the local economy recovers and development surges, the 
district could stand to lose more than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee said he opposed the plan because voters rejected a ballot proposition 
last November that would have let stand a similar increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Giritz said that new fees will become effective in July.

BOY, 3, FATALLY HURT WHEN HIT BY TRUCK IN FRONT OF HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy was fatally hurt Sunday when hit by a pickup truck as he 
darted into the street in front of his home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, identified as Derek M. Tolentino, died of head and abdominal 
injuries, police Lt. William C. Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 3:05 p.m. in front of the boy's home on Demion 
Lane. Stuart said the boy apparently darted from between two parked cars in 
front of his home and into the path of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek was rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he underwent emergency 
surgery. But he died about three hours after the accident, Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart said the pickup's driver, identified as 23-year-old Michael T. Newell 
Of Huntington Beach, was not cited and did not appear to be the cause of the 
accident.

SOME IN WESTMINSTER CLUB DISLIKE CITY MOVE; RECREATION: OFFICIALS TRANSFERRED 
THE SENIORS FUN CLUB MEETINGS TO A SMALLER ROOM. SOME SAY THEY'RE 'PACKED LIKE 
SARDINES,' BUT THE CLUB PRESIDENT SAYS ONLY A FEW ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE NEW 
LOCATION.

 Andrea Youngjohn, 95, says attending the Tuesday meetings of the Westminster 
Seniors Fun Club isn't much fun anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're packed like sardines," said Youngjohn, one of several club members who 
are upset that Community Services Department officials "forced them out" of a 
large room in the Community Services building that the club had been using for 
the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which has about 160 members, now meets at the dining room of the 
adjacent Senior Center that Youngjohn and other club members describe as too 
small and too noisy. And it lacks amenities such as free coffee and tea, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But club President Billie Godsey said that an "overwhelming majority" of club 
members are happy with the move and the complaints come from a "small minority" 
of disgruntled members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always hard to move," Godsey said. "But we're getting adjusted. It's a 
warmer and friendlier place. We're more comfortable here. The people who are 
complaining are impossible to please." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Goyne, the city's senior services supervisor, said that several seniors 
groups, including the American Assn. of Retired Persons, were asked to hold 
their meetings at the Senior Center instead of at the Community Services 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a twofold thing," Goyne said. "We wanted to consolidate all seniors 
programs at the Senior Center, and we wanted to free up the room (at the 
Community Services building) for other community groups." 
</P>
<P>
 While seniors used the room -- which accommodates more than 200 people -- 
without charge, other community groups are charged from $18 to $73 an hour, 
according to Charlene Lent, assistant community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 The room also can be rented for weddings and business meetings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Services Director Penny Loomer said that the city is planning to 
renovate the Civic Center complex on Westminster Boulevard, including the 
Community Services building. The renovation was scheduled to begin last year, 
but the project has been delayed while city officials try to find the money to 
finance it. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Perryman, a former Westminster Seniors Fun Club treasurer, said club 
members were told of the proposed renovation last year, but she said they were 
forced to move even though the renovation has not yet been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we ask is a decent place to meet," Perryman said. "Give our room back, 
because we've used it for 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Myrtle Funderburg, 85, said club members are worried that the Senior Center 
dining room may be unsafe. "Our club is too big for that little room," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Godsey said the dining room, which seats 148 people, is just the right 
size for the weekly meetings, attended by about 90 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fire Department and city officials will never jeopardize the lives of 
anyone by overcrowding the meeting room," Godsey said.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; AFTER JOYFUL GAMES, A PLEA FOR PEACE; CLOSING 
CEREMONY: AS THE WORLD SAYS GOODBY TO LILLEHAMMER, SAMARANCH SAYS THAT SARAJEVO 
IS NOT FORGOTTEN. 
</P>

<P>
 The XVII Winter Olympics, the most celebrated of these Games despite -- or 
perhaps somehow because of -- an attention-grabbing sideshow, passed joyously 
into history here Sunday night amid a moving plea for peace in another Olympic 
city and another for respect for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Olympic flame died in the Lysgardsbakkene ski-jumping arena, the 40,000 
spectators in the stadium switched on flashlights in a silent plea for peace in 
war-torn Sarajevo, host city of the 1984 Winter Games, and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the program, International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio 
Samaranch hushed the exuberant crowd when he said, "Ten years ago we were in 
Sarajevo. After many horrors, the situation now seems to be improving. Let us 
hope that this (17-day-old) truce -- to which, in our very limited way, we may 
have contributed -- let us hope that this truce will turn into lasting peace. 
For us, and also for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, cheers ringing around him, he added, "Dear Sarajevo. We do not forget 
you. We will continue to support you." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Liv Ullmann and explorer Thor Heyerdahl, hostess and host for the 
opening and closing ceremonies, alternated in reading the Declaration of Human 
Rights, Ullmann delivering the final line, "We have the right to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Heyerdahl intoned, "The Olympic flame here at Lillehammer has been 
extinguished, but we know this flame will never die. It will burn forever, in 
different places around the world. . . . In the meantime, let us continue in 
the tradition of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Woven into a stylishly choreographed fantasy, the solemn messages lent serious 
meaning to an outburst of song and Norwegian folklore that matched the tone the 
Games had sustained for two weeks, even while sharing the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The development-a-day story of figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan 
commanded much of the media's attention here, simply because it was too bizarre 
to be ignored. It began in Detroit on Jan. 6, when an attacker clubbed Kerrigan 
in the knee with a metal baton before she could skate in the national 
championships, knocking her out of that competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan recovered and was named to the Olympic team, winning a silver medal 
behind Oksana Baiul of Ukraine and then heading off to Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, implicated in the plot against Kerrigan, sued the U.S. Olympic 
Committee and was allowed to compete, but she did not fare as well as Kerrigan, 
finishing eighth. She commanded attention right to the end, however, when she 
broke a skate lace in warm-ups before her free program, was late getting to the 
ice, then had to interrupt her program to get a replacement lace and was given 
a re-skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all that going on, however, the Games more than held their own. 
Enthusiastic, flag-waving Norwegian crowds packed the skiing and skating venues 
in unprecedented numbers and the sound of the cowbell was heard in the land. 
Television ratings, particularly in the United States, were among the highest 
in history, as people tuned in to catch the latest Tonya-Nancy development and 
stayed tuned to see what else was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was a lot going on. Dan Jansen slipped in the 500 meters, but 
finally got his gold medal and a world record in the 1,000 in men's 
speedskating. He carried his daughter around the rink and carried the flag in 
the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Blair became the greatest female U.S. medalist of all time with two 
more golds. Norway's Johann Olav Koss set three world records to show who was 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. skiers had one of their most successful Olympics. Tommy Moe won the 
downhill and was second in the super-G. Diann Roffe-Steinrotter won the women's 
super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Turner even managed to turn short-track speedskating into pro wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Samaranch in congratulating Lillehammer and the country, "To you, the 
people of Norway, it is my great honor to say that you are the real winners of 
these magic games. You have presented to the entire world the best Olympic 
Winter Games ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegians couldn't help but agree. Suddenly, the spectators were singing 
"Seieren Er Vaar," the Norwegian victory song, just as they had been doing for 
two weeks during the Games.

MIKE DOWNEY: OH, DEER, HE'LL MISS THIS PLACE

<P>
 Well, everything about Norway and its people turned out to be an absolute 
delight, including that 27th letter of the alphabet of theirs that looks like a 
NO SMOKING sign. What kind-hearted and generous individuals they are here, even 
if they do spell my first name something like Mii&!%jkkke. 
</P>
<P>
 I had not known what to expect, having read somewhere that Norwegians were 
frowners and scowlers who had a high rate of suicide. My perception of a 
Scandinavian has always been someone whose idea of a good time was watching Max 
von Sydow play chess with Death. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what warm hospitality I found here in the North Pole suburbs. I will 
miss these people, particularly the young woman who asked me what sort of 
sports awaited me back home. When I told her that Dominique Wilkins was now 
living in Los Angeles, she replied, "Really? Does she ski?" 
</P>
<P>
 I will miss Norway's creatures, too. I will miss the reindeer. They have 
reindeer here like we have cats. There are reindeer here, reindeer there, 
reindeer everywhere. Reindeerkeep fallin' on my head. 
</P>
<P>
 I will miss moose. This is my first experience missing moose. Well, actually 
it's my second experience missing moose. Yesterday I missed one, but I was in a 
Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
 I also will miss the king. I saw the king a lot. I saw the king at hockey, at 
skiing, at skating, at sledding and in a sleigh. I think I saw him in line at 
the sno-cone counter once. This King Harald really gets out of the castle a 
lot. I became a veteran Harald examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Winter Olympics themselves, they commenced with Tommy Moe in the 
snow, continued with Tonya Harding joining us in mid-show, then concluded with 
Alberto Tomba on the go. It was 16 days of Tommy, Tonya and Tomba. With a lot 
else in between, which we'll be bringing you next on CBS, right after these 99 
trillion words from our sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 In hockey, Sweden defeated Canada, either in a shootout, with a penalty shot 
or in an Ugliest Uniform tiebreaker, I forget. Sweden's hockey uniforms were 
yellow. They should have gotten two minutes for clashing. 
</P>
<P>
 In biathlon, the guys with guns defeated the guys without guns, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In bobsled, Americans were asked to take their sled, Rosebud I, and stop 
shoving it. It seems somebody put illegal runners on the bottom of the sled -- 
possibly those Ginsu runners you've heard so much about. 
</P>
<P>
 In luge, Italians and Germans were the winners and Americans were the lugers. 
</P>
<P>
 In speedskating, Bonnie Blair brought her big family from south of Chicago, da 
Blairs. She won again and again, winning over everyone with her ability, her 
durability, her dedication, her work ethic and her wonderful person-next-door 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 In speedskating, the sequel, Dan Jansen skated the lap we've all been waiting 
for, a victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
 In speedskating, the final chapter, one Johann Olav Koss, the Nordic Air 
Jordan, won races, won money and won respect around the world for donating 
every penny of his prize to Olympic Aid for Bosnian relief.  
</P>
<P>
 In skiing, Sports Illustrated's Olympic preview issue reported that the U.S. 
team would have difficulty beating Switzerland's cows, much less Austria's 
skiers. Sports Illustrated is better with issues in which people wear fewer 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 In cross-country skiing, somebody passed a tree, then another tree, then 
another tree. 
</P>
<P>
 And in figure skating, uh, let's see, figure skating, figure skating, uh, did 
they have figure skating? I can't seem to . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah. Now I remember. In the men's competition, Brian Boitano came out of 
retirement long enough to wish that he hadn't come out of retirement. Jayne 
Torvill and Christopher Dean ice-danced the most superb, beautiful, skillful, 
tasteful, seamless routine that ever got judged third-best. (You were golden in 
my book, you two.) And barely-old-enough-to-drive Oksana Baiul overcame 
obstacles galore and Nancy Kerrigan's brilliance to win the women's gold with 
effort and grace. Ya got guts, kid. But watch out for Michelle Kwan next time. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news Sunday, Kerrigan and Harding said absolutely nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I leave you now with two last thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Lillehammer has been nominated to possibly host these Olympics again in 
the 21st Century, and, by all means, it should. Norway, hooray. 
</P>
<P>
 And two, if you really want to feel old, at the 2002 Olympics, Michelle Kwan 
will be 21.

FOREIGN MISSION; PARK HOPES TO BECOME FIRST KOREAN IN MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Each night before he sleeps, Park Chan Ho from South Korea puts on his headset 
and turns on his audiocassette tape, awakening each morning with a new sentence 
or phrase in English to try out on his American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not, however, learn "Hey, dude" from the tapes. Nor "Hey, man." Those 
expressions of pop culture came from Dodger players, who are doing their part 
in the Americanization of Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who taught him to say, 'Hey, dude,' but they told him to say 
hello to me in a team meeting, and he said, 'Hey, dudu,' " Eric Karros said. "I 
said, 'It's not dudu, it's dude.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott, who trains in the morning with Park in martial arts, recently 
started teaching him nicknames. But when it came to "Beach," coach Mark 
Cresse's nickname, Gott carefully stressed the long 'e'. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, the Dodgers held a Western barbecue at Dodgertown, and Park 
got caught up in the moment, wearing a cowboy hat and bandanna. At one point, 
he briefly did the twist with Manager Tom Lasorda -- to country western music, 
no less. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, Park, a 20-year-old right-hander, unleashed his talent on the 
mound, pitching in his first game -- albeit intrasquad -- as a Dodger. It is 
Park's fastball that gets the attention, and for good reason -- it has been 
clocked at 99 m.p.h. in South Korea. He didn't throw that fast Sunday, but he 
was good enough to get Mike Piazza on a called third strike with a fastball on 
the outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also has a good curveball, a good slider and a good forkball," said Ron 
Perranoski, pitching coach. "I liked how he did today, he mixes pitches and 
mixes location, and he knows how to handle himself on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who faced the regulars, went over a scouting report with Lasorda before 
the game. But after he walked leadoff batter Delino DeShields, catcher Tom 
Prince approached the mound to go over signs. Halfway there, he remembered to 
summon Park's constant companion, interpreter Don Yi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous because I thought Brett Butler was leading off, but it 
was Delino DeShields," Park said through an interpreter. "But after I struck 
out Mike Piazza, I felt more confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Park had a game-high three strikeouts in two innings. Tim Wallach took a 
called third strike and Raul Mondesi followed with a strikeout swinging. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has such great body control, and in his delivery, he drives hard off of 
his back leg, much like Tom Seaver did," said Rod Dedeaux, former USC baseball 
coach who is spending some time at Dodgertown. "The average pitcher doesn't 
have the kind of balance that he does. And that high leg kick is deceiving." 
</P>
<P>
 A student of Hapkido martial arts training in his home of South Korea, Park 
has about five deliveries to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell he didn't grow up pitching in the United States of America," 
DeShields said. "The way he changes his delivery, he has different looks, and 
that is confidence. I'm not an expert, but I think the Dodgers have something 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 After pitching Sunday, Park didn't really want to talk with reporters, 
preferring to think about his performance and talk the next day. Orel Hershiser 
-- who started for the regulars and has taken an active role in helping Park -- 
went over to him after they finished and walked with him to the clubhouse. 
Hershiser waved to the cheering crowd, Park bowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem we have with Chan Ho is trying to keep him from doing too 
much," said Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 One day Park got up and started throwing on the sideline, before somebody 
realized that he shouldn't. He had thrown the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has major league ability, as does (first-round draft pick) Darren 
Dreifort," Claire said. "To have two young arms like that means a lot to this 
organization. That's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Park's workout schedule here is less rigid than in South Korea, but he still 
gets tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling that I have to do well and also the weather, makes me a little 
tired," Park said. "In Korea, it's still winter, and here, it's like the middle 
of summer. I don't really feel pressure, but the idea that I have to succeed is 
always with me, so I feel like I have to try a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Signing with the Dodgers and leaving his country, where he was considered the 
best amateur, was difficult. But the eventual $1.2 million bonus negotiated for 
him by a distant uncle, Steve Kim of Los Angeles, made it all the more 
enticing.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard decision because I would be on my own and have to succeed on my 
own, but I realize now that there are a lot of people here to help me," Park 
said. "Also, I have thought about the United States -- the Los Angeles area -- 
ever since I pitched here in 1991. So, it was like coming to a second home." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger scout Bobby Darwin and scouting director Terry Reynolds first saw Park 
pitch in 1991 during a tournament at Dodger Stadium between the United States, 
Japan and South Korea. It was then Park also saw his first game at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember I was sitting on the fifth level of Dodger Stadium, and I almost 
fell over when Brett Butler leaned over the fence and robbed a home run," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with Park's consent, it wasn't easy for the Dodgers to sign him. In South 
Korea, every man must fulfill a two-year military obligation, which is deferred 
for students. When the Dodgers contacted Park, who was a sophomore at Han Yang 
University, he called Kim, who is an L.A. architect. Kim enlisted the help of 
Dodger President Peter O'Malley, who visited with officials in South Korea, 
trying to persuade them of the positive aspects of letting Park go. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first trip to Korea, the answer was no, then the second time I went there, 
the answer was no, then the third time, it changed," Kim said. ". . . Chan Ho 
will continue to be enrolled in school, which will defer him in the military. 
But we didn't have to pay money to anybody in Korea to get approval." 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Braves were also interested in Park, telling Kim they would match 
any offer, but Kim said Park wanted to sign with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier for him in L.A., and Peter O'Malley showed a lot when he went to 
Korea to meet with officials," Kim said. "We felt it was the right place for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 If Park makes it to the major leagues, he will be the first Korean to do so. 
Chul Soon Park signed with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1979, but advanced only as 
far as double A. 
</P>
<P>
 "My primary goal is to make it to the majors, and beyond that, I want to be 
known as a great baseball player in the United States," Park said. "This is a 
great opportunity and if there is a way, I would prefer for it to happen 
quickly."

ANALYSIS; ONLY ONE SIGHT TO SEE ON THIS TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like Disneyland without rides, the women's professional tennis tour is 
currently a flawed attraction. It is a weekly competition without any, match 
play with no matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the tour's Goliath, Steffi Graf, flicked away another of the tour's 
Davids, Amanda Coetzer, in the final of the $400,000 Evert Cup. The scores were 
6-0, 6-4; the crowd was a half-full 6,791 in the Stadium Court at the Hyatt 
Grand Champions, and the most drama for the media centered on who would win the 
pool on how long it would take Graf to win. The thought never occurred to 
anyone that she wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, it took Graf 57 minutes and the $33 pool was won by a writer 
from Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the current state of women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Perry, co-tournament director of the Evert event and an executive with 
the International Management Group (IMG) that is such a huge driving force in 
the sport, calls the current women's situation "a marketing issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, there's just a small group of top players," she said. "It's a 
serious issue in the women's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to put this is that, this week, Conchita Martinez took over the 
No. 3 spot in the women's rankings, behind Graf and Aranxta Sanchez Vicario. 
Needless to say, Conchita Martinez, a very fine player, is hardly a household 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 The blame for this can be traced directly to two people: Guenther Parche and a 
security guard at some mall in Tampa, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
 Parche is the German who leaped out of the stands in Hamburg and stabbed 
Monica Seles in the back nearly a year ago. Seles has yet to return to the 
tour.  
</P>
<P>
 The unnamed security guard is the one who decided to make a federal case out 
of some alleged shoplifted costume jewelry Jennifer Capriati had in her 
possession. That became such an embarrassing incident for Capriati that she 
left the tour and won't return until sometime this summer, after her high 
school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with Martina Navratilova playing her last full season of singles 
competition and hanging on at No. 4, and Gabriela Sabatini neither playing much 
nor well at the moment, you have players in the top 10 such as Kimiko Date of 
Japan and Anke Huber of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Graf as pretty much the 500-pound gorilla, and even the most 
sadistic ticket-buying fan will not put out much money, nor waste time watching 
a telecast of a sporting event that reminds them of the Alamo. For that, they 
have Buffalo in the Super Bowl every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Graf is aware of the problem that her excellence presents. When asked 
here Sunday about her reaction to the crowd's obvious favoritism toward 
Coetzer, she said: "I understand fully. If I bought a ticket for the match, I'd 
cheer for it to go longer, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But it seldom does, these days. The 24-year old German has not lost a set this 
year. Her winnings for 1994, two months into the year, passed $500,000 with the 
$80,000 she won in the Evert Cup. Since Parche stabbed Seles last April 30 and 
Graf lost in the final of that event, she has gone on to win 65 of 67 matches, 
including the last four Grand Slam events, the French Open, Wimbledon, U.S. 
Open and this year's Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with the way things are going for Graf these days, perhaps the most 
remarkable performance of the Evert Cup this year was turned in by Ginger 
Helgeson, the former Pepperdine player. She kept Graf out on the court for 79 
minutes, an amazing feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the current state of women's tennis.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; JAMAICANS ARE REALLY A HIT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was cool runnings, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those slapstick Jamaicans have gone serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception created by the movie will take a long time to uncreate, but 
this is a big step," driver Dudley Stokes said Sunday after his four-man 
bobsled team had finished 14th in the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jamaicans produced the 10th-fastest runs among the field of 34 in both the 
third and fourth heats and finished one place ahead of Randy Will in USA I and 
eight places ahead of a sledding power, Italy I, as they graduated to what is 
considered bobsledding's elite, the top 15. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a quick climb from their stumbling debut in the 1988 Olympics and 
distant finishes of 1992: 25th in two-man and 36th in four-man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's been a big joke," said Stokes, a helicopter pilot who has been 
with the team from the start. "People have had a lot of fun at our expense, but 
we take it in good spirits and use it as motivation. It's a real good feeling 
to do as well as we did here." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly, he said, to finish ahead of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a lot," Stokes said. "I know the American view is still to take us 
as a joke, which I don't appreciate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jamaicans have spawned a cottage industry of other sun-belt bobsledders -- 
Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Puerto Rico -- but their own climb gets tougher 
from here, Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Nagano (in Japan, where the 1998 Winter Games will be held), there is no 
reason we should not be a medal-contending team, but it's going to be as 
difficult to get from here to the top as it was to get from the back of the 
pack to here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take money, but I think we've shown that you get a return when 
you place your money with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes and friends will continue to receive residual returns from "Cool 
Runnings," having chosen long-term profits rather than an up-front payment. 
</P>
<P>
 A sequel? 
</P>
<P>
 "After this, we're open for offers," he said, laughing.

AT EL MODENA, WRESTLERS ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THEIR NEXT MEET; HIGH SCHOOL: FOUR 
VANGUARDS WILL COMPETE THIS WEEKEND AT THE STATE MEET IN STOCKTON TO CAP 
ANOTHER FINE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chemistry doesn't explain it. Talent is only part of the equation. Leadership 
isn't the answer, and coaching was the same as it has been the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the planets happened to be aligned perfectly? 
</P>
<P>
 No on all accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out what went so right for El Modena's championship wrestling team, 
the search ends at possibly the simplest, but certainly not the easiest, of 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pushed hard," senior Juan Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We trained hard and we worked hard," senior Chris Jaime offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids work hard," Coach Alan Clinton said. "It's the old, what have you 
done for me today, because yesterday doesn't count for much. You can't live off 
what you've done, because it's not going to get you far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids aren't dumb. They realize that if someone takes a vacation, it's going 
to cost the team down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Time off won't come until next week, after the last mat has been rolled and 
stored from the State tournament. So today, final preparations begin for the 
two-day event that ends Saturday at Stockton, where the Vanguards will send 
four wrestlers, including one Southern Section individual and Masters champion, 
a section winner and a Masters runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way there, El Modena won its second league championship, its first 
section team title and dual-team championship, and qualified seven athletes -- 
three were alternates -- for the Masters meet this past weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this was the first year for any section title, success under Clinton 
didn't come out of nowhere. The Cal State Fullerton graduate turned around 
Orange's program in 1982, then repeated the task at El Modena in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards went from 0-7 to 4-8 in his first year. In the past six seasons, 
El Modena has been ranked among the top 10, and has been rated No. 1 or 2 in 
the county in three of those years. In 1992, the Vanguards were third in the 
section and last year they were second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done something in a short time span and we've been consistent with it," 
Clinton said. "In the past six years, a (winning) tradition has formed. 
(Winning) is part of the natural plan, it's expected." 
</P>
<P>
 And with 16 returners, including nine starters, everyone expected this would 
be a banner year for El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone started getting better and better," senior David Wells said. 
"(Success) was expected, because during the season, there were a lot of people 
who did things we didn't expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells pointed to the surprising performances of Zane Koss and Dan Kingman, the 
Vanguards' 189-pounder and heavyweight. Koss, a senior who wrestled junior 
varsity last year, won a league title, and Kingman, an inexperienced freshman, 
finished second in league to a wrestler who took third in the section. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were awesome," Wells said. "That's the kind of thing that happened this 
year for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But along with the highs, there were some unwelcome lows. After a heady start 
and victories in back-to-back established tournaments in San Diego and Hawaii, 
a less-than-stellar showing in the prestigious Five Counties Meet and a 
lackluster 45-12 loss to Calvary Chapel made El Modena pause and think. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of slacked off a little in the middle of the season, and we realized 
we had to work hard again," Jaime said. "Yeah, they're powerful, but we could 
have done better. We started working even harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Should El Modena have an unsatisfactory State tournament -- it hopes to 
improve on last year's 12th-place finish -- it would look back at the rest of 
the season with mixed feelings of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't happen," Wells said in reference to a poor showing by the Vanguards. 
"We've been there before. We'll do well. If we don't, I'm not going to dwell on 
it the rest of my life. It won't be a crisis thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He even refers to his team's accomplishments from here on out as "bonus 
points," while Alvarez sees the Vanguards' State performance as a reflection of 
the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have a good State to have a good season," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the feeling the Vanguards are going to do many things at State, but 
falling flat on their faces won't be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 They've worked too hard to do that.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: BONDS GET HIT, BUT PROS ADVISE WAITING TO SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bond mutual funds, reeling from some of their worst share price declines in 
recent memory, fear that small investors' patience may be wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, most fund companies say the rise in market interest rates that has 
clipped bond values has sparked only minor cash outflows from bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But as investors focus on the probability that interest rates have finally 
bottomed after declining for five years, the risk is that a large chunk of the 
$750 billion in bond funds could head for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you hurry to sell bonds today, however, many experts advise patience: 
There may be a better time to bail this spring, once the current panic 
subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's crisis began on Feb. 4, the day the Federal Reserve boosted 
short-term interest rates by a quarter-point. It was a signal from the Fed that 
it is serious about restraining the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 What few investors had counted on was that longer-term interest rates, over 
which the Fed has no real control, would spiral higher with the small rise in 
short rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, for example, has shot up to 6.72% from 
6.31% on Feb. 3. And intermediate-term yields have risen even more. The yield 
on five-year Treasury notes now stands at 5.65%, up from 5.19% just before the 
Fed's shift. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, long-term yields shouldn't have been affected by the increase in 
short rates, because a moderately growing economy (the Fed's goal) would check 
inflation and money demand -- both of which should put downward pressure on 
long yields. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market hasn't followed Wall Street's script. Many professional bond 
investors have rushed to sell recently, driving yields up. Adding this latest 
rise to the spurt in long rates in November, bond yields now are nearly a full 
point above their October lows. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been an erosion in bond funds' share prices, because any rise 
in market interest rates devalues older fixed-rate bonds: 
</P>
<P>
 * The average bond fund that owns long-term U.S. government securities lost 
nearly 1% of its value in the seven days ended last Thursday, according to 
fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services.  
</P>
<P>
 * Year-to-date, the average long-term U.S. government bond fund has posted a 
negative total return of 1.25%, Lipper calculates. Total return measures the 
interest earnings of a fund plus the net gain or loss in its share price. 
</P>
<P>
 So a negative total return of 1.25% means that, even though a fund has been 
earning interest, the decline in its share price has more than wiped out that 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * The negative total return so far this year follows a fourth-quarter net loss 
as well for many bond fund owners. Lipper says the average long-term U.S. 
government bond fund had a negative total return of 0.36% in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds that own shorter-term bonds also have suffered, though less so, as 
yields have risen across the board. The average total return on short-term U.S. 
government funds (which own bonds maturing in one to five years) is a negative 
0.51% so far this year, Lipper says; intermediate-term government funds (5- to 
10-year bonds) have lost an average 1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: Few investors are making money in bond funds this year. What 
is unknown is how much individuals are willing to lose before they react. 
</P>
<P>
 But with long-term Treasury yields nearing 7%, and long-term corporate and 
mortgage-backed bond yields already over 7% again, some Wall Street pros 
believe rates are more likely approaching a near-term top than readying another 
big move up. This may be the wrong time to flee bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimists say the recent dumping of bonds has mostly been the work of 
so-called hedge funds and other trigger-finger investors, who tend to exit any 
investment at the first sign of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The hedge funds' selling of U.S. bonds also has been exacerbated by their need 
to unwind complex trades that have bombed, says William Dodge, investment 
strategist at Dean Witter in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In one common such trade, many hedge funds shorted the Japanese yen (i.e., 
they bet that it would drop in value), Dodge says. When the yen instead began 
to appreciate against the dollar, the hedge funds were forced to raise cash to 
close out their positions. The easiest way to raise cash is to sell U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 As that selling tapers off, investors should come to realize that the economy 
isn't hot enough to justify long-term rates much above current levels, Dodge 
and others say. That should allow long yields to ease again, at least slightly, 
going into the spring, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Barach, manager of the Enterprise Government Securities Fund in Los 
Angeles, says he figured the surprise early this year would be a sharp rise in 
long-term yields, so he positioned his fund accordingly. "But I think it's 
overdone now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With mortgage-backed bonds, such as Government National Mortgage Assn. issues, 
paying more than 7% again, that's a 4% real return if inflation holds at a 3% 
annual rate, Barach says. "Fundamentally, that's a pretty acceptable return," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some pros advise individuals who are heavy in long-term bond funds to 
gradually pare those holdings this spring, assuming rates come down again (and 
thus share prices rise). In a growing economy, with an "unfriendly" Fed, you're 
better off keeping your money in short- or intermediate-term funds from now on, 
says William Griggs at investment firm Griggs & Santow in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year Treasury note yields 6.20% now, Griggs says. A five-year T-note 
yields 5.65%. Considering the greater risk to the 10-year note's principal if 
interest rates continue to rise, the five-year note is a far better deal, he 
says.

THE CATELLUS DERAILMENT; OUSTER OF CEO IS LATEST CHAPTER IN SAGA OF STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS and CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news last week that the top executive at Catellus Development Corp. in San 
Francisco will resign is the latest twist in a long struggle by California's 
largest private landowner to turn nearly 1 million acres -- once owned by the 
nation's railroad barons -- into a vast real estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected departure of Catellus Chief Executive Vernon B. Schwartz was 
engineered by the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), 
officials close to the company and pension fund say privately. CalPERS owns 
more than 40% of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz declined to be interviewed. So did senior officials at CalPERS, the 
giant pension fund in Sacramento that invests the retirement money of more than 
800,000 of the state's current and retired workers. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS officials had been lobbying for drastic changes at Catellus because 
they were tired of seeing the company's stock go nowhere and of listening to 
management blame the firm's misfortunes on California's weak real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension fund has seen the value of its initial $473-million investment in 
Catellus cut in half in recent years. Even its financial adviser, who initially 
recommended that CalPERS buy the stock, now doubts that the fund can recoup 
these losses any time this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has turned out to be a catastrophe for investors, especially 
CalPERS," said Burland East, an analyst who follows Catellus for Kemper 
Securities in Chicago. "It's not all Catellus' fault -- there's plenty of blame 
to be spread around." 
</P>
<P>
 (The losses represent no danger to the health of the fund itself, East noted. 
CalPERS has assets that exceed $80 billion, making it the largest public 
pension fund in the nation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Catellus -- which transportation giant Santa Fe Pacific Corp. established as 
an independent, publicly traded company in 1990 -- is involved in about a dozen 
megaprojects from San Francisco to San Diego. It also owns more than 900,000 
acres of land across the state -- an amount twice the size of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 While Catellus' once-bright prospects have certainly been dimmed by 
California's real estate recession, it has also been hurt by forces ranging 
from slow-growth advocates to toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Catellus' joint-venture in the once-thriving Pacific Design Center in West 
Hollywood is suffering, as its wealthy clients have cut back their spending. A 
plan to build a massive mixed-use complex at downtown Los Angeles' Union 
Station has been caught up in controversy and legal disputes. So has another 
proposal to develop a 16-acre site in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Mission Bay in San Francisco, the company's most ambitious 
project -- and perhaps its most problem-plagued. 
</P>
<P>
 The 313-acre, $2-billion development would front the bay about a mile south of 
downtown and would be the largest in the city's history. Plans call for 8,700 
homes and more than 6 million square feet of offices, shops and 
light-industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project has languished on the drawing boards for years, as first Santa 
Fe and then Catellus wrangled with everyone from local no-growth advocates to 
government environmental officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservationists wanted the company to build fewer offices and preserve more 
of its wetlands. Housing advocates pushed for lower rents and cheaper selling 
prices. Environmental agencies wanted Catellus to clean up the toxic-laced 
site, which was previously used as a dump for everything from 1906 earthquake 
rubble to parts from old locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
 Catellus worked out a compromise with each of the groups and received the 
city's conditional approval for the project in 1991. But the permission came 
with so many strings attached that Catellus does not expect to break ground 
until next year at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mission Bay is a great project, but it has just taken too long to get it off 
the ground," said John Lutzius, an analyst who follows Catellus for Newport 
Beach-based Green Street Advisors. "And all the while the land just sits there, 
it's eating up cash without generating any income." 
</P>
<P>
 No one expected delays this long back in the 1980s, when Santa Fe started 
mulling the plan to establish Catellus as an investor-owned company to develop 
vast real estate holdings acquired in the previous 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the property stood in the middle of key transportation hubs, bustling 
commercial areas or fast-growing suburbs. Raw-land prices for less desirable 
parcels were rising as much as 20% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS first got involved in 1989 when, in a private sale of stock, it bought 
a 20% stake in Catellus at the urging of advisers at Chicago-based JMB Realty 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension fund paid $398 million for about 10.5 million shares -- or nearly 
$38 a share -- and also invested another $75 million in a convertible security. 
CalPERS felt the move was a smart long term investment that would pay off when 
the properties were developed. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late 1990, when shares in Catellus began trading publicly for the first 
time, California real estate prices had already begun their steep descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials at the pension fund had expected its Catellus shares to 
fall as much as 30% when trading began, the actual decline was a shock. 
Catellus shares opened at $11 and fell below $9 a short time later, costing 
CalPERS more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "CalPERS got blindsided," analyst Lutzius said. "They were looking at what the 
company's underlying assets were worth in the long-term, but Wall Street 
doesn't have that kind of focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to erase some of its debt and make borrowing for future projects 
easier, Catellus later asked CalPERS to exchange its convertible debt for about 
$141 million worth of additional stock -- a proposition that would push the 
fund's stake in the company to more than 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension fund agreed to the swap in 1993, some analysts say, simply because 
the note was due the following year and Catellus would have had difficulty 
paying it off. 
</P>
<P>
 But while CalPERS was publicly reaffirming its faith in Catellus, fund 
insiders say that they were growing increasingly frustrated with the company's 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Some complained that Catellus had fallen short of its optimistic financial 
projections too many times. Others questioned whether CEO Schwartz -- who kept 
the telescope in his 30th-floor office in downtown San Francisco routinely 
trained on the barren Mission Bay site nearby -- was really worth his 
$800,000-plus annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the company reported a $34.4-million loss for the first nine 
months of the year on revenue of $105.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The discontent came to a head last month, when William D. Crist, president of 
the pension fund's board of administration, fired off a letter to most of 
Catellus' board members. Although Crist and other key CalPERS executives 
refused to be interviewed, a copy of Crist's Jan. 14 letter was obtained by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Crist said that Catellus had repeatedly failed to meet its 
investment goals because they were apparently "made by financial people who 
have no knowledge of market conditions." Crist also complained that Catellus 
did not "have sufficient capital to meet its operational and development 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, Crist urged the directors to "take action as necessary to 
accomplish appropriate changes." Barely two weeks later, on Feb. 1, Schwartz's 
resignation was demanded by an 8-4 vote of the directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz won't talk about his ouster. Catellus only announced his pending 
departure last week, saying he will remain with the company through the end of 
June while a search for his replacement continues. He'll also get $450,000 cash 
as severance pay and stock options that would net about $75,000 if they were 
exercised today, a Catellus spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, JMB Realty is urging CalPERS to make even more changes at Catellus. 
In a Jan. 21 letter also obtained by The Times, JMB Vice President Pat Meara 
told CalPERS that Catellus should embark on an aggressive cost-cutting plan 
among other actions to improve its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Meara would not return telephone calls. But his letter said that even if most 
of those changes are adopted, JMB estimates that "the stock won't trade above 
$15 per share in 10 years, and could well stay flat from today's $7.75 price." 
Catellus' shares closed Friday at $7.875. 
</P>
<P>
 JMB Realty Corp. Chairman Judd Malkin, a Catellus director who represents 
CalPERS on the board, said he isn't worried about such projections because the 
pension fund has no intention of selling its stock soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been saying that this is a long-term investment, and we still hold that 
view," Malkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the California market is good, it's really good," he added. "When it's 
bad, it's really bad. For the last few years, it has just been really bad." 
Catellus Projects 
</P>
<P>
 Catellus Development is still one of California's biggest landowners, but the 
recession and other factors have forced the company to suspend work on many of 
its key projects. Here's a status report on some of their largest projects 
around the state.

AIRLINES TO RAISE FREQUENT FLIER MILEAGE MINIMUMS; MARKETING: UNITED, AMERICAN 
AND USAIR ARE AMONG CARRIERS PLANNING TO UP THE ANTE FOR EARNING FREE FLIGHTS. 
</P>

<P>
 New rules from some of the nation's biggest airlines mean you'll have to fly 
more miles as a paying passenger to earn minimum frequent flier awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting early next year, major airlines -- led by United -- will raise the 
number of miles to qualify for a free domestic ticket, from 20,000 to 25,000. 
They say it's one way of gaining more control over a marketing device that lets 
so many customers fly free. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest notch in the seemingly never-ending belt tightening at the nation's 
airlines is risky for them. They don't want to alienate their best customers -- 
the business fliers who pay the highest fares, fly the most frequently and have 
accrued enormous mileage entitling them to fat awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The most-frequent fliers may not necessarily see the new rules as a sacrifice, 
since they have so many miles accumulated anyway. But many less-frequent 
passengers see the awards as an entitlement. They're angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent it. I work hard to earn those miles," said George Brakeley III, a 
fund-raising consultant for nonprofit corporations. "I regard awards from 
frequent flier programs as something due me, and they make it tougher and 
tougher and tougher to get the awards." 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the most frequent fliers, the increase is actually welcome news. 
The higher requirement means there will be fewer people competing for free 
seats on the choicest routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to be more of a seller's market," said Randy Mohr, who worked on 
developing the Diners Club frequent flier program and is now advertising 
manager for the National Safety Council. "There are more people with miles 
looking for the trips, and there are more people looking for seats." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of passengers, maybe 90%, are not-so-frequent fliers and 
have been just barely qualifying for a free ticket at the 20,000-mile level, 
estimated Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of InsideFlyer, a monthly 
magazine that provides details on frequent flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the travelers, he said, who need to concentrate more on using credit 
cards, hotels, rental car chains and long-distance companies that are part of 
their frequent flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 United, American and USAir are among the biggest airlines planning to increase 
the minimum mileage requirement for a free ticket, starting early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental and America West are studying whether to change their programs, 
and Northwest is likely to raise its requirements. TWA, still recovering from 
years of passenger ill will encountered during its bankruptcy reorganization, 
has decided to leave the minimum reward level at 20,000 miles for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta is one of the few airlines that doesn't impose a deadline on when miles 
can be used, but that generosity might not last. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Delta's frequent flier program say the airline has told them it is 
reviewing the program with an eye toward falling in line with the rest of the 
industry. The airline will say only that the program is under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for the industry's increased stinginess in frequent flier 
awards is that you don't have to fly to collect the miles. You can drive a 
rental car. You can stay in a hotel. You can charge groceries on your credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based traveling salesman Bobby Finken scored a substantial number of 
frequent flier miles during a two-month period late last year, but only 13% of 
them resulted from flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole system has gotten so out of kilter; they pile the miles on," said 
Finken, who has more than 1 million untapped miles. "I look at it like it's 
money. . . . It's there for the taking." 
</P>
<P>
 But spending those miles on free trips has gotten more difficult. In recent 
years, airlines have limited the number of seats allotted for frequent flier 
freebie tickets on each flight, blacked out some of the most popular travel 
dates and put a three-year limit on how long the miles may remain unused. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, some airlines have cut back on one of the more popular frequent 
flier perks -- the free first-class upgrade -- by reducing the number of 
first-class seats on their jets or eliminating first class altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines say the cost of the free seats has grown excessive. On a flight with 
100 passengers, an average of six will be flying free on frequent flier miles. 
That's a 33% increase since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, frequent flier programs have been a powerful selling tool for the 
airlines, tapping an enormous market of people who might otherwise not fly. 
Moreover, the programs may not be as much of a financial drain as the airlines 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels, cellular telephone companies and the like that award frequent flier 
miles reimburse airlines for any free trips earned, whether the passenger 
cashes them or not. Not only can the airline realize a windfall from those 
unused mileage points, but it gets a regular check from the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, the airline gets free use of the money until the passenger 
cashes in the miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the marketing value of knowing your best customers' spending 
habits. The same businesses that dole out frequent flier miles covet the 
information and pay the airlines for their name lists as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 From their inception as a gimmick more than a decade ago, frequent flier 
programs were seen as a way to instill loyalty in a business where passengers 
see little difference between who is providing the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the brains that created the programs reasoned, if the airline gives 
away one free ticket to Hawaii, chances are the free traveler will bring along 
a paying companion. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines, the first to offer a modern frequent flier program, 
estimated in 1981 that the perks would induce passengers to take an extra trip 
on American every three years, said Rolfe Shellenberger, the project manager 
assigned to develop American's AAdvantage program. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out years later, the incentives were drawing frequent fliers to 
American an average of six additional times each year, said Shellenberger, now 
a travel management adviser with Runzheimer International, a consulting firm.

FOOTNOTES /JAMES BATES: IN SEARCH OF EXCELLENT BLURBS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Peters has built a reputation as a prolific writer of management books and 
articles. Now he's built a reputation as a prolific writer of promotional 
blurbs publishers print on book jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers of business and management books clearly know the value of having a 
well-known name such as Peters laud a book. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * "A vitally important, eminently readable and exceedingly practical book. 
Must reading for any corporate executive wishing to survive to the year 2000. A 
super book" (on "Intrapreneuring" by Gifford Pinchot III). 
</P>
<P>
 * " 'The Death of the Organization Man' is long overdue, and fills an 
important void in our understanding" (on Amanda Bennett's book of that name). 
</P>
<P>
 * "This is Mackay's most important book -- and his best" (on Harvey Mackay's 
"Sharkproof"). 
</P>
<P>
 * "It is, make no mistake, the best management answer for our chaotic times" 
(on "Adhocracy" by Robert H. Waterman Jr., with whom Peters wrote the 
bestseller "In Search of Excellence"). 
</P>
<P>
 * "It is exciting to have Ralph (Stayer) and Jim Belasco, whose work and 
writings I respect enormously, teaming up to offer their insights to us" (on 
"Flight of the Buffalo" by Belasco and Stayer). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jeffrey Pfeiffer has written one of the most important business books in a 
long time" (on Pfeiffer's "Competitive Advantage Through People"). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Andrea Gabor does a wonderful job of recounting the Deming story -- and 
thence the pursuing of America's pursuit of renewed competitiveness" (on 
Gabor's biography of W. Edwards Deming). L.A. Is No Sea of Tranquillity 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to the moon may look easy compared to getting to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidders in an Odyssey Auctions astronaut memorabilia sale Sunday at the 
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel were warned that getting there might be treacherous 
due to earthquake-caused freeway damage. "Rather than take a chance of missing 
any portion of the auction, we strongly suggest you contact the hotel for 
freeway conditions and possible alternate routes," bidders were told. Any Tang 
Still Around? 
</P>
<P>
 Call it one small step for commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's astronaut memorabilia auction included a variety of memorabilia, some 
unlikely to ever make it to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 One item was an "Apollo 15 Pineapple Fruit Drink" that is "housed in its 
original container." No word on whether it is still drinkable, but auction 
materials added that it comes with a "bactericide pill." Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Superhighway metaphor watch: Detour and pothole were frequently used to 
describe last week's collapsed merger between Tele-Communications Inc. and Bell 
Atlantic. . . . A Beverly Hills gift basket company boasts that "all of our 
products are natural and earth friendly." . . . A woman applying for a 
post-earthquake disaster loan from the Small Business Administration -- in a 
section asking whether she paid anyone to assist her application -- listed her 
husband as receiving "1 kiss and 2 hugs."

 Small-Business Owners Express More Confidence: More small-business owners in 
the Southland are confident of an economic rebound within six months, according 
to a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business. In a survey of 
725 California members of the small-business organization, a third of the 
respondents from Southern California said they believed conditions would be 
"somewhat better" or "much better" within six months -- an increase from 24% in 
December.The results indicate a reversal in the downbeat outlook the same 
business owners have reported since April, 1993. The federation's California 
Small Business Optimism Index, used as a gauge of business owners' attitudes, 
jumped more than five points, to 103.1 from 98.7. Southland business owners 
cited increased sales prospects as the No. 1 reason this year will be good for 
business expansion.

 Asian Carriers to Defend Turf: Top Asian airline executives have agreed to 
combine forces to fight agreements giving the United States and Europe 
favorable air traffic rights. The Asian executives oppose a series of 
longstanding pacts with the United States under which American travelers can 
visit every major Asian business center without flying an Asian airline.No 
similar rights exist for Asian airlines. Cheong Choong Kong, president of the 
Orient Airlines Assn., noted that Asia is the world's fastest-growing air 
travel market and demanded that Asia be given equal opportunity in the market. 
The group also opposes a common international aviation policy proposed by the 
European Union. The association represents 15 Asian and South Pacific airlines, 
including Japan Air Lines, Thai Airways and Qantas of Australia.

year-ago quarter. For the full year ended Jan. 29, the company had a loss of 
$495 million compared with profits of $280 million in the previous year.Sales 
declined to $9.63 billion from $9.96 billion. Woolworth is restructuring its 
operations to move away from its five-and-dime variety stores and focus more on 
its specialty store chains, such as Foot Locker athletic shoe shops, Champs 
sporting goods centers and Northern Reflections clothing stores.

 Westinghouse Paid Executive $14 Million: Former Transamerica executive Robert 
A. Watson, whose job until December was to liquidate the assets of Westinghouse 
Financial Services Inc., was paid that amount for a job that lasted 18 months, 
the Pittsburgh company's preliminary proxy statement shows.The ailing credit 
unit had lost billions of dollars after commercial real estate developers and 
other businesses defaulted on loans. The losses left Westinghouse Electric 
Corp. with debt of $8.4 billion by the end of 1992. Watson headed Westinghouse 
Financial Services and supervised the sale of its real estate portfolio and 
assets of more than $8 billion. Since the end of 1992, Westinghouse has reduced 
its debt to less than $4 billion.

7.8% in January over the previous month, extending 1993's gains and signaling 
brisk investment in U.S. manufacturing.The Assn. for Manufacturing Technology 
reported that machine tool orders rose to $356.05 million in January from 
$330.35 million in December. Compared to the same month a year earlier, orders 
were up almost 103% from $175.55 million. Orders for machine tools, considered 
an indicator of future economic activity, ended the year at a five-year high 
and are forecast to increase in 1994 and 1995. The demand for machine tools is 
largely due to renewed strength in the manufacturing sector.

FROM KITCHEN LAB TO GLOBAL FAME: TIGER BALM'S JOURNEY; REMEDIES: THE HERBAL 
CURE-ALL FUELS THE SUCCESS OF A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR CONGLOMERATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About a century ago, two Chinese brothers converted their kitchen in Burma 
into an herbal laboratory, much to the annoyance of their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did she know they were about to launch a product that would become a 
household name in Asia and would be well-known among patrons of health food 
stores throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Jars of Tiger Balm, the strong-smelling ointment the siblings developed, are 
contributing to a multimillion-dollar business conglomerate named after them: 
Haw Par Bros. International Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts predict a substantial improvement in Haw Par's revenue and profit in 
the coming years with expansion and diversification of the pharmaceutical 
business controlled by its subsidiary, Tiger Medicals Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quite bullish about the company," said Richard Jones, research director 
at Baring Securities in Kuala Lumpur. "Tiger Balm is a good brand and has a 
good market presence. It's inexpensive. I use it mostly for colds. It works." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Balm is a camphor-based ointment used like Vicks VapoRub or Ben Gay. In 
Singapore, a small bottle costs $1.89. In the United States, it goes for a bit 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones estimates Haw Par group's net profit at $16.67 million in 1993, nearly 
30% more than in 1992. He projects net profit at $18.68 million for 1994 and 
$20.63 million for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, TML took over marketing and distribution of Tiger Balm. The 
move led to a 42% improvement in TML's operating profit that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Leong Chi Meng, a Vickers Ballas analyst, said Haw Par is expected to see 
double-digit growth in earnings in the next few years, much of it from 
expansion of its pharmaceutical activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the company's history is its cure-all herbal Tiger Balm and oils. Elder 
brother Aw Boon Haw ("gentle tiger" in Mandarin), more aggressive than brother 
Aw Boon Par ("gentle leopard"), put his name on the product. 
</P>
<P>
 The balm is now sold in more than 70 countries, with recently entered markets 
including Russia, Mexico, Burma and Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers' rags-to-riches story began in Rangoon in the late 1870s, where 
their herbalist father arrived from China to treat patients who often paid him 
with a chicken or a dozen eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The book "Tiger Balm King," written by journalist Sam King about Aw Boon Haw, 
says that an elderly Burmese pharmacist working in their father's Rangoon 
clinic passed on to the brothers a cure-all herbal ointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers migrated to Singapore in the 1920s and set up several 
institutions, including the Tiger Balm Garden housing Chinese mythological 
figures. This is now Haw Par Villa, a theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Boon Par died in 1944. Before Boon Haw died in 1954, the balm had become one 
of the world's best-selling painkiller analgesics. 
</P>
<P>
 TML has launched an aggressive worldwide sales campaign, with the theme "Tiger 
balm works, wherever it hurts."

U.S. FIRMS TEST-SURF CHINA CENTRAL TV AIRWAVES; MARKETING: THE WORLD'S BIGGEST 
PUBLIC TV NETWORK IS AIRING 10-MINUTE 'INFOMERCIALS' FOR PHILIP MORRIS, 
PEPSICO, GM, WALT DISNEY AND OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a Chinese American promoter offered 10 minutes of unfettered and 
virtually free air time aimed at a television audience of up to a quarter of a 
billion Chinese, executives of Philip Morris Cos. leaped into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this as a chance for very broad exposure to our products," said Donald 
Harris, a vice president who oversees the conglomerate's cigarette, beer and 
food promotions in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The result might best be called China's first infomercials, those 
advertisements dressed up as public affairs shows that have become fixtures of 
American late-night television. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented marketing coup, the 10-minute shows -- scripted, filmed 
and financed by Philip Morris and six other U.S. firms -- appear on the world's 
biggest public TV network, state-run China Central Television, not as product 
promotions but as "corporate profiles" on a news show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not really a Marlboro commercial," Harris said at a ceremony in late 
January kicking off the series at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, the seat 
of Communist Party power. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is about all of the products Philip Morris makes, the kind of work we 
do around the world, along with a bit about our management and corporate 
philosophy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slick offerings in Chinese featuring General Motors Corp., Pepsico, Goodyear 
Tire & Rubber Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., American Telephone & Telegraph Corp. 
and Walt Disney Co. fill out the first batch of profiles. All are aggressive 
China players or plan major investments there. Twenty-two other firms are 
filming their own profiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The profiles, neither advertisements nor documentaries, feature company 
workers proudly discussing what they say are world-class products that 
management hopes to sell in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Asia chief John Feenie said he was thrilled to have what he called a 
China-wide "showcase" for the entertainment giant's products and services. 
</P>
<P>
 This unprecedented Western corporate access to China's tightly controlled 
airwaves is just one measure of how much the nation's media have changed in 15 
years of market-building reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the exclusive domain of propagandists, television and radio with their 
vast audiences are seen more as a commercial gold mine than a tool of communist 
thought control. 
</P>
<P>
 China's airwaves are up for sale -- and the cash-starved government is eagerly 
exploiting its increasingly lucrative monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial ads, unthinkable before reform architect Deng Xiaoping unleashed 
the consumer economy in 1979, are now staples on TV and radio around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 They give many peasants their first glimpse of China's nascent capitalist 
middle class, with its luxurious homes, cars, designer outfits, cellular phones 
and $200 bottles of Cognac. 
</P>
<P>
 One roaring success is Beijing Television's "TV Shopping" show in which state 
reporters venture from store to store, breathlessly extolling products in 
exchange for hefty fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers are still subjected to tightly censored news broadcasts. But they also 
enjoy an ever wider choice of programs, and happily channel-surf past the 
propaganda to shows they like, particularly those dealing with China's new 
consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wang, a Chinese American entrepreneur, persuaded CCTV to air the 
company profiles on its "Economics Half Hour," which commands a loyal audience 
of 80 million and can reach as many as 250 million consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, whose media consultant firm Yellow Line has an exclusive CCTV contract 
to produce the programs, sees the arrangement as a potentially lucrative foot 
in China's door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Media is very, very important in China. . . . Everything is under tight party 
control and you have to find a way in," he said. "Whoever has this inner 
channel is the one who will profit. For us this is a long-term thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme is also lucrative for CCTV. 
</P>
<P>
 The state organ not only gets the programs for free, avoiding prohibitive 
overseas production costs, but it also collects a modest broadcast fee paid for 
by the U.S. corporations profiled.

 First Current-Account Surplus Since 1988 Posted: The 1993 surplus of $450 
million followed a deficit of $4.5 billion in 1992, Bank of Korea said. The 
surplus was due largely to a $2-billion trade surplus, the first such surplus 
in four years and a reversal of 1992's $2.1-billion trade deficit, the central

 Nuclear Projects to Be Postponed: The Japanese government will delay for at

O.C. ENTERPRISE / SUSAN CHRISTIAN: SALES OF GAS SHUT-OFF VALVE GET SEISMIC 
BOOST; QUAKEMASTER OF FULLERTON SAYS DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCT DOUBLED AFTER JAN. 
17 TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 When last month's earthquake rattled his San Juan Capistrano home, Donald 
Nicolaides jumped out of bed, scrambled for a doorway and contemplated profit 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within 60 seconds of the quake, I was thinking about business," he said. "I 
can't help it. The two are so intertwined." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolaides owns Quakemaster, a Fullerton company that makes a seismic gas 
shut-off valve. It's not an easy product to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't take it out and show it off to the neighbors," he said. "You can't 
drive it to the market. People hesitate to spend $300 on something they don't 
look at and use every day." 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until there's a major earthquake. Whenever Californians are reminded 
of the fragile ground beneath their feet, they rush to buy first-aid kits, 
flashlights, bottled water and -- as Nicolaides can testify -- gas shut-off 
valves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sales during the month after the earthquake are more than double the 
previous month's sales," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest dangers in an earthquake is a fire caused by ruptured gas 
lines. When subjected to violent shaking, a shut-off valve automatically blocks 
the flow of natural gas into a building. 
</P>
<P>
 Quakemaster valves have been installed in about 5,000 homes and 1,000 
commercial structures -- including Dodger Stadium, the city of Orange's civic 
buildings and facilities on the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last fall, Nicolaides' involvement in 10-year-old Quakemaster was 
limited. His manufacturing firm, Western Machining Co., made parts for the 
valves, while Quakemaster -- originally based in Anaheim -- assembled and 
marketed the product. When Quakemaster could no longer pay its bills to Western 
Machining, its founders agreed to sell Nicolaides their patent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is a product I have a lot of faith in," said Nicolaides, 66. 
"It just hasn't been marketed well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Western Machining, which manufactures parts for everything from aircraft to 
tractors to bicycles, now makes the Quakemaster valves from start to finish. 
Nicolaides hired a sales manager to promote the valve, which he expects to 
bring in about $500,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Quakemaster competes with half a dozen other gas shut-off valve makers in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co., however, gives such valves a lukewarm 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a shut-off valve provides you a greater sense of comfort, we're all for 
it," said Vicki Estrada, a spokeswoman for the gas company. She warned, 
however, that the valves can stop gas unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once gas is shut off, service needs to be restored by the gas company or a 
qualified heating and plumbing contractor," Estrada said. "It may take days 
after an earthquake before we can get to a house to check the appliances and 
restore service." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that gas should be turned off after a quake only if a leak is heard 
or smelled. After the Northridge earthquake on Jan. 17, she said, "we restored 
gas to 120,000 customers, and 90% of those customers shut off their gas 
unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were inconvenienced -- they found themselves without gas for 
several days," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicolaides said that Quakemaster will shut off gas only in a tremor that 
shakes a building violently enough to damage gas lines. It reacts to quakes of 
magnitude 5.5 or larger, he said, and takes into account ground type and 
distance from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The valve's design is rather simple. Three steel balls sit in the rim of a 
funnel, which connects the outside gas line to the line going into a building. 
In a strong earthquake, the balls drop into the throat of the funnel and 
obstruct the flow of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, customers called, concerned that their valves were 
faulty because their gas did not shut off, Nicolaides said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A computer company in El Segundo asked me to come check their shut-off valves 
because they hadn't gone off," he said. "But the valves were fine, and the 
company's maintenance crew checked the gas lines and there were no leaks. The 
company was just too far away from the action for the valves to be triggered." 
</P>
<P>
 But the valve did shut off gas in an Encino home where gas lines were not 
damaged, he conceded. Said Nicolaides: "What we offer is peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 If your Orange County company has annual sales of less than $10 million, we 
would like to consider it for a future column. Call O.C. Enterprise at (714)

<P>
 JAMES W. OBERMAYER 
</P>
<P>
 Vice president, Inquiry Handling Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 James W. Obermayer, vice president of Inquiry Handling Services, thinks 
advertising is one of the keys to a better Southern California economy. When 
business is slow, advertising is not an expendable budget item, he said in an 
interview last week with Times staff writer Anne Michaud. Rather, it is the 
engine that drives increases in revenue. Obermayer's company, which is based in 
San Fernando, processes sales leads for companies such as Odetics in Anaheim 
and Rockwell in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: When Los Angeles ad agency Campbell & Wagman closed last month, one 
of the principals was quoted saying it's impossible to prove the results of 
advertising -- and that's why agencies are having a hard time surviving. You 
say you were upset about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes, it irritated me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But that view is widely held -- that you can't prove advertising works. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Consumer advertising is more difficult, compared with business-to-business, 
but it's not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountability is possible, with the ability today to create databases 
inexpensively and pretty accurately. You need databases that include buyer 
preference, need, desire, buying authority, time frame for purchase and those 
kinds of things. 
</P>
<P>
 You can capture that for people who inquire about a product. Then you turn 
that information over to the salesperson. You can follow up later to see 
whether the customer bought your product, and if not, why. 
</P>

 Q: Some of the people who say you can't prove that advertising works are among 
the top names in the business. Why don't they share your view? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some of them do and keep their mouths shut. They're not going to stand up 
and teach the other agencies how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it also is that clients don't allow the agencies that much latitude. 
They say, "Create the ads, create the PR, create that product interest." 
They're asked to create image rather than inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't ship image. It doesn't weigh very much; you can't bill for it very 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you get the inquiries in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Companies that aggressively use "800" numbers in their ads and direct mail 
can push up their total inquiry response from 3% or 4% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade shows create 12% to 18% of inquiries for most corporations. Smart 
companies are starting to give salespeople clipboards and saying, please get 
this information filled out. Or they put the computer on the floor and say, 
please find out this information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does that information help a company make sales? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Salespeople want more information than just simply a name, where the lead 
came from and which product is of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to know, how soon is the customer going to be purchasing? How 
many and what? What's his current application for that? Does he want to lease 
or buy it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then what? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I encourage in-house marketing people, as a first step, to find out what 
the company's sales have to be for that product this year. It's amazing how 
many people in marketing do not even know the sales quotas that salespeople are 
carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-house marketing people just simply have to go to sales and say, "Tell 
me what your quotas are. I will make every effort to give you enough sales 
leads, knowing what our market share is, for you to make your quotas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's not a new idea, is it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's been around a long time. But in a way it's revolutionary because 
you're not going to find a lot of marketing people doing it. I've done it 
practically, both as a consultant and as a (vice president) of marketing in 
several companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did it work out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Just about every time it has worked. It isn't that difficult. Half of all 
sales inquiries -- actually, 45% -- turn into a sale for somebody within 12 
months. Create a thousand inquiries, and there have to be 450 sales in there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they must do a little bit of research, call people in six months and ask, 
"What did you buy? Whose did you buy? Did a salesman follow up with you?" 
They'll find that 26% bought in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What goes wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unfortunately, 75% to 85% of all sales leads that are created are never 
followed up by a salesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reasons people buy from a competitor are that price or the channel of 
distribution was better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can an ad agency do about that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The agencies don't control that. 
</P>
<P>
 But an agency just has to say, "Along with everything else you're budgeting 
this year, Mr. Client, I want to make sure that we do one or two small mailings 
to people who have inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should do one or two small did-you-buy studies, either through the 
mailings or on the telephone, to double-check to see what percentage of people 
are closing purchases in what period of time for you and your competitors. 
We'll take a look at the profiles of those people, and we'll make some media 
decisions based on that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've got to spend some money to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you send out a little mailer six months after the inquiry was generated, 
it will cost you 10 or 15 cents to print up each letter, plus postage. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can do a did-you-buy study. Go to any telemarketing firm and say, 
"Here's 150 people, will you give us a study?" That's a couple of thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody will spend $30,000 to be in a magazine. Why not budget $2,000 to 
$4,000 to prove the value of your advertising? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On generating sales through advertising. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of our clients tell us that in the long run they have very strong 
advertising budgets because the budgets are tied to sales." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On trading ad budgets for profits. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "By midyear, if the sales department isn't making its quota, the company says 
it needs money for profits. It raids the marketing budget at the very time the 
company's not making quota. Now, the salespeople have to go it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On selling by having a superior product. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What's superior today might not be superior tomorrow. Sooner or later, you're 
going to be in the barrel along with all the me-too products trying to develop 
the next winner. Advertising has to come to the rescue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On proving that advertising works. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If clients prove the value, they won't hesitate to advertise more."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: EVEN DULL PROXY ISSUES ARE WORTH VOTING ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring is drawing near, and that means warmer weather, baseball and proxy 
balloting at many mutual fund companies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the season when fund groups traditionally hold their shareholder 
meetings and voting. And while proxy issues usually don't rank high on the list 
of shareholder concerns, most experts agree that investors should make an 
effort to understand what's happening and vote accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason to do so relates to cost. Fund companies face a minimum cost of 
$20,000 to $30,000 to draw up, print and mail proxies and count the votes -- 
and in most cases those costs are borne by shareholders, says Roy W. Adams Jr., 
a San Francisco area securities attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 For a small fund with perhaps 1,000 shareholders, that works out to $20 to $30 
or more each. 
</P>
<P>
 When fund companies don't garner enough shareholder participation to validate 
a proxy vote, the process has to be repeated at additional expense -- to say 
nothing of the inconvenience to shareholders of having to vote again. 
</P>
<P>
 Many would also argue that shareholders have a moral obligation to vote. Funds 
are mutually owned, after all. In addition, there's the more important question 
of safeguarding your interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should always be an active investor, even on mundane issues, so that 
you'll be in the habit of participating when important issues come along," says 
John Markese of the American Assn. of Individual Investors in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most funds are set up to avoid annual meetings and votes, when a proxy 
does arrive in the mail, "it may mean something's up," says Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no hard and fast rule to separate the mundane from the significant 
issues. Topics such as ratifying management's choice of an accounting firm or 
even renewing the annual management contract would usually qualify as fairly 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also hard to get too excited about the election of trustees or directors, 
since you probably won't get enough information to find out who they really are 
or where they might stand on various issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes involving fees and a fund's investment policy would be considered more 
substantive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.3 million investors in Fidelity Magellan, the nation's largest mutual 
fund ($32 billion), will vote on 20 proposals in this year's proxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those proposals would allow greater use of foreign managers and 
analysts with expertise in local markets. Another would broaden Magellan's 
investment range to include "foreign and domestic securities of all types when 
seeking capital appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Magellan, which built its superb long-term record primarily with 
U.S. stocks and which is commonly classified as a domestic growth portfolio, 
faces no prospectus limits on the amount of assets it can invest overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, it had an 8% foreign weighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two foreign-based companies within the Fidelity organization specialize in 
international securities, and the intent of the two foreign-manager proposals 
is to clarify that Magellan can use them if it chooses, says Arthur S. Loring, 
Fidelity's vice president for legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal dealing with a wider investment parameter is mainly designed to 
make clear that Magellan can buy corporate debt securities if it wants, Loring 
says. The fund is not likely to be managed differently with the changes, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Bowers, editor of Fidelity Monitor, an unaffiliated newsletter based in 
Rocklin, Calif., doesn't have a problem with these changes and the more mundane 
issues on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fidelity managers are sharpening their skills overseas, and they see lots of 
opportunities there," Bowers says. "It makes sense to give them this freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 But Markese feels proxy proposals of this type, if approved, could result in a 
changed fund. "What manager wouldn't want the ability to go overseas?" he asks. 
"But that doesn't mean they all should." 
</P>
<P>
 Markese says he would be suspicious of such proposals and would look them over 
carefully. "There are still plenty of good domestic investment opportunities," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, other proxy proposals worth scrutiny are those calling for changes 
in a fund's costs, such as imposition of higher management fees or adoption of 
a marketing, or 12b-1, fee. Bowers and Markese say they normally vote no on 
resolutions that boost fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In Magellan's case, a different proposal is on the ballot -- one calling for 
approval of a management contract that "can only result in a management fee 
that is the same or lower compared to the current contract," according to 
Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, a key component of Magellan's management fee would drop slightly 
when Fidelity's overall assets exceeded $250 billion -- almost where they are 
today. Additional small fee drops would kick in at higher asset levels. 
</P>
<P>
 While pointed in the right direction, these economies of scale are minuscule 
-- they would save a $10,000 investor about 50 cents a year, according to the 
proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they don't guarantee that Magellan's shareholder-borne expenses wouldn't 
rise, because this component is only part of the overall management fee, which 
is only part of the overall expense ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan's current expense ratio of about 1% is the equivalent of a $100 
yearly charge to a shareholder with a $10,000 position in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 As legal documents, most proxies are written in a style that ranges somewhere 
between boring and incomprehensible. Some documents may run 80 to 90 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 If you read the discussion of important proposals and still can't understand 
what's at stake, a good rule of thumb is to vote no. The fact that hundreds of 
funds have adopted 12b-1 fees over the past dozen years suggests that plenty of 
shareholders didn't understand what they were voting on. At a minimum, a no 
vote could pressure fund companies to publish more understandable proxy 
documents. More important, it could prevent you from voting to fix something 
that isn't broken.

 Analyst review: "Fluor is an industry leader with a clear vision. The company 
has successfully diversified its interests away from being based solely on 
hydrocarbon activity, though that segment is still very important to the 
company. Moreover, during a period of weak global economic activity in 
1988-1992, the company has been able to increase operating profits almost 
fourfold and more than double its order backlog. Fluor's size, reputation, 
international reach and appropriate energy, electric power and environmental 
exposure indicate to us that it should benefit from our forecasted pickup in 
engineering and construction activity over the next few years." -- Tobias M.

INCOMING STEELWORKERS' CHIEF HAS WORKER STYLE; HE STARTED IN MILL AT 14; LABOR: 
GEORGE BECKER IS CAMPAIGNING TO REPRESENT USAIR EMPLOYEES. HIS APPROACH AS HEAD 
OF 540,300-MEMBER UNION IS LESS INTELLECTUAL, MORE DOWN TO EARTH THAN 
PREDECESSOR, WHOM HE SALUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE DRESSLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Becker and hundreds of chanting airline workers wanted to deliver a 
stinging Christmas card to the chairman of USAir, but they had a problem: five 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a USAir frequent flier," Becker shouted to the stone-faced guards 
blocking the entrance to the airline's headquarters in Arlington, Va. "You mean 
I'm not welcome?" 
</P>
<P>
 Becker is a card-carrying frequent flier. But he's also a card-carrying 
officer of the United Steelworkers of America. He becomes president of the 
540,300-member union on March 1 and intends to use his aggressive, 
plain-talking style to make organizing a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the march on USAir headquarters just before Christmas as part of the 
union's campaign to represent about 17,000 USAir customer service workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people acted as a union maybe for the first time, and the company 
didn't do anything about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's working-man style -- he says furlough is a "fancy word" for layoff -- 
sharply contrasts with the more professorial demeanor of outgoing president 
Lynn Williams. Becker noted that Williams, who has a degree in economics and 
joined the union as an organizer, is regarded as a labor intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not that kind of guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rank-and-file members say that although Becker is less polished than 
Williams, his experience as a laborer helps him relate to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives him a better understanding of the problems we're facing, the reality 
of it, more than the textbook approach," said John Guy, an electrician at the 
USX Corp. Irvin Works steel plant in suburban Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the average workers on the shop floor, sometimes Lynn Williams talked 
over their heads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, 65, grew up in Granite City, Ill., and began working at the age of 14 
in the same mill as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Marines in 1946 and later worked as a crane operator before 
becoming a full-time union employee at the age of 35. He has been the union's 
vice president of administration since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's leadership transition marks a difference in style, not a change in 
direction. Williams prepared Becker for the job, and the two share the same 
philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lynn gave the union a new focus, a new dimension," Becker said. "I intend to 
build on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's biggest challenge will be halting the union's membership decline of 
the past decade. The union has fewer than half the 1.2 million members it 
counted in 1981 before the epidemic closings of steel mills and other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the union's members still work in the metals industry. Most of the 
rest work in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The union realizes it can't look to the large steel mills for growth. In the 
last year, the union's new members included bakery workers, nursing home 
employees and school bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the USW and other unions are organizing in services. The USAir 
campaign has become a high-profile test for the USW, the Teamsters and the 
International Association of Machinists. All are vying to represent the 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker virtually shut down the union's headquarters in Pittsburgh for an hour 
on one recent afternoon and called a meeting in the lobby. There he urged 
everyone, from secretaries to accountants, to knock on doors of USAir employees 
and urge them to sign union cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to make everybody an organizer," said union spokesman Gary Hubbard. 
"These are folks that have never been asked to go out and organize." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said he believes most people in factories and on shop floors would like 
to be represented by a union -- and could be if laws and regulations on 
organizing were changed. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he said, companies should be punished more severely for unfair 
labor practices when workers consider union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company can intimidate, coerce, threaten to fire, fire," he said. "They 
can destroy your campaign in so many different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Williams, the union won innovative changes designed to give workers a 
greater voice, including the right to nominate a representative to the board of 
directors of the big steel companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said he wants to continue pushing for changes that will give workers 
more control, such as employee buyouts of healthy, not just ailing, companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about worker empowerment," Becker said. "This is just taking that one 
step further. This is bricks and mortar."

MOST MAJOR INVESTMENTS OUTPACE INFLATION, POST POSITIVE RESULTS IN '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If every year were like the one just past, savers and investors wouldn't have 
much to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final tally for 1993 by Morgan Stanley & Co., all major categories of 
investments posted positive results, and most of them handily outpaced the 
reported rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you took an aggressive or a conservative approach, your chances were 
pretty good of coming out ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 As Barton Biggs, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, points out, things 
don't always work out quite so nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fortunate financial-asset investors have been terribly spoiled, and genius 
has been confused with bull markets," he observes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, prosperity is relative. Owners of money-market investments like 
Treasury bills and commercial paper had to settle last year for returns far 
below what they had been used to over the past decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Tangible assets produced very uneven results. While depressed gold and silver 
markets rallied sharply, real estate barely eked out a gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout winner in Biggs' annual tabulation of investment returns was 
emerging market equities -- the fledgling stock markets of numerous nations 
where industrial and financial bases are just being built. Their gain of 67% 
was almost double that of their nearest rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, in second place, jumped 39.1%, while gold gained 17.8%. But faithful 
followers of the precious metals markets still have a lot of catching up to do. 
Both silver and gold still show negative average returns over the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the domestic financial markets, emerging growth stocks racked up a 22% 
return, more than doubling the 10% advance recorded by Standard & Poor's 
composite index of 500 stocks, which is dominated by larger issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Junk bonds, benefiting from an easing of the early-1990s credit crunch, 
chalked up an 18.9% advance. 
</P>
<P>
 With their recent resurgence, junk bonds now boast annualized returns of 
better than 13% for the last five and 10 years, even with the severe shakeout 
their market endured at the end of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 If you opted for higher quality in bonds, you still came out with pretty fancy 
results. U.S. Treasury bonds gained 17.2% and investment-grade corporate bonds 
12.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortening maturities, however, meant giving up a lot, thanks to the decline 
of interest rates to their lowest levels in a generation. Intermediate-term 
government bonds returned 8.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short-term money markets, commercial paper brought a 3.3% return and 
Treasury bills 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those numbers were way down from the double-digit peaks of the early 
'80s, they still beat reported inflation, which at 2.9% also came in below the 
average levels of the past couple of decades. 
</P>
<P>
 By Biggs' reckoning, inflation from 1945 to 1993 averaged 4.4% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Without much inflation to stir up interest in them, the real estate and 
collectibles markets were generally subdued. Art, for example, returned 9.5% 
under Biggs' yardsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 In real estate, U.S. farmland returned 6%, residential housing 3%, and 
commercial real estate, the laggard among all categories, an estimated 2.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "For more than a decade," says Biggs in summary, "we have been luxuriating in 
real annual returns of 10% to 12% in big U.S. stocks, Treasury bonds, corporate 
bonds, foreign bonds and junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Delightful as this has been, Biggs says there is cause to doubt it can 
continue at quite the same pace. After all, he says, it's dangerous to keep 
hoping that every year will be above-average. 
</P>
<P>
 Or in mathematical terms, as he puts it, "regression to the mean is still the 
most powerful force in the investment world. Think contrary."

PLASTIC INCONVENIENT, NOT ECONOMICAL TO RECYCLE; ENVIRONMENT: THERE'S TOO MUCH 
TRASH AND NOT ENOUGH DEMAND. DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS MAKE SORTING 
EXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the middle-aged businessman who whispers the famous "just one word" to 
Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," the plastics industry asserts that there's a 
bright future in recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists and recycling officials are about as cynical as the 
Hoffman college grad who ignores the career advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Major cities like Philadelphia and Newark, N.J., have stopped recycling 
plastic. Most everything from mustard bottles to yogurt cups to meat wrap still 
is dumped or burned. Critics want government action to accelerate progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plastic is the bane of most recyclers' existence," says Brooke Nash, 
executive director of Solana Recyclers Inc. in San Diego, which collects 
recyclables from four Southern California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities want programs to divert as much material from their landfills, but 
it's a money-loser all around." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is simple economics: Too much trash, weak demand. But the solution 
isn't simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside programs inspired by environmental fervor have spread to more than 
4,000 communities. Forty states require comprehensive recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 But the programs were established without knowing whether companies would 
embrace trash as a raw material for new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Most didn't. The lack of demand drove down what communities get for an average 
ton of household trash from $100 a ton in 1988 to $35 a ton last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is especially acute for plastics. Despite the push by government 
to recycle, U.S. factories have actually increased output of plastic made of 
virgin materials -- oil and natural gas -- in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The tumbling virgin prices depressed prices of recycled plastic resins. It can 
cost communities $1,000 a ton collecting, sorting and trucking plastic, up to 
10 times what they can get for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, recycled resins cost 10% more than virgin plastic, giving manufacturers 
little reason to use plastic trash in new products. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's regulatory mandates to divert this material from the waste stream but 
no corresponding mandate to use it," said Jane Witheridge, vice president of 
strategic planning for WMX Technologies Inc., the nation's largest collector of 
curbside recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 There are impressive success stories, and officials partly credit the 
diligence of millions of Americans in sorting household trash for curbside 
collection. Much eventually ends up recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the recycling rate is about 70% for aluminum cans, nearly half of 
steel cans, 43% for newspapers and about one-third for all glass packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other rubbish also has recycling problems. Clear and colored glass, for 
example, create sorting headaches because they cannot be mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The laggard is plastic. About 6.5% of plastics packaging was recycled in 1992, 
the plastics industry says. But the majority of that is plastic soda bottles, 
largely due to state bottle laws requiring reuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The second largest category includes translucent milk and water jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall situation has created huge backlogs. In Los Angeles and New York 
City, for example, towers of plastic garbage rise from recyclers' processing 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Further inconveniencing recyclers are the same properties that make plastic so 
convenient to consumers -- lightness and versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, officials dropped plastic trash from their curbside program 
in November, 1992, after figuring it took up half the space on its garbage 
trucks but accounted for only 5% of the weight. That meant extra overtime for 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were driving around with a lot of air," said Tom Klein, director of 
recycling education and promotion in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point isn't whether it's recyclable or not -- my sofa is recyclable -- 
the point is whether it can be collected and recycled in a cost-effective way," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, plastics have different chemical compositions that make sorting 
expensive. Some packages have more than one plastic, another sorting problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The plastics industry says it is promoting recycling with a $1.2 billion 
investment between 1990 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In one innovation, manufacturers now make plastic soda bottles with pinched 
bottoms that stand on their own, eliminating the need for a rigid base of 
different plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinz's ketchup bottles were redesigned using PET, or polyethylene 
terephthalate, a more readily recyclable resin used in soda bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the environmental community says plastics manufacturers -- which includes 
oil companies that drill the oil used in plastic they make -- has spent far 
more to process virgin materials to meet surging demand for plastic packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economics don't make sense and we believe that at the root of this, 
fundamentally, manufacturers have to take responsibility for their packaging," 
said Lance King, outreach director for Californians Against Waste in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the private sector doesn't take the actions, we believe it will lead to 
mandatory rules," King said, referring to state legislation requiring a minimum 
amount of recycled resins in new plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, cheaper ways exist to dispose of plastic. In some parts of the 
country, there is a surplus of garbage-fueled incinerators. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet people prefer to recycle over burying or burning trash. Many companies 
created to exploit the recycling fervor have been disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee-based Poly-Anna Plastics, for instance, thought it had the perfect 
formula to success: Sell plastic recycling bins, made of old laundry detergent 
bottles, to communities for curbside programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But local governments didn't bite because Poly-Anna bins cost more than those 
made without garbage. "We've lost most of the big bids," said Poly-Anna 
president Marty Forman. 
</P>
<P>
 North American Recycling Systems was forced to shut its Fort Edward, N.Y., 
plastic processing factory last year because it was too expensive to operate, 
said chairman Robert Barber. 
</P>
<P>
 Envirothene of Chino, Calif., the largest plastics processor in the West, is 
just breaking even after three years of operation because it can't get loans to 
buy more equipment and generate more revenues, said chief executive Michael 
Kopulsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Even established companies have pulled back. Wellman Inc., the nation's 
largest processor of old plastic soda bottles, stopped taking other packages 
like milk and juice jugs because they weren't profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities claim broader success. Minneapolis sells recycled packages 
like margarine tubs and yogurt containers to recyclers that make them into new 
packages, carpeting and landscaping bricks. About 100 communities in western 
Massachusetts also sort and collect less commonly recycled plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these and other pilot programs depend on government and industry 
subsidies, compared to markets for glass, aluminum and paper that are more 
financially self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of progress: More products that increase demand for trash. Patagonia 
sells a polyester sweater made from 100% used soda bottles. Procter & Gamble 
Co. makes liquid detergent bottles from 100% plastic trash.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has granted $1.2 million for developing technologies 
for help put more recovered materials in consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hand-holding to get people to use recycled materials. There 
hasn't been a major national effort to do this yet," said Kathleen Meade, 
spokeswoman for the National Recycling Coalition, a group of business and 
government recyclers.

 The "plastics" exchange between a middle-aged businessman and Benjamin 
Braddock, a college graduate played by Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," the 
top-grossing film of 1968: 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman: I just want to say one word to you, just one word.

 Benjamin: Yes, sir.

 Businessman: Are you listening?

 Benjamin: Yes I am.

 Businessman: Plastics.

 Benjamin (after a long pause): Exactly how do you mean?

<P>
 Businessman: There's a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you 
think about it? 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin: Yes I will. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman: 'Nuff said. That's a deal.

STAR VEHICLE; DI, LIZ, TONYA, THE BOBBITTS . . . FOR 20 YEARS, PEOPLE HAS 
COVERED ALL TYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, they called it a puffy, fluffy, tacky magazine filled with 
celebrity piffle that could be read cover to cover in the supermarket checkout 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those same barbs are still being lobbed at People magazine two decades 
later. But after attaining a circulation of 3.15 million and becoming a Time 
Inc. money machine, the weekly is laughing all the way to the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 20th anniversary double issue hits the newsstands today, and the hoopla 
doesn't end there. With a hardcover book ("People Celebrates People: The Best 
of 20 Unforgettable Years"), a commemorative soft-bound publication ("20 Years 
of People Covers") and a television show ("People's 20th Birthday," scheduled 
to air March 7 on ABC), this birthday seems more a national event than a mere 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's fitting for a magazine that has chronicled popular culture while 
becoming part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 It has given us royal battles (Di versus Charles), battles royal (Mia versus 
Woody), royal pains (Morton Downey Jr.), plus fads (mood rings), trends 
(disco), flops (New Coke) losses (Ryan White) and triumphs (the 1980 Olympic 
gold medal-winning U.S. ice hockey team). 
</P>
<P>
 It has determined the Sexiest Man Alive, the Most Intriguing People, and the 
Best and Worst Dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But People magazine deserves credit for more than its breezy blips and copious 
black and white photos, its supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the magazine took the term popular culture and broadened it 
enormously, just as it broadened the term celebrity ," says Richard Stolley, 
the founding editor of People and senior editorial adviser for Time Inc. "If 
you had asked back then what a celebrity was, the answer would have been 
someone in entertainment and sports, probably. What People discovered through 
its correspondents is all these interesting people out there . . . who rose to 
national prominence in so many other fields." 
</P>
<P>
 People didn't just broaden the term celebrity , it blew it up to the size of a 
football field. Springing from the back pages of Life magazine, the weekly 
debuted on Feb. 28, 1974, cost 35 cents (current price: $2.39) and featured on 
the cover Mia Farrow coyly biting a strand of pearls. Until then, Americans had 
gotten their personality news via such newspaper columnists as Walter Winchell 
and Hedda Hopper, breathless fanzines such as Photoplay or the briefest of 
mentions in general interest magazines and newspapers.  
</P>
<P>
 People also vaulted just-plain folks to instant fame in showcasing what 
Stolley calls "ordinary people doing extraordinary things," which has become 
one of the magazine's mantras. The Menendez brothers, Lorena Bobbitt and Amy 
Fisher all qualified for infamy status under this clause. The concept quickly 
caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I worked at Newsweek, it had the Newsmakers section, and it was kind of 
dumb and dull," says Edwin Diamond, now media critic for New York magazine. 
"After People magazine came out, the People section of Time (magazine) was 
spiffed up, the Newsmakers section of Newsweek was spiffed up, newspapers had 
columns about Hollywood people, New York people. You can physically see the 
change, physically measure it in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Editor Stolley suggests that the cultural climate of the '70s was ideal 
for cultivating a personality magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had just been through a decade of war, racial tension and protest, and the 
individual in a sense had gotten buried in things like mass protests," he says. 
"By the time the magazine started, a lot of that anger had started to drain out 
and we were looking at individuals again." 
</P>
<P>
 Television may also have aided People's explosion, Diamond says. "We had movie 
stars in the '30s, '40s and '50s, but these people weren't coming into the 
house. . . . Television just brought so many previously unknown visages into 
our homes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout from People can be seen all over the media, in personality-driven 
magazines such as US (debuting in 1977) and Vanity Fair (debuting in 1983), 
plus legions of television news magazines and TV tabloid shows ("Inside 
Edition" and "Hard Copy"). 
</P>
<P>
 But the hunger has led to a feeding frenzy. The competition for access to 
celebrities -- real and manufactured -- is cutthroat. 
</P>
<P>
 Want Whitney on your magazine cover? Stand in line. Dying to interview the 
players in a surrogate-mother custody battle? Talk to their agents and pray 
they haven't yet made a movie-of-the-week deal. Personalities have become 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting for the New Yorker to start putting celebrities on the cover," 
says Landon Y. Jones Jr., managing editor of People since 1989. "There are many 
more outlets seeking to live off the same universe of stars, and that has 
driven up the value (of celebrities) enormously. And that's happening to 
ordinary people who are thrust into fame. They're told (by their agent or 
lawyer) to hold out for the best offer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're thinking, 'Why hand this over when we can control this, sell it, 
extract a higher price?' Everything's on the table now and being bargained for 
(in an interview) -- what's talked about, what's not talked about, who the 
writer will be. I would say we're not exactly Snow White, but most of the stuff 
we won't do." 
</P>
<P>
 People won't promise a cover to a celebrity ("All we'll say is, 'We think it's 
going to be a cover,' " Jones says) and won't pay for stories, although he 
knows how the celebrity journalism game is played. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I ask for covers? Sure. Absolutely," says Pat Kingsley of the top 
L.A.-based publicity firm PMK, whose clients include Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she get them? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't, we don't do the story, at times. You have to understand, this 
business is so competitive. . . . In order for (a magazine) to get exclusivity, 
we've got to get something in return. Those are the rules. But (the magazines) 
set that agenda, not us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley concedes that a People cover is "an advantage," but it's difficult to 
say if it translates into higher box office receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all hopeful," she says. "It's something you can't prove. You just know 
you have to try. Because the ad dollars are so expensive, you have to have that 
free publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes "free" publicity exacts a price. Although she declined to 
discuss specifics, Kingsley hinted that she has not always been thrilled with 
People's treatment of her clients.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a time when we didn't work with (People) for about a year," 
Kingsley says. "I don't want to go into it, it was a promise made that wasn't 
kept. But none of those (editors) are there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 One well-publicized case of a star getting into a snit occurred in 1988, when 
Robin Williams was profiled in a People cover story. 
</P>
<P>
 It chronicled the breakup of Williams' marriage to Valerie Velardi and cast 
the couple's nanny, Marsha Garces (now his wife), as the home-wrecker. "At 35, 
Robin is caught up in a private turmoil of passion and anguish," the magazine 
gushed, reading like the cover blurb of a bodice-ripping romance novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was still steamed about the story last fall, saying in an interview 
with the Los Angeles Times: "They wrote an article basically saying things that 
were untrue. The idea of home-wrecking is b.s." 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it bother me? Yes," Jones says of Williams' anger. "It was six years 
ago. I've talked to him and said, 'The whole staff of the magazine has changed 
since the story appeared, why do you keep doing this?' But you and I would 
probably feel the same way if it happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle for control has led to fewer celebs wanting to tell all, Jones 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are definitely people who are afraid to reveal much of themselves in 
public at all," he says. "That's posed a problem for us because we really like 
to see people at home, a real look at a real person. It happens, but it's 
harder and harder to get. Certain people -- certain publicists -- are harder to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 But actress Tracey Gold has done some gut-spilling. A recent cover story 
updated readers on her struggle with anorexia, first chronicled in a 1992 
People cover story. 
</P>
<P>
 Why put a semi-obscure television actress on the cover? 
</P>
<P>
 "Her cover two years ago was one of our best all-time sellers," Jones 
explains. "We knew the public was interested in her and her battle with 
anorexia and this was a sequel story. It did OK, not the blockbuster we thought 
it was going to be, but there were no problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's best newsstand seller was the "John Lennon: A Tribute" cover in 
1980; "Prince Charles & Princess Diana: It's Over" became the all-time highest 
circulation (subscription and newsstand) issue. And Princess Di has the 
distinction of being the most popular cover girl, appearing 32 times (followed 
by Elizabeth Taylor and Fergie, tying at 12 each; Michael Jackson at 10; Cher 
at 9, and Jacqueline Onassis at 8). 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect an unending supply of royal covers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a peak year in 1992," Jones says. "The royals is Diana -- Fergie and 
Andrew are supporting players in the story of Diana. Now that she truly seems 
to be heading into private life, even though she may be dating, I don't think 
she'll have the prominence she had before. We haven't had a Diana cover so far 
in 1994 -- and my God, we're almost out of February!" 
</P>
<P>
 If Di does make major headlines again, you can bet People editors will be 
sizing up cover photos. So will countless other publications, and readers will 
be sopping up every factoid they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Can they distinguish between the information carried in a People or Vanity 
Fair and the print and broadcast tabloids? 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think that people could distinguish fact from fancy, hype from 
reality, show business from news, that people are smarter than we give them 
credit for," says media critic Diamond. "But I'm beginning to entertain the 
notion that there's so much out there that numbness is taking over. Everything 
is impossibly muddied now. I used to believe that people could make the 
distinction -- I still believe that emotionally, if not intellectually." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has a bit more faith in his readers: "I think people do know the 
difference between the tabloids and People. I believe people take our magazine 
seriously. When it's a media feeding frenzy, as with Tonya (Harding) and Nancy 
(Kerrigan), I think we present a reasonable point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an earthquake, fires, the Whitewater issue -- and everyone sits there 
with their eyes half-closed. But someone comes over and says, 'Let me tell you 
what happened to my sister during the earthquake,' then everyone listens. It's 
fundamental to the magazine's success to find the common human experiences and 
relate them."

FINALLY, A TIME FOR NO REGRETS; BOOKS: AT 88 AND WITH THE FIRST VOLUME OF HIS 
SECOND NOVEL NOW OUT, HENRY ROTH COMES TO TERMS WITH HIMSELF AND IS 'RECONCILED 
WITH THE LOUSE I WAS.' 
</P>

<P>
 For a man who has spent the greater part of his life in self-imposed exile, 
Henry Roth has an unusual number of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 people gathered on a recent Sunday afternoon in the airy 
sanctuary at Congregation Albert to pay tribute to the 88-year-old author on 
the publication of the first volume of his highly autobiographical new novel, 
"Mercy of a Rude Stream," out from St. Martin's Press in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Natty in a plaid tam, sweater vest and shirt, Roth sat beaming in his 
wheelchair as his lawyer, his agent, his publicist and his editor sang his 
praises. His smile broadened as passages from the new book -- his second novel 
in 60 years -- were read aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth clutched a microphone with hands swollen by rheumatoid arthritis, and in 
a voice that echoed the inflections of the long-ago Lower East Side of 
Manhattan, he recalled the accolades for his first novel, "Call It Sleep." He 
also described how he grew alienated from the first book, published in 1934 
when he was 28, and regarded as a classic evocation of immigrant life. "I no 
longer felt the work was mine," Roth said. "It was the property of that 
arrogant young whippersnapper I once was." 
</P>
<P>
 He fled his native New York in 1939 and abandoned the writer's life for such 
occupations as tool-and-die maker, farmer and mental-institution attendant. For 
nearly 60 tortured years, he said, he worked at becoming "an adult -- a mensch 
." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have done so more or less successfully, so now, at last, when 
people praise my recent book, I feel it's me they're praising," Roth said. 
"This old codger you see before you is me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, who moved to Albuquerque in 1968, lives on a quiet side street in a 
house with a red tile roof that he bought after his wife, Muriel, died in 1990. 
In declining health for several years, he passes his days in his book-lined 
office, sitting in a motorized reclining chair. Close by is the word processor 
that enables him to write despite his arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 In this high desert setting, with its hard, clear winter light and a rugged 
range of mountains looming on the edge of town, his feat of transporting 
himself back to the teeming New York streets of 80 years ago is regarded by his 
colleagues as nothing short of astonishing. But for Roth, the circumstances of 
his childhood have always remained close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mercy of a Rude Stream" picks up where "Call It Sleep" left off, conjuring 
the sights and sounds of a vanished city. The book is finished and will be 
published in six volumes.  
</P>
<P>
 The first volume, "A Star Shines Over Mt. Morris Park," is set during World 
War I, when trolleys and horses still plied the city streets. Roth's alter ego, 
8-year-old Ira Stigman, moves with his unloving father and affectionate but 
ineffectual mother from the mostly Jewish Lower East Side to an Irish section 
of Harlem, where Ira is despised for his Jewishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira succumbs to corrosive self-loathing, a condition that has persisted for 
Roth himself over much of his life. The book is interspersed with ruminations 
by the aged Ira, who despises his youthful self for his timidity, clumsiness 
and dislike of his "greenhorn" in-laws, newly arrived from the old country. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of Roth's life are much like those recounted in "Mercy of a 
Rude Stream." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roth was born in the Austro-Hungarian province of Galitzia in 1906 and landed 
at Ellis Island in 1909. Like the Stigman family in his book, Roth's parents 
moved him and his sister to Harlem in the summer of 1914, an event he counts as 
a major trauma in his 8-year-old life because of the prejudice he encountered 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth lived at home until he enrolled at City College of New York, where he 
hoped to major in biology or zoology. But he found his literary calling when an 
expository writing assignment turned into a fanciful sketch that was published 
in the campus literary magazine (while earning a D from the instructor). 
</P>
<P>
 Roth took up with Eda Lou Walton, a poet and literature professor 11 years his 
senior, who nurtured his gift. She moved him into her Greenwich Village 
apartment, where he met and mingled with the intellectual lights of the day, 
including Margaret Mead and Hart Crane. 
</P>
<P>
 With Walton's support, Roth began writing "a kind of strict biography of 
self," which over four years turned into an autobiographical novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had to learn to write a novel in those four years," Roth says. He 
was deeply influenced by James Joyce's protean use of language in "Ulysses." 
"Call It Sleep" is similarly dense with description and sensuous imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Call It Sleep," the protagonist is called David Schearl, and the story 
traces in a fictional way Roth's life up until the age of 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the boy's father is not merely cold, but tyrannical, subject to sudden 
rages. The mother is idealized as a warm, nurturing figure who stubbornly 
shelters her son from her husband's anger. But even in this more-fictionalized 
vision of his youth, Roth depicts himself as a sniveling weakling too timid to 
stand up for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel builds to a dramatic climax in which the father, maddened by 
suspicions that David is not his son, beats the boy savagely. David flees home 
and nearly dies in an accident, becoming a kind of sacrificial figure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The book was a critical success, but it sold indifferently because its 
publisher went out of business. Still, it earned Roth a contract for a second 
book with the legendary Maxwell Perkins, F. Scott Fitzgerald's editor at 
Scribner's. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roth says "Call It Sleep" was a creative dead end, because to continue in 
that vein would have meant following Joyce's example of writing books 
increasingly obsessed with the possibilities of language while growing more 
divorced from life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no longer any illumination from life itself," Roth says of Joyce's 
later work. "All he's got left is Dublin and the medium itself, and the medium 
starts to prey on itself. As far as illuminating the human condition -- it's 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1930s, like many of his contemporaries, Roth joined the Communist 
Party. The party involvement lasted 30 years and nearly proved fatal to his 
muse. 
</P>
<P>
 He started a second novel, about a worker who loses his hand in an industrial 
accident, that was meant to be politically correct proletarian fiction. But the 
subject didn't ring true, and Roth eventually gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was, the precocious young man no longer had a future," Roth 
says. "It was necessary for me to start all over again and become an individual 
who did have a literary future, even though I was no longer that lyric artist." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, he married Muriel Parker, a Protestant New Englander who gave up her 
promising musical career to rear their two sons. The family moved to Boston, 
where Roth worked as a machinist, then to a farm in Maine, where he raised 
waterfowl and sold blueberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth's sojourn as a workingman "had that effect of bringing me back to the 
normal human condition," he says. "After 40 or 50 years, I got a new 
perspective on things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His retreat from the literary world was compromised in 1964, when "Call It 
Sleep" was republished to great acclaim. He had repudiated the novel as 
inauthentic for failing to tell the whole story of his early life. How did it 
feel to be feted 30 years after the fact? 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles. "I took the royalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth resumed writing in 1979, feeling his way as he sought a new fictional 
form. Tentative, stream-of-consciousness musings became a torrent that 
culminated in a 3,200-page manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite sharing the same themes and setting, Roth's two chronicles of a 
childhood remembered couldn't be more different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call It Sleep" is filled with richly lyrical prose, especially where Roth 
renders the mother's Yiddish dialect in a beautiful, poetic English. "Mercy of 
a Rude Stream," with its leaner, more prosaic style, includes many passages in 
Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
 And where "Call It Sleep" culminates in a confrontation, the first volume of 
"Mercy of a Rude Stream" is episodic, unfolding laconically. The lack of 
dramatic tension has disappointed some reviewers, who think the new book 
doesn't make a point. 
</P>
<P>
 There is ample dramatic material, Roth says, but readers will have to wait for 
the next volume, "A Diving Rock on the Hudson," due for release next January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the power of Roth's prose, his thinly veiled memoir is a painful read 
because of its persistent current of self-judgment. How could he harbor such 
dislike of the abused child he once was -- or the gifted young writer he 
became? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was justified, after you read some of the escapades," he says. 
These will not be recounted until the second volume. 
</P>
<P>
 What he regards as his youthful failings "were eliminated, erased in 'Call It 
Sleep.' " he says. "When I wrote 'Mercy of a Rude Stream,' they came to the 
fore." 
</P>
<P>
 Having faced up to those shortcomings in his fiction, Roth seems prepared to 
ignore the caustic inner voice that has hounded him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than use the word forgiveness , I've become reconciled with the louse 
I was," he says. "It's one of those things -- no use regretting any further."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: ARSENIO HALL VS. LOUIS FARRAKHAN: IT'S A ROUT; TELEVISION: 
THE TALK-SHOW HOST'S SOFT-INTERVIEWING STYLE PROVES NO MATCH FOR THE SMOOTH 
NATION OF ISLAM LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has as much right to the public 
airwaves as anyone, and Arsenio Hall can book any guest he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wishes, Hall can hand over virtually his entire syndicated show to 
Farrakhan and grovel -- as he did, in effect, Friday night. His show, his call. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of groups slammed Hall for inviting Farrakhan, and publicly urged him 
to reconsider. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles was one that strongly 
protested, its associate dean, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, questioning both the 
ability and disposition of the soft-interviewing Hall to get tough with someone 
as smooth and quick on his feet as Farrakhan. Anyone who has both seen 
Farrakhan speak and seen Hall's series would appreciate the concern about this 
hybrid pairing. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious, though, that no one complained much publicly when candidate Bill 
Clinton visited "Arsenio" during the 1992 campaign. Hall that night didn't 
utter a harsh word even about Clinton's sax playing. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of double standards, there were no objections when David 
Letterman -- not exactly Ted Koppel himself -- traded jokes on his CBS show 
last year with Vice President Al Gore. And wasn't that President Clinton 
schmoozing by satellite Saturday night with host Pat O'Brien on the whimsical 
CBS Sports post-Olympics show. There were plenty of sizzling topics that 
O'Brien could toss at Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat to Bill: "Next up for us is college basketball. How about those Arkansas 
Razorbacks, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 And how about that "Arsenio," huh? Just because Hall can do what he wants on 
his show (airing here on KCOP-TV Channel 13) doesn't mean he shouldn't be held 
accountable. It was a typical evening for Hall. As a worshipful patsy, he was 
brilliant. As an interviewer, he stunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference was that facing the cooing talk-show host this time was a 
charismatic 60-year-old Muslim minister, at once a significant African American 
leader and a controversial one, his admirable self-help/black pride message 
having been partially eclipsed by public statements that at times made him seem 
prejudiced against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent case involved his somewhat belated denunciation and suspension 
of a top aide who had called Jews "bloodsuckers of the black nation," referred 
to gays as "faggots" and said Pope John Paul II was a "cracker" and "in the 
palm of the Jewish white man" and all whites in South Africa. Although calling 
Khalid Abdul Muhammad's manner "repugnant" and "mean-spirited," Farrakhan 
endorsed "the truths" spoken by his aide. In response to press coverage of the 
incident after criticism of him by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 
among others, Farrakhan wondered aloud if there was "Jewish manipulation of the 
media." 
</P>
<P>
 And there he was Friday night with Arsenio Hall. From Farrakhan's view, it was 
a great gig: Hall's friendly questions, his own uninterrupted eloquence. "Wow!" 
Hall exclaimed at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the attempt to bar Farrakhan from "Arsenio" was not only 
wrong, but a bad strategy that backfired by seeming to support Farrakhan's 
theory that he is the target of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, putting one down the middle of the plate: "Why do you think there has 
been so much resistance to me having you on the show?" 
</P>
<P>
 One swing, and out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan said he'd been invited to appear on a bunch of network interview 
shows. "How about 'Oprah' and Montel (Williams)?" Hall asked about two African 
American TV hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Farrakhan said. Then he grinned. Then he laughed. Then the friendly 
studio audience applauded. The implication was that Hall was the only black 
talk-show host courageous enough to book Farrakhan. More media manipulation by 
Jews? Oh, this man is good. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I'm on a show where they think I will be seriously opposed, it's 
all right," he said, not identifying the ominous "they." He added: "Their fear 
is that nobody will oppose me, and as a result truth will get out, and people 
might be made free." Which "they" obviously oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said he'd gotten a call from Whoopi Goldberg "who was very confused about 
this night. She's black and she's Jewish. I've gotten calls from Irv Rubin (the 
Jewish Defense League leader). I've talked to many people in the community. 
I've heard terms like the 'new black Hitler.' " Would Farrakhan respond? 
</P>
<P>
 This was classic. Hitler's crimes were so epic -- leading to the annihilation 
of an estimated 13 million innocents -- that calling anyone in the U.S. a new 
Hitler is hyperbole that only someone who is an extremist would engage in. By 
asking Farrakhan the "new black Hitler" question, Hall was using the fringe to 
define and discredit the mainstream, as if all of Farrakhan's critics equated 
him with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan laughed. He "never desired to put another human being in an oven," 
he said. "To call me a Hitler, I ask why?" Could it be, he wondered, that 
"they" are fearful that he will use his great oratory to urge blacks to "take 
vengeance" on their oppressors? He wouldn't, he said. He now spoke to a rapt 
Hall. "They," he said, had threatened Hall. "They" had threatened to take his 
show off the air. "Yeah, it's been rough," Hall agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was time for "The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews," 
the Nation of Islam volume that charges that Jews were "key operatives" in the 
historical crime of slavery, that their role was "inordinate" and 
"disproportionate," that they had a "monumental culpability in . . . the black 
holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall noted that Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro American Studies 
Department at Harvard, had called the book "the bible of the new 
anti-Semitism." Hall cited no passages from the book. He omitted Gates' 
accusation that the book "massively misrepresents the historical record, 
largely through a process of cunningly selective quotation of often reputable 
sources. . . ." He also omitted Gates' even more troubling charge that the book 
suggests reported misdeeds by Jews are "the signs of an essential nature that 
is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Hall merely displayed and asked Farrakhan to comment on the "new 
anti-Semitism" charge, which Farrakhan naturally rejected and obscured. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's producers had promised to include pre-taped comments and questions from 
those with something to say about Farrakhan, but never got to that. Nor were 
questions asked about the slaughter of dozens of Palestinians in a mosque on 
the West Bank or about the "truths" that Farrakhan found in the speech of 
Khalid Abdul Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
 There was time for a gospel group near the end of the hour, and time for Hall 
to mention that he had a Jewish producer. You know how it is, some of his best 
friends. . . .

REELING IN THE YEARS; TURNING 40, RON HOWARD IS JUST HAPPY TO BE MAKING MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the moment, it would seem Ron Howard has a lot to fret about. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the forever young-looking baby boomer who still embodies the 
boyish charm of the Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham TV characters he 
immortalized, turns 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three weeks from now, the child star-turned-top drawer-director's latest 
movie, "The Paper," an ensemble comedy drama set in the world of tabloid 
journalism, opens. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite any success he's had with all-American mainstream comedies, he's 
yet to prove he can make deeper meaning movies and must feel the urgency to 
stretch like Steven Spielberg, who after decades of hit popcorn pictures has 
only just arrived on the serious front. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, apparently, Howard doesn't feel much personal or professsional pressure, 
though his close friends and associates will tell you there's no one more 
driven and competitive than he. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very happy with his lot in life," says producer Brian Grazer of his 
best pal and partner, who's directed such popular films as "Parenthood," 
"Cocoon" and "Splash" and, more recently, the less successful outtings 
"Backdraft" and "Far and Away." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, says Grazer, "doesn't see 40 as being any kind of threshold in his 
life. And even though he really wants 'The Paper' to do well, he doesn't think 
any one movie is going to (adversely) affect his collective body of work." The 
producer says Howard is "convinced he's going to live the career and life of a 
Billy Wilder, where he'll still be vital and shooting when he's 80."  
</P>
<P>
 Ask Howard if he's concerned about aging or any unrealized career goals, and 
he'll convincingly tell you he's in no particular hurry. This is a guy 
obviously very comfortable in his own skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even arriving 30 minutes late for a lunch interview last week at a posh New 
York restaurant, he appeared relatively unrattled and confident that his 
sincere-sounding apology for being detained by a TV taping was enough to pacify 
a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering tomato juice with a lemon slice, he eased into a conversation about 
the advantages of living 3,000 miles away from the Hollywood madness with his 
wife Cheryl and their four children, Bryce, 13; nine-year-old twins Jocelyn and 
Paige; and Reed, 6. "I wanted to find a place to raise the kids that is not 
dominated by the entertainment buisness," explains Howard, who grew up in 
Burbank, California and says it was his wife of 19 years who "ultimately 
twisted my arm" to move to the East Coast in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Howard considers himself bicoastal, being he travels twice a month to 
Los Angeles, where his and Grazer's movie company, Imagine Films Entertainment, 
is based. "I really enjoy the time away and I also have a wonderful time when I 
go to L.A.," says Howard, noting, "I work my ass off but I also socialize like 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 From his perspective, Hollywood hasn't changed much over the years, but for 
the "enhanced media coverage," which he believes has made L.A. "an even more 
nerve-racking place." Such intense focus on Hollywood admittedly makes him 
nervous. "If you're in the middle of it, it feels like your value is being 
measured on a daily or weekly basis." Taking particular exception to the way 
boxoffice results and TV ratings are reported, Howard bemoans: "Every mistep 
becomes a big story, so you feel a little more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the press has been very kind to Howard. That is until last year when 
he found himself and his expensive Irish epic "Far and Away" attacked, with 
some critics accusing him of being a David Lean wanna-be. The film, which cost 
$60 million before marketing, grossed around $60 million domestically and $130 
million worldwide, but was widely characterized as a colossal disappointment. 
"It was pretty painful," recalls Howard. "I kept thinking what am I going to do 
when I have an actual, bonafide flop-which is more or less inevitable?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard may criticize the media for falling prey to what he calls "the easy 
story," but as the former co-editor of his high school paper and someone who 
once considered pursuing journalism in college, the filmmaker has great respect 
for the Fourth Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's why he jumped at the chance to make a film on the subject when the right 
script came along. During a fortuituos meeting with David Koepp ("Jurassic 
Park"), he learned the writer was close to completing a script with his brother 
Stephen Koepp (a senior editor at Time Magazine) about 24 hours in the life of 
a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Paper," said the director, "was very much what I was looking for having 
done two movies ('Backdraft' and 'Far and Away') where the directorial 
challenges were more logistical than anything else...I was eager to do a movie 
dominated by strong performances hopefully given by great actors." He got his 
wish with an ensemble cast that includes Michael Keaton, Marisa Tomei, Glenn 
Close, Robert Duvall and Randy Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I liked about the script was I found the human situations to be born of 
a very relatable truth," says Howard. "The dynamic of pressure that the 
characters were feeling in their personal and professional lives was something 
that I found funny and emotional." The issue of deadlines, he viewed as the 
perfect metaphor for what people go through in real daily life. Perhaps still 
stinging from the press beating he took over "Far and Away," Howard brought 
"The Paper" in at $31 million, about $1.5 million under budget and eight days 
ahead of schedule. The film shot entirely in New York, mainly in a Manhattan 
office building that doubled as the authentic looking newsroom for the story's 
ficticious paper the New York Sun. "We created our own strucutre for the Sun 
based on an amaglamation of what we were observing at the Daily News and the 
New York Post," said Howard, who did a month of on-site research, sitting in on 
editorial meetings and picking the brains of journalists, including the Post's 
former editor and columnist Pete Hamill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While hanging out at the Post, the paper went through a tumultuous period when 
new owners and staffers flew in and out the door at lightning speed. He wound 
up spending more time at the News when a number of Post reporters defected 
there. One of the most compelling incidents he observed was when a News 
reporter got a tip from a secondary source that Darryl Strawberry was going to 
be investigated by the IRS. "They were literaly pacing and pulling their hair 
out and pushing back deadlines," recalls Howard, "but all they had was a 
secondary source." They knew they had "the perfect New York City tabloid story, 
but they also said 'if we're wrong, it's terrible...but, dammit I wish I knew 
if the Post was going with this."' 
</P>
<P>
 The paper finally held the story and broke it exclusively two days later when 
it could be substantiated. "It was really interesting to see these guys suffer 
with this choice. It was an ethical question, but also a question of the 
competition."  
</P>
<P>
 Both Grazer and Howard know "The Paper" is not a movie that can be easily sold 
on concept alone, but rather on word of mouth. To that end, Perry Katz, 
marketing chief for the film's distributor Universal Pictures, said the movie 
will be screened extensively for press and opinion makers and on March 18 will 
open for an exclusive run in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto and Chicago. The 
next day Universal will sneak the picture in bout 800 theaters, then follow on 
March 25 with a wide release. Howard admits that while several of his films, 
probably "The Paper" more than the others, touches on some serious issues, he 
hasn't really taken the full plunge dramatically yet. "I keep sort of sticking 
my toe in and doing sequences with no bells and whistles and no structured 
jokes...I'm just kind of testing a lot of different areas as a director as I go 
along."  
</P>
<P>
 He asks, "Do I want to do a 'Schindler's List?' Yeah, but I don't have that 
project on my shelf like Steven did for 10 years." There are however, a couple 
of movies Imagine is developing that are "much more serious," though not 
exactly issue-oriented. One Howard is seriously considering directing next 
(pending the right cast), is tentatively called "13" (formerly "Lost Moon"), 
based on the true story of the near disastrous 1970 Apollo 13 moon mission. 
Former Newsweek editor Bill Broyles and Al Reinert adapted the screenplay from 
a book by astrouaut James A. Lovell Jr. (commander of the Apollo crew) and 
Jeffrey Kluger. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who choses to only direct one film every summer, is also considering 
"The Postman," to star Tom Hanks; a remake of "Treasure Island"; and a thriller 
set in a South America prison called "Caged." He'll also quench a longtime 
thirst to make a movie about the controversial subject of capital punishment 
when next year he directs a movie version of John Grisham's soon-to-be 
published book "The Chamber," about a guy on death row who's exhausted his 
final appeals and the lawyer who comes to his aid turns out to be his grandson. 
 
</P>
<P>
 And while he eventually wantd to direct an issue-oriented picture, he says, 
"I'm also not stumbling over myself to search for that particular quality. I'm 
not looking for the Oscar movie." His gameplan is "to just patiently go about 
the business of making as many good movies as I can and I don't think I can 
manipulate it beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard says while he hasn't "entirely given up on my drive to be all things to 
all people, I feel it's fading." He says he looks forward to the decade of his 
fifties, "when I can use everything I've learned to really push the limits a 
little more and be less cautious."

LANSING TO STAY AT PARAMOUNT; MOVIES: SHE WILL REMAIN AS STUDIO HEAD AFTER THE 
VIACOM MERGER, ACCORDING TO PARAMOUNT SOURCES. THE FATE OF HER BOSS, STANLEY R. 
JAFFE, IS NOT YET KNOWN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherry Lansing is staying. That much is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing, who has headed Paramount Pictures for the past 14 months, has quietly 
informed her staff that she has accepted an offer to remain in her post after 
the mega-merger between Viacom Inc. and Paramount Communications Inc. is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still uncertain, however, is what the future holds for Lansing's boss, Stanley 
R. Jaffe, the combative president of Paramount Communications in New York, a 
job that oversees not only the famous studio but Paramount's television, sports 
and publishing units. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe, Lansing's close friend and one-time filmmaking partner, has been 
rumored for weeks to be on the way out, perhaps to buy his beloved New York 
Knicks and New York Rangers, which Paramount owns. Jaffe, however, has not 
announced that he intends to leave and was in Los Angeles last week working 
with Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Viacom won the $10-billion bidding war earlier this month, questions 
have arisen over what will become of Lansing and the upper echelon of the 
studio when Viacom's chairman, Sumner Redstone, and Chief Executive Officer 
Frank Biondi assume control of a new colossal media empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wondered if the 49-year-old Lansing -- the highest-ranking woman in 
Hollywood -- would go back to being a producer. But she seems to enjoy the 
hectic sometimes thankless job of running a major studio that had been all but 
moribund upon her arrival in late 1992 when she replaced Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But even on the day that the epic merger battle officially ended between 
Redstone's Viacom and Barry Diller's QVC Network, Lansing received a phone call 
from Redstone and Biondi asking her to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, QVC Network had also privately assured Lansing earlier in the 
corporate tussle that she could remain even if Diller won. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing declined to be interviewed for this story, but Paramount sources said 
that her decision to remain studio chief was principally driven by her job 
satisfaction and a desire to work with the filmmakers she has brought to the 
lot and see their projects bear fruit. Lansing has four years remaining on a 
five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big-name filmmakers she has brought on board are Frank Marshall and 
Kathleen Kennedy, Barry Levinson, Gail Anne Hurd, Alan Ladd Jr. and Walter 
Hill. She has also cemented relationships with Scott Rudin ("The Firm," "Addams 
Family Values"). Rudin made a deal to go to TriStar Pictures after a loud fight 
with Jaffe, but Lansing soothed his hurt feelings and postponed his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, trade publications reported that Sydney Pollack, who 
directed "The Firm," was in final negotiations to close a production deal at 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those filmmakers, Lansing also hopes for big projects from Tom 
Cruise, who has a production office on the lot, as well as producers such as 
Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme ("Patriot Games"), Lorne Michaels ("Wayne's 
World") and the ever-controversial Robert Evans, the one-time Paramount boss 
who last year produced the Sharon Stone film "Sliver." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount had two certified hits in 1993 in "The Firm," a legal thriller 
starring Cruise, and "Indecent Proposal," a romantic comedy starring Robert 
Redford, which Lansing herself had begun producing before becoming studio 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also had a less-than-illustrious string of movies during the second 
half of the year. The highly anticipated sequels, "Wayne's World 2" and "Addams 
Family Values," did not generate the huge returns that the originals did. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio came in sixth in overall market share in 1993 with 15 releases; 
Lansing's goal this year is to make more than 20 films. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the movies in the wings are "Milk Money," for which Lansing paid $1 
million for the script alone; "Clear and Present Danger" with Harrison Ford; 
"Beverly Hills Cop III" with Eddie Murphy, and "Forest Gump" with Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the hottest scripts on the lot have gone to Ladd, the former head of 
MGM who recently joined Paramount. Ladd was given "The Brady Bunch" to develop 
and also has a Mel Gibson project, along with "Jericho Equation," a thriller by 
the writers of "Predator," which Lansing's husband, William Friedkin, will 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
 The "go projects" include "Congo," the Michael Crichton book for which Kennedy 
and Marshall are now scouting locations; a new "Star Trek," which is in 
pre-production, and director John Badham's "Drop Zone," a film about a U.S. 
marshal who gets involved in sky-diving while investigating the murder of his 
partner, which is just weeks away from the start of shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing intends to keep her creative team in place. Under the supervision of 
John Goldwyn, that team includes senior vice presidents Karen Rosenfelt and 
Michelle Manning; vice presidents of production Bob Jaffe, Don Granger and Tom 
Levine, and vice presidents of creative affairs Bradley Kessell and 
John-Michael Maas. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bob Jaffe, Stanley's son, has strong support within Paramount's 
leadership, there are some on the lot who wonder if he would remain should his 
father leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a nonentity," said one critic of Bob Jaffe. "He's supervising 
(the filming of) 'I.Q.,' which is shooting screen tests right now for the role 
of Einstein, and he's off on a skiing vacation. . . . Well, he has a safety 
net." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Jaffe's office said Friday that he was not in and that he never talks to 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing's efforts to re-energize Paramount were hampered because, during the 
uncertainty over the studio's ownership, the creative community wanted to know 
if she would be around to see projects to completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been aggressively (looking for scripts) but there has been a cloud 
over the horizon," said one industry observer. "Everything has kind of been in 
a holding pattern at the studio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Lansing went about her work during her first year filling an empty film 
pipeline, criticism arose in some quarters that the studio was working 
directors to the bone, giving them impossible post-production deadlines to meet 
-- a charge Lansing in earlier interviews strongly denied. She has said she 
would rather postpone the release of a film if the directors felt they needed 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rap was that if you had a picture in production during the last couple of 
months, they'd been real hard-ass on you to complete it," said a source, who 
like other Paramount sources for this story asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculated that studio hierarchy became stern taskmasters because 
executives on the West Coast wanted to show Viacom and QVC that they weren't 
squandering resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their line (to filmmakers) was, 'We're running a tight ship here,' " one 
source recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing department was said to be under pressure to successfully release 
"Blue Chips," the Nick Nolte basketball film directed by Friedkin. The film 
opened Feb. 18 to a healthy $10.2 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumor was there was a lot riding on 'Blue Chips' and they were dumping a 
ton of money on it to make it open," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing had also come in for criticism after Friedkin made a multi-picture 
deal at Paramount and received high-profile projects. Lansing has earlier said 
that to avoid any conflict of interest, she leaves all business dealings 
involving her husband's films to Stanley Jaffe, who personally oversaw the 
making of "Blue Chips." 
</P>
<P>
 In her job, Lansing is on the telephone daily with Jaffe in New York, 
discussing the status of films in the works. While she has the authority to 
greenlight films, she concedes that she confers with him before signing off on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But should Jaffe depart, the question would then be, how would Lansing perform 
without someone as her sounding board in New York? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such uncertainties, sources say her decision to stay at Paramount -- 
with no guarantee that Jaffe will remain -- shows her independence. 
</P>
<P>
 She is doing what is best for her, a Paramount insider said, although she 
loves Stanley and the working relationship she has with him.

WEIRD AL'S ALTERNATIVE FOR 'OLYMPICALLY CHALLENGED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESS BRAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one years ago, young Alfred Yankovic wrote to his junior high classmate 
Doug Kyle, covering a loose-leaf page with copies of Mad magazine illustrations 
and concluding with the instruction, "Always keep this letter, and someday you 
can proudly say, 'poiuytrewq.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That day finally came on Friday, when Kyle, now 35 and a pastor at the Free 
Church of Laguna Hills, saw his friend for the first time since the 1970s. 
Alfred -- now known as Weird Al Yankovic -- was appearing at Santa Ana's 
Roxbury South nightclub, and Kyle, his precious letter neatly folded in his 
wallet, had come to say the magic word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I wasn't actually able to pronounce" poiuytrewq, said Kyle, 
who spent some time reminiscing with Yankovic before the show began. "But it 
was great to see him anyway. His humor seems to be very much the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Few present had such a personal connection to Yankovic, but on a night when 
much of the world sat glued to the women's figure-skating finals at the Winter 
Games, Weird Al offered an alternative for those he called the "Olympically 
challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 Yankovic, who has built a career out of parodying pop songs, did not actually 
play any Friday night, but instead offered another form of tribute to the 
entertainers he mocks: a pageant of celebrity impersonators. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankovic's act largely was limited to introducing the look-alikes -- he 
welcomed "Tina Turner" as "a meal-ticket for Ike for many years," another 
singer as "First he was Prince, then he was a symbol, this week I think he's an 
odor" -- but that didn't seem to discourage the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like Prince, but I've always wanted to see a Prince 
impersonator," said Louis Diaz, 23, a hardware store salesman from Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz spent his last $10 to get in to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any money left to really party here, but I didn't want to miss 
Weird Al," he said. "Besides, I'd like to meet somebody, and it has to be a 
woman who likes Weird Al." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz had come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the weird and scrawny types," explained a 21-year-old who gave her 
name as Anna Scandalous. Chimed in her friend, Karen Palumbo, also 21, "Weird 
Al is awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Others brought suggestions for Yankovic's future work. Although Yankovic 
already has satirized a top alternative band with his song and video, "Smells 
Like Nirvana," Sean O'Neill, 21, of Irvine, wanted to hear a parody of the 
latest Nirvana hit, "Rape Me." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not, however, able to come up with a convincing theme. "Maybe he could 
call it 'Bake Me,' " O'Neill suggested. "No, wait, I got it: 'Tape Me.' How 
about, 'Tape Me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yankovic sighed when later confronted with the suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 " You only had to listen to these ideas for an hour," he told a reporter. " I 
have to listen to them every day, everywhere I go." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Yankovic was indulgent of his fans, mingling among them until the club 
closed. He said he felt awkward on stage, since, despite the top billing he 
received and the ubiquitous Weird Al videos playing throughout the club, he 
hadn't performed any songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Yankovic, who is best-known for parodies of such Michael Jackson songs 
as "Bad" and "Beat It," said the experience brought him a peculiar empathy with 
the beleaguered entertainer, who was criticized for failing to perform at last 
week's "Jackson Family Honors" concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're soul mates now," Yankovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 By not playing, however, Yankovic pleased at least one member of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bugs me that he can make a fortune by parodying these songs," said Jeff 
Montgomery, 30, of Huntington Beach. "He's making a living off synthesized 
music, off people living synthesized lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, an amateur bass player, was one of the few who had come to see the 
evening's other act: Harry Dean Stanton, the veteran character actor who 
recently has been singing roots rock in Southland nightspots. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton and his combo went on at 12:30 a.m., after Yankovic and his 
impersonators had left the stage. For the handful who stayed to listen, 
Stanton's band was the evening's highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the real deal," Montgomery said, "the real thing, man. Whether he's 
playing here or to 10 drunks in some bar in Santa Fe, he's the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton himself was more generous to the evening's other act. "I love his 
satire," he said of Yankovic. "Didn't he used to be on 'Saturday Night Live?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the people who came to mimic Madonna, Hammer and George Michael, 
among others, Stanton chose his words carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way," he said while sipping whiskey after his gig, "if 
you're an impersonator, you can't ever rise above your model."

STRINGS ATTACHED TO MUSIC HISTORY; TRIBUTE: CURATOR OF FENDER EXHIBIT IN 
FULLERTON TRACES INNOVATIONS OF THE LATE ORANGE COUNTY GUITAR MAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 "Brother musician, listen to a miracle!" 
</P>
<P>
 So declared the cover of one 1930s musical instrument catalogue featured in 
electric guitar historian Richard Smith's lecture -- aptly enough, on the 
history of the electric guitar -- Saturday at the Fullerton Museum Center. 
</P>
<P>
 As miracles go, the big twang of the electric guitar might not seem as 
immediately impressive as walking on water, but the stringed things have 
certainly had a pervasive effect on the culture of this old world. That is a 
notion implicit, though not oppressively so, in the museum's "Five Decades of 
Fender: The Sound Heard Around the World" exhibit, celebrating the creations of 
Fullerton's Henry Ford of the electric guitar, the late Leo Fender. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith curated the exhibit, and it clearly is a work of love. He has amassed 
more old, rare Fender instruments than have ever been under one roof, including 
such primordial guitars as the original 1940s prototype for the Fender Esquire, 
which, re-dubbed as the Telecaster, revolutionized the music world as the first 
successful mass-produced solid-body guitar.  
</P>
<P>
 Though an ungainly plank of wood, it is the sort of thing that produces 
rapture in guitar players and collectors. Fortunately for others, the exhibit 
also allows a broader appreciation of Fender's works, showing how they sprang 
from a peculiarly Southern Californian sense of style and invention, and how 
they went on to influence music around the world. Though the exhibit, which 
opened Dec. 10, doesn't complete its run until April 2, it has already become 
the most well-attended exhibit in the museum's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton resident Smith was formerly a columnist for Guitar Player magazine 
and has authored a respected book on Rickenbacker guitars, as well as a 
long-anticipated tome on Fender expected out late this year. He was a friend of 
Fender, who died in 1991, as well as one of a long line of working musicians 
who Fender turned to in perfecting his instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though expert in the screw sizes, magnet composition and other minutiae in 
which guitar collectors revel, Smith also can make his subject compelling to a 
more general audience. He has previously made keen observations on the social 
effects of the electric guitar, such as its role in bringing to global 
prominence the "working man's" styles of American country, blues, R&B and rock 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much of that insight went into his presentation Saturday, which was more 
of a straight-forward citing of the events and persons that led to the 
development of the modern electric guitar. It was not so much a lecture as it 
was a heavily annotated slide show, and, as a result, was neither as lucid nor 
linear as it might have been.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than use a few slides to illustrate points he was making in his speech, 
the presentation was instead slide-driven, with Smith's narrative sometimes 
falling by the wayside as he tried to keep pace with the parade of faces and 
stringed instruments projected behind him. Given that, as well as having to 
introduce terminology like vibrato bar and truss rod to guitar novices, and the 
polite but unnecessary constraint of trying to keep his program brief, Smith 
did cover a lot of ground. 
</P>
<P>
 While taking nothing away from Fender's genius, Smith made it clear that his 
pioneering innovations didn't take place in a vacuum, but, rather, were the 
culmination of a long line of oddball California creativity.  
</P>
<P>
 According to him, that line started in the 1920s with the invention in Los 
Angeles of National guitars, which, instead of wood, relied on resonator cones 
of spun aluminum for their volume. Next came the invention of the first 
electric guitar pickup -- a Rube Goldberg-looking thing with huge horseshoe 
magnets -- by Rickenbacker in the 1930s. It also was a West Coast innovation, 
where designers weren't tied to wood craftsmanship of the East Coast companies 
tied to European traditions. Rickenbacker, for example, had also manufactured 
toothbrush handles of the then-new plastic Bakelite, and couldn't see any 
reason not to make his guitars of the same stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 These infidel innovations were first employed on the slide guitars used in the 
Hawaiian music that was popular early in the century. Smith explained that 
those instruments found their way into other styles of music, such as country 
and Western, after Hawaiian musicians had toured the States in tent shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Though racing over a lot of material, Smith's delivery wasn't dry. With one 
photo, where an electric slide player was seated amid several acoustic 
instrument players in front of a tacky Hawaiian-themed backdrop, he explained, 
"You might be wondering why he needed an electric instrument. It's so he could 
be heard over the volcano you see there." 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs, catalogues and other source material Smith collected for his 
slides often gave a sense for the weird spirit of their times. One from the 
1930s showed Bert Lynn and His All Electric Orchestra, with futuristic 
Rickenbacker electric violins, bass fiddles and other odd instruments presided 
over by director Lynn's Buck Rogers-looking control panel. 
</P>
<P>
 He also presented catalogue pages suggesting that parents buy their kids 
instruments because they "solve individual problems" and "promote a feeling of 
importance." 
</P>
<P>
 The later slides and recollections of Fender's early days -- his first shop 
was on Harbor Boulevard, just a few blocks from the museum -- were evocative of 
a more innocent Orange County, when Fender would roll his public address system 
around on a trailer to local events, and his partner Doc Kauffman would play 
electric guitar in a local supermarket, announcing store specials between 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the anti-tradition of the California guitar makers before him, Fender had 
"a vision of what a guitar should sound like, instead of the way it had, " 
Smith said. The result was the Telecaster, which had a treble-laden presence 
musicians came to call "that take-off tone" for the way it would blast out of 
any musical setting.  
</P>
<P>
 After the presentation, Smith said if he'd had more time he would have 
included a number of examples of the "unintended consequences" of Fender's 
inventions, such as the way the sturdy instruments come in handy in a bar 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, he only included one "unintended consequence" slide, which said 
loads. It was a photo featuring several instruments made by Fender -- who was a 
lifelong country music fan -- in the hands of wild rockers Gene Vincent and the 
Bluecaps.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHY WOULD ANYONE LAUGH AT 'SCHINDLER'S LIST'?; EDUCATION KEY TO 
SEEING, UNDERSTANDING THE FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY K. WATANABE, Jeffrey K. Watanabe is a junior in the urban studies 
program at Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the article "Did Cultures Clash Over 'Schindler's'?" (Calendar, 
Jan. 22), I found it appalling to read that about 20 kids in an Oakland movie 
theater laughed at a scene where a Nazi soldier shot a Jewish woman. It seems 
to me that these kids, like a lot of others, had no idea what the Holocaust was 
all about. I recall back in high school that our history classes did not spend 
much time on the Holocaust. In college, where I am now, you are not required to 
take specific courses for this period even if it is in your major. It is not 
required . . . and never has been. I am not saying that this period should 
govern more class time than any other, but concessions should be made somehow. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Levy, spokesman for Amblin Entertainment, the "Schindler's List" 
producing company, said in the article that Amblin sent 30,000 guides about the 
film to high schools. That's a fine idea -- a measure to try to educate kids. 
If students never received any guides, and had no background on the subject, it 
should be the teacher's responsibility to supplement them before taking them to 
view the film. Educating the students -- especially about subject matter such 
as this -- should have been the priority. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who works for a theater, I have had the unfortunate task of asking 
individuals to quiet down and not disturb the audience. In fact, my manager 
recently told me a story not unlike this one. About a month ago, an elderly 
woman came to our theater for her birthday to see a showing of "Schindler's 
List." About half of her family and relatives showed up to watch with her, 
leaving the other half of the prepaid tickets unused. The woman then went 
around the Beverly Connection mall giving them away free to anyone who cared to 
see the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hope was that those going in could learn something about a time in history 
many believe never occurred. Unfortunately, a few kids who went in with free 
tickets did not stop talking and jeering at the film. They could not have been 
oblivious to the violence and killing on the screen. But I assume that, like 
the students in Oakland, they were not prepared to comprehend what they were 
seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-hour-plus film in black and white about the Holocaust may not be 
everyone's choice, but those who decide to view it must be prepared and 
understand. I find it hard to believe kids today are so desensitized to 
violence that when they see the strange convulsions of someone who's been shot, 
their first instinct is to laugh. If one of their friends was gunned down on 
the way home, would they stand there and burst into laughter at the way he/she 
died? 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, it deeply hurt me to read this article. It seems that some kids 
today do not get the sufficient knowledge to understand the significance of the 
past. In the past couple of years, both local and national events have shown me 
how important it is to understand diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 My hope is that incidents such as the one in Oakland never happen again. Levy 
said that Steven Spielberg hoped that if more Holocaust study courses come out 
of this, a great deal will have been accomplished. I agree with Spielberg. My 
only other hope is that people begin to understand historically important 
events such as the Holocaust. Anyone who is not ready to see this film should 
not go. The emotional impact envelops most of the audience that attends with 
you. Uninformed people will only deprive themselves of a learning experience 
and deprive those in the theater around them.
