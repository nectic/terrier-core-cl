MUSIC REVIEW; BLOMSTEDT AND S.F. SYMPHONY BRING THE BLAHS TO THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The summer season at Hollywood Bowl is beginning to wind down. But while our 
own Philharmonic tours to conquer Europe, the parade of visiting orchestras 
grinds on at Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 This week we are playing host to Herbert Blomstedt -- a solidly professional 
old-school maestro -- and his San Francisco Symphony -- a perfectly competent 
orchestra that can be considerably more than that under the right conditions on 
the right night. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night apparently was not the right night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing went seriously wrong in a conservative program (the first of three 
consecutive conservative programs) devoted to Rachmaninoff's semi-somnolent 
quasi-valedictory Symphonic Dances and Beethoven's hardy Seventh Symphony. 
Unfortunately, nothing turned out to be genuinely memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just another opening, another show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda began with rather odd attention to the obligatory "Star-Spangled 
Banner." Ever courteous, Blomstedt waved his stick directly at the sing-along 
throng, turning his back on the orchestra. No problem. The players obviously 
know how their boss looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Any innocent patriot out front who tried to follow Blomstedt sign-language, 
however, was in trouble. Even allowing for the automatic confusion enforced by 
sonic time delay in the wide open spaces, the beat seemed erratic, the melodic 
impetus jerky. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one approached the real music on the agenda with a 
little trepidation. Not to worry. Early in the concert, it became clear that 
the San Franciscans understand what Blomstedt wants. After nine years under his 
no-nonsense leadership, they have had a lot of practice reading his complex 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachmaninoff's melancholic, sometimes bloated, occasionally poignant Symphonic 
Dances of 1940 didn't exactly soar on this occasion. Still, the pacing was 
always logical. The stresses all came in the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the abiding murk of the "improved" amplification system (it hasn't 
been a good summer for the microphone engineers), the orchestra sounded bright 
and tight. That is more than could be said for the itinerant ensemble from 
Detroit last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Blomstedt managed to turn Beethoven's indomitable Seventh 
into something like an extended academic exercise. There were no exaggerations 
here, and no distortions. Nor was there much inspiration or excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro, ever cool, took no chances. The internal repetitions emerged 
dutiful rather than climactic. The secondary voices tended to get buried in 
textural mush. The tempos were brisk yet rigid. The ultimate cadence brought 
relief rather than resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 We probably can thank Beethoven more than Blomstedt for the inevitable 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Blomstedt had the good sense to resist any temptation to add an encore. 
Beethoven is a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1994-95 season will be Blomstedt's last as music director in San 
Francisco. The mood and the mode will no doubt change drastically when Michael 
Tilson Thomas takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although a stellar soloist might have made the occasion more festive, and 
the bill more attractive, the concert reportedly attracted an audience of 
9,215. The crowd didn't look that big to the untrained eye. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was a buzzingly busy night in the sky, with eight aeronautical intrusions 
-- most of them obliterating Beethoven's pianissimo passages, of course. One 
wonders what happened to the official system that used to route planes away 
from the Bowl on concert nights.

JAZZ REVIEW; HOLLAND QUARTET STARTS SLOW, THEN KICKS IN AFTERBURNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it was the warm weather. Or the end of summer doldrums. Or maybe Dave 
Holland's quartet just had trouble getting into gear in its opening set at 
Catalina Bar & Grill Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's unusual instrumentation -- Eric Person on saxophones, Steve Nelson 
on vibes, Gene Jackson on drums and Holland on bass -- promised some 
interesting timbral combinations. And the initial tunes, especially Thelonious 
Monk's "Played Twice," produced strikingly lush textural blendings of alto 
saxophone and vibes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the playing was uneven. Occasionally it was excellent -- notably so in 
Holland's soloing, and in a rolling sense of time between vibes and drums that 
juxtaposed nicely with Holland's sure-footed bass lines. More often, however, 
the proceedings were tentative and uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, suddenly, in the middle of the final piece, Holland's "Ebb and Flow," 
everything changed. Jackson turned up the burners and began to generate an 
irresistible rhythmic torrent of energy. By taking his playing up another 
level, he sounded a wake-up call that immediately triggered the other musicians 
into their best work of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in perfect climax to a set that started slowly and ended in an 
accelerating rush of speed, Holland produced a lengthy cadenza amply justifying 
his reputation as one of the finest bassists in contemporary jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dave Holland Quartet at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. (213) 466-2210. $12 cover tonight and Sunday; $15 cover Friday and 
Saturday; two-drink minimum. The Holland Quartet plays two sets each night, 
8:30 and 10:30, through Sunday.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JULES SHEAR'S CRAFT SHINES IN TUNES, NOT PRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jules Shear is a power-pop hall of famer. The longtime cult hero, who 
headlined the Troubadour on Tuesday, mines a wealth of classic '60s pop 
devices, creating a world where taut, throbbing verses, soaring choruses and 
arching bridges trace the contours of emotional ups and downs (in Shear's case, 
mainly downs). 
</P>
<P>
 He's an uncommonly sophisticated craftsman in the style, fashioning hooks that 
have substance as well as catchiness and bringing an elegance to sound that's 
often simplistic. This touch has made him a regular supplier of hits for a 
varied roster of acts, from the Bangles to Cyndi Lauper to Alison Moyet. 
</P>
<P>
 His own career as a performer has been spotty, and his Troubadour set showed 
some reasons why. His singing is rough but earnest, with a tone like a nasal 
Jackson Browne, and he strains for the levels of expression his songs demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that, the optimum Shear show would rely more on tunes powered by his 
three backing musicians and less on the bare, intimate selections that he 
dropped in throughout Tuesday's set -- though, to be fair, the emotional peak 
was the halting, hymn-like ballad "If We Never Meet Again," where he 
transfigured the strain into an absorbing urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimum would also dispense with songs by other writers. The Walker 
Brothers' pseudo-Spector '64 hit "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore" is 
essentially a vocal showcase, so that was a pointless exercise, and Badfinger's 
"No Matter What" was an uneventful nod to his roots. RICHARD CROMELIN

ART REVIEWS; VASULKAS' INSTALLATIONS A ONE-TWO PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steina and Woody Vasulka's tandem video installations at LACE are engaging, 
his-and-her meditations on the slippery relationships among technology, nature, 
men and women. Greater than the sum of their parts, the two single-room 
displays of shifting, electronically generated images work in concert with one 
another to create a solid, one-two punch whose collective power builds as it 
echoes off its partner's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 On its own, Woody Vasulka's "Brotherhood, Table III," made up of war machines 
scavenged from Los Alamos, would seem to settle for rehashing tired stereotypes 
about connections between male alienation and technological violence. But next 
to Steina's simultaneously seductive and daunting "Borealis," his high-tech 
spectacle appears to be almost as soothing as it is destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Your eyes take a while to adjust to the engulfing darkness when you step off 
the street into Steina's immediately disorienting piece. Projected onto three, 
see-through screens suspended from the ceiling of the darkened main gallery, 
her looped videotape and soundtrack of crashing surf and other scenes from 
nature intensify the sense that you've lost your bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iceland-born, Czechoslovakia-educated and U.S.-based artist's 10-minute 
piece of video theater seems to stop time from passing in its usual manner. It 
also turns your experience of space inside-out. Nearly all its images are 
tipped on their side: Sunsets over the ocean become pulsating, vertical 
abstractions as cascading waves defy gravity and flow across (rather than down) 
your field of vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The most mesmerizing component results from a single video projection that the 
artist has duplicated and reversed, by projecting it through a translucent 
mirror, to produce an identical pair of images that move at perfectly 
synchronized cross-purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In this richly confounding work, it's often impossible to determine whether 
images are coming at you or drifting away. It's also difficult to know whether 
scenes are following a natural progression from past to present, or being 
manipulatively replayed in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody Vasulka's more compressed installation consists of a mechanized table 
that multiplies video and slide projections, sending them in six directions at 
once: onto four screens, the floor and ceiling. His imagery resembles the 
pixilated, computer-generated representations of high-tech war games, in which 
death and destruction appear as colorful yet bloodless abstractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the Vasulkas' installations undermine oppositions between culture 
and nature as they dispose of distinctions between men and women. By linking 
their distinct, mutually supporting pieces, they refute the idea that 
technology is masculine and intrinsically aggressive, and that nature is 
feminine and essentially nurturing. The Vasulkas' synergistic approach to 
collaborative work propels viewers into a realm where art demands active 
engagement.

<P>
 Out of Focus: At Cerritos College Fine Arts Gallery, "Object of Metaphor" is a 
hip, 11-artist exhibition that includes interesting work by a handful of 
talented young artists -- but still manages to be boring. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that its premise lacks sufficient focus to sustain an 
exhibition. Every thing that exists already embodies metaphoric meaning. An 
exhibition of art must do more than baldly state that objects convey 
significance. It must inflect these meanings in specific directions, 
emphasizing how individual works complement or contradict one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that the approach to art-making the show supports, in which 
artists use found-objects to trigger a viewer's memories and evoke poignant 
associations, feels increasingly cliched and outdated. A glut of fussed-over 
objects whose main significance lies in their literal, art-school references 
has diminished, rather than bolstered, the power of literary metaphors.

 The Paperboard Packaging Council (PPC) predicts that in a couple of years 
we'll see "smart" cartons that could tell you when your food is done or your 
milk has gone bad and maybe even talk to you. Hey, future shock time -- 
particularly since we just learned you should call that material "paperboard" 
(it's not PPC to say "cardboard"). Tastes Just Like Chicken!

 Visitors to Crowley's Ridge State Park in Walcott, Ark., complained about 
being bitten by mosquitoes, so park rangers decided to turn the liability into 
an asset by establishing an annual Mosquito Cook-Off. This year's first prize 
went to a recipe for mosquito cookies: Crush mosquitoes lightly and stir into 
boiling syrup mixed with brown sugar. Stir until mosquitoes are flavored and 
sterilized by heat (mosquitoes carry up to 16 disease bacteria). Pour on cookie 
sheet or pastry marble, let dry, cut into chips and add to commercial cookie 
mix.

 Runner-ups included mosquito supreme pizza and baked chili con 'skeeter. Take

 The latest culinary craze in Japan is eyes -- the eyes of the bigeye tuna. 
They turn out to contain large concentrations of DHA, an Omega-3 fatty acid 
which, the Japanese press has been claiming, lowers blood pressure, clears up 
the skin and even stimulates the brain. The eyes are going for $2 to $3 "a 
pop," as Seafood Leader magazine expressively put it. Wake Up and Smell My

 Ever chew on a pencil when you were a kid? These days Crayola's new Magic 
Scent crayons are a lot more tempting -- they emit food aromas such as coconut, 
chocolate and cherry when rubbed on paper. They're non-toxic, but the New York 
consumer protection board fears that because of the aromas children may try to 
eat the crayons, posing a danger of choking. Binney & Smith Co. claims that 
there were no reports of eating among the 170 familes that tested Magic Scent 
crayons. (The test families also helped the company decided not to make crayons 
with aromas of mushroom, onion, garlic, baby powder or garlic.) Galleria Goes 
Garlic 
</P>
<P>
 A peculiarly aromatic boutique opens at the Glendale Galleria Saturday, Sept. 
3. The Christopher Ranch Garlic Store, owned by the largest garlic shipper in 
Gilroy, will sell garlic sauces and salsas, whole peeled garlic, pickled 
garlic, you name it -- even, for the garlic lover who has everything, a 
14-karat gold-dipped garlic bulb. To request a gift guide or order garlic gift 
baskets, call (818) 637-2813 or fax 637-2815. The Garlic Store will ship 
anywhere in the United States. A Book You Can Pick Out in the Dark

 In other garlic news, Celestial Arts is publishing a series entitled Totally 
Cookbooks, by Helene Siegel and Karen Gillingham. Each of the four books is 
devoted to a single ingredient . . . and cutely die-cut into the shape of that 
ingredient. Each contains 49 recipes, mostly pretty sensible -- but when it 
comes to garlic, being sensible isn't enough, so it includes four garlic 
desserts: lemon-garlic sorbet, caramelized garlic, garlic-creme caramel, 
pineapple-garlic upside down cake. "Totally Garlic" and its companion volumes 
(on chiles, mushrooms and corn) are in bookstores now. CHARLES PERRY

RADIO HOMEMAKERS; MIKE ROY, MY POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ROY GRESS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 10 years, my pop, Mike Roy, spent his days in the kitchen at KNX 
across the microphone from his good friend and foil Dennis Bracken. Picture 
this: My padded papa, who reportedly "loved food but loved better food best," 
and rail-thin Denny, who adored baloney, loathed cheese and hardly knew a Dutch 
oven from a Dutch uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain-smoking cigarettes and drinking endless paper cups of coffee, the two 
gave out recipes and restaurant news, talked about wine and seemed to read each 
others' minds as they coaxed shy and tongue-tied callers to ask their 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conversation, so seamless and effortless, looked like child's play. It 
was not until I spent a year in radio myself that I realized what pros they 
really were. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio, Pop used to say, was in his blood. Television was fun, but radio was 
his true love, which is not surprising, as he'd been behind a microphone since 
his late teens. (His first broadcasts were trial-by-fire play-by-play coverage 
of the high school basketball team back in Jamestown, N.D., in 1929.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, he came to Southern California while emceeing "The 
Victory Parade of Spotlight Bands" tour. As the war wound down, he moved here 
and became the emcee for such national radio shows as "Duffy's Tavern," "Abbott 
and Costello" and "Screen Gem Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, KTLA asked Pop to try his hand at an experiment called "daytime 
television." Thus, "Mike Roy's Kitchen" started out inauspiciously on a hastily 
thrown-together set. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figured he could play some records and mix something up in a chafing 
dish," Mom recalled. "And he chatted. And chatted and chatted. There was a lot 
of time to fill. At some point, he took a call. Then there was another. And 
that was the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, "Mike Roy's Kitchen" had become a full-blown cooking show. 
Within two months, the Roys had a private telephone number, after a curious 
viewer called at 5 a.m. wanting to know how to can peaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our whole family was on the show at one point or another, and Los Angeles got 
to know his nearest and dearest, including Eleanor ("the Baptist sister") and 
Thelma, "the drinking sister." And then there were the kids -- me and my 
brother, Dana, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 One Easter, Pop took me and some friends to the station for a special show. 
Every now and again, the camera would segue to us dyeing Easter eggs and then 
go back to Pop in the kitchen. At one point -- remember, this was live TV, and 
I was about 4 -- I called out, "Daddy, I have to go to the bathroom." When 
Daddy did not immediately drop what he was doing, I repeated myself. The 
audience loved it. The letters poured in. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop continued in television until 1957 and then left the field. He took an 
unsuccessful flyer at building and running restaurants, but by 1960 he was back 
in radio, doing weekend news broadcasts for ABC and CBS. One day, he got a call 
from the late Ralph Story, who had a daily radio show called "Storyline." Ralph 
asked Pop to be a guest on the show, which included, among other things, calls 
from listeners. People remembered him. Story invited him back. And then again. 
Every time he was on, more people called. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food News Hour made its debut in 1965. It would run for 11 successful 
years, ending with Pop's death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pop had no use for people who refused to share recipes or tried to mystify 
what went on in the kitchen. (I've often wondered what he would have made of 
the far-out foodies of the '80s.) Good food, he often said, was within reach of 
everyone, and he was bound and determined to help everybody prepare it 
themselves. To the listener who wanted to bake bread or fricassee chicken or 
bake a pie from scratch, he said, "Go to it. You can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 He had an astonishing memory and an even more astonishing recall, and he often 
answered questions off the top of his head -- aided by 40 years of food 
experience that started when he was a boy watching his mother cook. The 12 
cookbooks he wrote didn't hurt.  
</P>
<P>
 But he never entered the studio without a battered briefcase -- his beloved 
"file of falderal." Its contents varied but there were two constants: "The Joy 
of Cooking" and the two deep-red Gourmet cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Denny usually began the show by hashing over the previous night, when 
Pop would have been "out amongst 'em." He'd talk about where he'd been, what 
he'd eaten, whom he'd seen. If he didn't like a place . . . a dish . . . a 
wine, or a person, he simply never mentioned them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I cook for the ear, especially on the radio," he once told an interviewer. 
"When you say words like whipped cream or almond roca , it sounds good right 
away. If you do a stew and you talk about stuffed olives, it says richness. You 
see, it's as much a word game as a cooking game; I love words." 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. He loved cooking too. My fondest memories were of the 
holidays, when he stuffed and roasted -- always breast-side down and always 
rubbed with lots and lots of butter -- a turkey that never weighed less than 25 
pounds. Gravy, however, rich and silky and unforgettable, was the pie ce de 
resistance . 
</P>
<P>
 He would start with a flour and butter roux (he described a roux almost weekly 
to his radio audience, refusing to let its French name intimidate a new cook) 
and then add quarts of stock that had simmered all morning. He'd stir and 
taste, and lecture Dana and me on the evils of lumpy gravy and gravy mixes. And 
then it would be done. Ever the boy at heart, he'd take a taste and a beatific 
smile would spread across that ever-young face. "Ah," he'd declare, "I don't 
know how I do it."

<P>
 When I lived in Iowa during graduate school, my friend Alan would bring me 
pheasants to cook. Never having eaten or cooked pheasant while growing up in 
California, I went through cookbooks looking for recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, I found the section on game in "James Beard's American Cooking." 
Because Alan skinned -- rather than plucked -- the pheasants, I learned to 
drape bacon over the breasts or wrap the birds in butter-soaked cheesecloth to 
keep them from drying out while roasting. I tried various sauces; our favorite 
was a light cream sauce with a few drops of good brandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pheasant, I discovered, was delicious -- how could you go wrong with such 
beautiful, corn-fed birds? Still, I felt insecure, a greenhorn whose only 
knowledge came from books, so I consulted with some friends who, like Alan, had 
grown up on Iowa farms. (Hunting was more than a sport in their families -- it 
helped stock the freezer for winter.) 
</P>
<P>
 The couple I talked to had never heard of the techniques I'd learned from 
Beard and other cookbooks. No, no, no, they said, such methods didn't sound 
right at all. If we provided the pheasant, they promised, they would show me 
how it was really done. 
</P>
<P>
 We set a date. Early that morning, Alan and I went hunting and brought down 
two birds. We showed up as planned. The man cut the pheasants into parts, the 
woman placed them in a pan and covered them with a mixture of Campbell's cream 
of celery soup, Lipton's dried onion soup and dots of butter. Into the oven 
and, an hour and a half later, spooned onto minute rice, those beautiful 
corn-fed birds tasted exactly like something out of a can. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I recalled this story recently while reading Evelyn Birkby's "Up a Country 
Lane Cookbook," a memoir-with-recipes of the four years (1950 to 1954) Birkby 
and her husband Robert and their two young children lived on Cottonwood Farm, 
two miles from the tiny southwest Iowa town of Farragut.  
</P>
<P>
 I remembered the story partly because Birkby is a storyteller and, like all 
good storytellers, she calls up our own stories in response. But mostly, 
Birkby's recipes recalled that characteristic Midwestern blend of local bounty 
(freshly harvested vegetables, corn-fed meat) and convenience food (canned 
soups, Jell-O, marshmallows, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 I would never buy this book for the recipes alone, except that in Birkby's 
hands, every recipe tells a story -- and the story is invariably more 
delectable than the dish. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier Birkby cookbook, "Neighboring on the Air: Cooking With the KMA 
Radio Homemakers" (University of Iowa Press: 1991), was a series of 
recipe-studded profiles of women broadcasters who kept a generation of farm 
wives company over the airwaves. Birkby herself was a KMA radio broadcaster and 
a newspaper columnist. For 43 years, she wrote an anecdotal recipe column for 
the Shenandoah Evening Sentinel that also was entitled "Up a Country Lane." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each chapter in the book "Up a Country Lane" is based on an aspect of farm 
life -- chickens, water, laundry, schools, planting, storms, Sunday fun, etc. 
How Birkby chose and grouped recipes for each topic is quirky and frequently 
amusing. Because wash day was strenuous, recipes following the chapter on 
"Laundry" are for simple meals: soup and corn bread, shepherd's pie, 
quick-and-easy hash. "Saturday Night in Town" gives recipes from Farragut's one 
cafe, the Anchor Inn, for fried chicken and liver and onions, and a cookie 
recipe (grocery bars) from Delbert Robert, a Farragut grocer. Because Birkby's 
favorite use of well water was for tea, the chapter on "Water" gives recipes 
for the scones and gingerbread she served at tea parties, as well as recipes 
for fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the book, Birkby paints a picture of farm life that was vanishing 
even as she and her husband tried to make a go of it. They had rented 120 acres 
and a farmhouse with primitive plumbing. The only running water in the house 
was the kitchen tap.  
</P>
<P>
 Birkby, city-raised and college-educated, was more dismayed by the difficulty 
of tending the necessary vegetable garden. "I felt woefully inadequate," she 
writes. She told her husband: "Our neighbors must have been born with hoes in 
their hands. . . . I'll learn how to cook and can the food, but I'm resigning 
as a gardener." The garden, she imagines, "gave a sigh of relief."  
</P>
<P>
 Birkby casts a kindly but keen eye on the habits and customs of those bygone 
times. She writes how rural society divided itself into various allegiances: by 
ethnicity, by church, by school district, by social club, even by "beef club." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is a beef club? Well, before electricity (and, therefore, refrigeration) 
was generally available, butchering a steer in the heat of summer posed a major 
storage problem for Midwestern farm families. Neighbors got together, and each 
family unit donated one steer per year to the entire group. During the summer 
months, a steer was butchered weekly -- in the Birkbys' club, every Wednesday 
-- and the meat distributed among members. Farmers competed among themselves to 
raise the best beef, so that well into the '50's, even after most households 
had refrigerators, beef clubs thrived because the meat was so delicious.  
</P>
<P>
 A few folk fit into no clubs; the mysterious Japanese men, for example, who 
appeared each spring to sex chicks at the hatcheries. "We didn't know much 
about where they stayed or what they did in their spare time," Birkby writes. 
"In fact, socializing with anyone very different was not part of most rural 
Iowans' daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is also liberally seasoned with bits of country color and lore. In 
her grandmother's day, Birkby tells us, an invitation for dinner might be 
phrased, "Come over and we'll kill a chicken." An outhouse, she tells us, was 
often called a "necessity." Eavesdropping on a party line was "rubbering." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers predicted a winter's harshness by looking at the thickness of a hog's 
skin at butchering, or the thickness of the rings of an onion: the thicker the 
skin or rings, the colder the winter was to be. Iowa farm wives washed clothes 
on Monday and ironed on Tuesday. "No one," writes Birkby, "could tell me why. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Birkby's humor is understated, sly and compassionate. She writes fondly of 
Myrtle Brooks, who could not resist a ringing telephone, never mind that there 
were party-line rules against "rubbering": "No matter whom a call was intended 
for, when the phone rang, everyone knew that Myrtle would be listening." 
Myrtle, Birkby writes, was "more up-to-date than the newspaper, more accurate 
than the radio newscasters, and more aware of the concerns and joys of the 
people on her telephone line than any other resident of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Myrtle sent out the word when a farmer needed help, or a doctor was required. 
Once, as Birkby was giving a bread recipe to a friend, Myrtle broke in and 
begged them to wait so she could get the recipe too. She'd been in the tub when 
the phone rang, was standing there naked and dripping in the dark without a 
pencil. With remarkable forbearance, Birkby and her friend chatted calmly while 
Myrtle pulled herself together. The next day, Myrtle returned the favor by 
giving Birkby her famous secret recipe for banana cake. The recipe, of course, 
follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper ads for Maytag washers and Bell Telephone, printed bills for 
machinery sales and photos from the family album illustrate Birkby's text. A 
snapshot of Birkby's Friendly Fairview social club shows 10 stout farm women in 
flowery house dresses and sensible shoes and suggests what hard work and rich, 
starchy, protein-focused meals can do to a woman. There are also snapshots of 
neighbors, a hog named Newcomer, a cow-herding farm dog named Sparkle, various 
men driving farm equipment and, of course, the Birkby children, Bob and Dulcie 
Jean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This may be a cookbook, but the reader grows close to these people who work so 
hard, then gather together in school houses and churches, at social clubs and 
cafes, at each other's farms for harvests and auctions. The chapter on "Storms" 
touches on many of life's difficulties, and Iowa farm life in the '50s was rife 
with them: A neighbor's home is destroyed by a tornado. Another neighbor is 
killed when his tractor rolls into a ditch and crushes him. Another dies after 
heart surgery. Dulcie Jean, Birkby's 5-year-old daughter, dies suddenly of a 
mysterious heart virus. "We learned, during those long, painful days," Birkby 
writes, "that the quiet offer of food provided sustenance for our bodies and 
comfort for our aching hearts, as our family weathered the terrible storm of 
our daughter's death." At the end of the chapter she includes a recipe for 
Mabel Lewis' comfort Jell-O (red gelatin with pineapple and grapes with whipped 
topping). "This," Birkby writes, "was truly a comfort salad, for Mabel always 
took this to a family at the time of serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Evelyn Birkby didn't make it as farmers. By the early 1950s, 120 
acres of farmland could no longer support a family of four. (Indeed, today it 
takes 600 acres.) In 1954, Robert accepted a job with the County Agricultural 
Service, and the family moved to the town of Sidney, where Evelyn prospered as 
a journalist and their house had ("oh joy!") a real bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Cottonwood Farm? "Our house at Cottonwood Farm is gone," Birkby writes, 
". . . and so is the barn and all the other buildings except a small machine 
shed. Even the cottonwood trees have been cut down and the brooks from the 
springs dammed to make way for more rows of soybeans and corn."

ROSH HASHANAH; STARTING A SWEET YEAR IN THE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

(Chronicle Books: 1994).

<TEXT>
<P>
 This year Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown Monday, which just happens to be 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 My family will gather to celebrate this double occasion with a barbecue and 
early dinner that will allow everyone to attend evening synagogue services 
without rushing. The weather is usually still warm at this time of the year, so 
we will eat in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu starts with a refreshing cup of cold tomato soup and chunks of fresh 
mozzarella cheese. The easy-to-prepare main course is marinated grilled salmon 
kebabs served on a bed of stewed leeks. The whole-wheat challah rolls can be 
made several days in advance and stored in the freezer. A mixed green salad 
will round out the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, the holiday apple cake made with honey symbolizes "a sweet year," 
a Jewish tradition that dates from Biblical times. Vanilla ice cream, home-made 
or store-bought, is a perfect addition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This menu is a light and welcome change from the traditional chopped liver, 
chicken soup with matzo balls and stuffed roast chicken dinner I have served in 
the past. Most items can be prepared in advance, with only a few last-minute 
touches needed. 
</P>

ROSH HASHANAH; A MOROCCAN NEW YEAR: CELEBRATING WITH SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN NATHAN, Nathan is the author of Jewish Cooking in America (Alfred 
Knopf: 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many Moroccan-born Jews who emigrated to the United States, Solange 
Emsellem, 71, is superstitious. On Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, she will 
not serve black olives for fear that the color and sour taste might augur evil 
for the coming year. She removes the purple-black skin of eggplants for similar 
reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's in my head," she says at her Rockville, Md., home. "We think of 
black as a mourning color, not like green, which is for happiness for the New 
Year and the harvest period." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the festive Rosh Hashanah meal, which marks the beginning of the 
two-day holiday, Emsellem, like other Sephardic Jews (Jews whose ancestors came 
from Spain and Portugal), will say a prayer over a number of symbolic fruits 
and vegetables. This year Rosh Hashanah comes unseasonally early, commencing 
the evening of Labor Day. Since this is also the beginning of the fall harvest 
season, fall food and vegetables are celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 First, sept legumes (seven vegetables) boiled and then baked with sugar, 
cinnamon and a little margarine, will be tasted. Emsellem will include three 
different kinds of squash -- pumpkin, zucchini and yellow -- as well as 
turnips, onions, carrots and spinach. Before tasting the various vegetables, 
her husband Albert will recite the following prayer: "May the coming year grow 
as a gourd in fullness of blessing. In the year to come, if enemies gather 
against us, mayest Thou guard us as we eat of this gourd with the prayer: 
Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, Ruler of the Universe, who createst the fruit 
of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The head of a fish or lamb will be served to the senior family members at the 
table, "so we will begin the new year at the head, not the tail," Emsellem 
says, laughing. As part of the meal, she will serve baked whole sea trout with 
red peppers, garlic and cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prayers, including the wish for a happy, sweet, plentiful and prosperous 
year will be made both nights of the holiday over dates and sesame and anise 
seeds. The first night an apple will be dipped in honey, and the second night 
the blessing will be said over a pomegranate. "God wants the Jews to multiply 
like sesame or pomegranate seeds," Emsellem explains. 
</P>
<P>
 When Emsellem came to the United States 21 years ago from Fez, Morocco, her 
recipes were more Moroccan than what she cooks today. Having American-born 
grandchildren, she has learned to make American dishes and uses store-bought 
instead of homemade filo dough.  
</P>
<P>
 Inherited from her forebears who fled from Toledo, Spain, at the time of the 
Expulsion in 1492, Emsellem's recipes, with their unique blend of Moroccan, 
French and American influences, have been modified to take advantage of the 
American ingredients she uses today. The French influence on Moroccan culture 
and cuisine plays itself out in Emsellem's kitchen, as does the French 
language, which still comes more naturally to her than English, even after many 
years in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a short ceremony, Emsellem will serve a festive dinner in her apartment. 
The meal will begin with a blessing over pain petri ("kneaded bread"), the 
sweet Moroccan challah that is made circular to symbolize a full, "round" year. 
"It should taste sweet, like a brioche," says Emsellem. "At Rosh Hashanah we 
dip it into sugar, not salt, as we do for the Sabbath." Although Emsellem does 
not, many Moroccan women include sesame and anise seeds in their rendition of 
pain petri.  
</P>
<P>
 As every Moroccan Jewish festival meal, Emsellem's meal will open with a 
spread of cooked salads -- carrots, peppers and eggplant (with the ill-omened 
black skin removed) -- dishes cooked in advance, and particularly suited to 
this year's warm beginning of the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal will continue with the baked sea trout followed by the famous 
Moroccan pastels, meat-filled turnovers. In Morocco, her main course would have 
included a tongue with green olives, but because of her American grandchildren, 
she now makes brisket instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Honey-dipped "cigars" filled with ground almonds, French mocha cakes, 
Napoleons and macaroons will be the dessert instead of the typical Eastern 
European honey cake found in the majority of American Jewish homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, after Rosh Hashanah morning services, in Moroccan Jewish 
homes a traditional Moroccan couscous is served with a sweet vegetable dish. 
And on Yom Kippur (the day of atonement) -- 10 days after Rosh Hashanah -- tea 
and figuelas ("figs"), deep-fried pastries soaked in a sweet syrup, break the 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moroccan women are, for good reason, fiercely proud of their culinary skills. 
It takes both dexterity and extreme patience to prepare the dainty pastels and 
other delicacies for their holiday meals. Recipes vary from city to city and 
from family to family, many of them proudly kept family secrets. Some women, as 
superstitious about their everyday cooking as Emsellem is about her holiday 
foods, will never reveal their recipes. Fortunately, Emsellem was willing to 
share some of the dishes she will prepare this Rosh Hashanah. MOROCCAN WHOLE 
BAKED SEA TROUT WITH RED PEPPERS AND CILANTRO 1 (5-pound) sea trout or 
rockfish, gutted and split down center, leave head on 1 cup chopped cilantro 1 
head garlic or to taste, minced 4 medium tomatoes, sliced 1 sweet red pepper,

 Place entire fish in glass or earthenware baking dish. Stuff fish with most of 
cilantro and garlic. Surround with remaining cilantro and garlic along with 
tomatoes, sweet red pepper and lemon slices. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl of boiling water dissolve saffron. Let stand few minutes. Then 
sprinkle saffron water over fish and tomato mixture. Pour oil around fish and 
tomatoes. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees until fish is golden and crisp, 30 
minutes. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

expands and foams. Then add to well in flour. Use hands to gradually work in 
flour, adding more water as needed, about 3 cups. When medium dough is formed, 
knead on wooden board about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Form dough into ball. Place in greased bowl and turn to coat surface. Cover 
with towel. Let rise in warm place 30 to 40 minutes or until doubled in bulk. 
Punch down and knead once more few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide dough into 5 pieces. Shape into 5 round loaves or roll each piece into 
cylinder and coil into spiral form with 1 end of dough at high point in center. 
Cover with towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Place loaves on 
baking sheet covered with foil. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix remaining egg yolk and remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Brush loaves with 
mixture. Bake at 400 degrees until loaves are golden, 40 to 50 minutes. Makes 5 
loaves, about 5 servings each.

WINE: A FEW GOOD WINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are a few of the "new" wines I have found, quite by chance over the last 
two weeks. They all should be available in fine wine shops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marimar Torres, scion of the famed Spanish winemaking family, has released a 
Pinot Noir, her first from densely planted vines on her gorgeous Green Valley 
vineyard in western Sonoma County. The wine, from the 1992 vintage ($25), is a 
masterful combination of delicacy and richness, with cherry and cloves 
intermixed with traces of earth and pepper. It's an elegant and full-flavored 
wine that needs at least another year in the bottle before it awakens from 
bottling sleep. Just 1,007 cases of this first release were produced. 
</P>
<P>
 * The week before, I stopped in a deli and heard the wine salesman extolling 
the virtues of the 1993 Tiefenbruner Pinot Grigio from the Alto Adige region of 
Italy ($7). I bought a bottle and tried it. It was spicy and rich, a delicious 
wine and a lot better than many pricier Pinot Grigios on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * Truly impressive and a real bargain is 1992 Monthelie "Clos le Meix Garnier" 
($23), imported by the highly respected Martine Saunier. Monthelie is a red 
wine region near Volnay in Burgundy. It's neither well known nor highly 
regarded, though the wines generally offer good value. 
</P>
<P>
 This one has a wonderful story. Owner Armande Douhairet, says Martine, is in 
her 80s and has no heirs. She cannot will the property to a non-relative 
without disastrous financial consequences, and at the same time, French 
inheritance tax laws could, upon her death, cause a breakup of the vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the ancient vines from the tax collector, Martine says, Douhairet 
adopted her enologist, the famed winemaker Andre Porcheret, who had been with 
Domaine Leroy. Over the next few years, Douhairet is slowly, legally, granting 
more and more of her property to Porcheret. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine itself is a Porcheret masterpiece, with impeccable fruit, a minty 
note in the aroma, and marvelous depth, anything but what you would expect from 
Monthelie. At the price, it's an excellent buy in finely crafted Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom and Nick Martin, Paso Roble's Martin Bros., have a striking new wine 
that has no appellation and no vintage date, though all the fruit was harvested 
in 1992. Called Martin Bros. Gemelli ($24), the wine is all Nebbiolo, half of 
it grown in Italy's Piedmont and half in their own vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian grapes were crushed and fermented at the cellars of the grower, 
well-regarded Barolo producer Franco-Fiorina. Then the 550 gallons of wine were 
air-freighted in a special container from Milan to the United States, where 
they were blended with the Martins' estate-grown Nebbiolo. 
</P>
<P>
 The final blend is wonderfully aromatic and complex, showing the rose 
petal/cherry aroma of the grape variety, and plenty of the tartness one 
associates with Barolo. But there is a clove and cinnamon aftertaste to the 
wine, something I have never seen in Barolo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, the other day I tasted a marvelous 1989 South African red wine 
called Rustenberg Gold. A mix of Bordeaux varieties, predominantly Cabernet, it 
was loaded with character, bursting with herbs and cherries and toasty notes 
from oak. The wine is delicious. I told the importer, master of wine Peter 
Koff, that I'd never heard of Rustenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Koff said the winery was founded 300 years ago and has made world-class wines 
in the last two decades. This one, at $20, is superb. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of now lifted apartheid-based trade restrictions, South African wines 
have been back on the U.S. market for only a year, so their prices are lower 
than they would be if the brands were better known. (A Cape Wine of the Month 
Club, based in Huntington Beach, carries a wide selection of wines from smaller 
South African wineries. All are excellent, and all are reasonably priced.) DAN

WINE: ADRIFT IN A SEA OF WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More good has happened for wine drinkers in the last 20 years than in the 
previous 200, but the good news is tempered by the confusion that now exists in 
the wide world of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, there were three kinds of wine: excellent, drinkable and 
poor. Excellent wine (the top Bordeaux chateaux, a handful of Burgundy 
producers, the best German and Italian estates and a very few top-rate American 
and Australian wineries) accounted for a tiny proportion, drinkable wine for 
somewhat more. But most of the world's wine was pretty poor and (justifiably) 
unknown outside its own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology -- in the vineyard, in the winery and in shipping -- has changed 
all that. For one thing, the bottom rung of the old three-level system is all 
but gone; so little truly poor wine is made now that it is a negligible part of 
the industry. Today fine and even exceptional wines come from places that 
previously never dreamed of making anything more than the local populace could 
swig. This means that demand for these improved wines has increased, prompting 
their sale thousands of miles from their points of production. 
</P>
<P>
 As if this wasn't enough to cram the shelves with good wine, along came the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, making possible the import of wines from former 
Soviet satellites, such as Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovenia and Romania. Then 
apartheid got kicked in the teeth, making South African wines suddenly an 
import item. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the rapid rise of quality wine from New York, Texas, Washington, 
Oregon, New Mexico, Virginia, even Missouri. Factor in the rapid improvement of 
Chilean wines, the internationalization of vineyards in Spain and Italy (with 
new plantings of Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon) and the more sophisticated 
marketing of top-rate wines from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 What today's consumer faces is a veritable forest of bottles with unfamiliar 
names.  
</P>
<P>
 The wine lover suffers from that cliched problem, an embarrassment of riches. 
How do you keep track of all these new wines? Indeed, how do you even find out 
about them? 
</P>
<P>
 Experimentation is one way. Ask wine merchants or knowledgeable waiters to 
recommend something new and very good to go with the food you're planning to 
eat.  
</P>
<P>
 But be prepared to be surprised by what you find. I usually am. You may not 
have heard of a "new" property, yet it may be quite old. Other wines come from 
regions you may never have heard of, or from "wineries" that don't even exist 
-- some "wineries" these days are simply wine brands, such as the Forest Ville 
brand that Bronco Wine Co. markets. Bronco owns neither vineyards nor a place 
to make wine but contracts for grapes to be delivered to a winery where space 
is leased to crush and ferment the wine. Other new winery-less brands blend 
wine purchased from bulk wine brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best new labels on the shelf are from newcomers who have developed 
new wineries on existing vineyards. Among these are excellent producers with 
names such as Von Strasser, Araujo, Viader, Peter Michael, Fife, Bayview 
Cellars, Benton-Lane, Seavey and Random Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And finally there are brands that exist as second labels, allowing the primary 
producer the luxury of selling lesser wines at a lower price, brands such as 
Bell Canyon (Burgess Cellars); Bel Arbors (Fetzer); Canyon Road (Geyser Peak), 
C.K. Mondavi (Charles Krug); Counterpoint and Terra Rosa (Laurel Glen); Hawk 
Crest (Stag's Leap Wine Cellars); Gavilan (Chalone), and Liberty School (Caymus 
Vineyards). 
</P>
<P>
 So yes, it is confusing. But today, adventuresome consumers can have good, 
fairly priced wine in almost every price range -- wine that's better than it's 
ever been.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: SUPER TORTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all I know, there may be a thousand fast-food stands in the more posh 
parts of Mexico City that serve sandwiches like the ones at Super Torta, but 
somehow the clean, mayonnaise-y richness, the play of crisp textures, seems 
inspired by the California coffee-shop burger. The tortas at Super Torta are 
undeniably American -- a transformation of the classic form of the Mexican 
sandwich similar to the mutation of the Spartan East Coast hamburger into the 
sweet, multilayered thing that became the California lunchroom burger (and then 
the Big Mac) -- but they still retain the funkiness of great Mexican street 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Torta is a purple place, very purple, a paradise of grilled meat and 
purple Formica tucked into a tiny strip center on the stretch of Alvarado just 
north of MacArthur Park, where the 99-cent stores begin to give way to medical 
offices, where the 75-year-old buildings and pedestrian chaos around the park 
are less in evidence than new condo complexes and old parking lots. Super Torta 
opened around the time El Pollo Loco opened its first U.S. branch across the 
street. For a time in the mid-'80s, when broiled-chicken stands began to 
outnumber gas stations in the Southland and what seemed like every third 
taqueria in America started to make sandwiches that were exact copies of the 
ones at Super Torta, it seemed as if this small stretch of road might be one of 
the most influential food streets in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino families hang out here, beret-wearing poets, Filipino guys and big, 
mixed groups of businessmen in shirt-sleeves. Sometimes in midafternoon, the 
place is dark with blue uniforms, the small parking lot fills with squad cars, 
and it seems as if Super Torta is the unofficial commissary for the Rampart 
Division police station.  
</P>
<P>
 And a Super Torta is a good thing: built on a feather-light French roll 
crisped at the edges, barely substantial enough to stand up under the thick 
lashings of mayonnaise and guacamole, yet firm enough not to disintegrate even 
when carried 20 miles in a foam to-go container; marred neither by the earthy 
smear of beans common to most great tortas , nor with an amount of chile that 
might bother an Iowan grandmother. (You can add chopped jalapeno peppers to 
taste from the little plastic containers they give you with each sandwich.) A 
Super Torta is just the thing with a paper-cupful of the smooth, 
cinnamon-scented rice drink horchata .  
</P>
<P>
 The sandwiches are stuffed with grilled slices of rib-eye steak, chewy and 
blackened, seasoned with great drifts of ground pepper; garlicky grilled pork; 
or a rather eggy version of machaca , the northern Mexican dish of dried beef 
sauteed with onions and peppers, that seems not unlike some exotic Sonoran 
variation on the egg foo yung sandwiches they sell at the Grand Central Market. 
A chicken torta , perhaps because of the vaguely chopped condition of the meat 
and the abundant mayonnaise, tastes like nothing so much as a peppery 
chicken-salad sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also burritos and tacos and carne asada plates here, but I can't see 
why you'd bother. If an intricately carved radish is not what you consider a 
side dish, try a small order of cheesy, stiff refried beans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Super Torta

IN THE KITCHEN; DON'T HOLD THE MAYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to mayonnaise, my attitude is a lot like that old bit of 
doggerel about cigarettes: 
</P>
<P>
 It's fattening  
</P>
<P>
 And I like it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's made with raw eggs  
</P>
<P>
 And I like it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's out of fashion, it's bad for you and some folks say it's revolting.  
</P>
<P>
 And I like it.  
</P>
<P>
 According to all the standards by which we judge dishes today, mayonnaise is 
the im perfect food. 
</P>
<P>
 And, you know, I like it. 
</P>
<P>
 If your only experience with mayonnaise is that miraculous sweet white paste 
that's sold in the supermarkets as "salad dressing," you're probably wondering 
just what in the heck I'm going on about. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, mayonnaise is not sweet. Not even a touch. If it's at all sweet, 
it's not mayonnaise. Try a little experiment: Put two whole eggs in the work 
bowl of a blender or food processor with a tablespoon of mustard and a pinch of 
salt. Turn the machine on. With the machine running, slowly add a flavorless 
oil (by flavorless, I mean both neutral and fresh -- rancid vegetable oil is 
definitely not flavorless). The oil should be added in a thin thread at first, 
increasing in flow to the width of a piece of yarn at the end. When you've 
added about a cup of vegetable oil, finish the sauce with a quarter cup of good 
olive oil. Then add a squeeze or two of fresh lemon juice and a touch of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's what real mayonnaise tastes like. If you have neither the time nor the 
inclination for this little experiment, there is an easier way: Go to the 
grocery store and pick up a bottle of Best Foods mayonnaise (sold on the East 
Coast as Hellmann's). As a rule, I don't write about brand-name products, but 
in testing dozens of recipes for flavored mayonnaises over the last couple of 
weeks, I've tried just about every mayonnaise and salad dressing on the market, 
and this was the only one that tasted like homemade. In fact, I'm embarrassed 
to say, when sampled side-by-side with my scratch mayonnaise, it tasted better. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not alone in this belief; a recent mayonnaise tasting by Cook's 
Illustrated magazine came to the same conclusion. In fact, they found, the 
second-best commercial mayonnaise was Best Foods "Light." In this test too, 
almost every taster favored the best bottled brand over homemade. 
</P>
<P>
 Though mayonnaise is technically one of the "mother" sauces in French cooking, 
you'll rarely see it used that way today. In fact, it has fallen so far from 
fashion that you probably will find a hundred restaurant salsas for every 
mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, that's probably not a bad thing. Given the relative caloric contents 
of the two dishes and all the food safety questions surrounding raw eggs, I'm 
not sure I want to recommend spooning a quarter-cup of mayonnaise on your plate 
(though, given a bit of fresh tarragon to flavor it, and a plate of cold 
chicken, I could make an exception). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But because you don't want to eat a lot of mayonnaise, this doesn't mean you 
don't want to eat any mayonnaise. To my way of thinking, a tablespoon of 
mayonnaise per serving is not a bad thing. And a tablespoon per serving is all 
you need to turn some decent cold meat or fish into something spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuna salad is a perfect example. Though you may think of it as nothing more 
than lunch-counter desperation fare, treat it with a little respect (and a tad 
of mayonnaise), and even canned tuna can shine. Try this: Finely chop a couple 
of anchovies (salt-cured, preferably), spoon in some mayonnaise and beat about 
a minute until the anchovies disappear. Add a couple tablespoons of capers, a 
bit of lemon juice, some minced fresh parsley and, finally, a can of tuna (only 
in this case do I prefer water-packed -- the aggressive fishiness of oil-packed 
is a little much in this dish). It's wonderful spooned into a ripe tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if you want to dress your tuna salad up a bit, try this recipe -- similar 
to the above, but made with some wonderful smoked albacore like the stuff I 
bought from Pete Siracusa, who sells fresh and smoked fish at many Southland 
farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an unbelievably rich dish, and so it took some tinkering to keep from 
being unctuous. It needed a boost of lemon juice and even more capers than the 
first recipe. Most important, add some diced celery to give the dish some 
freshness and a textural "pop." Each time I've made this I've added more 
celery, and each time I think it's better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When stuffed in a nice ripe tomato and surrounded with freshly cooked green 
beans, it's enough for dinner. And more than enough, I'm willing to bet, to 
convince you of the virtues of mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Make this with good tomatoes and save the scraps from hollowing the tomatoes. 
Give the tomato scraps a little salt and pepper and serve them spooned on 
little garlic toasts as an appetizer. If you can't find smoked albacore, 
substitute a good brand of smoked turkey.  
</P>
<P>
 SMOKED TUNA SALAD IN TOMATOES 4 large tomatoes 1 pound thin green beans, ends 
cut 1 teaspoon thin strips of basil leaves 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
1 pound smoked tuna, in 1 or 2 thick slices 5 tablespoons mayonnaise 2 
tablespoons capers, plus some juice 3 teaspoons lemon juice 3 tablespoons diced 
celery Salt Freshly ground pepper 4 anchovy fillets 
</P>
<P>
 Slice off top 1/4 of tomato and, using melon baller, remove as much of insides 
as possible without breaking skin. (Reserve insides for another use.) Turn 
tomatoes upside down on platter and let juices drain. 
</P>
<P>
 In large pot filled with rapidly boiling water, cook beans until bright green, 
about 5 to 7 minutes depending on freshness. Remove from boiling water. Chill 
in ice-water bath to stop cooking and set color. Pat dry with paper towels. In 
medium work bowl toss lightly with oil and basil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut tuna into 1/4-inch strips lengthwise, then 1/4-inch strips widthwise. 
</P>
<P>
 In medium mixing bowl combine mayonnaise, capers and juice, lemon juice and 
celery. Stir to mix well. Add tuna and fold gently into mayonnaise. Be careful 
not to break up fish. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly season to taste with salt and pepper inside of tomatoes. Spoon 1/4 of 
filling into each tomato. Place 1 anchovy fillet on top of each tomato. Put 
tomato in center of plate or arrange on platter. Lightly season green beans to 
taste with salt. (Don't salt until this moment, or color will change.) Toss. 
Arrange around outside of tomatoes. Makes 4 servings.

LOW-FAT COOKING: SKINNY RELLENOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA DEANE, TIMES FOOD STYLIST. Deane is co-author of Simply Healthful 
Cakes (Chapters Publishing: 1993: $9.95). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inspired by recent news stores about the high fat content of Mexican food, we 
decided to come with with a low-fat variation of chile rellenos. Our version, 
at only two grams of fat per serving, not only is far more healthy, it tastes 
wonderful, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The chiles are stuffed with a non-fat bean mixture that is flavored with onion 
slices and whole garlic cloves that have been grilled on a heavy cast-iron 
stove-top grill sprayed with mesquite-flavored nonstick cooking spray. After 
grilling, the onions and garlic are chopped and then cooked and mashed with the 
beans. Add just enough bean liquid to give the filling a consistency like 
mashed potatoes -- moist but firm enough to spoon into the chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 To further reduce fat in the filling, we combined the beans with a combination 
of nonfat cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. Spoon the beans atop the cheese in 
the chile. This helps to hold the cheese in the chiles. Press the edges of the 
chile into the beans to seal and arrange them seam-side down in the baking dish 
to keep them from opening and drying out during baking. 
</P>
<P>
 A custard made with egg substitute, nonfat milk, cumin and oregano is poured 
around the chiles and then the dish is baked just until the custard is set. The 
flavors come through and the textures are best when the custard is not too 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the casserole immediately after 
removing from the oven and let stand a few minutes to melt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle each serving with a little chopped tomato, cilantro and green onion 
and serve. BAKED CHILE RELLENOS 6 medium poblano chiles 1 (15-ounce) can black 
beans 1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch slices 2 cloves garlic Salt, pepper 3/4 
cup nonfat Cheddar cheese 1/2 cup low-fat Monterey Jack cheese 1 cup nonfat egg 
substitute (equivalent to 4 eggs) 1 1/2 cups nonfat milk 1/4 teaspoon ground 
cumin 1/4 teaspoon oregano leaves, crushed 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon 
cayenne pepper Chopped tomato Chopped cilantro Sliced green onions 
</P>
<P>
 Roast chiles over burner of gas stove or under broiler until blistered on all 
sides. Peel under cold running water. Make slit along 1 side of each chile and 
remove seeds. Do not remove stems. Set chiles aside. Drain beans, reserving 
liquid.  
</P>
<P>
 Spray stove-top grill pan or heavy iron griddle with mesquite-flavored 
non-stick cooking spray. Cook onion slices and garlic until tender and charred 
on all sides, then remove from grill pan and chop.  
</P>
<P>
 Place chopped onions and garlic in skillet sprayed with non-stick mesquite 
cooking spray. Add beans to skillet and fry, mashing, until pureed. Add enough 
reserved bean liquid, about 3 to 4 tablespoons, to make soft, yet spoonable, 
consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss together Cheddar and Jack cheeses. Put about 2 tablespoons cheese into 
each chile, then spoon about 2 tablespoons beans atop cheese and press cut 
edges of chile together.  
</P>
<P>
 Arrange stuffed chiles, cut side down, in 8x8-inch baking dish. Combine egg 
substitute, milk, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne pepper. Pour over chiles. 
Bake at 350 degrees until custard is set, 30 to 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese over top of casserole at end of baking. Let 
stand until cheese melts. Sprinkle chopped tomato, cilantro and green onions to 
taste over top of each serving for garnish. Makes 6 servings.

GOOD COOKING: BOUNTY BEAUTIFIED

 From North Dakota to Ohio stretches some of the best farmland in the country, 
not to mention prairies and forests with wild game; rivers, lakes and streams 
with fresh fish; woods full of foraged foods; and orchards heavy with fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Midwest also has an increasing number of small producers of 
specialty foods; their wares include apples grown from turn-of-the century 
seeds, organic lamb and chickens, caviar and farmhouse cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 While Midwestern cooking may have a reputation for stodginess, plenty of 
bright cooks take advantage of these new products.

 Chefs Debbie Gold and Michael Smith feature a melon terrine on the menu of the 
American Restaurant in Kansas City, Mo. It's a light, refreshing first course. 
At Peter's Restaurant and Bar in Indianapolis, seared duck breast with 
blackberry-Port sauce is a favorite. Chef David Foegley serves the fanned duck 
slices with a fresh berry relish and sweet potato-chive pancakes. Judy Contino 
of Bittersweet, a Chicago bakery/cafe, proposes a rich chocolate pave with 
dried tart cherries.

 Layers of diced melon and dark green arugula leaves in this terrine make for a 
dazzling presentation. MELON TERRINE WITH PROSCIUTTO HAM, BASIL AND ARUGULA 
SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1/4-ounce) package unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons Ruby Port wine 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound arugula, stems trimmed 
</P>
<P>
 1 ripe medium cantaloupe, cut into 3/4-inch dice, to equal about 4 cups 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons light-tasting olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups mixed arugula, stems trimmed, rinsed and crisped 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups basil leaves, rinsed and crisped 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup Ruby Port Wine Glaze 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup small diced casaba melon, chilled 
</P>
<P>
 6 slices thinly sliced prosciutto ham 
</P>
<P>
 For terrine, in small mixing bowl mix gelatin in 1 cup boiling water and Port 
wine. Set aside. In separate pot of boiling water, blanch arugula 5 seconds, 
drain in colander and place under cold running water to set color. Arrange in 
single layer on paper towels. Then blot dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip each melon piece in gelatin mixture, then place in bottom of lightly oiled 
5-cup terrine mold until bottom is filled. Make sure melon pieces fit snugly. 
Top melon layer with layer of blanched arugula leaves. Generously brush arugula 
layer with gelatin mixture. Continue layering alternating gelatin-dipped melon 
with gelatin-brushed arugula until terrine is filled, finishing with arugula 
layer. There should be 4 layers of each. Discard leftover gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover mold. Chill until set, at least 6 hours. Can be made day ahead and 
stored in refrigerator, covered airtight. 
</P>
<P>
 For salad, in small mixing bowl combine vinegar, oil, salt and pepper to 
taste. Can be made ahead and refrigerated. (Let come to room temperature before 
using.) Just before serving, mix arugula and basil with vinaigrette. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Unmold terrine by running sharp, thin knife around edge of mold. Invert on 
flat platter. If terrine does not loosen, drape hot, wet towel over inverted 
mold 5 minutes. Remove mold. Use sharp knife (not serrated) to cut terrine into 
6 equal slices. Place slice on chilled salad plates. Sprinkle with diced casaba 
melon. Dribble with Ruby Port Wine Glaze. Loosely roll up each prosciutto 
slice. Arrange on plate. Garnish with arugula and basil salad. Makes 6 
servings.

 Once marinated, the duck doesn't take long to cook. Duck breasts should be 
done no more than medium; otherwise they become tough.  
</P>
<P>
 SEARED DUCK BREAST WITH BLACKBERRY-PORT SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless duck breasts, halved 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sliced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried ground sage 
</P>

 1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon arrowroot dissolved in 1 teaspoon cold water 
</P>
<P>
 In plastic food bag combine duck breasts, olive oil, garlic, sage, salt and 
pepper. Shake well to mix. Seal tightly and refrigerate at least 6 hours or as 
long as 2 days. 
</P>
<P>
 For sauce, in non-aluminum saucepan combine liqueur, Port, water and sugar. 
Bring to boil. Simmer, uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup. Whisk in arrowroot 
slowly. Cook until thickened. Set aside. Can be made day ahead and 
refrigerated. Gently reheat before using. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, remove duck breasts from marinade. Place 10-inch cast-iron skillet 
over medium-high heat. When very hot, lightly season duck breasts to taste. 
Then sear about 2 to 3 minutes per side, depending on desired doneness. Use 
sharp knife to cut breasts into thin crosswise slices. Fan slices on warm 
dinner plate. Pour 1/4 cup of hot sauce over slices. Serve immediately. Makes 4 
servings.

 This pave, a French term describing a rectangular-shaped preparation, is very 
easy to prepare and can be made several days ahead. Slightly sweetened dried 
cherries complement the chocolate . CHOCOLATE PAVE 
</P>
<P>
 13 ounces bittersweet chocolate (preferably Callebaut or Valrhona) 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 3/4 cup whipping cream, chilled 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups dried tart cherries 
</P>
<P>
 Caramel sauce 
</P>
<P>
 In double boiler or microwave oven on MEDIUM (50%) power, gently melt 
chocolate with butter. Transfer to 2-quart mixing bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Use electric mixer to whip egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until pale and fluffy, 
about 2 minutes. Whisk egg yolk mixture into chocolate mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Whip cream until thick. In 3 batches, fold into chocolate mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 In clean mixer bowl with clean beaters, whip egg whites with 2 tablespoons 
sugar until thick and soft peaks form but are still moist-looking. Stir 1/4 of 
egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold in remaining egg whites. Fold in 
cherries. Transfer to 4-cup terrine mold lined with enough plastic wrap to 
allow some overhang. Refrigerate at least 6 hours until solid, or up to 3 days 
wrapped airtight. Pave can also be frozen up to 1 month. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, unmold. Remove plastic wrap and use sharp knife to cut into 
3/4-inch-thick slices. Place slices on chilled dessert plates. Drizzle with 
caramel sauce. Serve immediately. Makes 8 servings.

 Note : Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes that 
have been pasteurized may be used in place of raw eggs in certain 
circumstances. Check egg substitute package for applications.

HOME COOK: GIMME SUGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last couple of weeks, I've had strawberry desserts in four restaurants. 
But while they all looked enticing, they were almost devoid of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most strawberries are not very sweet -- in fact, they are often slightly 
sour -- I even wondered whether these dishes should have been offered as 
savories rather than desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that excessive amounts of sugar and salt can be a problem and that I 
should probably be glad that pastry chefs are concerned about the state of my 
health, but what about the other chefs in the kitchen who served me all of that 
butter, olive oil and cream? It's difficult to know whom to thank these days 
and whom to criticize. 
</P>
<P>
 Since my doctor hasn't requested that I limit my use of sugar and salt, I 
continue to enjoy strawberries and lemon custard in meringue and 
strawberry-whipped cream waffles. Strawberries and lemon custard in meringue 
dates back at least 30 years and was known as heavenly strawberry pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry whipped cream waffles should be remembered but seem to be sadly 
forgotten. I can't remember the last time I was served waffles in a private 
home, with or without strawberries. Waffles are not only splendid at breakfast; 
they are very pleasing as a savory dish served with creamed mushrooms, or 
creamed crab spooned on top. Good earthy buckwheat waffles, spread lightly with 
sour cream, smoked salmon and a sprinkle of salmon roe, can brighten the 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you are looking for something that's easy to prepare, waffles are it. 
Waffle batter can be made a day in advance and refrigerated until needed. 
Baking the waffle needn't be a lonely job; there is charm in having a waffle 
iron on the table with a large pitcher of batter and bowls of toppings. It only 
increases the anticipation of having hot, golden waffles on your plate. 
STRAWBERRIES AND LEMON CUSTARD IN MERINGUE 
</P>
<P>
 4 egg yolks, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups whipping cream, whipped 
</P>
<P>
 Meringue Crust 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups strawberries, rinsed, sliced in half and sweetened to taste 
</P>
<P>
 In medium heavy-bottomed pan, combine egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon 
juice and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until mixture is 
thick, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and cool, stirring occasionally. 
Gently stir in half of whipped cream. Fill meringue crust. Refrigerate at least 
6 hours. (May be prepared 1 day in advance to this point.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before serving, spread half of strawberries over lemon custard, spread 
remaining whipped cream on top (if cream has separated, whip briefly) and top 
whipped cream with remaining berries. Makes 1 (9-inch) pie, or 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 538 calories; 185 mg sodium; 291 mg cholesterol; 34 grams fat; 57 grams 
carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.26 gram fiber. Meringue Crust 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup egg whites 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl beat egg whites and cream of tartar until frothy. Slowly 
add sugar in thin stream, beating constantly, until whites are stiff but moist. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Spread meringue about 1/4-inch thick over bottom and about 1-inch thick up 
sides of greased 9-inch pie pan. Bake at 275 degrees 1 hour or until lightly 
browned and firm to touch. Remove from oven. Cool. STRAWBERRY- WHIPPED CREAM 
WAFFLES 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs, room temperature 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup shortening, melted 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups whipping cream whipped and sweetened to taste 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 cups of strawberries, rinsed, sliced in half and sweetened to taste 
</P>
<P>
 In mixing bowl combine flour, salt, baking powder and sugar. Stir with fork 
until blended. 
</P>
<P>
 In another bowl beat eggs well and stir in milk. Combine with flour mixture 
until well mixed. Add melted shortening and butter. Beat until blended. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour about 1/2-cup batter into very hot waffle iron. (It takes from 1/2 to 3/4 
cup batter to make 1 waffle, depending on size of waffle iron.) Bake waffles 
until golden and crispy. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon whipped cream on top of hot, cooked waffles and mound strawberries on 
top. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about:

 I'm writing to let you know that I (unlike Mary Lou Quirt from Thousand Oaks) 
enjoyed your article on how to boil an egg (In the Kitchen, Aug. 11). I am a 
wife and full-time mother of two children, and must say I'm a pretty good 
cook.One of my biggest problems has always been how to boil a perfect egg -- 
especially one that doesn't have the shell stuck to it. After reading your 
article, I have found success. I've even placed the "recipe" on the inside of 
my cupboard!

 I eat one hard-boiled egg one morning every week and until I read your 
wonderful article on how to properly boil an egg I really didn't enjoy it. Now 
they are simply delicious. Keep doing what you're doing!

BAG THAT RATING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on salad mixes (Bag That Salad, Aug. 25) confirmed what I had 
suspected all along: These mixes are high in price and low in quality.And 
speaking of quality, your quality ratings aren't very informative. There's no 
scale and no indication of what the numbers mean. Is 1 high or low? Is the 
range 1 to 5? 1 to 10? 1 to 100? It makes a difference. On a scale of 1 to 5, 
with 5 the best and 1 the worst, I give your quality rating system a 1.

LOCAL BESTS; THE SECRET SOURCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What secret do the Bistro Garden, Shutters on the Beach Hotel, the Bel Air 
Country Club and the Regent Beverly Wilshire share? They all buy their intense, 
dark chocolate ganache cakes, hazelnut charlottes and rich fruit tarts from 
Caprice pastry shop. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 years, Jean-Louis Kippelen has been wholesaling cakes, fancy 
cookies, pastries and candies to local restaurants, hotels and caterers.The 
French-born pastry and chocolate maker knows that good ingredients are the key 
to good baking, so he uses only imported Callebaut chocolate, real butter and 
fresh fruit and nuts. During peak season, Kippelen makes more than 100 cakes a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Because 90% of his business is wholesale, most people aren't even aware of the 
nondescript, red-brick pastry kitchen on Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica. "I'm 
the best-kept secret in town," he says. "A lot of places claim they bake their 
own pastries while somebody is delivering mine through the back door."  
</P>
<P>
 Kippelen makes about 25 different cakes and tarts, including white chocolate 
and pistachio, opera, Grand Marnier butter cream, lemon mousse, even New 
York-style cheesecake. A cake that generously serves 12 to 15 starts at around 
$20 and can be decorated to order. Just don't ask for any fluffy white 
frosting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call those Crisco cakes," mutters Kippelen, "because basically all they 
contain is shortening and powdered sugar."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: SUBMITTING TO CRITIQUES BEATS SUFFERING ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm going to let you in on a trade secret: Writing is hard. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it isn't quite like mine excavation or suspension-bridge construction, 
although writers do a fair amount of rooting, dredging and digging of another 
sort. 
</P>
<P>
 They also spend a lot of time locked in self-imposed isolation trying to coax 
the clever phrase, the Big Thought or the silly notion out of a tormented state 
of mind. And when they succeed, they fool the rest of us into believing that it 
is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't easy. Which is why writers tend to become brooding members of 
that collective cultural consciousness know as "The Tortured Souls." Or why 
they become members of writers groups, where they learn to suffer in a group 
instead of suffering in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We writers tend to join a writers club because it gives us the knowledge that 
we are not alone plugging away in our little rooms with no feedback except for 
the occasional rejection letter," said free-lance writer Ann Shields, who wrote 
this week's Centerpiece story on the 300-member Ventura County Writers Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, Shields said, has been a home away from home for local writers since 
1932. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the workshops have been going on so long that the members have become 
like family," she said. "They even support each other in other areas of their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 And as in all families, a certain amount of sibling rivalry is considered 
necessary, even healthy. At the writers club, that rivalry shows during 
workshops, where writers gather to critique each other's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critique group is definitely not for everyone, but those writers who can 
take it find the criticism very helpful," Shields said. "They get a chance to 
see their writing clearly, not from the point of view of family members who may 
be overly impressed with everything you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Shields, who has been a member of the group for 12 years, has occupied the 
workshop hot seat any number of times. And during those years, she has occupied 
a few other seats as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a member since 1982 and I've been about every officer in the group 
except treasurer," she said. "They took a look at my checkbook and decided they 
didn't want me in that job." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which is fine with Shields, who is happy just being a member in good 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The help, concrete help -- not just support -- that you get from a writers 
club is invaluable. Besides the workshops, the guest speakers, the newsletters 
and the social events, writers are there to exchange and share marketing ideas 
and give each other up-to-date info on the business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A writers club is a community building thing; it really is a community."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: A NEW WAVE OF CELEBRATION FOR SOME OLD MEN OF THE SEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ANCHORS AWEIGH!: The restored World War II cargo ship Lane Victory and its 
crew of senior-citizen ex-merchant seamen didn't quite make it to Europe for 
the D-day 50th anniversary. But next month, if all goes well, the 455-foot 
freighter will once again head out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion is the scheduled triumphant return of another old oceanic codger, 
the WWII Liberty ship Jeremiah O'Brien, which made the 9,000-mile D-day 
anniversary voyage and is heading back to its home port of San Francisco. The 
Lane Victory crew, all members of the U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans of World 
War II, plans to take the ship into San Francisco Bay with the O'Brien about 
Sept. 23 and tie up there for a few days before returning to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Engine problems aborted the Lane Victory's D-day voyage in May after only five 
days at sea, but they have now been repaired, says Jerry Turner of the merchant 
marine veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 After the San Francisco trip, Turner says, the Lane Victory will be moving to 
its new quarters at Berth 94 in San Pedro, near the Los Angeles Maritime 
Museum.

 NUMBERS PLEASE: El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson says he would be glad to turn 
over records for his city-owned cellular phone to former City Councilman Scot 
Dannen. After all, Jacobson says, he has nothing to hide -- no calls to a 
bookie or a sex line. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he says, city officials won't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be happy to release them, if I had them," Jacobson says of the phone 
records. "But I've never had physical possession of them. . . . But I can tell 
you I use (the phone) strictly for city business." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson said the itemized bills for his phone have averaged $5 to $10 per 
month, and never more than $22. City Manager James W. Morrison says the mayor 
and other city officials need cellular phones in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy started three months ago, Dannen says, when he wondered why 
the mayor of a one-square-mile city needed a city-issued cellular phone. He 
asked for copies of the phone bills, which he got, but city officials refused 
to turn over the itemized list of calls made and received on the mayor's 
cellular phone. They cited a court ruling that said releasing such phone 
numbers could violate the privacy of callers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dannen says, he doesn't intend to give up.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to ask him again who he's been calling," he says. "I just want to 
know."

 A ROYAL STINK: If you noticed a stench coming from Manhattan Beach last 
weekend, don't be alarmed. It was for a good cause.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 men from the South Bay competed Saturday in the fifth Annual Old 
Smelly Jocks Sports Tournament, a 12-hour test of endurance and athletic 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors, who raised $300 for a Hollywood orphanage, played three-on-three 
basketball, three-on-three volleyball, over-the-line baseball and Ultimate 
Frisbee.  
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the aging jocks weren't as fit as they thought, says Bob 
Makela, 33, of Manhattan Beach, who organized the annual tournament five years 
ago. "Guys were hunched over walking around afterward. There were a lot of 
aching muscles." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, Gary Ceregioli, 31, of Manhattan Beach smelled victory when he 
won the most games and was crowned King of the Old Smelly Jocks. QUOTE OF THE 
WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "If God could grant me all of my wishes, I would wish he'd give me the ability 
to make a difference in a place like Inglewood. I am a child of a place like 
Inglewood." 
</P>

 -- McKinley Nash, the new superintendent of the Inglewood Unified School 
District.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: SQUARE OFF FOR GOOD WORKOUT ON DANCE FLOOR; LESSONS ARE A 
MUST. YOU FIRST NEED SKILL-LEVEL CERTIFICATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NINE MONTHS 
OF WORKOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many folks say they got into country-Western dancing for the exercise -- they 
don't call it "barroom aerobics" for nothing. But if it's a workout you're 
looking for, I'd have to tell you square dancing ranks far above line dancing 
and clogging. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a lot of fun. And because Ventura County is a hotbed of square dance 
mania, there are several clubs that provide opportunities for family-oriented 
dancing in smoke- and alcohol-free environments. 
</P>
<P>
 Square dancing attracts people of all ages. About half of the members are 
retired. The rest are dancers in their 30s and 40s, but teen-agers enjoy it 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in learning California's official folk dance, now is the 
time to sign up for inexpensive lessons -- about $4 a week. The annual 
enrollment period for new members lasts only through the first part of 
September. If you don't take the lessons, you can't get in for another year 
without skill-level certification. This policy ensures a minimum proficiency 
among the dancers so that everyone can execute the caller's moves and have a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Tuesday most square dance clubs in the area will start weekly 
classes for nine months. Each club meets on a different night to allow 
visitation between groups. It also makes it possible for people to belong to 
clubs in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bachelors 'N Bachelorettes," is an international square dance club with a 
chapter in Ventura and one in Thousand Oaks. B 'N B's, as it's called, also 
accepts couples. But it's designed for single dancers -- those who arrive 
without a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clubs, such as the "Pi-R Squares" in Newbury Park, accept singles and try 
to help them find partners. The remaining clubs will try to help you find a 
dance partner during the first couple of weeks of lessons. After that, you must 
bring your own in order to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 In square dancing, "sets" or "squares" of eight dancers perform a series of 
steps directed by the "caller," who sings instructions, tells jokes and 
entertains the crowd. After six months of lessons, "mainstream level" dancers 
know the first 40 calls or dance moves in the Dictionary of Square Dance Calls 
and Moves, including the familiar "promenade" and "do-si-do." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates of the standard nine-month classes reach "plus level." With about 74 
moves under their belts, dancers can do complex moves like "relay the deucey," 
-- done to 48 musical beats -- and comfortably participate in special social 
dances. In addition, many clubs hold quarterly dance events and even take field 
trips to clubs in other counties. And four times a year, California's 22,000 
square dancers learn a new "tip" or "call" that has been accepted by all the 
square dance callers in the state. So there's no reason why you can't keep 
those happy feet movin'. Details

SOUTH BAY CITIES REJECT COUNTY LIBRARY TAX DISTRICT; SPENDING: ONLY CARSON AND 
LOMITA SUPPORT $28.50 ANNUAL FEE. CITING UNFAIR BURDEN TO HOMEOWNERS, OFFICIALS 
ARE STUDYING OTHER WAYS TO RAISE THE REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay cities have overwhelmingly rejected a new tax to support the county 
library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawndale joined Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Avalon and Gardena in 
rejecting the district that would assess each household $28.50 a year for 
libraries. Hawthorne officials decided not to vote on the issue, in effect 
excluding them from the district this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson and Lomita supported the tax. In addition, the County Board of 
Supervisors decided Tuesday that libraries in unincorporated areas -- including 
three that serve the South Bay -- will benefit from the special district. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lawndale, which has one county library, the City Council voted unanimously 
Monday to turn down the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library could be run more effectively without all the overhead of the 
system," Councilwoman Nancy Marthens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawthorne council decided at a special meeting Friday not to vote on the 
issue. Mayor Larry Guidi said the city was not given enough time to find 
funding solutions other than taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials said that if Hawthorne decides to not join the special 
district, the Wiseburn branch, one of Hawthorne's two libraries, may be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hawthorne and Lawndale said they were uncomfortable adding 
another tax to their communities. Both financially strapped cities recently 
increased utility fees.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to replace more than $30 million in budget cuts, library 
officials have asked city councils throughout the county to support the special 
tax district. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts have forced many libraries to reduce hours and freeze spending on 
books, computers and reference materials, said Jean Alexander, Los Angeles 
County library regional administrator.  
</P>
<P>
 Library revenue comes mainly from property taxes and is distributed on the 
basis of library usage. Legislation sponsored by state Sen. Ralph C. Dills 
(D-El Segundo) and signed Monday by Gov. Pete Wilson will protect that revenue 
from further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials said that with base library funding protected, they hope the 
special tax would help bring libraries up to the level of service before the 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But at hearings across the South Bay, residents complained that adding the tax 
was unfair to property owners and made no allowances for people -- especially 
senior citizens -- who are on fixed incomes. Many residents and local officials 
also said they wanted to support their local library but did not trust the 
county with extra tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is raping the property owners," Lawndale Councilman Larry Rudolph 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the cities that voted against the tax are considering other ways of 
making up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach officials say that pulling out of the county library district 
and funding their own library would be better than joining the special 
district. Even though Hermosa rejected the proposal, its library will be funded 
an extra day, library officials said, because of the way funding is calculated. 
Allocations are based on library use, the amount of money from the area in 
property taxes and the population.  
</P>
<P>
 Other cities are considering forming a regional library district or trying to 
raise money from private sources.  
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach and Gardena have paid $1,300 to $1,700 a day for extra days of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 But library officials say that those prices will rise dramatically to pay for 
new materials, building maintenance and administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries in Carson and Lomita can expect significant increases in their 
operating hours and budgets, Alexander said. Officials began calculating those 
increases this week.

FATAL SHOOTING BY POLICE OFFICER RULED JUSTIFIED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: L.A. POLICE 
COMMISSION'S ACTION OVERTURNS AN INITIAL FINDING BY CHIEF WILLIE WILLIAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission has ruled that the fatal shooting of a San 
Pedro man by a Los Angeles police officer last year was justified, overturning 
an initial finding in January by Police Chief Willie L. Williams.  
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the commission, Williams says the shooting was not in line 
with departmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission found that Harbor Department Officer Mark Griego had little 
choice but to shoot Sergio Garcia, 27, after a foot chase through San Pedro on 
May 24, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Williams' report, Griego and his partner, Officer Rodney Peacock, 
pulled Garcia over about midnight for driving without headlights. Griego 
recognized Garcia as a Rancho San Pedro Street gang member who was on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 After being ordered out of the car, Garcia fled and was chased by Griego, who 
told Peacock to return to the police car and secure it. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego reported that he dropped his police flashlight during the chase. Garcia 
grabbed it and raised it to strike him on the head, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Officer Griego shot Garcia four times from four feet away in a 
parking lot on 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Williams and the commission found that Griego's lone pursuit of Garcia 
and his failure to carry his baton during the chase were against police 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also states: "I am very concerned with (Griego's) lack of fire 
control. I have determined Officer Griego failed to exhaust all reasonable 
alternatives prior to using deadly force. . . . Griego's use of force is not 
within department guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission Deputy Executive Director Cliff Weiss said the commission 
found the shooting was justified because department policy allows police 
officers to shoot a suspect if there is an imminent threat of death or serious 
bodily injury to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the commission report adds: Griego "requires training in fire 
control, as he fired four rapid rounds at the suspect, rather than assessing 
each round before continuing to fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The board has revised 10 of more than 200 findings by Williams in the past two 
years. "In the vast majority of cases, they are in agreement," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference held at the Garcia home in San Pedro last week, attorney 
Hugh Manes said the family, which has sued the city over the fatal shooting, 
has added the commission and its members to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint over Garcia's death is expected to be heard in federal court 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Manes said no fingerprints were found on Griego's flashlight, and several 
witnesses have told him Garcia never touched it.  
</P>
<P>
 Manes said the commission's finding sends a message to LAPD officers that the 
use of deadly force against an unarmed man is an acceptable option.

 "That is not in the best interests of the people. It's certainly not in the 
best interests of those who are at the receiving end of force by the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 Six days before the detailed finding by the commission was released on Aug. 1, 
the Special Investigations Division of the county District Attorney's Office 
concluded that Griego had not acted unlawfully and no charges would be filed 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But local attorney and community activist Diane L. Middleton said the 
community will not rest until criminal charges are brought against Griego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the shooting, Griego has not lost one day's pay. We want Officer Griego 
fired," Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 family members, friends and neighbors gathered last week in the small 
apartment Garcia lived in with his mother and siblings. They said police 
officers have harassed the African American and Latino neighborhood for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's sister, Marisol Garcia, 24, chairs the San Pedro Committee 
Against Police Misconduct, which was formed after Garcia's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Department officials declined to comment or to confirm that the two 
officers are still assigned to the division.

ANALYSIS OF PROJECT'S IMPACT ON WETLANDS IS DISPUTED; ENVIRONMENT: GROUP 
CHALLENGES REPORT THAT FAVORS SHOPPING CENTER AT SITE NEXT TO GARDENA WILLOWS 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The economic benefits of building a controversial shopping center in Gardena 
outweigh any adverse impacts the development may have on a nearby wetland, 
according to an environmental report released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-required draft environmental report analyzes the effects of a city 
plan to develop a 10-acre strip of vacant land at Artesia Boulevard and Vermont 
Avenue into a 54,000-square-foot Smith's Food and Drug Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the city's investment in the subject site . . . an economically 
productive use of the property is considered essential," the report says.  
</P>
<P>
 But a newly formed group of community activists known as the Los Angeles 
Recreation and Open Space Assn. has countered with its own document, which 
advocates turning the site into parkland with a family education center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the differing views are concerns about the fate of a 7.8-acre 
freshwater wetland that backs onto the vacant site. Known as the Gardena 
Willows, the vernal wetland is a canopied forest, thick with willow trees and 
6-foot-high reeds. It is one of four surviving patches of wetland in the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Incorporating the preservation of the Willows into its plans, the open space 
association's document outlines dozens of educational and recreational uses for 
the proposed park, as well as ways to fund the park's maintenance at about 
$300,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city once had a similar plan for a "South Park" on the site. But City 
Manager Kenneth W. Landau said priorities have changed. Money is scarce, and 
the Smith's center would bring in new tax revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smith's complex, plus a 10,000-square-foot structure for future commercial 
use and parking space for 548 vehicles, can be built without hurting the 
adjacent natural area, Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural plans in the draft report show a seven- to 12-foot-high wall 
alongside the Willows, but Landau said the city is committed to leaving a 
50-foot buffer zone between the development and the edge of the wetland to help 
minimize the effects of noise, light, litter and runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The community has 45 days to comment on the draft environmental report for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists Mitch Heindel of the Palos Verdes/South Bay Audubon Society, Frank 
O'Brien and Sherry Roberts of the open space association, Steven Bradford, 
director of the South Bay Cities Project, and several other residents say the 
mitigation identified in the draft report will not protect the wetland and the 
plants and animals it supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has hired Long Beach attorney Charles E. Greenberg, a specialist in 
land use and environmental law, to advise them. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said the report, done by consultant Impact Sciences Inc. of Thousand 
Oaks, is a long way from complying with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's has always been open to having its market on another site in Gardena, 
said the company's Real Estate Director Dennis Burt. "It's just that the city 
seems to be fairly adamant that they would like to see this corner developed 
for retail (purposes)," Burt said.  
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money the project would generate for the city has been 
questioned. Landau's recent statement that the city will receive about $500,000 
a year from Smith's in tax revenues is exaggerated, O'Brien said. Fiscal 
experts Stanley R. Hoffman Associates say in the environmental report that the 
revenue would be $90,000 to $127,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the center may stand alone on an economic basis, from a long-term 
perspective it's a land-use disaster and very damaging for local family 
businesses," O'Brien said. "People can disagree, but let's get all the facts on 
the table." 
</P>
<P>
 The city disputes the figures in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is going to draw a whole new clientele, adding to the tax base in 
Gardena," Landau said.

ROCK TALK; ANOTHER GREAT BAND DECIDES TO PULL A DISAPPEARING ACT; TAO JONZ, 
WITH FOUR GOOD SINGERS, WAS TOGETHER FOR FIVE YEARS AND HAD MORE THAN 70 
ORIGINAL SONGS. SAY GOODBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 I hate to read stories like this. It's worse to have to write one. My favorite 
Santa Barbara band, Tao Jonz, is breaking up. Why does this always happen? Why 
do the bands we hate just keep on making bad music and good money? There ain't 
no justice in rock 'n' roll. If there was, Tao Jonz would have one third the 
airplay of those million Stone Temple Pilots' videos, half of Michael Bolton's 
money and all the numbers in Axl Rose's black book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mudheads, Los Guys, Durango 95 are all gone, making it seem that even 
talent is incidental when it comes to making it musically. Some bands were more 
fun than Tao Jonz -- like the Ska Daddyz and Lion I's -- but no one was better. 
</P>
<P>
 While most bands have no good singers, Tao Jonz had four, and bass player Doug 
Jaffe had one of those rock voices. Besides Jaffe, the band featured "The 
Working Man," Jimmy Werking on guitar -- make that Dr. Jimmy, Werking recently 
received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UCSB. Stosh (just Stosh) hits 
the drums and Johnny Atmosphere creates plenty of same on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tao Jonz played what may have been their last gig last weekend at Calypso in 
Santa Barbara. They plan a last, last gig at the same venue on Oct. 8, but 
that's iffier than the resolution of the baseball strike. By the time this 
piece comes out, two of the members, Jaffe and Stosh, will be relocated to the 
Bay Area, making any in-between gigs difficult without some sort of conference 
call set-up, which is bad for ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tao Jonz was together for five years -- time enough for a tape, two great CDs, 
with a fourth in progress. The band gave away hundreds of their CDs to their 
fans -- maybe not the best move business-wise. With already eight or nine songs 
in the can, the new one, apparently, will never be released. The band had over 
70 original songs. They played what may've been their first-ever cover song a 
few weeks ago, a surreal rendition of the Beatles' "Dear Prudence." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say what happened other than that we pretty much broke up," said 
Jaffe at the last packed Calypso gig. "I'd say it was a combination of things. 
We were playing and getting discouraged by not making enough money at our gigs. 
It just got to be very frustrating, and maybe it was time for a change. You 
know, Jimmy and I have been playing together for eight years since we met in 
Colorado, and we were starting to get on each other's nerves. Stosh and I are 
moving to San Francisco this week, and Jimmy may be leaving the state to get a 
job as an electrical engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds serious. So how come the Calypso staff didn't let the band play one 
more when the crowd was going nuts and it was only 1:20? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This may not be quite like Ed McMahon showing up with a van full of money, but 
you never know. Circus Frequency is a 5-year-old Santa Barbara band, but unlike 
Tao Jonz, they're still hard at it, chasing those MTV dreams and more 
specifically, a record deal. They have been on the verge of being signed 
seemingly forever, and at least have a chance when they perform at the upcoming 
Ticketmaster-Musician Magazine Battle of the Bands at Revival in Santa Barbara. 
Dishwalla, a S.B. band recently signed to A&M Records, participated in this gig 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent in a tape and an application four or five months ago, and forgot all 
about it," said guitarist Dan Bucko. "We just found out about the contest three 
weeks ago. Basically, this is the same contest that Dishwalla won last year. 
We've been going through a lot of sound changes lately with more upbeat, rock 
stuff, and we're still doing a lot of writing." 
</P>
<P>
 As the only Santa Barbara band on the bill, the Circus band will have the 
home-field advantage for the Sept. 10 gig at Revival. Also playing will be a 
bunch of L.A. bands -- Native Tongue, Guppy, The Devics, To The Sky and 
Theodora Blue. It'll be over before you get tired of it, so if a band stinks, 
wait a minute -- each group gets but 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of hundreds of tapes submitted, these six made the first cut in this area. 
As it stands, 180 bands will be performing at 36 showcase sights from sea to 
shining sea. Next, three regional showcases will further cut the field to the 
fabulous five with the winner receiving a weeklong studio session. Tickets for 
the Revival gig are an affordable $1.99. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you've been burning to ask Yoko Ono a few hundred Beatles questions, well, 
you waited too long. Ono will be performing at the Contemporary Arts Forum in 
Santa Barbara for two shows on Sept. 9. The tickets, which were priced from 10 
to 50 bucks, are all gone. After Ono's gig, she'll engage in a 
question-and-answer session with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's still plenty of tickets left, however, for the Moody Blues Sept. 25 
gig at the Santa Barbara County Bowl. The Santa Barbara Symphony will join 
these long-running cosmic art rockers.

POLITICAL NOTES; MANY BIG SPENDERS LOST ANYWAY IN JUNE ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 BIG SPENDERS: Many South Bay candidates for Congress or the state Senate spent 
well over a hundred grand in the June primary races. 
</P>
<P>
 Most losers are stuck holding a hefty bill; winners have spent much of the 
summer trying to raise more money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 36th Congressional District, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan 
Brooks spent $179,720 in her successful bid for the Republican nomination, 
according to campaign finance reports. (The figures only include spending since 
Jan. 1). Her opponent, former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance, 
spent almost twice as much: $336,589, more than half of which was his own 
money. Incumbent Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), who had no opposition, spent 
$183,856. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to look to a state race -- the 28th State Senate District -- to 
find this year's biggest spender: incumbent Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo). He 
paid $459,797, the bulk of it on a barrage of mailers in the last weeks of the 
race. His chief opponent, Torrance Councilman George Nakano, spent $195,797. 
Dills won the race with 47% of the vote to Nakano's 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Sidley, who spent $212,720 on his campaign this year, got 11% 
of the vote. Manhattan Beach real estate broker Jo Ann Rodda got 8%, spending 
less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley financed much of his campaign with his own money or with loans from his 
father. But he plans to run for office again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was everybody's second choice," Sidley said. "Next time around, I 
will be positioned very well." 
</P>

 GUNS AND BUTTER: President Clinton's health care plan is in limbo, but that 
doesn't mean it will hurt Harman in her reelection race. 
</P>
<P>
 She had yet to throw her support behind any plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another opportunity for her to demonstrate her independence," campaign 
spokesman Roy Behr said. He added that Harman will "oppose anything that will 
hurt business in the South Bay." (Harman has been meeting with a group of 
advisers from the district, dubbed the Medicine Cabinet). 
</P>
<P>
 But opponent Brooks charges that Harman was holding out so she could align 
herself with the plan that is most popular to the Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was waiting to be told (which way to vote)," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks supports a health care bill co-authored by Rep. Bill Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield), who gave a health care speech at a Brooks fund-raiser last 
week. His plan requires employers to offer insurance but not to pay for it. It 
also provides subsidies to workers with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's camp, however, denies that political motives have come into play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that was the case," Behr said, "she would have jumped on the Clinton plan 
when it was really popular. She didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates' positions are crystal clear on the recently passed crime 
bill. Harman called it a victory for "law enforcement over special interests." 
Brooks called it a "big city payoff" that will mean little for South Bay 
communities.

 UNFORGETTABLE GODFATHER: The new Nat King Cole commemorative stamp will be 
unveiled at Compton Community College on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand will be the late crooner's daughter, Casey, along with her godfather, 
Ralph C. Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Ralph C. Dills, the 84-year-old state senator now running for reelection. 
His friendship with Cole "goes way back," said Tim Mock, Dills' campaign 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills will give a keynote speech at the ceremony. The Postal Service will also 
unveil a stamp honoring singer Ethel Waters.

NIGHT LIFE: A FRIENDLY VENUE FOR FOLK SINGERS AT THE VENTURA HARBOR; J. PETER 
BOLES, WITH HIS ACOUSTIC GUITAR AND HARMONICA, PLAYS AT LORENZONI'S ON SUNDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Folk singers are like firefighters, everyone likes them, while the jury is 
mixed toward rappers and cops. One particularly hot folk singer is J. Peter 
Boles, a most affable fellow who can be found Sundays at Lorenzoni's, spinning 
tales of the down-and-out for the up and about tourists-turned-pedestrians who 
lately frequent the Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue is a restaurant and bakery that serves industrial-strength coffee 
and cappuccino in flavors that can barely be pronounced, much less spelled. The 
food is great, and there's entertainment on the weekends. Boles, along with his 
acoustic guitar and harmonica, provides some of that entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 He stands strategically underneath the security camera and between a pair of 
open doors where on one recent evening the fog was elsewhere and the breeze was 
just right -- reminders of the area's long industrial tradition embodied in the 
nearby sewage plant thankfully were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lorenzoni's is a friend to folk music," Boles said. "Other than this place, 
there's not much of a folk scene that I've been able to find. There are a 
couple of other places, but they don't pay, and I don't think I should have to 
try to push tips out of people, or play for somebody else's profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Boles, a small guy with a big set of lungs, has that classic folk voice with a 
rich range that fills the room and obliterates the idle chitchat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got somewhere around 300 songs, I guess, and probably about 15 of my own 
that I'm happy with," he said. "I've always felt the compulsion to preserve 
other people's music -- the old ballads that aren't being listened to anymore. 
The roots of it all for me was Hoyt Axton." 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, before "Gremlins," Axton was a folk singer with a bunch of albums, 
perhaps best known for "Greenback Dollar." Besides Axton, Boles covers songs by 
Utah Phillips, Hank Williams and even a John Prine song, "The Frying Pan," a 
musical warning about the dangers of lonely wives and traveling salesmen. Boles 
doesn't limit himself to just the famous songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a couple of songs by Roland Mitchell, a busboy at the MGM Grand in Las 
Vegas -- maybe he's the head busboy by now, I dunno," Boles said. "He's one of 
the best songwriters I've ever heard, but he's just unappreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 On a purely superficial level, most country songs seem to be about as much fun 
as an ice cream headache, while folk songs seem to be generally funnier. But 
there's more to it than that, according to Boles. 
</P>
<P>
 "A folk song is any song that contains the phrase 'Oh, Lord,' played on an 
out-of-tune guitar," he said. "The perfect folk song is usually about hookers 
or hobos. Now, the perfect country song is about dying dogs, mama, trains and 
drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Boles, who went to Holy Cross School in Ventura, has a twang in his voice, 
probably because he's traveled extensively. But like most locals, he always 
seems to return to the Poinsettia City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always worked. The oil fields were always my thing, but I've also mined 
for gold in Alaska, built boats in Washington and built homes in Hawaii," he 
said. "Right now, I'm a free-lance construction worker. I started performing at 
pipeline camps in Alaska around 1978. Later, I went to Reno, where there were a 
lot of people, but not much work." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, you need a lot less work when you are the only guy in the band. 
And it makes it easy to divide the loot at the end of the night; there's no one 
to argue with about creative differences, and solo acts rarely break up. 
Despite these obvious advantages, Boles may be doubling the size of his act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did play with a country band for a few months in New Mexico once. Lately, 
I've been working with a guy named Greg Lanners, and we'll probably be doing a 
duo thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Boles, who is on the timetable where "who cares?" and "whenever" are words to 
live by, released a tape five years ago and is thinking seriously about a 
sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the tape is the big thing for me. I'm trying to get the money 
together and get the thing produced. I don't have a compulsion to do all 
original stuff. It'll just be a tape about life." Details

NEW LAW CLEARS WAY FOR HOSPITAL CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An obscure measure approved by the state Legislature last week could hasten a 
major management change at South Bay Hospital, a publicly owned hospital in 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood-based Daniel Freeman Hospitals is negotiating to take over 
operations at the financially ailing facility, and a decision is expected in a 
few months. The hospital, owned by the Beach Cities Health District, is 
currently leased to a hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, because of legislation that the health district requested, it will be 
allowed to sublease the hospital without voters' approval. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daniel Freeman does assume management of the hospital, it would be operated 
under Catholic directives that forbid abortions and sterilization techniques 
such as tubal ligations, as well as certain fertility procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 At South Bay Hospital, 15 tubal ligations and four elective abortions were 
performed in the year ending in July, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they asked for the change so they could quickly find a 
new operator and assure that the hospital stays open. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're trying to find another partner for this operation and you have to 
go to a public vote, anyone's going to walk away," said board member Ken 
Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
 But some critics question whether the public received adequate notice; the 
district board never voted in public to ask the Legislature for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital district was formed in 1955 to build and operate a community 
hospital. It encompasses Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, 
where taxpayers pay about $900,000 annually to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the district leased South Bay Hospital to American Medical 
International, a commercial chain. Under the lease, which will not expire until 
2014, AMI pays the district $3 million a year in rent. The district uses 
interest from its investments to help finance health-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But South Bay Hospital has struggled in recent years amid financial losses and 
stiff competition for patients.  
</P>
<P>
 When the hospital lost its largest managed-care contract early this year, some 
wondered if the facility would be forced to close. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniel P. McLean, president and chief executive officer of Daniel Freeman 
Hospitals, said Monday that it has been negotiating with AMI for several months 
to take over operations, possibly through a sublease. Nonprofit Daniel Freeman 
runs Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood and Daniel Freeman Marina 
Hospital in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Blair Porter, a coordinator of the Palos Verdes/South Bay chapter of 
the National Organization for Women, said she is disappointed that a ban on 
abortions may go into effect at a publicly owned hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really rather a sad state of affairs, that without anyone knowing about 
it, women's access to medical care is precluded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach Councilman Bob Pinzler also expressed concern about the Catholic 
guidelines. He said the district needs to discuss its activities more openly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the responsibility of the agency to get the word out, rather than to 
wait for people to come and ask," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they were not trying to circumvent the electorate. 
Robert Lundy, attorney for the district, said that the legislation was intended 
to clear up some legal ambiguity and that it is not even clear that the law's 
old language would have required an election.  
</P>
<P>
 The change became part of a bill sponsored by the Assn. of California Hospital 
Districts and introduced by Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno). The Beach Cities Health 
District asked for the change, said Barbara Glaser, the hospital association's 
legislative advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Hospital is the only hospital in the state affected by the 
modification, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next scheduled election is Nov. 8, when six candidates are vying for two 
of five district board seats: David E. Andrews, incumbent Patricia A. Dreizler, 
M.A. (Kyle) Culley, incumbent Johnson, J. Daniel Keeling and Judy Swanson. The 
election filing deadline was Aug. 12, and district officials say that holding a 
special election would be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 A district staff member reviewed records of the board's meetings this week and 
found only one brief reference to the law, in a July 7 attorney's report. 
</P>
<P>
 However, district officials met with Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del 
Rey) in March and with state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) last month to 
discuss the change. Both legislators supported the legislation.

WOMAN WHO LIVED ON SCHOONER 4 DECADES DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Kelley, an independent woman who eschewed a conventional home for a 
52-foot wooden-hulled schooner in Wilmington, died recently of bone cancer. She 
was 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kelley, who was featured in January in a Times article on people who live 
aboard their boats, lived on the Gypsy Clipper for more than four decades. When 
her husband died more than 10 years ago, Mrs. Kelley remained, caring for the 
sails and varnishing the wood to ensure that the schooner would have a long 
life at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was appropriate, her brother said, that when Mrs. Kelley died last week, 
she spent her last moments aboard the Gypsy Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The love she had for that boat stemmed from the love she had for her 
husband," said her brother, Paul Robinson, 67, of Harbor Gateway. "The boat was 
all she had left of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kelley and her husband, Vernon, moved aboard the ship soon after they 
married in 1953. The two often hoisted the schooner's sails to ride the 
afternoon sea breeze off the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 After she was found to have cancer several weeks ago, family members stayed 
with her around the clock to ensure that she could remain aboard the boat she 
loved most.  
</P>
<P>
 After a memorial service Friday, flowers were placed atop the ship's stern and 
cabin, and relatives motored the Gypsy Clipper around harbor waters. As the 
boat passed, other sailors paid tribute to Mrs. Kelley by waving and honking 
their boats' horns. The family says the Gypsy Clipper is part of Mrs. Kelley's 
estate and they have not determined what will become of it.  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kelley's ashes will be scattered at sea, near the waters where her 
husband's ashes were scattered a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by Robinson; her sister, Virginia Harshman, 74, of Rialto; and 
her son, Richard Hulett, 55, of San Pedro; and two granddaughters. JAMES 
BENNING

CENTERPIECE: IN THE COMPANY OF CRITICS; COUNTY WRITERS CLUB WORKSHOPS GIVE 
FRIENDLY FEEDBACK TO ASPIRING SCRIBES ABOUT PLOT, CHARACTER, TONE AND MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN SHIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One is writing about a white witch. Another lives with a 17th-Century sea 
captain. Two others are immersed in ancient Crete and Franco's Spain. All are 
members of the Ventura County Writers Club, a wildly imaginative group of 300 
perfectly normal-looking people who spend their days in other worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the absolutely best writers club between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara," 
says Barnaby Conrad, award-winning author, artist and director of the 
internationally known Santa Barbara Writers Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has humble origins. It started in 1932 as the Ventura County 
Scribblers' Club, growing out of a five-woman writing class that met in Ojai. 
By the '80s, publishing credits were adding up, along with new members. When a 
monthly evening meeting was started, people with day jobs could attend, 
bringing in a younger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the members range in age from 26 to 92 and include professionals, 
retirees, wanna-bes and people such as Gary McCarthy and Gaylord Larsen, who 
make their living writing fiction. The diverse group of screenwriters, 
novelists, poets, children's writers and journalists meets regularly to 
critique each other's works in blunt but good-natured exchanges, listen to 
speakers and commiserate over rejection letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Genre workshops offer a friendly environment in which writers can be candid, 
spirited, instructive, defensive and sometimes more entertaining than their 
actual writing. Genres include novels, nonfiction, short story/articles, 
mystery, inspirational, poetry, fantasy/sci-fi, screenwriting, marketing and 
personal experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the meetings are held in members' homes, some weekly, others 
semiweekly or monthly, and are only open to members. An exception is the 
all-genre group, in which non-members are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 What goes on at a workshop? Read on. NOVELS GROUP I 
</P>
<P>
 Hugs are the prerequisite greeting when these 10 members get together every 
Thursday evening for three hours. On this night, they sit around a dining room 
table in Oxnard, manuscripts and note pads spread out, a platter of bakery 
sweets and grapes within easy reach. Egos were checked at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone gets to critique, with most of the initial comments confined to what 
the group calls "pickies," as in "picky, picky, picky." The workshop leader 
checks her list and calls on a man who hasn't read in a while. He reads the 
first two chapters of a contemporary novel he's been revising for months, so 
the work is familiar to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone refers to his phrase "torn shards of glass" as glib, a cliche. The 
author lets out a small yelp of protest as he bends over his tablet and duly 
notes the comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great tension, I loved it," someone says, bringing a smile to the author. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a pickie: "You switch too many times between the omniscient and first 
person viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't find the structure," says a man whose own novel is in the hands of 
several publishers. He adds, "It might have been your lousy reading rather than 
the text." 
</P>
<P>
 The author winces and gets picked on again: "Your reading wasn't that lousy." 
From another: "Don't pay attention to them, they were busy eating cookies." 
Everyone laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The next reader is a woman who manages apartments so she has the time to 
write. After she reads a chapter from her mystery novel, the first critic says 
emphatically, "It was great," then follows with a pickie. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The dog) pees an awful lot in this chapter," he says. Another writer agrees. 
"Yes, unless the dog is important later on, he's in this scene too much." 
</P>
<P>
 A scholarly looking man goes for the jugular and tells the author to throw out 
the entire first page. "You don't need it -- it stops the story cold." Then he 
delivers a short lecture on structure: "You state a goal, you complicate the 
goal, you deny the goal. You did A and B right." 
</P>
<P>
 The leader says the story is moving forward but the tone is flat. She wants to 
hear trumpets, drum rolls, some highs and lows. The author writes down all the 
comments and concedes that the dog pees too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest member of the group reads six pages of his novel and receives an 
especially picky pickie: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do I have to know that the whitecaps were 10 to 30 yards apart? I 
pictured you with a ruler out there." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman objects to the alliteration "Ronda reeled," but the author makes it 
clear he's leaving it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The last reader reads the new opening chapter of the final revision of his 
17th-Century novel. At least he thought it was the final revision. Nobody likes 
the chapter. They want it tossed out and the original restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the original first chapter better," the leader says. "I think we all 
agree this isn't the place to start. It's ponderous, heavy. Action and tension 
is lost in the style." 
</P>
<P>
 On a positive note -- as if anything could lift the author's spirits by now -- 
someone says, "I loved where you said, 'Carvings of a thousand gods.' " SHORT 
STORY / ARTICLE GROUP 
</P>
<P>
 Despite meeting just once a month, a core group of six to eight regulars 
maintains the kind of support, friendship and directness found in the novels 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors drop in from time to time. On this evening, 13 writers are sitting 
around a living room in east Ventura, 10 of them with manuscripts. Each reader 
is limited to 10 doubled-spaced pages. The leader calls on the first reader, a 
private investigator. He's going to read a short story, which is obviously over 
the page limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many pages?" the leader says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lots of dialogue; it goes fast," says the man, a master of evasion. 
Someone snickers. Hearing no more objections, he plunges in and manages to read 
his entire story. It's funny and fast-paced, a modern-day "Catcher in the Rye." 
He has two endings and wants advice on which works best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get rid of the breast cancer bit at the end," someone says. "It changes the 
tone." Everyone agrees and he crosses out the last paragraph. Someone else 
tells him to dump the reference to masturbation in the beginning, that it's 
only there to titillate. The author grins, shrugs and blue-pencils the 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
 The second writer reads a query letter to an agent he's trying to interest in 
his book on the paranormal. Someone says, "Too dry, sounds like an engineer 
wrote it." It's pointed out the author is an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman has driven down from Santa Barbara in the hopes of getting marketing 
suggestions for her short story, which won the best mystery award at the Santa 
Barbara Writers Conference in June. Her British accent and stage experience 
give the reading an edge. The group, mesmerized, has no pickies, only advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try Alfred Hitchcock or Ellery Queen Magazine," the investigator suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 The next reader does a chapter from her historical book about life in the 19th 
Century as seen through authentic letters she's hunted down all over the 
country. One of the luckier ones, with a New York agent, she's just fine-tuning 
the work, but she can't avoid a prickly pickie. 
</P>
<P>
 "You use his name too much," someone says. "Switch to 'he' whenever it isn't 
confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her pompous Civil War soldier isn't very sympathetic, she's told. "Can't we 
get some emotion out of him?" Nobody much likes the guy, but that's just the 
way he is, the author says, and she can't change history. But "can't you 
intrude on his thoughts a little and imagine what he might be thinking, maybe 
warm him up a bit?" someone asks. LEARNING CLUB 
</P>
<P>
 People who show up at these workshops week after week, month after month, 
improve their craft noticeably. Some stop coming when they feel they've learned 
enough. Once in a while, a sensitive soul will feel stung by a critique and 
drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups aren't for every writer. Some members never attend workshops, 
either too shy to expose their creations to critical eyes, or so well-published 
they don't feel the need for it. New members are just as apt to be enticed to 
join for other perks, such as the monthly speakers, the parties and the 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly newsletter, The Write Stuff, is mailed to all members, public 
libraries and college creative writing classes. It includes writing tips, 
marketing information, publishing news and what's going on at local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker's meeting on the second Tuesday evening of the month outgrew its 
facilities and moved to larger quarters last year at Ottavio's in Camarillo. 
Any guest with $5 is welcome to come and hear editors, agents and published 
authors offer advice on writing and getting published. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai author and club member Gary McCarthy, winner of western genre Golden Spur 
awards, spoke to members at the August meeting. Scoffing at the practice of 
drawing up lengthy profiles of major characters before beginning to write the 
story, McCarthy said, "It's just an excuse to procrastinate. Characters don't 
come alive until you begin to write about them." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 62 years of existence, the Ventura County Writers Club has managed to 
create a community within a community. It has given writers a place to bring 
their dreams of getting published, of landing on someone's bestseller list . . 
. or maybe even making it to the wide screen.

<P>
 Police officers protested stalled contract talks with the city by calling in 
sick this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the uniformed officers, 75% of them scheduled to be on duty called in sick 
Monday morning.In addition, most of the detectives called in, and nine of 12 
graveyard-shift officers called in sick later that day, said Torrance Police 
Sgt. Dave Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators covered shifts with supervisors, probationary officers and 
officers held over from previous shifts, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, whose contract expired June 30, want an 8.6% salary increase. 
The city last offered 7.1%, said Officer Steve Harvey, president of the 
Torrance Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers have not received a wage increase in three years, he said. To protest 
stalled contract talks, nearly 150 officers and family members picketed in 
front of City Hall on Aug. 23, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said the department's ability to retain and attract top personnel will 
be threatened if salaries fall too low. "It's not that we want to stuff our 
pockets more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager LeRoy J. Jackson said other city organizations have accepted 
packages that include 7% wage increases over the next two years. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; NORTHROP PROPERTY TO GO ON AUCTION BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman Corp. has a new tactic to get top dollar for its 34-acre site 
here: The company has hired an auctioneer to sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century City-based aerospace company "wanted to get more offers," said Jim 
Hart, Northrop Grumman spokesman.The auction firm of Kennedy-Wilson will take 
offers through sealed bids.  
</P>
<P>
 The Crest Road property has been vacant since 1991, when Northrop closed a 
research and technology center there. Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes 
reportedly bid between $14.5 million and $15 million for the property, but was 
outbid by a spa company, which offered about $17 million. That deal later fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart would not comment on previous offers, and did not know if a minimum bid 
had been set.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PORT OF LOS ANGELES; $6 MILLION IS EXPECTED FROM NEW CARGO 
SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The port expects to make $6 million a year from a new cargo shuttle service to 
the ports of Seattle and Vancouver being offered by Los Angeles-based Matson 
Navigation Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Matson began the business in July.It is believed to be the first service to 
move cargo specifically between the West Coast ports. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an alternative to rail and truck routes on the West Coast and allows 
some international carriers to reduce the number of ports where they have to 
stop, said Matson spokesman Jeff Hull. The company may expand its service to 
include Oakland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert B. Fierstine, the port's director of marketing, said ships bringing 
cargo from a domestic port to use Matson's new service will have to pay 
wharfage fees.

 Will John Wayne Bobbitt's porno film, the trials of O.J. Simpson and Heidi 
Fleiss, and militant talk show hosts and their often-crazed callers keep us 
enthralled throughout 1994? Or do you hunger for a kinder world that encourages 
intelligent discourse rather than anxiety and fear? Here's a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>

 Actor Buddy Ebsen, who attracted hundreds of fans during his first appearance 
at the Phantom Bookshop six months ago, returns to the bookshop at 451 E. Main 
St., Ventura, from 1 to 4 p.m. Sunday to sign his autobiography, "The Other 
Side of Oz" (Donovan Publishing). Ebsen's film career spans six decades. He was 
originally cast as the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz" (replaced by Jack Haley) 
and is known worldwide for his television roles as Jed Clampett in "The Beverly 
Hillbillies" and Detective Barnaby Jones. Acknowledged for content, design and 
photographs, Ebsen's book captured the prestigious Benjamin Franklin Award for 
best autobiography at the American Booksellers convention in Los Angeles. The 
award was presented in June by Publishers Marketing Assn., the largest 
nonprofit group of independent publishers.

THEATER REVIEWS; CONEJO PLAYERS PAY TRIBUTE TO OLD TEAM; PRODUCTION OF 
'SUNSHINE BOYS,' NEIL SIMON'S SALUTE TO VAUDEVILLE, OFFERS IMPECCABLE 
PERFORMANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One of vaudeville's leading and most beloved comedy teams for 43 years, Al 
Lewis and Willie Clark, haven't spoken to each other for more than a decade: 
Clark can no longer abide Lewis' irritating mannerisms. Television beckons with 
an offer for a nationally broadcast onetime reunion. Can Clark tolerate Lewis' 
finger-jabbing long enough for one last appearance before an audience of 
millions? 
</P>
<P>
 So goes "The Sunshine Boys," Neil Simon's tribute to classic vaudeville. The 
Conejo Players are presenting the comedy at their theater in Thousand Oaks 
through Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The play might be likened to an extension of "The Odd Couple" -- a pair of 
longtime friends, grumbling at each other for a couple of hours -- sweetened by 
Simon's obvious affection for the vaudeville milieu and by some 
authentic-seeming comic routines. One, known as The Doctor Sketch, is the 
centerpiece of Lewis and Clark's act; other, equally smartly paced routines 
appear disguised as dialogue between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those, in which Lewis and Clark confuse the names of some old pals, are 
near-classics in the same genre as Abbott and Costello's "Who's On First," 
impeccably performed by Wayne Collier (Clark) and Don Perlman (Lewis) on the 
Conejo stage under Gary Romm's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hillstrom plays Ben Silverman, who tries to pull Lewis and Clark 
together; Walker Christian, dolled up in a Loni Anderson wig, adds to the 
doctor sketch as a buxom nurse, and Joanna Jocelyn plays a no-nonsense 
registered nurse. Doug Reese and Mike McCauley appear briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Romm knows where the punch lines are, though one of the principals 
seemed to be having some trouble remembering a few of them on opening night.

THEATER REVIEWS; MUCH TO ENJOY IN OJAI COMPANY'S 'MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING'; AN 
IMPRESSIVE SET AND SEVERAL EXCELLENT CAST MEMBERS ARE AMONG THE PRODUCTION'S 
STRONG POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gossip and misunderstanding lead to near tragedy before a merry resolution in 
Shakespeare's romantic comedy "Much Ado About Nothing," the current production 
of the Ojai Theatre Company. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe, unrelated to the Ojai Shakespeare Festival, is performing only a 
few weeks following the festival in that outfit's longtime home, Libbey Bowl. 
They win no points for originality in that regard, but at least local 
Shakespeare fans will know where to go. The play, directed by Lena Frederick, 
closes this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Attractive young noble folk Benedick and Beatrice seem to despise each other 
as much as they claim to; virtually every exchange between them is an insult. A 
friend, Don Pedro, bets some other friends that he'll have Benedick and 
Beatrice declaring their mutual love before the end of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, another young lord, Claudio, harbors a crush on the lovely 
Hero, but claims to be too shy to court her. Anticipating Cyrano de Bergerac by 
a couple of centuries, Don Pedro volunteers to court Hero on Claudio's behalf, 
in disguise. Into all of this revelry comes the no-good Don John, who has sworn 
to separate Claudio and Hero. High jinks ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 There's much to enjoy about the play, beginning with the impressive Italian 
courtyard set designed by Bob Coble, Jon Cotham and D'Anria and including the 
intermission snack-bar coffee, which is the best provided by any local theater 
group. Director Frederick moves the action out into the audience several times, 
which adds to the immediacy and intimacy of the production, another plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the cast are excellent, none more so than Dwier Brown and 
Kim Maxwell-Brown as the well-matched Benedick and Beatrice. The scenes in 
which they attempt to hide while eavesdropping on their plotting friends are 
practically worth the price of admission. Larry C. Wright is very funny as the 
constable, Dogberry; James Lashly is strong as the Prince of Aragon, and 
Stephanie Lowe is delightful as the ingenue, Hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Where some other members of the cast fall short is in experience and thus the 
consequent lack of confidence in their roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other situations contribute to the less-than-professional level of the 
show: Frederick, evidently faced with more women than men, cast females as 
Dogberry's posse, and she uses an enormous number of very young people to fill 
the stage for certain scenes. (Some directors have been known to include huge 
numbers of superfluous cast members to attract ticket-buying friends and 
neighbors; others just cain't say "no.") 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Dogberry's "watch" -- Debbie Court, Rachel Tibbitts, Rowan 
Frederick and Juno Cole -- acquit themselves well enough under the 
circumstances (only one of them made no effort to appear manly at Saturday 
night's show), but the pitter-patter of tiny feet overwhelms the stage more 
than it helps things, no matter how cute the children are in their little 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this "Much Ado" is an enjoyable experience, although not up to the 
overall quality of Ojai Shakespeare Festival and California Shakespeare Company 
productions. If there were only a way that all three groups could pool their 
considerable resources for the common good. . . . Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Much Ado About Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday through Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; closes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Libbey Bowl, Libbey Park, Ojai at Signal streets, Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $12 adults, $10 senior citizens and students, children 12 and 
under free. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Unreserved bench or lawn seating. For information, call 646-2992.

FASHION; HOLEY NOSES!; PIERCING TREND THAT BEGAN AS RADICAL HAS EXTENDED TO 
EYEBROWS AND NAVELS AND CROSSED OVER FROM OUTRAGEOUS TO MAINSTREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A rack of nose jewelry awaits shoppers at Afterthoughts in Oxnard's Esplanade 
Mall. It is, in fact, trainer nose jewelry for those who have not yet taken the 
plunge of perforation. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a pinch-on nose ring in her hand, salesclerk Patricia Hernandez says: 
"They are the top seller. It's like everybody has them. It's demand -- you know 
what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Once in place, clamped on a nostril, the rings look just like the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not just for kids," Hernandez assures us. "We have older ladies, 
older men. Just walk down the mall today; you will see them. It's everybody. 
You know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 We know. It's hard to be radical nowadays -- and getting harder. Street 
trends, once the domain of the truly hip, now spread faster than mutant aliens, 
and sometimes bear a resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock fans -- not to mention designers -- copy rockers' underground fashion as 
fast as it springs onstage, trying to stay on the cutting edge of cool. The 
middle class adopts the outrageous looks -- and there's no one left to outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easier in the '70s. An extra earring, a hint of leather and chains, had 
shock appeal. Now, nothing shocks anyone, and most of it is tamed and 
mass-produced for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial boots, camouflage jackets, frayed jeans, bared navels, ragged hair, 
leather everything have trickled into the style vortex and caught the wave into 
the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Take kilts. Once considered the ultimate tacky threads, pleated plaid skirts 
were hauled from the catholic closets of girls reaching majority and chucked in 
charity bins. Now, they are chic. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact does not please a young woman named Jessica from Ventura who makes 
the punk rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me mad. It means a lot to me, but now they are selling them," she 
said bitterly. "It's the Euro-trash look. It's like they finally did this -- 
after we've been doing this for so long!" 
</P>
<P>
 You have to sympathize with the feeling. If everything counterculture goes 
mainstream, what's the point? How can a statement be made to the square if they 
mirror it back faster than you can diverge? 
</P>
<P>
 Like America, Ventura County wants to take a walk on the wild side. Jim 
Angelo, owner of Jimi's Tattoo Parlor in Port Hueneme, has watched it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Middle class, upper class, we get 'em all," he said, affirming that tattoo 
clientele has changed in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another demographic warp in ink art is age. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a quarter are over 30," the artist said, "Then we get people in their 
50s and 60s. That's about 10%." 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the older customers are women. But, so far, they still choose mundane 
symbols. "No skulls or grim reapers," said Angelo, "They want a rose, usually." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as big as tattooing is a wave of body piercing that has crossed over 
from subculture. 
</P>
<P>
 At Charlie's House of Tattoo in Simi Valley, Tara Hyde said the custom is 
spreading fast, and that piercees over 30 make up a 15% segment of the trade, 
"but, it's growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Noses are being overshadowed by eyebrows as sites for apertures, she said, 
with navels running a close second. Interestingly, many people seem to take to 
piercing more easily than tattooing, working up to the tattoo on a later visit. 
</P>
<P>
 With such trends flourishing around us, standing out from the crowd is a 
tricky business. 
</P>
<P>
 This was borne out by Roy, a first-year Ventura College student who wears 
alternative fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, it's like 'Look at that freak!' They are making fun of you," he 
said. "Then all of a sudden, they see it's different. A couple of months later, 
you see them doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 You could tell Roy was serious. His dark hair parted in the middle, he wore a 
spiked dog collar and choke chain set off by a black rayon jerkin. Fishnet 
stockings covered his arms, custom cut for the fingers. Completing the ensemble 
were gray jersey pants, neatly cut off at the knee, black Oliver Twist-style 
stockings and industrial boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Even this outfit is too readily copied by his contemporaries -- so he 
constantly checks thrift shops for a unique touch, or crafts accessories on his 
own. For club wear especially, he said, he must go to greater extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 What other elements can he adopt to stay ahead of the masses? 
</P>
<P>
 "Skirts," he said, "They really confuse people."

SHOP TALK; MAKING AN INFORMED CHOICE OF POSSIBLE PETS; THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS 
AT MANY PRICES IF YOU DECIDE TO EXPAND YOUR HOUSEHOLD WITH A GOLDFISH, HAMSTER 
OR MOUSE.

<P>
 A fear of many a parent: Your child wants a pet for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 You attempt to negotiate. He or she wants a St. Bernard, you offer a goldfish. 
He or she says, maybe a German shepherd. You suggest a goldfish. Your child 
says how about a cat? You say, OK, a goldfish . . . or maybe a hamster or a 
mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 We're rooting for you, so last week we visited four Ventura County pet shops 
-- Petco and Animal House Pets stores in Ventura, the Pet Company in Camarillo, 
and Pet World in Oxnard -- in search of a goldfish, a hamster or a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 We began by looking at the fish. All we knew was that when selecting one it 
was best to avoid those floating at the top of the tank, upside-down. Other 
than that, to us a fish is a fish is a fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so. True, there is such a thing as a basic goldfish, but there are enough 
types of other goldfish out there to make your head swim. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest, simplest pet goldfish -- the kind you'd be able to pick up at a 
county fair by bouncing a Ping-Pong ball into a bowl -- is perfectly 
acceptable. At Pet World they are referred to as "regular" gold fish. At Petco 
they are "feeder" fish because they are used to feed other fish even though 
they are the most popular among the store's average goldfish buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Petco, the basic "small" goldfish went for 29 cents each when buying 
quantities of one to nine, 10 cents each when buying 10 to 99, and nine cents 
each when buying 100 or more. At Pet World, the regular small gold fish were 
also 29 cents each, or 15 for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up on the goldfish social ladder are the orandas ryunkins, liontails and 
fantails. They all have different price values placed on them, depending on 
breed and size. It just depends on how much you want to spend and whether you 
are a serious collector or just want a low-maintenance household pet. 
</P>
<P>
 We found fantails for $2.99 at Petco, and for $3.98 (marked down to $2.98) at 
Pet World. We found a red oranda for $5.99 and a red cap oranda for $6.99 at 
Petco. At Pet World we found a regular oranda (medium-sized) for $5.98, a 
medium African oranda for $4.98, and a small African oranda for $3.98. And at 
the Pet Company we saw a red and black oranda for $9.99. It pays to shop 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 A very popular kind of goldfish is the koi. You're apt to find a koi just 
about anywhere fish are swimming in tanks. Petco had them at $19.99 (large) 
$11.99 (medium large) and $7.99 (medium small). Pet Company had them for $24.99 
(large) and $5.99 (small). And Animal House had small koi for $4.99. Keep in 
mind that there are relative degrees of large, small and medium. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Pet Company specializes in exotic fish and even if you're not 
buying, it's a great place to window shop. They've got some pretty amazing 
fish. Our favorite? The dogface puffer ($29.99). And the fumanchu lion 
($39.99). A fumanchu lion was going for $24.98 at Pet World. So again, you can 
see how prices can vary greatly depending on various factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we've confused you, let's try to straighten things out. We spoke with 
Kristen Steinbrecher of Petco for advice on selecting healthy fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look for where the fish swims in the tank. If you see a fish sitting at the 
bottom, that's not a good sign. If you see a fish hanging around the top where 
the filter is, that's not a good sign either. Those are signs of disease," said 
Steinbrecher. "As a rule of thumb you want fish swimming around the middle, not 
just sitting or hovering." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said to check the fins for white spots, a fish parasite known as ich. 
"Also look for fungus hanging off the fins or certain parts of the body. Look 
for bulging eyes. Some fish have bulging eyes, but the majority of them don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldfish are fairly hardy, said Steinbrecher. But keep in mind that "feeder" 
fish are not maintained as well as others because they are used as feed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the kids won't let you off with a goldfish, try a hamster. We found a basic 
one for $4.99 at Petco. The store also sold a Siberian hamster for $22.99. At 
Animal House Pets, a dwarf hamster was $14.99. And at Pet World a dwarf hamster 
was going for $10.99. If you prefer mice, we found them for $1.99 at Petco, 
$1.69 at Animal House and $1.49 at Pet World. 
</P>
<P>
 If none of these satisfy the kids, there's always the increasingly popular 
green iguanas, which can cost anywhere from $19.99 to $49.99. "You want them 
with some meat on them," Steinbrecher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could just give in and buy that St. Bernard.

<P>
 Want to end the Labor Day weekend on a good old-fashioned note -- literally? 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Pops Orchestra is giving a free outdoor concert Monday at Conejo 
Community Park in Thousand Oaks. Show time is 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a chance to bring a blanket and stretch out under the park's giant oak 
trees and listen to old and new show tunes and even a patriotic march or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, which is part of the Conejo Symphony Orchestra, has been 
offering the summer pops concert for close to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 You might want to get to the park early because the event draws 2,000 to 
3,000. Bring a picnic dinner and make an evening of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's been hot, it's usually cooling down by then and it's quite pleasant," 
said Steve Wiley, recreation services manager for the Conejo Recreation and 
Park District, which brings the concert to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 James Christensen, who has been affiliated with Walt Disney Productions for 
more than 24 years, will conduct the orchestra. If you have been to Disneyland 
or Disney World, you probably have heard Christensen's music. He was music 
director for the theme parks for 12 years and has written soundtracks for the 
"Main Street Electrical Parade," "Fantasy in the Sky" and other Disney parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, who has performed as guest conductor with the Conejo Pops 
Orchestra previously, will conduct arrangements from Broadway hits such as "The 
Sound of Music," "Carousel," "Phantom of the Opera," "Cats" and "A Chorus 
Line," and the film "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's pops concert will be performed by 45 to 50 musicians on a portable 
stage set up in a bowl-like area in the park. During intermission, mimes will 
pass the hat for donations. The concert is being sponsored by several community 
organizations and Musicians Local No. 581. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert also offers a chance to explore Conejo Community Park. If you feel 
like taking a short hike, you can walk the nature trail that winds through the 
park's Conejo Valley Botanic Garden. The path takes you down next to a cool, 
shaded stream, as well as high on a hill overlooking the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want more vigorous exercise, try volleyball, basketball or Frisbee. For 
children, the park has a sandy playground. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Conejo Pops Orchestra concert. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Conejo Community Park, corner of Dover and Hendrix avenues, Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Monday, Labor Day, 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Come early to get a space close to the orchestra. Parking is available 
on the streets surrounding the park. Leave dogs at home.

EARTHWATCH: NEW CARS COULD HELP CUT SMOG PROBLEMS; THESE SPECIALLY CERTIFIED 
VEHICLES MEET LOW EMISSION STANDARDS SET BY THE EPA. MANY ARE IN SHOWROOMS NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Smoggy days got you down? Lots of folks are bothered, not just about their 
health. People are worried that many businesses in the county might have to 
move away or cut payroll because of possible expensive new rules to reduce 
smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthwatch has a solution for both concerns. A one-stop-shopping solution, in 
a manner of speaking: Buy a new car. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I'm not trying to sell an electric-powered car like the GM Impact you may 
have seen cruising around hereabouts and on display at the county fair. Those 
won't be marketed for years. I'm talking about a type of standard 
gasoline-powered, ready-to-drive, name brand, locally available car officially 
certified by the state as TLEV -- Transitional Low Emission Vehicle -- and 
accepted as environmentally OK by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough of us buy such a car we can cut smog way back and maybe keep the 
federal government from slapping new restrictions on county businesses. Cars 
cause half the air pollution in the county, but less well-known is that local 
industrial firms are sitting ducks for federal air regulators who are under 
court order to mandate costly new technology -- unless we can cut smog some 
other way. I suggest we save our lungs and our job base by switching to 
low-smog driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The California TLEV certification, awarded to certain new cars for the first 
time this year, may sound off-putting, but I suspect you'll feel better if I 
use some of the names the manufacturers put on their cars: Cavalier, Corsica, 
Escort, Saturn, Skylark, Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, while not many people were looking, Detroit and several foreign firms 
have actually made some cars that environmental regulators approve of. "The 
auto industry is going along with us," said a spokesman for the California Air 
Resources Board, which sets environmental standards on cars sold here. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1994 model year began last September, Detroit has garnered TLEV 
certification for over a dozen gasoline-powered models. When you shop, ask your 
car dealer to point them out. They don't look any different than regular cars. 
And the traditional fuel-efficiency stickers on new cars don't really indicate 
whether the vehicle's smog emissions are low. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the auto makers will roll additional smog-fighting models of 
well-known makes onto California showrooms. "In six years, the average new car 
sold in California will be 70% cleaner than the average new car sold here 
today," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local consumer acceptance of these cars during the next few years could have 
good results. According to Scott Johnson, planning director for the Ventura 
County Air Pollution Control Board, it could mean a 50% or 60% reduction "from 
today's vehicle emissions and be a big part of getting us off the hook with the 
EPA." 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to stress, "We're going to have to make up the difference by 
driving low-emission cars or face extra taxes, driving restrictions or onerous 
controls on businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to this nationwide epidemic, a useful guidebook has been compiled 
by a Washington-based group, Public Citizen. "The Green Buyer's Car Book" is a 
valuable supplement to the EPA's annually published fuel-economy estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Citizen, in a departure from the practices of its founder, Ralph Nader, 
turns the usual auto research results on their head. Instead of stressing who 
the worst environmental sinners are, it goes in search of those consumer 
products least involved with waste and toxic releases. It's a buying guide, not 
a bashing guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Claybrook, the group's director, said: "What kind of car you drive 
determines whether your county meets healthy air standards or must limit 
driving, factories and commerce." Almost every 1994 car is rated by its 
emissions and fuel mileage -- even its recycling qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Using figures from our state's Air Resources Board as well as the EPA, the 
guide shows some surprising clean-air cars on the market. Saturn leads in the 
small station wagon category and the Olds Achieva in the compact category. But, 
predictably, the Geo Metro and Honda Civic are at the very top in overall 
eco-rating. 
</P>
<P>
 So, shop till the smog drops. Details 
</P>

1994 cars, "Fuel Economy Estimates," contact a new car dealer of your choice or 
phone (800) 523-2929. For a copy of "The Green Buyer's Car Guide" at $5 call

PROFILE; OJAI TUTOR TEACHES YOUNG ABOUT LIVING WITH A DISABILITY; JOANN KARA, 
WHO WAS PARALYZED IN A CAR CRASH, FIELDS QUESTIONS ABOUT MATH, READING AND HER 
MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RACHEL ALTMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When teaching assistant JoAnn Kara returns to the classroom at Ojai's Topa 
Topa Elementary School next week, she anticipates as many questions about her 
motorized wheelchair as about math or reading, the subjects in which she 
specializes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger children in particular are fascinated by my chair," Kara said. 
"The most popular questions are 'How fast does it go?' and 'Can I drive it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As a volunteer teacher and frequent guest speaker in Ventura County 
classrooms, Kara, 36, is accustomed to questions from children about her life 
and her disability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find kids to be much less self-conscious and ill at ease around me than 
grown-ups (are)," she said. "They warm up right away, and they're eager to help 
me out -- to pick up something I've dropped or to hold a door open for me. And 
the older ones aren't afraid to ask hard, personal questions, like 'How does it 
feel?' or 'Don't you wish you could play tennis, or dance?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And how does she deal with the questions? "Like everyone, I have good days and 
bad days," Kara said. "I just answer how I feel at the moment, and what I think 
they can handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Kara suffered a spinal-cord injury in 1977, leaving her a paraplegic, 
paralyzed from the waist down with partial use of her hands. She was a 
passenger in a car driven by a drunk driver. The car spun out of control and 
crashed into a ditch. A student at Ventura Community College at the time, Kara 
was forced to give up her studies in environmental science. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I graduated (from) high school, I thought I might want to become a 
forest ranger here in the Los Padres (National Forest)," she said. "But after 
the accident, that didn't seem like a very practical idea." 
</P>
<P>
 After 1 1/2 years spent recovering, Kara enrolled in Santa Barbara Community 
College, graduating in 1985 with a degree in liberal arts and enough education 
credits to teach preschool. But the amount of physical help needed by 
preschoolers proved to be more than Kara could manage from a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1987, second-grade teacher Mary Ann Scheele invited Kara to speak in 
her classroom at Topa Topa Elementary School. "Our new reading book referred to 
disabilities of different kinds and I wanted the students to meet someone who 
lives with disability," Scheele said. "JoAnn was very matter-of-fact about it 
all, and explained how she gets around in her chair, how she uses the pull bar 
to get in and out of bed. She's comfortable talking about herself in that way, 
and it was wonderful for them." 
</P>
<P>
 When Scheele saw how well the children responded to Kara, she asked her to 
tutor students in a math and reading program, which led to an ongoing position 
as a teacher's aide. Some years, when school budgets allowed, Kara was paid; 
these days, budget cuts mean that funds are not available. Still, Kara returns 
to the classroom each year as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her presence is invaluable," Scheele said. "She'll take one group and give 
them individual attention on reading comprehension, phonics or spelling games, 
which leaves me free to work with another group. Without her help I couldn't do 
nearly as much with the students -- especially the ones that need individual 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Kara doesn't confine her child-centered activities to the classroom. In 
addition to her work at Topa Topa, Kara home tutors, teaches Sunday religion 
classes at St. Thomas Aquinas Church and is co-leader of Girl Scout Troop No. 
158. She and her scouts make frequent outings to the Ojai Valley Bike Trail to 
pick up trash for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a nature-loving person and I try to get outside as much as possible. 
You'll see me over at the school field watching sports, or at Libbey Park 
playing with kids or watching them play tennis. And the bike path is a big help 
for me now," Kara said of the asphalt-paved trail, one of the few that are 
wheelchair-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kara's help, others with disabilities who love the outdoors will have 
more choices for treks in the future. As access coordinator for CREW (Concerned 
Resource and Environmental Workers), Kara is working with the U.S. Forest 
Service on the research and development of wheelchair-accessible trails in the 
Los Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking into paving some old fire roads and hoping to set up an 
interpretive trail with a fence and guide rope for the seeing impaired," Kara 
said. "I hope we can do what they've done at Rancho del Rey (a retreat center 
with an accessible trail in Ojai), where they have these scent boxes, so that 
you can get the smell of the native plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Kara lives in a converted garage in her parents' Ojai house in the same 
neighborhood in which she grew up, on a street that dead-ends at the base of 
the Topa Topa Mountains. Because she lives around the corner from Topa Topa 
school, neighborhood children -- some of whom call her "Aunt JoAnn" -- often 
drop by to visit on their way home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll ask me to help them with a math problem, or they'll just want 
somebody to talk to. Sometimes they'll come by just to say, 'Hi! We were 
playing outside and we wondered if you wanted to play too.' "

FOR THE KIDS; AUDIENCE MEMBERS GET CHANCE TO JOIN THE CIRCUS; PERFORMERS FROM A 
VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUNDS RECRUIT SPECTATORS TO PARTICIPATE UNDER 
THE BIG TOP. 
</P>

<P>
 When you go to the circus, do you sit safely in the stands, thankful you 
aren't the one teetering on the high wire or flying through the air grappling 
for the trapeze? 
</P>
<P>
 Or do you feel a twinge of jealousy, a yearning for a few minutes in the 
spotlight? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, here is your chance. At Circus Vargas, which is in Oxnard through 
Sunday, a team of acrobatic performers pulls audience members into the ring to 
become part of the act. 
</P>
<P>
 The acrobats, called Fausto Scorpions, do foot juggling. One member lies on 
the ground, feet up, and juggles the other two -- twirling and flipping them 
with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent show, the acrobats picked three people from the audience, 
including Roger Newbold of Simi Valley, who found himself balancing two of the 
performers -- one doing a handstand on his feet and the other on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was actually fun," Newbold said. "They knew exactly how to do it." He 
called it "another new experience," one that might be blamed on the fact that 
he was sitting in the front row with his wife and 2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the circus. A slice of Americana -- although in the case of Circus Vargas, 
it's more of an international slice. Nearly all the acts are from other 
countries: Argentina, Germany, Bulgaria, Spain, the Philippines, Denmark and 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup of acts includes slapstick acrobats dressed as Superman, tramps and 
other zany characters; a wire walker who can jump over a line of knives; 
acrobats who use a swing and a teeterboard to do high-flying gyrations; trapeze 
artists who do some moves blindfolded; African dancer-gymnasts who dance the 
limbo under a flaming pole, and two elephants that can stand on their front or 
hind legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids will like the dog act. The 10 dogs -- boxers and one bulldog -- come out 
suited up for soccer in T-shirts and shorts. In a chaotic scene, the dog teams 
try to nose a balloon into their opponent's goal. Shorts fall down and balloons 
burst. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is the clown. In this case, it's a 60ish retired high-wire 
walker who falls from a ladder only to be caught by his sturdy suspenders 
before hitting the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For $2, you can buy a program that describes the acts and the performers in 
English or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The show lasts about two hours, with an intermission during which a circus 
employee hawks circus coloring books. Vendors also offer the usual circus fare 
-- snow cones, cotton candy, soda, popcorn and those glow-in-the-dark wands. 
Stars decorate the inside of the big top, which seats 2,400 on bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the big top, the attractions are meager. For $1, you can view a dozen 
or so caged snakes, including a 21-foot Burmese python. 
</P>
<P>
 The circus, headquartered in Ventura, is in its 25th year. It was started by 
the late Clifford E. Vargas, the son of a Portuguese immigrant who sold his 
home to buy his first circus tent. He did so after Ringling Bros. decided in 
1969 to begin performing exclusively in indoor stadiums and arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 So Circus Vargas still searches out the empty fields and parking lots in towns 
and cities to put up its big top. Every year, the circus visits 75 locations in 
California. Before opening in Oxnard on Aug. 25, the circus set up on a dusty 
field in Simi Valley and, after the Labor Day weekend, it will be on to 
Anaheim. Details

ON THE ROAD: A SOFT SELL ON THE GREENER GRASS IN COSTA RICA 'OASIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 70 people are jammed into the reading area of the region's newest 
public gathering place, the Barnes & Noble bookstore, and none of them are 
reading. Instead, they're listening to an author sell his subject, a subject 
built on a dream: 
</P>
<P>
 "Down in Costa Rica, there is no 'Yankee Go Home,' " says Christopher Howard, 
formerly of Costa Rica and more recently of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very Americanized, with Taco Bells, Pizza Hut, satellite TV. It's the 
kind of place in which you can stay connected while living in a different 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses a moment, looks at row upon row of rapt middle-aged faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, they actually celebrate Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's the soft sell, obviously. Howard, co-author of "The Golden Door to 
Retirement and Living in Costa Rica," knows people everywhere like the familiar 
-- even when they're leaving everything familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams have that power. Dreaming actually can suspend one's ability to 
anticipate reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees for years have flocked to Florida and Arizona and New Mexico -- all 
for the lures of affordable housing and welcoming climates. But Florida is 
about to sink under gray hair, and adult developments of the Southwest are 
filling up and getting more expensive. There's just no greener grass on the 
other side of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica has enjoyed a well-deserved reputation as an oasis of sorts. 
Situated deep in Central America, its climate is lushly tropical, its 
government democratic, its national security held in place without an army, its 
people open and friendly, its very identity one of civility. Put another way, 
it's a Latin American state without political unrest, the threat of coup or 
hang-ups about Americans who have more money in IRAs than locals might earn in 
a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, the clincher. Costa Rica has long been known to be a relative 
bargain, a place where housing is cheap and the cost of food even cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass gets greener. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sixtyish man with white hair wanted to know about health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's socialized," says Howard. "You need bypass surgery? It's covered. 
Plastic surgery? They have some of the best in the world. It's all covered for 
a monthly premium of $20 to $30." 
</P>
<P>
 The fiftyish woman in the red and blue print dress wanted to know about 
safety, security, the ability to move about freely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dangerous? No," says Howard. "There's some burglary -- that happens 
everywhere. But there are no drive-by shootings or things like that -- that all 
happens here. It is much safer than the typical American city." 
</P>
<P>
 A rugged, sinewy hiker type in shorts asks about currency and Costa Rican 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can convert your money and buy CDs in Costa Rica's excellent, stable 
banking system. Even after conversion, you'll earn the equivalent of 16% to 18% 
in interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Language. More than one of those listening to Howard want to know about 
English proficiency in Costa Rican culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who once taught high school Spanish in Northern California, fields 
this one with authority. In 1985 he opened a language school in San Jose, Costa 
Rica's main city and capital, and sold it in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 25,000 resident English-speakers," he says. "But you will, in fact, 
have a better life if you speak some Spanish. You'll communicate with the 
people, you'll be able to attend the theater, you'll be able to get a buy at 
the market. There's a 'Gringo Grapevine,' which makes it easy to meet people, 
and two English-language newspapers. But it's worth it to learn some Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 And then housing. Everyone present wants to know what it costs to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard estimates it at 60% of the cost here in Southern California. Indeed, he 
makes it sound better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if you're an attorney and accustomed to living in a $300,000 house 
here and want to maintain that standard, it can be expensive. But a retired 
couple can live very nicely on $1,500. You can rent a decent apartment for $600 
or $700 or buy a small house for $30,000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the woman with the large green hat mutters "that would be a dump." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman with the green hat is from Oxnard and living in Costa Rica part 
time. She's a Costa Rica fan but also a New World realist. She says prices are 
considerably higher for safe, well-appointed places. 
</P>
<P>
 After the talk, she discusses the real ins and outs of living where grass is 
greener with Craig R. McClean, an orthopedic surgeon practicing in Oxnard. 
McClean also spends time in Costa Rica -- he's joined others in building a 
hotel and restaurant there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of everyone here sitting around bitching about medicine," he 
allows. "This is my way of branching out a bit, doing something new. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful place, down there," he continues. "But it can take some 
money. There's burglary everywhere. Leave nothing in your car at any time. And 
you can't leave your house unattended." 
</P>
<P>
 To which the woman in the green hat nods and allows as how she and her husband 
share with neighbors the cost of a private guard to keep watch on their houses 
when unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a dream," Howard later says. "Everybody's looking for 
something. Obviously, you can't escape your troubles here and find answers 
there. But it is an oasis." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many that have come before it, greener grass and all.

 Regulars at Pete's Breakfast House in Ventura have probably noticed some 
carpentry work going on next door. Well, that's part of restaurant owner Pete 
Ransom's preparations for opening a takeout operation specializing in 
cappuccino, espresso and baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first got the space (a former hair salon) in November, 1993," Ransom said. 
"We didn't jump on the retail idea right away because we wanted to look into 
expanding the restaurant. That wasn't a viable option." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the coffees and desserts, the new space will stock jams, jellies, 
T-shirts and other merchandise. "As we get going we'll be open to new ideas 
along the retail line. Knickknack stuff," Ransom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete's is located at 2055 E. Main St.

 What happens when two former finance managers with no coffeehouse experience 
buy a coffeehouse? Business percolates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a 40% increase in business last month," said Ron Fiducia, co-owner of 
the 6-month-old Coffee Connection in Simi Valley. "About half of that increase 
was from movie-theater traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Fiducia and his partner, Scott Hinton, lacked a restaurant background, 
they had the foresight to open their place next to a 10-plex cinema under 
construction. And when the Edwards Simi Valley Plaza opened a couple of months 
ago, Fiducia and Hinton extended their hours for the nighttime movie crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Business also hasn't been hurt by the 36-flavor coffee menu or the new patio 
seating. Coffee Connection is located at 1407-X E. Los Angeles Ave.

 Entries are being accepted for the Sept. 10 Simi Valley Days Chili Cook-Off, 
sponsored by the Rotary Club of Simi Sunrise. There are three divisions of 
competition -- amateur, commercial (as in restaurants) and International Chili 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no entry fee in the first two categories and just about anything 
goes. As proof, said cook-off chairman Craig Foster, a contestant last year 
added a touch of wild boar to his dish. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those ICS folks, it's very serious business, with entrants looking to 
make their way up the chili ladder into regional, state, national and 
international competitions. Entry is $10 for those who are already ICS members 
and $40 (which includes a $30 membership) for those who need to join. Call 
527-2272 for more information.

 TRASHED OUT: As if Ventura County didn't have enough problems figuring out 
what to do with its own trash. . . . Now, trash hauler Waste Management is 
talking up an old plan to ship 300 tons of rubbish a day from Oceanside to the 
Simi Valley Landfill (B7). . . . Said Supervisor Vicky Howard of Simi Valley: 
"We were blindsided, and now we're going to have to fight to keep this trash 
out of our county." 
</P>
<P>
 OOPS! It seemed like an honest mistake. . . . Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin of 
the Ventura County Community College District was identified in a new college 
catalogue only as a Ph.D., rather than as Dr. Lakin. But someone felt it was 
offensive and stopped the presses after 1,000 of the catalogues had already 
been printed (B1). . . . The extra brochures are being distributed free of 
charge. . . . Meanwhile, the printer says that the catalogues have referred to 
Lakin as a Ph.D. for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 WRITE STUFF: Since it formed in 1932, the Ventura County Writers Club has 
grown from 10 members to 300. The club includes retirees, wanna-bes and at 
least two published authors (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . Members meet 
regularly to critique each other's work as well as to offer support. The 
workshops, however, are not for the overly sensitive. . . . Recently, after 
listening to a fellow scribe read a chapter from her mystery novel in progress, 
one critic advised that she kill the first page. "You don't need it -- it stops 
the story cold." 
</P>
<P>
 NOVEL IDEA: Speaking of writers and books . . . the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors has approved a plan to extend the weekly hours of six county 
library branches. The action was made possible by extra money received from the 
county and community groups. . . . Although the city of Ojai contributed 
$30,000 toward the cause, the hours of its branch library will actually be 
reduced. The reason is that some money will be used to increase the working 
hours of the branch's head librarian in order to improve operations.

 ONE FOR THE ROAD: The scheduled reopening of the rest of the downed Simi 
Valley Freeway leaves only one major post-quake freeway repair project: the 
Antelope Valley and Golden State Freeway interchange. . . . Although the 
busiest portions reopened in July, some transitions still need work. Repairs 
should be completed in November. 
</P>
<P>
 PEACE HOPES: The IRA's cease-fire (A1, B13) was greeted locally by expatriates 
who note that in most cases, Catholics and Protestants who move here leave 
those tensions behind. . . . Eileen Selby, founder of the Mayflower Club in 
North Hollywood, says, "We've never had a problem." . . . Local leaders think 
about 1 million residents of Los Angeles and Orange counties are of Irish 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW CHANCE: Today's prep football preview (C10) takes a look at the Northwest 
Valley Conference, where plenty of teams hope to benefit from the new playoff 
system. . . . The team that might gain the most is Kennedy High, which had a 
good season last year but missed the playoffs. Quarterback Dan McMullen (above) 
will again be calling the signals. 
</P>
<P>
 CASUAL TOWER: College professors do plenty of research, but GQ must not be on 
their reading list. Some, like Valley College faculty President Jack Sterk, go 
casual in the classroom to keep cool and dress like students. Sterk, in fact, 
has never worn a suit and tie in 24 years of teaching. . . . And casual doesn't 
mean tweed jackets. That's an Ivy League thing, he says (E1). 
</P>
<P>
 NEW LEAGUES: Forget the baseball strike. Next summer, the Antelope Valley may 
have its own pro team. . . . It would be part of the growing national movement 
of independent leagues that are self-funded and have no relationship with the 
majors. A league headquartered in Chatsworth is trying to field a team for next 
summer in Palmdale. A four-part series beginning today in Valley Sports (C10) 
examines the trend. Michael Arkush and Henry Chu

 Now where have we heard that plot before?"He had a nice seductive manner, like 
those dark-suited zombies who sell cemetery plots to the not-yet-dead," begins 
the short story by Harry Hellenbrand. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tone sounds sort of 1940ish, it's because Hellenbrand, a Duluth, Minn., 
English professor, was an entrant in the International Imitation Raymond 
Chandler Writing Competition, held by the La Jolla Library. In fact, 
Hellenbrand's parody of the hard-boiled Bard of L.A. took the $700 top prize. 
How could it miss with the riveting title, "Confusion Is My Business"? 
</P>
<P>
 The story describes a meeting in which an L.A. lawyer by the name of Shapiro 
tries to lure detective Philip Marlowe back from La Jolla to join the defense 
team for a man accused of killing his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten minutes of your testimony and any jury would be so dizzy they'd have 
reasonable doubts about what decade it is," Shapiro says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marlowe turns him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't buying," the detective/narrator explains later. "It sounded like the 
same old city, just bigger and sleazier and a lot more afraid of cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can't escape the trials of L.A.: Even if you drive around with the radio 
off, you can hardly avoid noticing several billboards that seem to offer ironic 
commentary on recent events. 
</P>
<P>
 We've mentioned the ads for Not Guilty Jeans ("more for your bottom dollar"). 
There's also the billboard on the Long Beach Freeway that proclaims: "You Can't 
Do This With Just Any Camcorder" -- and shows a black-and-white police car 
through the viewfinder. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the ad on the San Diego Freeway for a "fragrance for men," 
titled DNA. We don't know about you, but we'd hate to have the same DNA as a 
bunch of other guys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, but we don't need that one linked to L.A.: The TV movie "Overkill," 
which was broadcast the other night, is a docudrama about a female serial 
killer in Florida. But Jeff Bliss of Newbury Park noticed that during one 
outdoor scene that was set in that state, a clearly visible sign in the 
background said: "Malibu Country Mart." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bradleyiana: Tom Bradley has been retired as mayor for more than a year but 
people are still naming things after him. There are more than a dozen sites 
now, compared to one for his predecessor, Sam Yorty. (That's Yorty Hall in the 
Convention Center.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, UCLA is planning another tribute -- a Tom Bradley International Center 
for Students and Scholars that will contain the memorabilia he amassed as our 
traveling mayor. We wonder if they'll have collections of the flight passes, 
airliner napkins and swizzle sticks he must have collected. 
</P>

 The heat has disoriented everyone: City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sent out 
notices informing her constituents that the city Bureau of Sanitation will make 
special calls to pick up bulky items that normal trash collection trucks 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But will they do it now, or next March? The notice was headlined: "Spring 
Cleaning Time!" LAny:

<P>
 The Walt Disney Co., hard-nosed in its business dealings, doesn't have a 
reputation for poking fun at itself. But there is such a scene in the Disney 
movie "Lion King," in which evil Scar asks a prisoner to sing for him. The 
inmate breaks into "It's a Small World," but Scar cuts him off. Echoing the 
words of parents who've heard that syrupy tune one too many times, the lion 
growls: "No, no, anything but that."

SCOTT HARRIS: A TIME TO SMELL THE FLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun has cooked the petals brown, and the branches could stand some 
pruning. But otherwise, Mario Ceremano's rosebushes appear strong and healthy. 
Mario was pleased to hear that, because there are few things he misses quite 
like his roses. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers are a comfort. One Saturday some years back, he had clipped dozens 
of roses and wasn't sure what to do with them. Then he read somewhere that 
singer Minnie Riperton was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park, also the 
final resting place of Marilyn Monroe. Mario admired Riperton's music, so he 
decided the flowers should be for her. This became a Saturday routine, 
delivering roses to Minnie Riperton, sitting for hours beside her marker. The 
roses were for Minnie, the ritual for Mario. It helped him come to terms with 
the knowledge that he had contracted HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensed vocational nurse, Mario understood that HIV might affect him in a 
variety of ways. Three years ago, he rubbed his right eye as if awakening from 
a nap, but the fog didn't clear. His vision grew darker day by day, month by 
month. A few weeks ago, he awakened, rose from bed and felt his way around the 
room. "I was blind. I had totally no vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Now his days are as dark as his nights, and the only time he can see is in his 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Look around you. Take it all in. There is beauty and ugliness and everything 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Now close your eyes and keep them closed. No peeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "When guests come over," Mario says, "I'm constantly telling people, 'Do you 
have enough light? Put on your glasses. Make sure you turn on the light.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He makes other prosaic recommendations: Take better care of yourself. Use a 
condom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario's blindness was caused by CMV retinitis, an affliction that occurs 
frequently in AIDS patients, often in the later stages of the illness. Mario's 
case is somewhat unusual, for apart from CMV, he seems to have dodged other 
afflictions common with AIDS, so far. 
</P>
<P>
 His sense of humor shows itself from time to time, but Mario's manner is glum, 
a distinct contrast to the plucky, upbeat types who gamely step to the fore in 
sad causes. Mario is nobody's poster boy. He's just trying to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the roses in his garden, the decor in his neat Sun Valley bungalow 
suggests someone who keenly appreciated the visual world. Photos of family, 
friends and former lovers are exhibited in the living room. In the dining room 
are two curiosities: an impressive collection of Betty Boop memorabilia, and a 
photographic shrine to actress Elizabeth Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 He collects Betty Boop, it seems, because he couldn't afford Limoges china. 
"My dream was to collect Limoges and then when I turned 40, I would open up a 
little antique store and sell it off." He'll be 40 in November.

 Why the fascination for Elizabeth Montgomery? "Oh, I don't know. It was 
something about that nose," he jokes, a reference to Montgomery's trademark 
twitch in the old sitcom "Bewitched." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just always been obsessed with her," he says, more serious now. "I just 
think she's beautiful and talented and I like these trashy movie roles she 
takes on TV."

 Mario had a chance to meet the actress a few years ago when she served as 
grand marshal for a gay pride parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked like we had known each other for years. She told me about her 
kids," he recalls. "She was just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario still speaks to her from time to time. She's a friend, he says.

 He grew up in the Valley, in Shadow Hills, and figured out he was gay while 
attending Polytechnic High School. In the '70s and early '80s, he frequented 
the gay discos in West Hollywood. There was casual sex and serious, long-term 
relationships. "I really don't have any regrets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What he misses most, he says, is his independence. He doesn't like to depend 
on others, though he is grateful for the help. He receives regular visits from 
a nurse, a maid and a gardener. Family and friends come by, and sometimes take 
him out to dine or shop. He is effusive in his praise for the Center for the 
Partially Sighted, a Santa Monica-based agency that has provided services, 
equipment and training to help him live as independently as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 But even when visitors come, darkness is a lonely place. "If people move 
around quietly, I always ask, 'Are you there?' " he says. "Being with a group 
of people, I feel the isolation." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes in God and says he is comfortable with dying. His visits with 
Minnie Riperton helped, he says. And this week, he visited Westwood Village 
Memorial Park once again, with his parents and sister this time, to make plans 
for his own burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll believe I'll go to a better place," he says. "I really do."

WILSON DELAYS MOTOR VOTER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's decision to hold up implementation of the "motor voter 
law," during an election year no less, is an outrage (Aug. 26). 
</P>
<P>
 If voter turnout in California was anything to brag about, Wilson might be 
justified in waiting for federal funds to implement the law. But, it's not. In 
truth, voter turnout in California is something of a national disgrace. We just 
held a primary in June with the lowest turnout in more than four decades. In 
this primary, only 6.2% of the eligible voters voted for Wilson and only 5.5% 
voted for Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a mandate, it's an embarrassment. With turnout so consistently low, 
we are quickly reaching the point where the very legitimacy of election results 
can and should be called into question. In deciding not to implement the "motor 
voter law," Wilson is risking the legitimacy of California government to make a 
political point with the feds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says he's looking out for the California taxpayer, but he may also be 
looking out for his political career. Who knows, if the "motor voter law" 
actually worked to boost registration and then turnout, the governor might be 
looking for a new job come January. Wilson won the 1990 gubernatorial election 
and the 1994 primary with low turnouts and may want to make sure turnout stays 
just as low in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, the lower the turnout the more likely it is for an 
incumbent to win reelection and the easier it is for high-priced political 
consultants -- the mercenaries of modern electoral democracy -- to manipulate 
the electorate to a favorable outcome. No elected official has any incentive to 
increase turnout for these very reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Wilson's latest effort at political self-preservation is both 
predictable and understandable, even if highly lamentable. Once again, the 
governor seems intent on sacrificing the long-term goal of enhanced legitimacy 
for the entire governing apparatus of the state to serve his short-term career 
interests.

FEDERAL ART FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "It's Curtains for Federal Arts Funding," Column Right, Aug. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 The case is made by Rep. Philip Crane (R-Ill.) that our Founding Fathers 
considered funding of the arts to be unwise.The congressman should note that 
our Founding Fathers also considered it unwise to give the vote to women, 
blacks and white trash (i.e., you middle-class beer-drinking Americans). Our 
Founding Fathers also concurred with the wisdom of allowing the practice of 
slavery.  
</P>
<P>
 Is this the great wisdom of our Founding Fathers to which Crane refers in 
making the case against funding for the National Endowment for the Arts?

WELFARE AND CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Frank Furstenberg's Column Left, Aug. 23: 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the retro-conservatives, such as Charles Murray, are 
determined to whip the character of the poor into shape by abolishing welfare. 
Since the retro-conservatives are so committed to such a notion of character 
development, why stop with the poor? Why not broaden the proposal to abolish 
welfare for the non-poor, a great deal of which is accomplished via tax 
deduction? Is it fair to deny to the non-poor this marvelous opportunity for 
character enhancement?

IF YOU WILL, MR. WILSON, SIGN RIGHT HERE; FOUR BILLS AMONG THE MANY BEFORE THE 
GOVERNOR STAND OUT AS WORTHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the arrival of recess in this year's session of the state Legislature, a 
number of bills are on Gov. Pete Wilson's desk to either be signed into law or 
vetoed. The following bills are but a few that merit becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2444. California's splendid 1,000-mile coastline requires protection from 
environmental hazards. AB 2444 seeks to help ensure that -- by banning 
indefinitely new offshore oil drilling in state waters, from Imperial Beach to 
the Oregon border. The measure, by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpenteria), 
would add to existing drilling prohibitions and would remove provisions that 
would allow drilling to resume in some areas as soon as next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his past stances opposing offshore drilling and limiting the development 
of oil wells in federal waters, it should be easy for Wilson to approve this 
bill. But the governor, seeking reelection, is also trying to keep business in 
California, and oil companies that have contributed to his campaigns oppose the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 On aesthetic grounds as well as on the basis of estimates that the amounts of 
oil to be gained are not worth the potential risks, AB 2444 should become law. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 3046. A series of articles published by The Times in 1990 documented 
widespread abuses in the garment industry, mostly by subcontractors who employ 
immigrant Latino or Asian women as seamstresses at below the minimum wage. In 
some especially egregious cases, so-called "stitch and ditch" operators 
absconded with newly sewn goods without even paying their employees. Due to 
budget cutbacks there are simply not enough state labor inspectors to crack 
down on all such violators. 
</P>
<P>
 This legislation, by Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte), would shift 
some responsibility for improving work conditions in the garment trade to the 
large manufacturers that keep the subcontractors in business. It is more 
narrowly written than earlier legislation that was opposed by the garment 
industry; it makes a manufacturer liable only if a subcontractor fails to pay 
his workers or does not pay the minimum wage or overtime. It is a reasonable 
compromise that could help eliminate any remaining sweatshops in California's 
garment trade, without putting an undue financial burden on an important 
manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 1333. This bill would require police to destroy confiscated guns. The 
practice by some local governments of allowing police departments to raise 
money by reselling firearms is dangerously irresponsible. Legislation by 
Assemblyman Mike Gotch (D-San Diego) would bar the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently police agencies are allowed to sell all legal weapons that are 
confiscated and keep the money. This bill would require police to destroy all 
weapons, except antiques, or use them for law enforcement. The legislation is 
eminently sensible. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 3335. Asians and Pacific Islanders account for 10% of California's 
population. But when the state Department of Finance last year issued a report 
about population projections, there was no category for Asians and Pacific 
Islanders. They were lumped into the "other," which was the fourth category, 
after whites, blacks and Hispanics. The Finance Department acknowledged that 
85% of the "others" were Californians of Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry.  
</P>
<P>
 To correct this oversight, the Legislature passed AB 3335, by Assemblymen 
Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) and Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard). The bill would 
require the Finance Department to present Asians and Pacific Islanders as a 
distinct category whenever the agency issues reports containing breakdowns or 
analyses based on race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 This fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States -- and California -- 
will have increasing impact and voice. It's just good public policy for the 
state to have basic information about Asians and Pacific Islanders.

 California, blessed with year-round good weather and a sunny attitude toward 
sports of all sorts, has been a cornucopia of memorable champions for all 
seasons. Last weekend, 18-year-old Tiger Woods of Cypress became the youngest 
winner ever of the prestigious U.S. Amateur Golf Championship, and he did so by 
making what was described as the greatest comeback in the history of the 
event.Woods made up a six-hole deficit in the 36-hole final to take the victory 
in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Add this son of a former Green Beret to the list of 
California legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who will enter Stanford University in the fall, already had achieved a 
great deal of notice. In his 1992 walk down "Hogan's Alley" -- Riviera Country 
Club -- he made a respectable showing in the Nissan Los Angeles Open as one of 
the youngest players ever to compete in a PGA Tour event. Even as a 16-year-old 
he had attracted an entourage of followers, who wondered just what great things 
might be ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has developed and continued to reveal championship nerve, and 
his victory last Sunday gave him the U.S. Amateur title when he was one year 
younger than Jack Nicklaus was when that legendary golfer won it at the ripe 
old age of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Amateur title may be no guarantee of future achievement in golf, but in 
an era of often unrealized expectations, it was refreshing indeed to see a 
determined young competitor overcome a deficit with flair and verve, and make 
good on a promise of greatness.

SINGLE-PAYER INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Sally C. Pipes' anti-government hysteria piece, "All Bow to the State 
Health Czar" (Commentary, Aug. 26), does not show any appreciation of the 
bureaucratic monstrosity that the private health insurance industry has wrought 
upon Californians, a truly honest analysis of Prop. 186 (the single-payer state 
health reform initiative) would identify how much of our current health care 
premiums are devoured by insurance company profits and ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
 If she believes that a health delivery system whereby the state, rather than 
insurance companies, channels money from our wallets to doctors and hospitals 
would reduce service or lower choice, she'd be wise to re-examine what we are 
getting for our money right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine -- a "patient's provider of choice will probably not really be the 
doctor of the patient's choosing but a primary care provider," she writes. 
Where has she been? Millions of us with adequate health coverage from our 
employers must use a primary care provider, who we are very fortunate to have. 
For this privilege, my HMO receives over 8% of my paycheck, much of it ending 
up in the insurance companies' political advertising against health reform of 
any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of focusing only on what a state single-payer system can't provide, 
people should think about what services their current coverage (if they have 
any) won't provide, and how much it's costing us today. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * "Getting a Jump on Health Care" (by Bill Zimmerman and Pacy Markman, 
Commentary, Aug. 24) presented a compelling argument for the passage of Prop. 
186. As a physician and a health care consumer, I heartily endorse this 
proposal. My only question is, why can't a single-payer plan be adopted on the 
national level? The obvious answer is that our spineless politicians are afraid 
to buck the multibillion-dollar insurance industry. Too bad for us! 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Since when has government control of anything saved money? If Zimmerman's 
and Markman's prattle about the vast savings to flow from eliminating private 
medical insurance in California under Prop. 186 were true, the Soviet Union 
should have been the richest country in the world since they did away with 
private everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The only things that socializing health insurance in California will do away 
with are our freedom to choose our doctors and the type of insurance plans we 
want, followed by our jobs, as businesses leave for neighboring states to 
escape the ruinous taxes that will need to be imposed to pay for this plan. 
</P>
<P>
 RON M. KAGAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The issue of socialized medicine notwithstanding, Zimmerman and Markman 
present a well-balanced view of Prop. 186 except for one substantial omission. 
The elected servants of this state have not demonstrated the ability, nor even 
the inclination, to run any program as designed, and certainly not with the 
public's best interest at the forefront. They've bankrupted the system; Prop. 
186 would only give them another cash cow to milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 186 is probably no better or worse than any other that we have, but 
before we throw good money after bad, let's have more responsible public 
servants in office, see that they are able to overcome personal greed, special 
interest groups and partisan politics, and then, maybe, let them have some new 
toys to play with.

SCHOOL METAL DETECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a disgrace that we need legislation to authorize the spending of $1 
million for the purchase of metal detectors to be placed in Los Angeles city 
schools (Aug. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 What has this country come to when children can walk around with guns? Who is 
responsible? Is it the parents, gun dealers, elected officials, the NRA, or is 
it all of us? 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we all need to take responsibility. However, I feel the National 
Rifle Assn. should run educational seminars for young people and their parents. 
The parents should also be held responsible when their child is found with a 
gun. Both parent and child should also be fined and do community service, such 
as in hospitals where they can see the damage of shootings, especially when 
done to other young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors should also teach and be role models against violence.  
</P>
<P>
 The parents of any child who is caught with a gun, whether after the detectors 
are installed or before, should be made to contribute monetarily to the 
installation of such metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a sad day when we have to live watching our backs and our 
children, and debate whether a law should be passed on owning guns. Have we 
become such a violent society that we have stopped caring about human life?

STOLEN PLUTONIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your otherwise admirable editorial on the menace of the trade in black 
market plutonium (Aug. 19), you state, "Even in the chilliest Cold War days, 
international civilian terrorism was one area in which East-West cooperation 
could usually be counted on." 
</P>
<P>
 I have to take issue with that.After all, the Czech communist government was 
one of the chief weapons suppliers to terrorists, from Libya to the IRA, 
besides providing medical treatment and rest and relaxation facilities for 
terrorists. The KGB surely knew of these activities, and did nothing to stop 
them. Indeed, the former Soviet Union itself was the site of various training 
schools for terrorists, including Palestinians and others. 
</P>
<P>
 On those occasions when the Soviets cooperated it was likely to be because 
Soviet nationals had been victims of terrorism in one form or another. But the 
general Soviet attitude was that terrorism served their interests, and they 
were hardly paragons of virtue in cooperating to bring international pressure 
on various terrorist groups.

PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA; GIVE UP TRYING TO BE PYGMALION; BOTH U.S. BUSINESS AND 
REFORMERS NEED TO REASSESS A NATION UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO FIT OUR MOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD CARREL, Todd Carrel, a journalist in residence at the East-West Center 
in Honolulu, is on leave from ABC News. He was the network's Beijing bureau 
chief from 1985-1992. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown may believe his trip to China has been 
a triumph in salesmanship that will net billions for American business. But it 
has surely left China's dictators smiling with the secure feeling that they can 
make more deals with "business first" Americans, tighten the screws on 
dissidents at home with impunity and go on the offensive against any Americans 
who insist that they respect the rights of their own citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many American views of China are colored by wishful thinking and greed. It 
is a result of a cultural habit of thinking; a combination of a missionary zeal 
to convert and a capitalist zeal to profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans like the notion that they can somehow pressure China to "be 
like us." We can't. As with so much, in dealing with China, there is a great 
gulf between being well-meaning and doing good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese know perfectly well who they are. There is no groundswell among 
them to be democratic in the mold of America. Experience with democracy is 
something they have never had. They don't know the taste of the rule of law, or 
fair play. Their system has not allowed that. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a groundswell among China's citizens to demand accountability from 
their government. But their government is aloof to these demands. China's 
Communist Party dictators form a thin class at the top of society. They are the 
lords, the feudal families who control most of the power and wealth. They also 
control most of the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 This ruling class is changing the currency of its power from private perks and 
privileges to money. They are cashing in. Some of their money goes into 
investments outside China, like homes in California, where they know it will be 
safe, and where they may someday flee. Much of the money is used to lubricate 
an internal system of corruption. No foreign investors will be immune from the 
siphoning effects of Chinese business. Some of the spoils of the new money game 
go to the branches of the vast security apparatus -- from riot police to border 
police to customs agents to municipal police to secret police. These police are 
the agents of repression and torture. These people run drugs and guns and 
contraband and brothels. They work fist in glove with emerging criminal 
syndicates. So the hooligans at the bottom of society, the ex-cons and 
street-hustlers, flourish along with their patrons -- the hard-core communists 
and their families.

 Caught in the vise of greed and plunder and official caprice is the vast 
majority of China's 1.2 billion people. Most are very poor and barely educated. 
They are accustomed to government repression and persecution, to struggling 
against their betters, to treachery and betrayal. They are also accustomed to 
working hard and using enterprise and perseverance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also are angry at being squeezed. So they rebel. They riot. They go on 
strike. They complain. They wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The most able turn to business. They make profits on the model of a Michael 
Milken. The best and the brightest run ahead of regulations and churn money 
through a system that is governed by insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little room and little opportunity for most of China's farmers 
and workers to prosper. So the least able remain busy and poor, or just idle. 
Often they lose their money when they stake it on pursuing new opportunities. 
Like many of the millions who ride the rails to the big coastal cities only to 
exhaust their savings and themselves in search of work, finding that too many 
others got there first. They return home broke, ashamed, dispirited to lives of 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the industrial workers. The communist state remains, but its 
promise of cradle-to-grave benefits is withering away. Many of those who are 
laid off fend for themselves. They are angry that egalitarian dreams have been 
taken away. Some long for the guarantees of the Maoist days. The laid-off woman 
who invested in stock and lost her money feels she had been abandoned twice -- 
once by the fading promises of socialism, again by flickering promise of the 
market. Those who have jobs often moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their problems, the Chinese remain proud and capable. They and their 
leaders will cobble together a new nationalism, which Westerners may not like. 
Across society, most Chinese are wary of what their propagandists dub "foreign 
hostile forces." Despite any photo-ops and embraces between officials and their 
so-called "old friends" from abroad, official xenophobia remains a cornerstone 
of China's internal governing ideology. The officials will protect their people 
from foreigners wishing to convert them. They also will protect them from 
plunder by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 China's growth statistics may lull many Americans into imagining that the 
nation is on a happy trajectory to riches. But the opposite is true. As China 
deconstructs from social and economic tensions within, as its arable land 
shrinks and pollution mounts, as its population increases, the nation may 
plunge into harsher times. If natural disaster hits or, political infighting 
turns to armed conflict, the specter of Rwanda could be reflected in pockets of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Chinese are ready to leave in search of economic and political 
opportunities. So far, few get out.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans might best start to think about China less as a country ripe for 
profit-taking and political conversion and more as one on the verge of a 
hemorrhage.

COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER: PUT CASTRO TO THE TEST: END EMBARGO; NIXON WAS 
RIGHT, OUR HARD LINE HAS FAILED; SO WHY DO WE PERSIST IN TRYING TO TOPPLE 
FIDEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "History will absolve me," claimed Fidel Castro while on trial as a student 
rebel 41 years ago when he first attempted to overthrow the U.S.-backed 
dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans will eventually decide whether Castro was right or wrong. But what 
about history's judgment of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 When Castro finally toppled the gangster-dominated Batista regime in 1959, it 
wasn't long before the tiny Caribbean island nation was swept up in the mad 
politics of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of the 1960 presidential election, candidate John Kennedy accused 
the Republican Administration of being soft on communism in our hemisphere. A 
strangling embargo was promptly placed on Cuba to ensure that Richard Nixon 
wouldn't suffer from such red-baiting charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, despite the fact that Havana was fast turning from a modern-day 
Sodom to a city a proper Republican could take his family to, the U.S. 
government was simultaneously launching a Keystone Cop carnival of 
assassination attempts on Castro. And, ironically, the CIA used the Mafiosi who 
had run Havana's powerful drug, prostitution and gambling cartels for these 
failed attempts at international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 We now know the full details of that sorry chapter, thanks to the release last 
year of the CIA's internal audit of its first seven years of plots to 
assassinate Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Mafia hit was initiated in August, 1960, two months before the 
embargo was put into place. At that time, the CIA report tells us, "Richard 
Bissell, deputy director for plans, asked Sheffield Edwards, director of 
security, if Edwards could establish contact with the U.S. gambling syndicate 
that was active in Cuba. The objective clearly was the assassination of Castro 
. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA gave an initial payment of $150,000 of taxpayer money to the mob to 
kill Castro with poisoned cigars, infected saccharine pills and explosives, 
always denying to Congress and the public that they were doing anything of the 
sort so as not to undermine the pristine sanctity of our democratic system. 
Ironically, Castro was quite popular at the time in Cuba, in part because he 
was able to break the Mafia's hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying all this was the infamous Bay of Pigs invasion ordered by Kennedy 
in April, 1961. And so, within two years of his takeover, we had driven Castro 
into utter dependence on the Soviets, setting up the Cuban missile crisis and a 
near-nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 35 years later, after agreeing to open trade with North Korea and 
Vietnam, after sending Ron Brown to frolic with American CEOs on the Great Wall 
and after watching the demise of Castro's backers in the Soviet Union, we 
continue our wrongheaded, counterproductive policy on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's not surprising that Clinton has held to the same retrograde policy 
as his predecessors -- Republicans and Democrats alike have kept up the 
harassment, not wanting to look weak or to lose the support of the powerful 
Cuba lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Robert Kennedy, who had made his reputation going after the mob as a 
congressional counsel. His outrage on being informed of the CIA/mob hit plans 
was surprisingly procedural rather than moral: "I trust that if you ever try to 
do business with organized crime again -- with gangsters -- you will let the 
attorney general know before you do it." Nothing was said about stopping the 
attempt to assassinate a head of state, and efforts to work with the mob 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA later seemed somewhat embarrassed by this adventurism. As the report 
states: "We cannot overemphasize the extent to which responsible agency 
officers felt themselves subject to the Kennedy Administration's severe 
pressures to do something about Castro and his regime. The fruitless, and in 
retrospect, often unrealistic plotting should be viewed in that light." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, should all other aspects of the three-decades-plus effort to topple 
Castro. Why not put Castro to a test he has never had to face -- the threat of 
open trade and travel? Those are the tactics that helped bring down the Soviet 
Union; why not try it 90 miles from home? 
</P>
<P>
 In a book published at the time of his death, Richard Nixon offered advice on 
the handling of Castro that President Clinton should take seriously: "The hard 
line against him has failed . . . our best service to the Cuban people now 
would be to build pressure from within by actively stimulating Cuba's contacts 
with the free world."

COLUMN RIGHT/ ARAM BAKSHIAN JR.: ANTI-SMOKING ZEALOTS ARE THE REAL THREAT; 
SMOKERS MAY BE ANNOYING, BUT THEY DON'T WARRANT A REPLAY OF PROHIBITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARAM BAKSHIAN Jr., Aram Bakshian Jr. served as an aide to Presidents Nixon, 
Ford and Reagan.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you smoke or not, aren't there times when the sheer arrogance of the 
anti-smoking zealots gets to you? My turning point came some years back at a 
New Year's Eve party in Georgetown. There I was, standing in the corner of a 
high-ceilinged drawing room watching several well-heeled hemp-heads pass around 
a joint. While I don't believe in better living through chemistry, I do believe 
in minding my own business, so I said nothing. I did, however, decide to smoke 
a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, was that a mistake. Just as match touched Macunado, an enraged harridan, 
still bleary-eyed from her last drag of controlled substance, snarled, "You 
don't think we're going to let you smoke that thing in here, do you?" She was 
breaking the law, not me -- and it wasn't even her house. Yet she was coming on 
like a cross between Carrie Nation and a puff adder on Benzedrine. 
</P>
<P>
 How reminiscent of the style and strategy of that famous pioneer anti-smoker, 
A. Hitler, late of Berchtesgaden. In "Mein Kampf," he reminded aspiring fellow 
social engineers that "strength lies not in defense but in attack." 
Anti-smokers have been getting more offensive ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider "passive smoking." In the early 1990s, the Environmental Protection 
Agency found that, using its established risk standards, it could not link 
passive smoking to statistically credible health risks. What happened? Instead 
of admitting that it had lost fair and square, the EPA changed the rules to get 
the results it wanted, adopting blatantly skewed standards. As one anonymous 
senior public-health researcher confessed in a 1992 article in "Toxic 
Pathology": "Yes, it's rotten science, but it's in a worthy cause. It will help 
us get rid of cigarettes and become a smoke-free society." 
</P>
<P>
 This past June, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler 
engaged in a similar act of deception before the House subcommittee on health 
and the environment when he claimed to have uncovered a sinister plot on the 
part of the tobacco industry -- specifically the Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp. -- to raise nicotine consumption by developing a new, secret "Y-1" hybrid 
tobacco leaf in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds very ominous, but it turns out that the primary reason for the Y-1 
research was to develop a lower-tar, not higher-nicotine, leaf. In addition, 
far from being a sinister "secret," Y-1 research was well-known to several 
federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, which had actually 
developed the tobacco-breeding line that became Y-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking may not be a nice habit. It may be dumb and it may be annoying. So are 
nose-picking, humming off-key, failure to use a deodorant and voluntary public 
flatulence. Smoking can be unhealthy for the person who does it. So can wolfing 
down vast amounts of low-class, high-cholesterol junk food of the kind beloved 
by our non-inhaling commander in chief. But there is no conclusive evidence 
that "passive" smoke poses a scientifically demonstrable health hazard to 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibition was the most disastrous social experiment the United States ever 
indulged in; it was also the most politically correct one by the standards of 
the time. It was pushed through -- step by step, year by year, culminating in 
national prohibition of alcoholic beverages in 1920 -- because, in the words of 
a popular writer of the day, George Ade: "The nondrinkers had been organizing 
for 50 years and the drinkers had no organization whatever. They had been too 
busy drinking." Never again. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the usually interventionist New York Times has sounded a skeptical note 
about the FDA's claim that it has no intention of banning cigarettes. "It gets 
tricky," we read in the July 2 issue, "because if the FDA declares nicotine an 
addictive drug -- the almost inevitable next turn in this fast-moving plot -- 
the legal wheels start turning in auto pilot: If it's a drug, the FDA must 
declare it safe, which is impossible . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing America needs is yet another piece of Catch-22 interference 
from the federal social police. Do me a favor, Uncle Sam. Get off my back and 
out of my lungs. And -- if that's what they want to do -- let my people smoke.

 "God is dead," Nietzsche wrote 100 years ago. The profound import of this 
simple and yet deeply disturbing statement lies in its repeated 
demonstrability. Nietzsche may have killed God, but we in the late 20th Century 
have buried him 6 feet under without any hope of resurrection. God's death is 
no longer a metaphysical possibility, but rather the reality of our age, when 
science and technology have become our defining teleology. 
</P>
<P>
 God is no longer an animating force in our hearts. He is obsolete. We the 
moderns with all of our sophistication have no need for him. Today, in our 
world of computers and fax machines, God has become an anachronism. We no 
longer need God to answer the worn-out interrogatives of our existence, of our 
place in the universe; we have hope and faith in quantum mechanics and the 
unifying theory. We no longer need God to intervene on our behalf; we have 
sophisticated technology. We no longer need God to console and comfort us; we 
have modern psychology. We no longer need to pray and worship God; we have 
other creations for that. We no longer fear God; we have laser-guided nuclear 
bombs that can do far more damage than a 40-day flood. 
</P>
<P>
 The objects of our faith today are science and technology. We have faith in 
our cars, we have faith in the surgeon's hands, we have faith in probability. 
The Kierkegaardian leap is no longer meaningful. Ours is a different kind of 
leap; a leap that embraces the world. We the moderns of the late-20th Century 
accept without question the fruits of science; we accept without question the 
inevitability of our own progress. The old walls that separated the sacred from 
the profane are crumbling.  
</P>
<P>
 There are some who naively cling to the nostalgic memory of God. The average 
churchgoer takes a few hours out of the week to experience the sacred; to 
experience God. But the rest of the time, he is immersed in a society that no 
longer acknowledges God as an omniscient and omnipotent force to be loved and 
worshiped. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this person, who continues to accept God as his savior, is a willing 
participant in the very society responsible for killing God. This person may 
accept certain scientific conclusions that directly contradict what she hears 
every Sunday. He may seek the services of a psychologist to adjust his 
emotional state. She may drive a car, use a phone, work on a computer, watch 
television. The only problem is that his everyday world is devoid of God. In 
time past, God was not only a living force in people's hearts, but also part of 
our everyday world. We were not just reminded of him on Sunday, we breathed him 
in the air. God was part of our language, part of our life. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we are too sophisticated for God. We can stand on our own; we are 
prepared and ready to choose and define our own existence. Nietzsche did not 
proclaim the death of God with eager delight; he uttered the words with 
profound anguish and despair. Today, the second death of God is accepted as a 
matter of fact. But only fools could believe that we can stand alone in a 
universe that is the result of blind chance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 20th Century, human beings are reduced to numbers. It is an age of 
fleeting images and instant information, of self-help cults and pop psychology, 
of loneliness and existential Angst. This is what we have to accept as the 
price for our final sin against God. The death of God means that we have to 
confront the absurdity of our own existence head-on. Science has unveiled all 
our mystery, dissected us under a microscope and left us to live our lives in 
naked isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 God, with all his theoretical complications, gave us morality, decency and 
hope. He gave us something permanent to hold on to. We used to find shelter and 
meaning in God. Today, we find meaning and shelter in physical sensation; we 
escape our lives through television, the movies, music, sex and drugs. We seem 
to need more and different sensations to feel anything at all. We have killed 
God, all of us together. Our hands are stained with the blood of our father. 
May he rest in peace.

OBITUARIES; MICHAEL PETERS; HELPED CREATE MICHAEL JACKSON VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Peters, director, choreographer and dancer who helped Michael Jackson 
create his top-selling videos "Beat It" and "Thriller" and was often referred 
to as the "Balanchine of MTV," has died. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters died Saturday in Los Angeles of complications of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered a pioneer in the music video industry, Peters won American Video 
and MTV awards for each of the Jackson productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The versatile Peters also won a Tony award for choreographing the Broadway 
musical "Dreamgirls," and two Emmy awards for designing the dancing for the 
television specials "Liberty Weekend Closing Ceremonies" and "The Jacksons: An 
American Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 His bold state-of-the-art choreographic style focused on sounds of instruments 
rather than counting out steps, which is usually done in classical ballet or 
modern dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you dance by the numbers," he once said, "you extract all emotions and 
sterilize the movement. You remove the dance from its inspiration, which is the 
music. What I love is the capability of a body to be free in the sense of 
street or social dancing and, at the same time, do something that is 
technically hard and tremendously disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters often appeared in his own productions -- notably as the white-suited, 
switchblade-wielding gang leader in Jackson's "Beat It." 
</P>
<P>
 He also directed music videos for Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, Billy Joel, 
Earth, Wind and Fire and the Jacksons. 
</P>
<P>
 Films showcasing the Peters dance magic include "Sister Act II," "What's Love 
Got to Do With It?" "Sarafina" and "The Mambo Kings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn-born Peters was placed in classes for gifted children because of 
his high IQ. But he disliked school and grew bored easily, so he failed to 
graduate after spending four years at New York's High School of Performing 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 He found himself by learning to dance at the Bernice Johnson Cultural Arts 
Center in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters is survived by his mother, Rebecka Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled at 4:15 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 17, at the 
Performing Arts Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to AIDS Project Los 
Angeles.

 Earl V. Pullias, a former dean at Pepperdine College and professor at USC who 
served three terms as president of the Los Angeles County Board of Education, 
has died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullias died of a cerebral hemorrhage at his Los Angeles home Aug. 20, USC 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on higher education, Pullias wrote several books. The most popular 
was "A Teacher Is Many Things," which was translated into nine languages. His 
other books included "A Search for Understanding," "Toward Excellence in 
College Teaching" and "A Common Sense Philosophy for Modern Man: A Search for 
Fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
 Pullias earned his bachelor's degree from Cumberland University in his native 
Tennessee, a master's degree from the University of Chicago and a doctorate 
from Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to Los Angeles in 1940, he began teaching at USC as a visiting 
professor while serving as dean of faculty at Pepperdine College. After 17 
years at Pepperdine, he switched permanently to USC, teaching there from 1957 
until his retirement in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullias was a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Education from 1954 to 
1977 and served as president from 1956 to 1957, 1962 to 1963 and 1967 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sat on the California Commission on Higher Education from 1960 to 1966 
and was chairman from 1963 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pullias Lectureship, established in his honor in 1978, annually brings a 
nationally recognized scholar to USC for an academic dialogue on education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Pullias cared more about teaching and learning than anyone I've ever 
met," said Tom Garrison, a former student and the current chairman of the 
lectureship committee. "He was genuinely interested in each and every one of 
his students, and we all knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pullias is survived by a son, Calvin. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial donations can be sent to the Pullias Lectureship Fund, USC School of 
Education, WPH 1103, Los Angeles 90089-0031.

 The Harbor Board awarded a $65-million contract Monday to construct the 
nation's largest container wharf on Terminal Island's Pier 300. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle-based General-Kiewit will build the 226-acre terminal and 28 acres of 
rail facilities at Berths 302 to 305. 
</P>
<P>
 The new wharf, expected to be completed in January, 1997, will house the 
operations of Eagle Marine Services Ltd., a subsidiary of American President 
Lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The port estimates that nearly 700 direct and indirect jobs will be created 
during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Port spokeswoman Barbara Yamamoto said American President Lines has signed a 
30-year lease, agreeing to return $21 million to $25 million a year to the 
port. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the company's expanded cargo handling is expected to generate more 
than 10,500 jobs with $335 million in wages and annual industry sales of $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 American President Lines is the leading U.S. container line, providing 
transportation to North America, Asia and the Middle East. SUSAN WOODWARD

 Local citizens have made it a little easier for the Police Department to 
purchase a new police dog, which could cost up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's City Council meeting, the city received a check for more than 
$6,600, and was told that an additional $1,600 has been pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are still searching for a dog, which must perform 
duties ranging from meeting the public to sniffing for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the job is public relations," said Lt. Ed Jaakola, pointing out that 
police dogs frequently visit area schoolchildren. The department's previous 
canine, Bandit, was put to sleep in July after failing to fully recover from 
surgery. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: PORT OF LOS ANGELES; BOATERS MUST AVOID PIER CONSTRUCTION AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boaters will have to steer clear of portions of the Port of Los Angeles during 
construction of a major pier during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors will begin work on the port's Pier 300/400 project Tuesday.With 
the development of three miles of new navigation channels, a turning basin, and 
5,000 linear feet of berths, it is the largest dredging and landfill project 
that has been undertaken in the nation, said port spokeswoman Barbara Yamamoto. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs on 14 steel platforms will mark safety zones and areas to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters must stay out of these areas because of submerged rocks, pipelines, 
barges, tug boats, buoys and platforms, Yamamoto said. And floating equipment 
attached to barges will have steel anchor wires stretching above, along and 
under the water for up to 1,500 feet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers notifying boaters of potential dangers associated with the project are 
being distributed from Marina del Rey to Newport Beach.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL SEGUNDO; POLICE RELEASE SKETCH OF RAPE, ROBBERY SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Segundo police have released a sketch of an acne-scarred man suspected of 
raping a Danish tourist and robbing three businesses Aug. 21 during a 
late-night crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses and the 20-year-old rape victim provided police with a description 
of the suspect, a black man in his late 20s or early 30s who is 5 feet, 9 
inches tall, with short, dark hair, a light mustache and a gold earring in his 
left ear. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who was touring the country with a friend, was dragged from the 
Hacienda Hotel at 525 N. Sepulveda Blvd. by a gunman who had just robbed a 
sandwich shop and a copy shop in a mini-mall across the street, said El Segundo 
Police Sgt. Glenn Coles.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, entered the hotel about 12:40 
a.m., demanded money, and ordered hotel employees and patrons to lie on the 
floor. He collected $700 and dragged the woman out a back door. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was forced into a sedan with a waiting driver and raped twice during 
a two-hour drive through South Bay streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described the car as a metallic-painted, four-door sedan with a 
dark, vinyl top and thin whitewall tires with spoke or wire rims. Anyone with 
information may call the El Segundo Police Department at (310) 322-9114, Ext. 
261. JAMES BENNING

COMING HOME; NEW INGLEWOOD SUPERINTENDENT IS BACK IN SCHOOL TO TACKLE CHALLENGE 
OF REVIVING DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a long road home for McKinley Nash, the new superintendent of the 
Inglewood Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash did not grow up in Inglewood. He still has to ask directions to get 
around. But in his heart, he says, all ethnic communities are related, all are 
siblings parented by struggle and promise. So when Nash speaks of having 
returned "home," which he often does, he is referring to Inglewood, the African 
American and Latino community.  
</P>
<P>
 After four years away from public schools, working as an executive for the 
Assn. of California School Administrators, Nash has returned to school board 
politics, union negotiations and student test scores because of his broad 
definition of home and community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood school system, although it has some outstanding schools, also 
has ones with the lowest test scores in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so painful to me," Nash said. "We have failed to protect our children. 
The failure of our children to achieve has to be attributed to the failure of 
black adults to nurture and protect our children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may get in trouble for saying it, but I'm going to say it. Because there's 
nothing wrong with our children," Nash said. "We, the adults, have failed 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash says he needs to find more money for the schools, create magnet programs 
and specialized curricula to keep Inglewood's best students from leaving the 
district, improve morale among teachers and principals and turn around the 
city's bilingual education program. 
</P>
<P>
 But he believes the district has everything it needs to excel. The only 
question remaining, he said, is whether he is the one to lead it to excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, who at 61 is near the end of his career, was raised in a nurturing 
Louisiana community, where teachers and family pushed him to achieve. He earned 
a bachelor of science degree at the University of Arkansas, a master's degree 
at Oklahoma State University and his doctorate at the University of Illinois. 
He left there to become principal and later deputy superintendent in Evanston, 
Ill., where he gained fame as a man who could improve student test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 A report in 1987 found that as a group, black students in the suburban 
Evanston Township School District had lower test scores than those in the 
Chicago schools, a district notorious for its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash targeted a group of students, both black and white, of high intelligence 
but average grades and moved them from their easier classes to an honors track. 
Evanston Township's scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test soared. 
</P>
<P>
 From there he went to Centinela Valley Union High School District in Lawndale, 
also as superintendent, where his methods of reform and style of administration 
-- so successful in Evanston -- caused a civil war. New programs and sweeping 
changes led to rebellion by some teachers and parents. The district was divided 
between those who loved Nash and those who hated him, and students walked out 
of school in support of Nash. The board fired him shortly afterward, accusing 
him of having orchestrated the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash sued the district and ultimately won a settlement, as did several other 
African American staff members and teachers in Centinela Valley, who charged 
the board with racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has again taken on an urban school district that will need a complete 
overhaul to achieve excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 The job before Nash is to provide a decent education for all students in 
Inglewood.  
</P>
<P>
 Immediate attention must be paid to bilingual education. A recent report by 
the state Department of Education found that the district has kept poor records 
and that it does not have enough books, materials or teachers for students who 
do not speak English. The 15,000-student district has about 5,418 bilingual 
students and needs 112 certified teachers, but last year had only 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash will need more money. It is not possible to educate students spending an 
average of $3,100 apiece, he said. But he's not worried about finding it. 
Ferreting out private sources of money has been one of Nash's successes in all 
past positions, including Centinela Valley. There, he worked with El Camino 
College and Toyota to begin a program in which students would work closely with 
Toyota professionals and, if they made good grades, Toyota would pay for them 
to go to college. After graduation, students would have a job waiting at 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 Some immediate financial resources for the Inglewood district are apparent, he 
said. It has acres of land that he said could be sold or developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Lois Hill Hale said the board is discussing the idea with city 
officials, who want to purchase some land, but selling off school land is not 
an idea that she supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 acres around Morningside High School, Hill Hale said, could just as 
well be used for an entire education complex and athletic center, rather than 
city buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill Hale, however, said she has promised Nash she will keep an open mind 
about his proposals and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our part of the bargain is to make sure when he introduces ideas that will 
help to change the whole educational process, that we support him in it," she 
said. "We want to give him full rein with moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top on Nash's agenda is a scrutiny of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
non-classroom expenses in the school budget. He had a list drawn up of all 
programs that are funded by the district, and already has pinpointed between $2 
million and $3 million that is not being spent directly on education. Included 
on the list is Inglewood's 13-member school police department, which has a 
budget of $1.2 million; transportation and security for high school athletics 
programs, $78,415; junior ROTC at Inglewood and Morningside high schools, after 
projected reimbursement from the Army, $94,673. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that we need to get rid of all those programs or departments," 
Nash said. "Some of those provide very necessary services to our students. I'm 
only saying that we'll have to find other ways to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fund raising, private grants and money from the federal crime bill, Nash 
hopes, will help pay for some of the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants the city to designate 25% of the money it receives from the new 
Hollywood Park Casino for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Edward Vincent, who was handed a payment of $326,000 from the card club 
last month, vowed to help Nash get all the money he needs, but without tapping 
into Hollywood Park revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 As important as finding money for the schools will be Nash's ability to 
navigate the politics of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Philosophical divisions and even outright hostility among the administration, 
board members, the teachers' union and parents means that past superintendents 
have spent as much time on back room politics as they have on education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every superintendent's job has a lot to do with politics," said 
Kenneth Moffett, superintendent of Lennox School District and former assistant 
superintendent in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the power structures differ in minority communities," Moffett said. In 
towns like Inglewood, he said, people with respect and influence in the 
community may not have job titles that would enable newcomers to recognize they 
are powerbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is confident that Nash can manage the schools and maintain good 
relationships with them and the staff.  
</P>
<P>
 "My reasons for selecting Dr. Nash over the other candidates is because of his 
tremendous success record in running school districts," Hill Hale said. "And 
because of his strong fiscal background. He knows how to expend funds so they 
go toward educating students." 
</P>
<P>
 Academically, Inglewood must offer a new kind of education if it is to stem 
the flow of students leaving the district. About 20% of the district's students 
leave Inglewood between middle school and high school, graduating from schools 
in Culver City, Beverly Hills and Westchester, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood already has a broad curriculum. It is one of a few public school 
districts in the South Bay to offer Latin as well as all Romance languages, 
performance art classes and commercial art studies. It also has a rigorous 
science program. 
</P>
<P>
 What it does not have, however, are courses geared to preparing students for 
jobs as well as college. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating magnet schools is a top priority for Nash, and ultimately he hopes 
Inglewood will have schools specializing in the disciplines of health, math, 
science, computers, foreign languages and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nash inherits some gifts as well as tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the district's schools are among the best in the area, particularly at 
the elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at Bennett-Kew Elementary School, fourth-graders scored higher 
than the state average, the county average and schools in the same economic 
bracket on the recent California Learning Assessment System test. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kelso Elementary School, student scores on the CLAS tests were comparable 
to those of students in Manhattan Beach and on par with or better than some 
Torrance schools. 
</P>
<P>
 By middle school, however, the divide between Inglewood test scores and those 
of neighboring districts widens, as some of the top students leave to go to 
other school districts, and by high school, its test scores consistently are 
among the lowest in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the morale problem. Inglewood's teacher salaries lag about 
$2,000 annually behind those in other districts.  
</P>
<P>
 And the relationship between teachers and former school Supt. George McKenna 
was hostile and combative. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems in Inglewood are ones that can be overcome if the community 
is dedicated to doing so, Nash said. It is a philosophy he learned from his 
time as the head of Evanston Township High School, when he could not be praised 
enough, and during his difficulties as superintendent in Centinela Valley from 
1983 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 His Centinela critics -- a mix of teachers, board members and some parents -- 
charged that Nash was dictatorial in his efforts to bring math reform to the 
school district and that he had unrealistic expectations of teachers and 
students. Nash concedes that the experience taught him to be more diplomatic 
and sensitive.  
</P>
<P>
 After Centinela fired him, Nash sued and the district later paid $150,000 to 
settle his claim, as well as two lawsuits that stemmed from a dispute over his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately Centinela also paid $425,000 to former Hawthorne High School 
Principal Kenneth Crowe, now principal of Inglewood High School, and $75,000 to 
another former district employee. Thousands of dollars in other settlements 
were also paid to staff members who sued the district for racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations by the U.S. Justice Department in 1992 and several state 
agencies found Centinela Valley to maintain "a racially hostile environment" 
for everyone -- administrators, teachers, students and aides. 
</P>
<P>
 In Centinela Valley circles, Nash is either revered or reviled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought state and national recognition for the programs he brought into 
the district. Now we've lost a lot of people Dr. Nash brought in," said 
Lawndale City Councilwoman Virginia Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, our loss is Inglewood's gain," Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill Hale said the Inglewood board was not concerned that Nash had been fired 
by Centinela. 
</P>
<P>
 "Centinela Valley was unfair and unjust and pure discrimination," she said. 
"The U.S. Justice Department proved that in its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash does not dwell on his troubles in Centinela Valley, but said he takes the 
lesson he learned there to heart. He said he will take the time to inform, 
nurture and prepare the community for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He began his tenure in Inglewood by meeting with dozens of community leaders 
and parent groups. And, every Saturday, Nash has asked three or four principals 
to give him a private tour of their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe Elementary school was one of the first schools Nash visited. Principal 
Kevin Butler whipped from room to room, showing Nash every ceiling leak, broken 
air conditioning vent, ruptured fence and unpainted surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash was dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, never ask a principal what they want," he muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an unprecedented opportunity," Butler said. "To have the 
superintendent in a one-on-one situation where you can show exactly what you do 
and what you need." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday school tours generally end about 5 p.m., when Nash heads home. 
</P>
<P>
 Home is a spacious house in Palos Verdes Estates, located a couple of blocks 
from the water. The house, Nash's retreat from the rough and tumble of 
education politics, is filled with pictures of his four grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 An intense man, Nash rises daily at 5:30 a.m. and works out on a treadmill. 
Once he gets off the machine, his day is consumed with his work, which, he 
said, is also his fun. A productive board meeting, for example, can leave him 
awake until 2 or 3 in the morning because he is too excited to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 His free time is devoted to cultivating roses and plum trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he puts in long hours every day, he says that he no longer cares 
about blazing a career path. 
</P>
<P>
 But one job remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, when I took this job, a reporter asked me: 'Why would you go to 
Inglewood? It made me so mad I could hardly think," Nash said. "It . . . 
implies that the Inglewoods and Comptons and Oaklands should be written off. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, what we're talking about is the perception many people hold about 
African Americans' ability to govern," Nash said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the schools do improve, Nash said, it will be to the credit of the entire 
community. If they do not, then he wasn't right for the job and the failure 
will be his alone, Nash said. He says it often. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if God could grant me all of my wishes, I would wish he'd give me the 
ability to make a difference in a place like Inglewood," Nash said. "I am a 
child of a place like Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it is my duty, win or lose, to come back and try."

2 SCHOOLS TO JOIN ANTI-BIAS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To ease racial tension, school officials in Inglewood have enlisted the help 
of the U.S. Department of Justice to start a conflict-resolution program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called Student Problem Identifying and Resolving It Together, or 
SPIRIT, will begin this fall at Inglewood and Morningside high schools.It is 
aimed at getting students to talk about problems before they resort to 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say community leaders, including local police, leaders of 
youth groups and clergy, will learn a six-step method for solving problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Those leaders work with school administrators and student representatives from 
the ethnic groups on campus to determine problems and solve them, Supt. 
McKinley Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are initially separated by ethnic group to allow them to freely 
discuss problems, racial and other. Once the problems are identified, all the 
groups meet to discuss their findings, said Stephen N. Thom, a Justice 
Department meditator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many students find the racial divide ends, and that they share common 
problems," Thom said. 
</P>
<P>
 How those problems are solved is left up to administrators and students at 
each school. Some options include a peer mediation team and a student advisory 
panel that meets with district and community leaders throughout the semester, 
Thom said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 Western schools participate in the program. Leuzinger High School 
in Hawthorne took part in a similar Justice Department program last year after 
a number of fights between Latinos and blacks. JON GARCIA

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY; NEW IDENTITY, SAME SOUL

<P>
 "I was on the outside looking in," says Bill McCreary, owner of the M & W Soul 
Food Restaurant in Gardena. He literally was. As the owner of a cleaning 
business, twice a month he would be outside what was then named the M & M, 
washing the windows and looking in at people enjoying Mississippi-style 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the manager told McCreary that the company was not going to renew the 
lease (there's still an M & M Restaurant in Gardena, though, and other branches 
in Carson, Inglewood and South-Central Los Angeles). McCreary stepped in and 
took the place over. Now McCreary, who used to get $25 a month to clean the 
place, is signing the paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Renamed M & W (the W representing McCreary's late partner, Ralph Williams), 
the restaurant opened in May with new booths, paint and lighting. However, 
customers of the old M & M will be glad to know little has changed in terms of 
personnel. Chef Joan Martin, for instance, started at the original M & M at 
95th Street and Avalon Boulevard 18 years ago. The most popular item here is 
the short rib dinner ($9.99), beef short ribs baked for 2 1/2 hours and awash 
in gravy. Diners can select any three from a list of 13 side dishes; a popular 
choice is dressing, macaroni and cheese and candied yams.  
</P>
<P>
 Fried chicken ($6.99) is available three ways: all white meat, all dark, or 
mixed ($1 extra). Another favorite is the fried catfish and red snapper 
($9.99), which can be ordered baked or broiled. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate its reopening, the restaurant will be open for 24 hours on Sept. 
9, 10 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * M & W is at 2222 Rosecrans Ave., Gardena. (310) 323-0417. Open Sunday 
through Thursday 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

 Mira Costa High three-sport standout Phil Fonua, who suffered a ruptured brain 
aneurysm Aug. 10, will be released Friday from Daniel Freeman Hospital in 
Inglewood and allowed to go home, his case worker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua has been undergoing physical, occupational and speech-cognitive therapy 
at the hospital's rehabilitation center since Aug. 23 after being transferred 
from Torrance Memorial Medical Center, where he underwent surgery Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Levy, senior case manager for brain injury at Daniel Freeman, said 
Fonua will continue a comprehensive program of therapy as an out-patient at the 
hospital. She said the Mira Costa senior is not ready to return to school and 
will have to miss the first day of classes Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has some problems that affect his learning," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy said Fonua has made outstanding progress considering the seriousness of 
his injury and should be able to return to school in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, in a Times' story last week, said Fonua must refrain from athletic 
activity in his senior year. The 6-foot-2, 275-pound Fonua is regarded as one 
of the top prep defensive lineman in the country, in addition to being a 
standout basketball player and shotputter.

 Loyola Marymount, expected to have one of its strongest teams ever, opens the 
women's volleyball season at 7 tonight at Gersten Pavilion with a nonconference 
match against third-ranked and defending national champion Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola, ranked 23rd, returns all six starters from last season's 23-7 team 
that finished second in the West Coast Conference. Standouts include junior 
middle blockers Mardell Wrensch and Julie Greer, both WCC first-team selections 
last season; sophomore hitters Kim Blankinship (Torrance High) and Suzanne 
Radcliffe (Torrance), the 1993 WCC freshman of the year; and senior setter 
Robin Ortgiesen (Mira Costa). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about the possibilities of our program with our fourth 
recruiting class now in place," said Coach Steve Stratos, starting his fifth 
season at Loyola. "We possess an extremely balanced attack from both the middle 
and outside." 
</P>
<P>
 WCC coaches, in a close vote, picked Loyola to finish second behind San Diego 
in a poll released Monday. The two teams split the eight first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola has a tough opening week. After playing Long Beach State, which returns 
four starters from a 32-2 squad, the Lions meet 15th-ranked USC at 5:30 p.m. 
Saturday at Long Beach State's Gold Mine gym. 
</P>

<P>
 Carl Strong, who stepped down as Harbor College basketball coach last month, 
was hired Monday as an assistant at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong will join assistants Bob Mandeville and Marty Wilson under new 
Pepperdine Coach Tony Fuller. Before coaching at Harbor, Strong was an 
assistant at Loyola Marymount and El Camino College and coach at Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former Peninsula High pitcher Brian Bowles, a 50th-round draft choice of the 
Toronto Blue Jays in June, signed a contract with the major league club last 
week. That came as bad news to Long Beach State, which had signed Bowles to a 
baseball scholarship. Bowles, a 6-foot-4 right-hander, was the Bay League Most 
Valuable Player and an All-Southern Section Division I selection for Peninsula 
last season, posting an 8-3 record and 1.13 earned-run average, with 96 
strikeouts in 68 innings. He will report to the Blue Jays' rookie league team 
in Dunedin, Fla., in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Torrance High and Harbor College baseball standout Kevin Higgins and a 
teammate each played all nine positions for the Las Vegas Stars in a Pacific 
Coast League game Aug. 25 in Las Vegas. Higgins, normally a catcher and second 
baseman, and Keith Lockhart became the second tandem of triple-A players to 
play nine positions in a game. Tommy Shields and Shane Turner did it playing 
for the Rochester Red Wings in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Loyola Marymount basketball standout Terrell Lowery, an outfielder in 
the Texas Ranger organization, hit two home runs Monday for the double A Tulsa 
Drillers in a 6-3 Texas League victory over Jackson, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola Marymount women's soccer team will begin its second season and 
first under Coach Jim Millinder when the Lions play host to UCLA at 2 p.m. 
Saturday. Millinder, a former professional player who was a standout at North 
Torrance High and El Camino College, will be assisted by Kit Schwartzman, who 
coached Bishop Montgomery to the Southern Section Division II girls' title last 
season. Millinder previously coached the men's and women's soccer teams at El 
Camino. . . . The Loyola men's soccer team will play host to UC Davis at 2 p.m. 
Sunday in a season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the nation's top youth basketball players will converge in the South 
Bay this weekend for the third annual Labor Day Classic tournament. Games begin 
at 5 p.m. Friday at El Segundo High and continue Saturday starting at 9 a.m. 
and Sunday starting at 11 a.m. at El Segundo, Torrance and West Torrance high 
schools. Championship games will be played from 10:45 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday 
at El Segundo. The tournament is expected to draw 56 all-star teams. Boys' 
divisions are 10-and-under through 14-and-under, and girls will compete in 
14-and-under.

LAND USE; HEARING RESCHEDULED ON BLUFFS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing on a plan to protect the Westchester-Playa del Rey bluffs by 
regulating land use in the area has been rescheduled to Sept. 13 at 1 p.m. in 
the Los Angeles City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bluffs are habitat for such sensitive species as the burrowing owl and 
site of one of the last strips of coastal sage in the area.The plan would 
regulate development along the cliffs that act as a buffer between residential 
areas and the Ballona Wetlands.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan was drafted in 1988 by the city after residents and city planners 
became alarmed by the spread of palatial homes atop a three-mile bluff that 
runs from Westchester to Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics alleged that some single-family mansions topped 8,000 square feet and 
sold for at least $1 million, clashing with the smaller residential tracts in 
the community and posing potential environmental problems for the wetlands 
below because of water runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Bluffs Specific Plan was designed to ensure public access to the 
coast, control bluff erosion, preserve ocean and Los Angeles skyline views and 
reduce the effects of grading. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents have complained that the plan is too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council members -- Hal Bernson, Laura Chick and Richard Alatorre -- who 
comprise the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, will conduct the 
hearing on the proposal and send a recommendation to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was originally scheduled for presentation before the committee 
Tuesday but minor changes had to be made after a community meeting on the 
proposal Monday. ADRIAN MAHER

AEROSPACE; CIA CHIEF URGES FIRMS TO SELL SPY PHOTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Bay aerospace companies could weather cutbacks in U.S. defense spending 
by selling some spy satellite technology to commercial customers around the 
world, the top U.S. intelligence official says.  
</P>
<P>
 CIA Director James Woolsey told a gathering of South Bay aerospace executives 
in Torrance on Friday that they would benefit from a new policy that allows 
companies to sell highly detailed satellite photos to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is going to be essential with a reduced-size intelligence community," 
Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and politicians say the new policy, announced in March, will 
help aerospace companies diversify their operations. Spy satellite technology 
that was once top secret can now be used to provide detailed photos for 
geological firms, map makers, news organizations, mining companies and oil 
exploration firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CIA is realizing that there has to be commercial and civilian 
applications for some of the technology that they will be using now and in the 
future," said Alan Schwartz, president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of 
Commerce. "It's always been, 'We need this for national security. We want it 
for this, and that's it.' . . . Now, it's a whole different tune. And that is a 
good tune for the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 Three companies -- World View Inc. in Livermore, Lockheed Corp. in Calabasas 
and Litton Industries' Itek Optical Systems in Lexington, Mass. -- plan to 
market the high-resolution images. (Lockheed's plans were made before it 
announced its merger this week with Martin Marietta Corp.) 
</P>
<P>
 But as yet, the South Bay's two largest satellite firms -- including TRW Space 
and Electronics Group in Redondo Beach and Hughes Aircraft Co. in El Segundo -- 
have not announced plans to market the sophisticated photos.  
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and politicians said that it would make sense for South Bay 
companies to do so, as intelligence and defense budgets decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the market develops, the sophisticated producers (of satellite systems) in 
the South Bay will figure out how to be major players," said Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills), who is a member of the House Science, Space and Technology 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to industry experts, a customer would call a satellite service, 
specify the geographic coordinates, and the satellite would be positioned to 
take a photo. Customers could get quality photos of objects on the ground that 
are a square meter or more in size, which is precise enough to show buildings, 
cars and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies were once prohibited from selling images of that quality.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Commerce Department, the market for satellite images is 
expected to grow from $400 million worldwide this year to $2 billion by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry experts, however, have doubts about how lucrative it will be for 
a company if a satellite costs hundreds of millions of dollars and the photos 
cost thousands of dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of foreign countries, (the market) is not large," said John Pike, a 
space expert at the American Federation of Scientists in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Pike fears that the new policy will enable intelligence agencies in hostile 
foreign countries to gain access to America's spy technology and use it against 
the United States or its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My basic objection is that in addition to the American military, they will be 
selling to everyone else," Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new policy includes a host of safeguards, Woolsey said. The Commerce 
Department has to approve each application to operate a satellite surveillance 
service or market it worldwide. The State Department must approve the sale or 
the export of spy satellite hardware. The U.S. government also could shut down 
the system in the name of national security -- for instance, during a war or 
foreign policy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton Administration had not changed policy, industry officials 
feared the United States would lose out to France or Russia, which are pursuing 
the market for the sophisticated satellite images. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration believed "it was a bad idea for us just to sit here and 
watch Russian and and French imagery appear on the international market and not 
make it possible for American companies to compete," Woolsey said after 
addressing the aerospace executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in this room are the 800-pound gorillas of space reconnaissance. 
They know more about it. They are better at it than anyone in the world."

DESIGN: CHANGING LOGO FOR STRAND RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new T-shirt design is being sought for the 43rd annual Sand and Strand Run 
in Hermosa Beach next February. 
</P>
<P>
 If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Indeed, why change a good thing just for the 
sake of change? The longtime traditional logo is an excellent and distinctive 
design that graphically describes our unique run.It is immediately recognized 
wherever runners are seen -- at races or at the supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the many things I've learned in more than 30 years in the advertising 
world is that if an organization or corporation has a readily recognized logo, 
one does not change a good design just for the sake of change. There's nothing 
wrong with modernizing a longtime design. There are many corporate examples of 
this, accomplished without changing the basic elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermosa Beach run is one of the oldest of hundreds in Southern California. 
And it's different from the many road races. It goes through wet sand, dry 
sand, sloppy slopes, the Strand, high or low tides, ocean storms, wind, rain, 
sun, heat and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the run include children, grandparents, beginning joggers and 
world-class runners, including Billy Mills, who won a gold medal in the 10,000 
meters in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 I've enjoyed participating in it each of the past 28 years. Rummaging through 
my closet drawers, I uncovered my oldest Hermosa Beach T-shirt with the 
longtime logo, the 27th annual, 1979. Several earlier ones became dust rags. 
The first T-shirt design featured a balky mule being coaxed by a tender carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 Please don't change this novel, established logo design!

HARBOR AREA: ONE YEAR ON PORT COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year ago this month, I received a call from newly elected Mayor Richard 
Riordan asking if I would accept a position as a Los Angeles Harbor 
commissioner. My immediate response was yes. 
</P>
<P>
 I was told I would be an asset to the Harbor area and to the city of Los 
Angeles. That was the beginning of a year that has been a tremendous learning 
experience for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought once I was confirmed by City Council, I could change things in the 
port to the way I thought things should be. But change is hard, I found out. 
Policy is determined by the mayor and City Council, with the commissioners as 
overseers. 
</P>
<P>
 All port employees have a specific job to perform in the smooth-running 
operations between the port, tenants and public. Everyone I worked with made me 
feel welcome and listened to what I had to say concerning a variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Los Angeles' financial conditions, we were asked to forgo any 
financial remuneration, which I believe was $50 per meeting for past 
commissioners. I was given two credit cards (telephone and general credit), 
which I have never used. I filled my gas tank with my own credit card. I 
attended every commission meeting and represented the port at all functions I 
could. I returned all phone calls from concerned individuals with questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of my fellow commissioners were unfamiliar with the immediate 
surrounding area, so I invited all of them to tour with local communities of 
Wilmington and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted no on two agenda items. One was the monies taken from port funds and 
sent to City Hall to the general fund. I believe a percentage of these funds 
should be spent in the communities of San Pedro and Wilmington, which are 
affected by the port. Very little of these monies trickle back to us.  
</P>
<P>
 My second no vote was the certification of the environmental impact report of 
the B and C streets realignment in Wilmington. There are three possibilities in 
this report: 1) no project, 2) upgrading B Street, which includes upgrading the 
C Street off-ramp of the Harbor Freeway and 3) relocating B Street up to C 
Street and installing a 20-foot-high buffer wall to protect the adjacent 
residents from the noise of a double-track rail line and expanded container 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 This wall is approximately one mile in length with no breaks. No community 
input was requested pertaining to this wall or who was going to clean up 
graffiti or maintain the landscaping. During the scoping meeting, the majority 
of people present asked for the upgrading of B Street, with the natural buffer 
being commercial development between B and C.  
</P>
<P>
 My fellow commissioners told me I was their conscience and promised this 
20-foot buffer wall would not be chosen by them in the B/C Street project, and 
Wilmington would get its port interpretive center at Bannings Landing at the 
foot of Avalon Boulevard. I hope these promises come true for the betterment of 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 I started hearing rumors in early June that I wouldn't be reappointed. I was 
never contacted by City Hall one way of the other on my reappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., business people, politicians, labor 
organizations and community people sent letters, faxes and telephoned the 
mayor's office in my behalf. I thank everyone for this outpouring of support. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 15 I talked to Mayor Riordan, asking about my reappointment and the 
letters of support that were sent in my behalf. He told me Bill Wardlaw made 
the final decision on commission appointments and looked puzzled about the 
support letters. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling Bill Wardlaw three times with no response and Greg Dawley in 
City Hall with no response, Deputy Mayor Mike Keely called me, stating that two 
new Harbor Commissioners will be appointed. I talked about the mayor's look of 
puzzlement pertaining to the letters of support in my behalf. He stated the 
mayor was aware, but sometimes forgets. He offered me a commission on the 
Convention Center, which I later turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel sorry for my supporters who took the time to write in my behalf as it 
fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 I am being decommissioned, but I am not going in mothballs. Thanks to all of 
you who supported me; it is deeply and humbly appreciated. I still have not 
been given a reason why I was not reappointed.

RESOURCES: MERITS OF TREATED SEWAGE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All that glitters is not necessarily gold. Reclaimed tertiary water is an 
important component in Southern California's water supply scheme, but it is not 
a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article: "Pitch Touts the Joys of Treated Sewage Water" (South Bay, Aug. 
25) was Pollyannaish and ignored some serious problems with the development of 
the West Basin reclamation plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible, well-planned and cost-effective reclaimed water development must 
be encouraged when there are pre-sold receptive markets for its use. This is 
not the case with the West Basin project. Your article states that only 5% of 
the water that will be produced has been sold to date, despite a $200-million 
capital expenditure for the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is going to foot the bill for this? The property-tax payers of the West 
Basin district who are subsidizing the oil refineries' use of this public 
resource. Furthermore, a more succinct examination of the pricing of the West 
Basin reclaimed water will reveal that it is not 30% cheaper than currently 
available potable supplies. In fact, the pricing of this water is a serious 
impediment to its use and the repayment of the capital and operating costs of 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaimed water -- yes, but not at any price!

<P>
 James Benning's story on recycled water marketing ("Pitch Touts the Joys of 
Treated Sewage Water," Aug. 25) overlooked a unique approach to reinventing 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Basin Municipal Water District operates from a "demand side" 
perspective, which has helped it create partnerships with businesses, 
environmental groups and other governmental agencies. The sum total of West 
Basin's efforts is to provide adequate water supplies to sustain businesses and 
jobs in the South Bay communities we serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark West Basin Water Recycling Project was conceived, planned and 
constructed in only four years. The Clinton Administration has identified this 
water project as a "Presidential Priority Investment Initiative" and has 
committed to providing $50 million in federal grant funds. At full capacity, 
the project will reduce the South Bay's dependence on expensive water from the 
Colorado River and the State Water Project by 50%, while assisting in the 
cleanup of Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Benning's visit, the Chevron refinery in El Segundo has committed to 
using 6,000 acre-feet per year of recycled water (one-third the demand in El 
Segundo). On Sept. 13, we expect to execute a similar agreement with the Mobil 
Refinery in Torrance. Combined with 50 other users and the Mobil Refinery, the 
Phase I plant capacity of 20 million gallons per day is nearly 100% subscribed. 
Because of this strong market demand for recycled water, the treatment facility 
will be expanded in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Basin water district shares a modest staff of 34 professionals and 
headquarter facilities in Carson with the Central Basin Municipal Water 
District. The combined population of the districts is 2.4 million, covering 10% 
of California's cities. The district contracts with the private sector to 
provide for the engineering design and operation of its water facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 We appreciate the L.A. Times' interest in water recycling. Clearly, 
conservation and more effective use of our existing water supplies is needed to 
sustain our economy.

PARKS: VETERANS MEMORIAL REDESIGN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Carson Beall's beautiful proposal to redesign Veterans Memorial Park to 
include a memorial to Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool and Capt. Michael Tracy 
would be a spectacular design for a private estate or Beverly Hills-type city. 
It does not seem to be at all appropriate for our city. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans Memorial Park in Palos Verdes Estates was the creation of talented 
landscape architect Hammond Sadler, whose son was one of several young Palos 
Verdes men who lost their lives during World War II. On a number of occasions 
in the 1950s, Hammond and I talked about this little park and how it was 
designed to be a quiet secret garden, a very natural woodland place which would 
fit gracefully into the city's "urban forest." 
</P>
<P>
 It is very regrettable that Bunnie Jezewski's efforts to maintain this park in 
the spirit of the original designers of our city were accidentally 
misinterpreted by the families of our tragically martyred officers. Of course 
Jezewski did not mean that the recently submitted design concepts were too 
grandiose a memorial for Sgt. Vanderpool and Capt. Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be too grand to honor these wonderful officers. However, the 
memorial, to be truly beautiful, should be in keeping with the rural natural 
design of our city. Multiple statuaries, plaques and monuments on our public 
land could ultimately change the natural look of our city. A bas-relief 
memorial plaque or statue inside the City Hall would be a highly visible 
constant reminder of the officers' bravery and sacrifice to the many citizens, 
employees and visitors who come to the City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A more wonderful memorial from my view would be a Vanderpool-Tracy Memorial 
Forest on one of our barren hillsides or a Vanderpool-Tracy Memorial Parkland 
along our Margate, Lunada Bay, Resort Point bluff parklands. Paths, low shrubs 
and colorful ground covers would not only honor our true hero officers, but 
enhance our property values and be a joy for all. 
</P>
<P>
 I think a living memorial would receive a lot of support from Palos Verdes 
organizations and residents. It would be a constant reminder of Sgt. Vanderpool 
and Capt. Tracy. It could be the inspiration once a year for a community 
gardening effort in the European tradition -- after which our city was 
patterned.

<P>
 All around the newsroom last Saturday, TVs were tuned to baseball. There were 
cheers when the hometown team tied it up, groans when they fell back behind, 
gasps when a late-inning home run put them back within one. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the attention, you might have thought it was the World Series. And it 
was -- the Little League World Series, Northridge versus Maracaibo, Venezuela. 
These kids were good, but hey, they were still just kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the major leagues' strike continues, reaching day 22 today and leaving 
some baseball fans more than a little desperate. More than 200 games have been 
missed, and if things keep moving (or not moving) as predicted, most if not all 
of the remaining season will be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion seems to view both sides, the players and the owners, with 
equal disgust. It was a high-flying season until the walkout, with home runs on 
a record pace and many star players having career seasons. Just like that, it 
was over, and for seemingly arcane reasons that have left most fans crying 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike hit the same day the exhibition football season started, so some 
made a relatively painless switch -- as long as there's a ball involved, 
they're happy. 
</P>
<P>
 But die-hard fans of the great American pastime may be having more of a 
problem with the season's premature demise. The lack of baseball -- a national 
ritual as much as it is a game -- has left a void, and OC Live! has a few 
suggestions for filling it. Minor Diversions 
</P>
<P>
 If there has been a winner in this strike, it is the minor league system, 
which has reaped plenty of attention (including newspaper features like this 
one) touting it as an alternative to the stalled major leagues' seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 All the publicity couldn't have come at a better time for the newly uptown 
Class A California League. The Lake Elsinore Storm (an Angels affiliate) has a 
new $19-million stadium with 6,800 seats, a sunken field and a roofed concourse 
that evokes a turn-of-the-century ballpark. The Epicenter, year-old home of the 
Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, cost a cool $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the relatively low ticket prices ($3 general admission to $6 box 
seats), minor-league games are whole-family affairs. And the action on the 
field isn't the only thing that's in an entirely different league than what you 
find at Dodgers and Angels games. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Lake Elsinore Storm game last weekend, for instance, patrons jockeyed for 
prizes between innings: Dancers shimmied atop the dugouts, with the crowd's 
cheers determining the winner; amateur golfers chipped whiffle balls at a pin 
held by the team's dinosaur mascot; two men spun until they were dizzy, then 
ran a woozy footrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, families spread blankets on the hilly lawn section, and kids did 
somersaults down the grass. Some even watched the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular minor league season winds to a close Sunday , but there are a few 
remaining chances to catch games near Orange County. Ticket prices top out at 
$6 for the chance to see young ballplayers hustling to make an impression on 
big league managers and scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance has been strong this season, so it's not a bad idea to call ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lake Elsinore Storm: There's one home stand left, Friday through Sunday 
against the Riverside Pilots. The first two games start at 7:05 p.m., the 
Sunday game at 5:05 p.m.; ticket prices are $2.50 to $5. Games are played at 
the Diamond, on Diamond Drive just off Interstate 15. Information: (714) 
245-4487. 
</P>
<P>
 * Riverside Pilots: The Pilots, affiliated with the Seattle Mariners, have one 
home game left, tonight against the Storm. Game time is 7:15 p.m., and tickets 
range from $2 to $5. The game will be played at the Riverside Sports Center, 
1000 Blaine St. Information: (909) 276-3352. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho Cucamonga Quakes: A San Diego Padres affiliate, the Quakes close out 
their home season tonight at 7:05 p.m. against the High Desert Mavericks of 
Adelanto. Tickets are $3 to $6. The Epicenter is on Stadium Way (off Foothill 
Boulevard). Information: (909) 481-5252. League of Their Own 
</P>
<P>
 "I like baseball more than softball. I grew up playing in the streets with the 
boys," says Lee Ann Morretino. But when it came to playing for organized teams, 
she never really had a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to follow that 'baseball is for boys, softball is for girls' thing," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 That has changed. Morretino is now the player-manager of the Edge, one of 
three Orange County teams in the new Women's National Adult Baseball Assn. Here 
in the county, the league kicked off last Sunday with three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams from the South Bay area of Los Angeles County joined in, including 
Pepper's Peaches, managed by Pepper Davis and featuring several actresses from 
the film "A League of Their Own," about the wartime exploits of a women's 
professional baseball league. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of that film is what inspired the new women's recreational league, 
said Jim Moore, Orange County president of the National Adult Baseball Assn., 
which started in 1986 as a men-only league. Now there are 44 men's teams in the 
county, including some with former college and minor league players. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the women's league off the ground locally was a challenge, Moore said. 
But now that the season has started, it's getting attention, and he expects 
that to translate to more players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to add some more teams," Moore says. "We're really looking for teams 
and players." 
</P>
<P>
 Morretino, who played last year on the Rancho Santiago College softball team, 
says she is having a lot of fun. "With the leading off and the stealing, it's a 
blast. It's a little more challenging" than softball. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something for spectators too, she says. "We're not inhibited at all, 
so there's a lot of action going on all the time," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were good" on Sunday, adds Moore. "We had a pretty good little crowd out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The league accepts all ability levels (players must be at least 18). For 
information on both women's and men's leagues, call (714) 996-2763. Games are 
played Sundays at 9 a.m., noon and 3 p.m. at Pacifica High School in Garden 
Grove; spectators are admitted free. All-Star Weekend 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best high school players in the world will converge on Long Beach 
this weekend, playing the ninth annual Goodwill Series in lovely Blair Field. 
The three-day tournament, opening Saturday, features all-star teams from Korea, 
Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 How's the level of play? "In my experience, it would be equal to Class A over 
in the California League," said Bob Williams, president of the Santa Rosa-based 
Goodwill Series Inc., organizers of the tournament. "They would be very 
competitive in Division I college ball." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Williams has a vested interest. But he is able to point to some 
high-profile alumni, including Matt Williams of the Giants, Gregg Jeffries of 
the Cardinals and John Wetteland of the Expos. Chan Ho Park, who started the 
current season with the Dodgers, played for the 1991 Korean team at the event 
and was "discovered" there by Dodger scouts. (He will make an appearance at 
this year's tournament, at noon on Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
 So, what it boils down to is this: If you can't watch the stars of today, come 
check out the possible stars of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is represented by one player on this year's 20-player U.S. team, 
Eric Valent of Canyon High School in Anaheim. All the U.S. players are juniors, 
selected through a recent national tournament, the Area Code Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the schedule: Saturday, it's Korea vs. the United States at 12:30 p.m. 
and Korea vs. Japan at 3:30 p.m. Sunday, the U.S. team will play Japan at 12:30 
p.m. and Korea at 3:30 p.m. In the final games, the United States and Japan 
will play Monday at 12:30 p.m., and Korea and Japan will meet at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for all games are $5 and will be sold at the gate (children under 12 
get in free). Blair Field is near Wilson High School in Long Beach; from the 
San Diego (405) Freeway, head west on Seventh Street, then turn right on Park 
Avenue. Playing the Game 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Wright put in 10 years as a major league pitcher, including a stint with 
the Angels. "I missed it from the day I walked out of it," he says now. "I wish 
I could still play, but there's a certain thing called old age that catches up 
with you." 
</P>
<P>
 So, for 15 years, Wright has done the next best thing to playing -- teaching 
others to play, specifically, to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work on the curve, the change-up, everything," he says. "I start the kids 
at 9 years old, and they go on from there." It's not just the youngsters, 
though. He's had students up to 47 years old, getting ready for spring fantasy 
baseball camps. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for those baseball fans who always dreamed of some time on the mound but 
figured their glory days were behind them, there's still a chance to rear back 
and toss a few, with the help of a pro. The skills learned could come in handy, 
with the growing number of recreational baseball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright teaches on a pair of practice mounds at Home Run Park in Anaheim, a 
privately run park with batting cages and a large baseball shop with more than 
1,000 bats for sale. His school is one of several operated throughout Orange 
County (just check the Yellow Pages under baseball schools); Don Aase is 
another former Angel who operates a local pitching school, in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrolling in pitching school requires a commitment of time and money. Wright, 
for instance, charges $250, which covers one one-hour meeting a week for eight 
weeks (there are two students per session). 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons can pay off, however: One of Wright's longtime students just 
signed a contract with the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made more money signing than I did in 10 years of playing," Wright says. 
But there are no hard feelings. The young prospect is Wright's son, Jaret, a 
pitcher out of Katella High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball fans who would rather work on their swing than their slider, or just 
work out their frustration over the shortened season, can drop into one of the 
many public batting cages throughout the county. Most offer a variety of 
pitching machines set to speeds from about 40 m.p.h. up to major league-level 
heat (there are also slow-pitch softball machines). You can put in a handful of 
quarters for a set number of pitches, on those quick visits, or pay a flat fee 
for a more substantial chunk of time. Most facilities loan bat and helmet for 
free. Memory Lane 
</P>
<P>
 Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? 
</P>
<P>
 The musical question grows even more poignant as yet another labor dispute 
further tarnishes the image of the Grand Old Game. Baseball fans yearning for a 
visit with DiMaggio and other stars of yesteryear, and hoping perhaps for a 
nostalgic return to childhood passions, can check out a sports card and 
memorabilia shop -- almost as ubiquitous on the Orange County landscape as 
frozen yogurt franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the cards you cavalierly obliterated in your bike spokes as a kid are 
gingerly preserved in plexiglass frames. Prices on the real rarities can exceed 
the players' lifetime batting averages. The browsing is fun, and even if you 
don't feel like buying, chances are you'll at least find someone to commiserate 
with about the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the walkout, interest in cards of such hot current stars as Ken Griffey 
Jr. was riding high, according to Tim Stone, manager of Whiz Kids, a card and 
memorabilia shop in Costa Mesa. But when the strike hit, much of the collector 
interest drifted to the coming pro football season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the market for cards of past baseball stars remains steady. 
</P>
<P>
 "That never stops," Stone says. "Interest in the older cards is still high." A 
Day in the Park 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium holds some memories, even if most of them are frustrating 
ones. There's no baseball there at the moment, but that doesn't have to rule 
out a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium (which, alas, was a much nicer baseball park before it was 
partially enclosed for the Rams) is open daily for tours, except on event days 
and holidays. Tour times are 11 a.m., noon, 1 and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour stops include the Angels' dugout, but not their locker room. Visitors do 
get to see the Rams' locker room and their cheerleaders' locker room, along 
with the press box. They also get to walk out onto the field, which is 
currently in its between-seasons state: dirt base paths for baseball, goal 
posts for football. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday, tours will also include a stop at the Orange County Sports 
Hall of Fame, which is housed in the stadium near Gate 6 and features a number 
of former Angels. Officially, the hall of fame is open to the public 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. on weekdays, but times can be sporadic, so it's best to call ahead if 
you're not planning to take the stadium tour. The hall is also open for two 
hours before events at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours are $3, $2 for children 5 to 16 and seniors, free for kids under 5. For 
tour information, call (714) 254-3120. For information on the hall of fame, 
call (714) 254-3050. Road Trip 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, it will be possible to visit such legendary ballparks as 
Chicago's Wrigley Field and Boston's Fenway Park -- along with such minor 
league spots as Bakersfield's rickety Sam Lynn Field -- all without leaving 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major League/Minor League: Photographs of America's Baseball Stadiums by Jim 
Dow," a traveling exhibition from the Smithsonian, opens at the Fullerton 
Museum Center Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow, who once made prints for the great photographer Walker Evans, made his 
highly detailed ballpark portraits with a tripod-mounted, large-format view 
camera, taking his long-exposure photographs both at dusk and in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition includes text by Times staff writer David Lamb, author of 
"Stolen Season: A Journey Through America and Baseball's Minor Leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball's best ballparks are full of odd angles and nooks and crannies," 
Lamb says in a written release. "And, rather than being architectural 
intruders, they appear to be part of the cityscape." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the major league parks are a silent part of that cityscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Museum Center is at 301 N. Pomona Ave. For information on the 
exhibit, which will run Sept. 30 through Nov. 13, call (714) 738-6545. Looking 
Back 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the best news of all for dejected fans could be the arrival of 
"Baseball" -- the long-awaited series on the history of the sport from Ken 
Burns, creator of the highly praised "Civil War" miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball" will air in nine two-hour segments on KCET Channel 28, at 8 p.m. 
Sept. 18 through 22 and 25 through 28.

GODDESS PLUCKED FROM ON HIGH; PETITE FLOWER JUDY TENUTA GROWS WILD ON DIVINE 
COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a tip for anyone interviewing Judy Tenuta, the self-proclaimed high 
priestess of camp and happiness. Simply introduce yourself and start taking 
notes. She'll handle the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like she's always bothered or put out by someone or something. And the 
Love Goddess is eager to share these thoughts, without benefit of euphemisms. 
</P>
<P>
 A phone call to somewhere in Sherman Oaks on Monday confirmed this. A very 
basic first question: Specifically where in Sherman Oaks? "Why? So you can 
stalk me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tenuta was off and running, keeping straight answers to a minimum, as usual. 
True to form, not much about her can be pinned down; even her official press 
release is an extension of her act (unless, of course, she really did get a 
degree in theater and lingerie lunches at the University of Illinois.) 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing we're safe saying is that the Petite Flower, now in her 
late 30s, grew up as one of eight children in a Polish-Italian home in the 
Chicago suburb of Oak Park. We can also document that she's a performer who has 
done quite well for someone strapped to an accordion while wearing flowing 
gowns and accepting unquestioning worship from males -- whom she frequently 
refers to as furniture, swine, trolls, love slaves and stud puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans can see this siren of the surreal Friday through Sunday at the Irvine 
Improv. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking a straight question of Tenuta is akin to leading with one's chin. Even 
a simple ice-breaker such as "How did you get your start in comedy?" is greeted 
ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, c'mon, studsicle!" she scolded in her trademark trill, which often slinks 
into a guttural attack. "You can't be serious. It was like, I could be a serial 
killer, or B) I could do this. I was left on a doorstep in swaddling clothes 
and Elvis found me. 'I must act, I told him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was Elvis, she added, who suggested the Judyism angle. That turned out to 
be good advice. Her signature religion caught on, lifting her from the pack of 
normal stand-up comics as well as lifting her followers out of their daily 
grinds. To worship at the feet of the Aphrodite of the Accordion is to give 
one's self to a higher being. (She's up on the stage, you're not.) 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the peg that makes her different among comedians was one of the few 
times her voice fell into a street-level tone and the interview had any sense 
of propriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is I'm making people happy. I have a reason for 
being here, the ritual of Judyism. The whole experience of Judyism. Maybe 
someone will come up and show me their new butt clamp. Judyism makes you lose 
your inhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 It happens across the country, but she quickly recalled a West Coast episode 
to illustrate this phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "In San Francisco, this guy comes on stage -- right out of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 
devil worship, all in black and his head shaved. And he's got a cream pie. He 
says, 'Please throw this in my face. I'm a pie sexual.' I'm going, 'Hello?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't stop at pie tossing. She mentioned several examples of body 
piercing that boggle the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the beauty of my show. The act is very cathartic. . . . I don't know 
what it is. In my act, people have a need to come up and confess something. 
That's why the goddess is here, to help people. You don't have to pierce 
(yourself) to feel alive. (These people) are deadened in society." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenuta's list of credits is impressive. Besides playing "Lady of Spain" on her 
accordion at Chicago Cubs games in her formative years (those would've been 
great days to witness), Tenuta went on to write "The Power of Judyism," earn an 
ACE award as top comedian, tape cable specials, star in Dr Pepper ads and 
record two albums ("Buy This, Pigs!" and the latest, "Attention Butt Pirates 
and Lesbetarians" because "I want to be politically correct"). 
</P>
<P>
 But after more than a decade of living on a pedestal, her next move, she says, 
is into movies or a television series. But given the off-the-wall nature of her 
persona, both fields will take some work. ("I'm under the weight limit to get a 
sitcom, like Roseanne.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be in the movies," she said seriously, before relapsing. "I was 
supposed to do the Meryl Streep role in 'Out of Africa,' but she needed the 
work, so I let her have it. I'd like the lead in 'Babe, the Blue Ox,' or 
something really glamorous like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the real world, she's scheduled to do a music video with Weird Al 
Yankovic this week, and she's also working on a development deal with 
Klasky-Csupo for an animated TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood and the High Priestess, however, are not a perfect match. Executives 
don't know quite how to package her, and she is frustrated by the standoff. 
("This town sucks hippo" is how she puts it, actually.) Lately, she said, she's 
been spending time auditioning and being rejected because she isn't more like 
Melanie Griffith. Her frustration doesn't stop there, though. She thinks TV 
shows are straying from humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to like punch lines and jokes. I thought that was important to comedy. 
Maybe I'll do 'Married With Power Tools.' I'm the wife, and my husband is 
Carrot Top. And my lover is someone really straight, like George Hamilton. And 
I have a kid, and I don't know whose it is. It has a tan and red hair." 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, live performances remain her staple. And as a true giver and 
expert in affairs of the heart, the Love Goddess' job doesn't stop when she 
leaves the stage. She's always there to help her fans over the rough spots, 
including Tom and Roseanne during their recent split. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my god. They're always calling me for advice," she said, now firmly back 
in the ethereal world. "I don't need that tubosaurus around. She makes $20 
million a year. That's a lot for a farm animal. She wants me to see her new 
beauty mark. 'Oh, is that where the comet hit you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She's also expanding the ranks of not-so-famous she draws into her celestial 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting older people now, which is fun for me," she said, temporarily 
touching land again. "It's really cute. Or little kids. Ten-year-old boys come 
up to me at the airport. Like I've got sunglasses on, and I ask them how they 
knew it was me. 'Well, duh, your name's on your accordion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly proper respect for a goddess, but as future followers, the Petite 
Flower forgives them their sins of youth.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: C.C. ADCOCK "C.C. ADCOCK" / ISLAND RECORDS

 Guitarist's guitarist Jimmie Vaughan has recently been singing the praises of 
yet another guitarist, C.C. Adcock. Listening to the young Louisiana native's 
debut album, it's easy to hear why.This is swampy, fevered stuff, the sort of 
music you'd want for a last dance if you were in a bayou roadhouse with zombies 
closing in on all sides. OK, maybe that isn't in your weekend schedule, but it 
never hurts to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Though still in his early 20s, Adcock has logged time on the road with Bo 
Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, and he's adept at both making a fat guitar 
racket, as he does here on the Diddley-penned "Beaux's Bounce," and at laying 
back behind a zydeco accordion on the propulsive "Kissin' Kouzans." 
</P>
<P>
 That latter song is about the pleasures of Southern incest, and Adcock's 
lyrics in general aren't likely to garner any Good Housekeeping seals. 
Fortunately, he doesn't seem to place any great premium on diction, usually 
filtering his vocals through a murky distortion, as if they'd wafted in via Dr. 
John's CB radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitar playing throughout is inspired, with hypnotic grooves and sizzling, 
surprise-filled solos. Adcock clearly has a command of blues roots but doesn't 
hesitate to slice through them with a trashy fuzz-toned assault. The result is 
playing that is often wildly out of context with the musical setting, but his 
phrasing is so cool he always makes it fit. Check out the spluttering lines on 
the R&B ballad "I'm Just a Fool to Care," the whirling and swooping tones of 
"What I Like (Womens)" and the ultra-swampy "Couchemal." JIM WASHBURN

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: DONALD FAGEN "THE NIGHTFLY" (1982) / CAPITOL  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adjectives like warm and nostalgic rarely are applied to the cynical and 
bittersweet music of Steely Dan. But they certainly describe the moods evoked 
by "The Nightfly," the first solo album by the cryptic band's singer, Donald 
Fagen.Working apart from the barbed sensibilities of his Steely Dan partner 
Walter Becker, Fagen fashioned an elegant pop album that engagingly recalls his 
years growing up on the East Coast during the late '50s and early '60s. 
Allusions to uncluttered romance, cool jazz, '50s pop culture and cold war 
politics all found their way into the album's vivid lyrical tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rhythmically effervescent "New Frontier," Fagen captured both the 
anxieties and the innocence of the era, smartly juxtaposing images of suburban 
fallout shelters with references to Tuesday Weld and Dave Brubeck. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the immediately seductive and brightly toned "I.G.Y (International 
Geophysical Year)" is an ironic look at the unbridled sense of national 
optimism engendered by the U.S. space program more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of tracks on this jazz-inflected album are as guileless and 
breezy as a Gershwin standard. "Walk Between Raindrops" is a nearly impeccable 
slice of swing-pop. "Maxine" is a velvety, piano-based ballad. The title song 
finds Fagen in the shoes of a hip disc jockey named Lester the Nightfly. It is 
a sparkling cut, with a cool, late-night ambience reflected in the album's 
cover photo of Fagen spinning a record, cigarette in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nightfly" arrived two years after Steely Dan's last album, 1980's 
"Gaucho." Eleven more years would elapse before Fagan's long-awaited follow-up, 
"Kamakiriad." 
</P>
<P>
 Fagen and Becker will perform as Steely Dan Sept. 16 and 17 at Irvine Meadows. 
On tour last year, the duo included several songs from "The Nightfly" in their 
shows, including "I.G.Y" and "Green Flower Street." JON MATSUMOTO

WANNA DANCE?: AN AIR OF ROMANCE SWIRLS AROUND IMPERIAL BALLROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the ballroom floor, it must be the teamwork thing that makes couples look 
so happily-ever-after in love. Together they're achieving what neither could 
accomplish dancing alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could also be the old-fashioned man-leads, woman-follows sense of 
chivalry, or the radiant smiles that inevitably shine. Maybe the diaphanous 
cocktail dress she wears has something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the above create an air of romance at the Imperial Ballroom in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting a largely over-50 clientele, this second-story nightspot (known as 
the Imperial Academy for ballroom dance during the week) dims the lights, 
brings in live bands and serves refreshments every weekend for waltzers and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Large photographs of famed ballroom champions, pink walls and a few fake 
potted plants make up the club's simple decor, jazzed up for evenings with 
little white lights, a glitter ball and colored spotlights. Small tables and 
chairs flank the spacious dance floor, which abuts an area just for seating at 
one end. 
</P>
<P>
 Large windows and mirrors compensate for a slightly oppressive low ceiling, 
and people looking for fresh air can stroll onto a balcony, where the aroma of 
a barbecue restaurant wafts across the strip center in which the club is 
situated. 
</P>
<P>
 The live bands play tunes for all types of ballroom, swing and Latin dances. 
The three-piece Imperial Junction may have recently evoked crusty memories of 
the "Lawrence Welk Show," but it also served up some Glenn Miller and Count 
Basie standards and other, peppy songs ("Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'," "On the 
Sunny Side of the Street") that dancers never balked at. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday nights, the Imperial Ballroom caters to couples and groups only. 
Fridays are for singles, and, to break the ice, the deejay leads mixers. The 
ladies, holding hands in a large circle around the men, walk in a circular 
motion for a moment or two, until the music stops, at which point the men break 
out and invite the nearest woman (or whomever they wish, really) to dance. This 
process is repeated for a half-dozen or so dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Expertise levels vary, just like anywhere, but the crowd is friendly; there 
seem to be none of the cliques or attitudes common at other clubs, be they 
tailored for country, swing or deep house. 
</P>
<P>
 No alcohol is served, but soda and popcorn go for the low, low price of 50 
cents, and bottled water is 75 cents. And with Friday and Saturday admission at 
$6 per person, you might just be able to save up for one of those diaphanous 
cocktail dresses and live happily ever after.

DO IT!: GO EXTRA MILE (OR 100) IN WHEELMEN EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
Edition staff.

<P>
 Orange County Wheelmen, the county's biggest cycling club, has two events 
planned in the next month that require an extra measure of commitment, as well 
as advance registration. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is the Amtrak Century, a 100-mile ride along the coast from the 
Irvine Multimodal Transportation Center (the bus and train station, in layman's 
terms) to the Amtrak station in San Diego. Organizers describe it as a great 
first-time century for regular riders. Participants should be able to average 
12 m.p.h. for eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back, cyclists will celebrate their feat with a Western-style party 
in their own private train. Included in the $53 registration fee is train fare, 
truck transportation for the bikes on the way back (take a blanket or other 
padding) and refreshments on the ride down, including lunch in Carlsbad. On the 
ride south, a roving vehicle will offer mechanical support to cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 riders have taken part in past years, including Steve Nelson, a 
Wheelmen member who has taken part for more than 10 years. The large turnout is 
one factor that led Amtrak to offer the riders a train of their own (or maybe, 
as Nelson quipped, "the other passengers got tired of smelly cyclists"). 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson reminds first-time riders that even though the ride is a lot of fun and 
generally hugs a rolling coast, there are a few killer hills -- notably at 
Torrey Pines, in northern San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that, this time of year, riders should have a gentle tail 
wind helping push them along. Registration deadline is Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, also a licensed U.S. Cycling Federation coach, is one of the forces 
behind another event: a four-part cycling clinic for women riders, to be held 
on four consecutive Saturdays beginning Sept. 24. Nelson is one of several 
coaches who will teach. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is sponsored by Paramount Racing (a club within the Orange County 
Wheelmen) but designed for novice riders rather than racers. (A racing clinic 
for women may be held early next year.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a beginning cyclist, we're too advanced for you," Nelson said, 
referring to the clinic. "We're not geared to the racer; we're not geared to 
the beginner. We're geared to recreational riders." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic debuted last year, with about 20 participants. The four-hour 
sessions are about 40% classroom, 60% on the road, Nelson said. "We like the 
hands-on approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Topics include pace-line riding, cornering, nutrition, sprinting -- and how to 
fall down. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Amtrak Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Sept. 17, riders start anytime between 6 and 8 a.m. (advance 
registration is required). 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Begins at the Irvine Multimodal Transportation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the Santa Ana (5) Freeway, exit east on Alton Parkway and 
head about one-half mile to Ada. Cross Barranca Parkway and enter the center's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $53. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 956-2453. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Women Specific Training Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturdays (Sept. 24, Oct. 1, 8 and 15) from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Food Park, MacArthur Boulevard and Main Street, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit north on MacArthur; go 
just beyond Main and turn left into the Food Park parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $50. Advance registration recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 892-6545.

SURFING: A REALLY SHARP BAJA VACATION KEEPS HIM IN STITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a week in Cabo, Fig came back looking like a politician: tanned, rested 
and ready to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fig: I am rested. But the good news is I got my voice back 100%. I lost my 
voice after two weeks of announcing the Op Pro and U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
 Yo, Fig, I heard that isn't all you came back from Mexico with. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I didn't get sick but I did get a few stitches.  
</P>
<P>
 A late takeoff? Or did you smash up on those mean Baja rocks? 
</P>
<P>
 I had a brand-new board, and my fins were really sharp. The waves were 
breaking good, like 6- to 10-foot faces. My fins needed to be sanded down a 
little bit, but I didn't have time before the trip. I was paddling out through 
a big set and the fin was so sharp it sliced my skin open like a watermelon 
right near the ankle. It was on the first day there!  
</P>
<P>
 Bloody? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, folks let's take the surfer's test. You've paid for air fare, a rental 
car, new surfboards, extra leashes and traveling board bags, and have just 
found the answer to life's blues: A nice break bursting with plenty of waves. 
But now you're dinged up. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you A) Get out of the water? B) Get out of the water and wrap yourself 
around a bottle of tequila to ease the pain? C) Continue surfing? 
</P>
<P>
 Fig? What's the answer? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I kept surfing for another half-hour. But after it started to feel 
weird, I went in. On the beach, I took a look and it was a big gash, almost to 
the bone. I applied the 'ol pressure technique to slow the bleeding. I was hot 
and had to wait for my buddies who were enjoying the waves. It was 110 degrees. 
And we were more than an hour away from the nearest hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Ah yes, coaxing your surf buddies to come in and help you gives a whole new 
meaning to friendship, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond words. When we finally got to the hospital, it was like a 2,000-degree 
furnace in that place. No windows. No air conditioning. I found a water faucet 
and wet my face, my hat and my hair, then jumped on the doctor's table.  
</P>
<P>
 They knew what to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah. The doc hit me with two shots to numb the ankle area, cleaned up the 
gash, broke out the thread, then stitched it up. The doc gave me antibiotics, 
told me to lie in bed and not to get into the water for eight days.  
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm. Surfer's test No. 2: You're on vacation. A doctor has just warned you 
stay out of the water. Do you A) Heed the warning? B) Rationalize and wait four 
days? C) Be hard core and hit it? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey! You're on vacation, it's a tough thing to do. Fortunately, I brought this 
video camera and played Mr. Video Man.  
</P>
<P>
 For how long? 
</P>
<P>
 One day. The Fig took the massive duct tape therapy, wrapped it all around the 
ankle and surfed for the rest of the trip.  
</P>
<P>
 Trip rippers included John Parmenter, Fig's shop partner and former U.S. 
champion; Huntington Beach local Phil Fein and shaper Chuck Burns. Fig says 
grommets Chris Camacho and Ryan Turner, both 15, kept up with the older set, 
even on the big days. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone taking a trip to hot spots, Fig passes along this advice: Take 
plenty of drinking water. With 110-degree days in mid-August, Fig and friends 
(he took a crew of 11 surfers) were, at one point, down to a quart. Water temps 
were in the 85-degree range. Also, if you have an epoxy board, which is likely 
to ripple in temperatures above 135, take a reflective board bag. Airlines now 
charge a $45 board fee each way. The trick, Fig says, is to pack two or three 
boards into one bag. 
</P>
<P>
 With strong south swells hitting the Baja tip, waves were hitting on the Gulf 
and Pacific side. Fig's group mainly caught caught waves on the Gulf side, near 
Shipwreck's, closer to San Jose del Cabo. 
</P>
<P>
 After surfing, they chartered a fishing boat and hooked into some 30-pound 
mahi mahi. 
</P>
<P>
 We had talked to a restaurant before we went and cut a deal for them to cook 
the fish. Man, it was like the most excellent fish I've had. We had yellowtail 
tuna, and they fixed it sushi style right on the boat. With a little soy sauce, 
the stuff was almost jumping off our tongues.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contests: With the big boys departing Huntington Beach after the world tour's 
U.S. Open of Surfing, the U.S. Bud Tour kicked in at Virginia Beach, Va., and 
Imperial Beach. In Virginia last Sunday, Huntington Beach's Jeff Deffenbaugh 
terrorized the small surf to win his first Bud contest. In second was Hawaii's 
Conan Hayes, followed by Australia's Beau Emerton. On Aug. 21 in Imperial 
Beach, Chris Gallagher of Santa Cruz was first, Vince de La Pena of Laguna 
Niguel, second, and Hawaii's Noah Budroe was third. Hot amateur Kalani Robb of 
Hawaii was fourth. Bud Tour hits Trestles Sept. 12-18. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of big boys, Kelly Slater won another world-tour contest two weeks 
ago, taking the Gotcha Lacanau Pro in France. A week later, he grabbed second 
place at Hossegor, also in France. Slater scored with two eight-point waves and 
a nine for his best three rides (top is 10 points). Slater had a sumptuous 
stand-up tube inside a crashing two-meter shore break dumper. Brazilian Flavio 
Padaratz won. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish: Fig wants to wish his mom, Betty Fignetti, also known as Momma Fig, a 
happy birthday this Monday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOMMA FIG!

HERE'S A PITCH FOR SCREEN THRILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How hungry can strike-stunned baseball fans get? Hungry enough to search out a 
video fix? Hungry enough to slip into thechubby embrace of William Bendix? 
</P>
<P>
 Bendix, best known as the dumbfounded Riley in TV's "The Life of Riley," tried 
to be Ruthian in "The Babe Ruth Story" but could barely manage Bendixian. It's 
one of the worst baseball movies ever. The 1948 flick never dissuaded 
Hollywood, though -- either as myth, hero worship, an excuse for gags or 
sentimental family entertainment, the studios have often seen baseball as a 
fertile arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there are better pictures than "The Babe Ruth Story." Some are 
strange, some are dumb, some are funny because they're so bad, some are 
diamonds in the rough. Here are just a few of the mostly more obscure ones 
available on video: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear Strikes Out" (1957): Anthony Perkins stars in this rapid heartbeat of a 
biography of Jimmy Piersall, the professional outfielder who suffered through 
mental illness during much of his career. Perkins, one of the tickiest actors 
ever, exaggerates a tragic story with his portrayal (Piersall seems to be in a 
perpetual state of night sweats), but the film is weirdly fascinating for 
mixing psychosis with balls and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It Happens Every Spring" (1949): Ray Milland plays a nutty professor who 
accidentally concocts a chemical that makes baseballs do odd things, like avoid 
bats. It's light and enjoyable. Good for anyone who dreamed of throwing a 
perfect curve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jackie Robinson Story" (1950): Another biography, but with a dramatic 
social backdrop. Besides describing Robinson's life, the movie (starring 
Robinson as himself) examines the racial issues of the day that both fueled and 
hindered his becoming the first black player in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Winning Team" (1952): Still another biography, of pitcher Grover 
Cleveland Alexander. Sappy, like most baseball biopics, but you do get to see 
Ronald Reagan as he portrays Alexander in his ultra-brave battle with 
alcoholism and nearsighted umpires. Just right for Republicans who crave seeing 
their heroes in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" (1949): Mr. Musicals himself, Busby Berkeley, 
put together this fanciful flick about a gal (Esther Williams) gets involved 
with a baseball team with a couple of singing and dancing guys (Frank Sinatra 
and Gene Kelly). Silly but brightly done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings" (1976): Jive-happy comedy 
about a group of black ballplayers on a barnstorming tour through the South. 
Likable Billy Dee Williams and the always-mellifluous James Earl Jones are the 
heavy hitters, but Richard Pryor, in one of his few good roles, swipes plenty 
of scenes as an infielder trying to make the big leagues by passing as Puerto 
Rican. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight Men Out" (1988): Atmospheric retelling of the World Series "Black Sox" 
scandal of 1919. The movie can't keep from moralizing and only giving cursory 
attention to such intriguing characters as "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, but it's 
still one of the more sophisticated pictures about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Natural" (1984): A film that divides baseball and movie fans alike. It's 
loved by anyone who sees the sport as an icon, nothing less than a metaphor of 
the American way of life. Others think it's mythologizing ignores the simple 
pleasure that baseball is. It stars Robert Redford as Roy Hobbes, the enigmatic 
superhero of Bernard Malamud's novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pride of the Yankees" (1942): Many fans consider this picture about Lou 
Gehrig as quintessential, the best baseball movie ever made. Well, it is 
entertaining, in a sentimental Hollywood sort of way, but it's also too 
emotionally pushy to be effortlessly satisfying. Gary Cooper does make Gehrig 
an appealing symbol of upstanding manhood, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, there's more: "Bang the Drum Slowly" (1973), "The Pride of St. Louis" 
(1952), "Bull Durham" (1988), "Damn Yankees" (1958), "Field of Dreams" (1989), 
"A League of Their Own" (1992), "Major League" (1989) and "The Babe" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 And something to look forward to: Turner Home Entertainment recently announced 
that the videos of Ken Burns' nine-part, 18-hour series, "Baseball," (airing on 
KCET Channel 28 beginning Sept. 18 at 8 p.m.) will be arriving in stores Sept. 
23.

KIDS ON FILM: PASTICHE OF 'KILLERS' APPEALS TO MEDIA-RAISED GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In "Natural Born Killers," Mickey and Mallory, psycho-lovers severely abused 
as children, embark on a nightmarish killing spree and become darlings of the 
tabloid media, defending their actions better than the journalist, the police 
officer and the warden who want to exploit them. (Rated R)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If, as this movie proposes, the general public has an adolescent fascination 
with violence, it's not surprising that adolescents would be fascinated by this 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-cut MTV-style, with fantasy sitcoms and animated cartoons of the killers' 
horrific lives, it offers a Generation X tour of life's sewer -- violent sex 
and mindless mass murders, starting off with Mallory's parents -- with cynicism 
the only lesson. Footage of O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers, Tonya Harding 
and others drives home the point at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 (Don't even bother asking how 15- and 16-year-olds get into a movie supposedly 
restricted to those 17 and older. They just buy a ticket and walk in. What is 
less understandable is why adults bring even younger children to an 
ultra-violent movie that so clearly pushes the limits of an R rating.) 
</P>
<P>
 The movie left some teens wordless beyond "weird" and "gross." But others were 
impressed with director Oliver Stone's technical creativity and his pointed 
jabs at the media-drenched culture in which they've been raised. All said they 
liked it, even if they felt like taking a shower afterward and were confused 
about the ultimate message.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good movie for the kind of movie it was supposed to be," said Renata 
Bacellar, 15. "It's not exactly like a great movie, like something you would 
really want to watch, but if you're going to watch something crazy like that, 
they did it well." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her friend Stephanie Chaffin, also 15, said if there was a point, they 
didn't get it. The scenes that stood out in their minds were the murders, but 
they didn't think the film would provoke nightmares.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a movie," Stephanie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bacellar, 16, and Gavin Fields, 17, said at times they felt the movie 
flowed aimlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Bill called it an "A-grade" movie that realistically portrayed media 
exploitation of the public's love of violence, his friend called it 
"overrated." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be better than it was," Gavin said. "I liked it and 
all, but I read in the newspaper that it was going to be 'audacious 
filmmaking.' It wasn't as spectacular as I thought it was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 His reaction to the unusual mixing of styles, distortions, black-and-white 
with color and news clips was mixed.  
</P>
<P>
 "The part was good at the end when they showed O.J. Simpson and Lorena 
Bobbitt. It sort of gave me chills, you know, like he's condemning our society 
and how we're exploiting these things," Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes the style confused the point, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to watch the movie and see what he was getting at, like 
symbolism, or double meaning. I couldn't figure it out too much. Like when he 
did the murders and there was a cartoon, did he think he was seeing himself as 
someone in a comic book, or was it like something in a comic book influenced 
him to do these things?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nailing the root of the controversy over the movie, he also questioned the 
integrity of a media project full of violence that criticizes violence in the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the movie, it was saying how our society exploits violence all the time, 
but I was thinking: Doesn't the movie itself exploit violence?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its intellectual remove from your standard muscle action flick, the 
boys said their adrenaline was flowing afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked out of the theater, I wanted to go shoot somebody or 
something," Gavin said. "Not really," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill agreed. "You feel like a rage going." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's overall message about violence was unclear, they said. Mickey and 
Mallory continue to kill without remorse or regret, in the end, leaving a trail 
of 50 dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say," Gavin said. "It's so sarcastic all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bill, "It doesn't give you this direct, direct message. The viewer has to 
figure that out."

VIDEOS; ARMCHAIR VOYAGERS CAN PICK FROM FULL ITINERARY 
</P>

<P>
 Summer and being on the move go together, but if you can't get away, you can 
always cure some of your wanderlust through the movies.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has always loved boats, planes, trains and automobiles . . . and 
attractive stars using them to make tracks. Here are several videos with 
trippin' as a main theme. (And just remember as you hug that couch and it hugs 
back, fall can be a nice time to get away, too.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Bette Davis sees a cruise as a chance to turn her life around in "Now, 
Voyager," the 1942 weep-orama co-starring Paul Henreid. She plays a spinster 
who, after undergoing a little fine-tuning by her psychiatrist (Claude Rains), 
books passage and runs into Henreid, a sophisticated nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's romance in an ocean fog, highly melodramatic. But Davis, as usual, brings 
a hint of jaggedness to her overly sensitive character. The movie also features 
a famous scene involving a couple of smokes, Davis' big, searching eyes and 
Henreid's steady hands. Max Steiner won an Oscar for his lush musical score. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judy Davis is on a mission of her own in "A Passage to India," the 1984 
adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel. Eager to discover the true India, Davis 
leaves England and heads to Bombay by boat. Then it's overland by train. Later, 
she tries a carriage and bike to get around. Wherever she's going, it's always 
hot, and there's troubling sensuality in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis finds much to like about India, especially its foreign, erotic side, and 
is liberated but then ruined by the experience. It's a quietly suggestive 
performance that gets more primitive as the movie goes along. The earthy 
cinematography is often beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put Marilyn Monroe on a bus, and you might not have a long trip but you'll 
at least have a scenic one. In "Bus Stop," the 1956 adaptation of William 
Inge's play, she's the chanteuse who's hounded by a bohunk cowboy (Don Murray) 
and then makes the mistake of boarding a Greyhound with him. She falls in love 
between the bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert do quite a bit of traveling in "It 
Happened One Night," Frank Capra's 1934 comedy gem. He's a newspaperman on a 
big story. She's the rich girl who turns out to mean more to him than the big 
story. While they squabble on their route to romance, the two go cross-country 
by bus, car and leg. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be Capra's best movie, simply because he hadn't given into more 
sentimental impulses at this point in his career. The much-loved but often 
florid style of populist films like "Meet John Doe" and "It's a Wonderful Life" 
is nowhere to be seen in this one. "It Happened One Night" is a fast 
wisecracking kick. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon witness a gangland murder, they're inspired 
to dress in drag and board a train filled with female musicians. "Some Like it 
Hot," released in 1959, is Billy Wilder at his most agile. It's also Curtis' 
most entertaining performance, and probably Lemmon's as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pee-wee Herman (a.k.a. Paul Reubens), a walking fetish of the pleasingly 
bizarre, goes on a woolly odyssey in "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." The 1985 flick 
follows Pee-wee in his search for a lost bike, perhaps the coolest bike ever. 
His journey, an amusingly mindless adventure by foot, truck and bus, takes him 
from the deserts of California to the basement of the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a luxury cruise is more your style, book passage with Barbara Stanwyck in 
Preston Sturges' "The Lady Eve." She's a crook, looking for rich guys to fleece 
at cards. When the naive Henry Fonda comes aboard, fresh from a tour of the 
Amazon, she's found her mark. Sturges' customary blithe wit graces this 
near-perfect 1941 screwball comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Then there's "Around the World in 80 Days," released in 1956. David Niven 
takes on a bet to float around the globe in a balloon. Not the greatest movie, 
but almost always colorful as Niven and a cast that includes Cantinflas, 
Marlene Dietrich and Buster Keaton moves from one country to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other moving experiences worth a look are: "Airplane!" (1980), "The Palm 
Beach Story" (1942) "Prizzi's Honor" (1985), "Flying Down to Rio" (1933), "The 
African Queen" (1951), "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" (1987) and "Lost Horizon" 
(1937). SPECIAL SCREENINGS

RESTAURANTS; STEAKING A CLAIM AND WINGING IT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 The parade of regional foods marches on. 
</P>
<P>
 Just check out Brookhurst Street in Fountain Valley, where you can eat at 
either Boston Chicken, which attempts to work yet another wrinkle into the 
rotisserie chicken concept, or Philly's Best, which serves one of the iconic 
American sandwiches, the cheese steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheese steaks are practically a religion in Philadelphia, right up there with 
the Phillies, Bill Cosby and the Liberty Bell. Think of a long Italian roll, 
sliced, lined with cheese and stuffed with pulverized meat and greasy onions; 
in short, an aerobics instructor's nightmare. There's a certain amount of 
controversy about the cheese, by the way. Depending on which Philadelphian you 
talk to, you have to use either provolone, aerosol cheese spread or white 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 The first cheese steak I ever had was at a place called Pat's Steaks in South 
Philly, and without claiming to be a connoisseur of this pleasingly greasy 
treat, I take my cap off to Philly's Best's owner, Bob Levey; his sandwich 
beats Pat's. It comes on an Amoroso brand Italian roll flown in from 
Philadelphia, with a white American cheese lining and a heap of fried onions on 
top of the meat. The cooks here are constantly chopping and grilling the flat, 
ultra-thin slabs of meat, which a manager tells me is cut from the rib eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people ask for marinated sweet red peppers on their sandwich, a condiment 
the restaurant sells in large glass bottles. I prefer my cheese steak au 
naturel , along with a bag of tangy, lightly spiced Wise barbecue potato chips 
and a Frank's Wishniak black cherry soda, two more items Levey also has flown 
in from his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't the end of the of Philadelphia imports. You can get delicious 
chocolate-covered Goldenberg's Peanut Butter Chews (six to a wrapper) and goofy 
little packaged desserts from a company called Tastycakes, such as kreme-filled 
stuff with names such as Coconut Junior and Peanut Butter Kandy Kake. 
</P>
<P>
 Philly's Best doesn't count on cheese steaks alone, however. The hoagie, 
otherwise known as the submarine, is another sandwich taken seriously in the 
City of Brotherly Love. I tried the shop's Italian version -- a salty sandwich 
made with capicollo , salami, provolone, mortadella, lettuce, tomato, a spritz 
of peppery olive oil and a mound of sliced raw onions. Mmmm. (Hope you don't 
have a heavy date.) 
</P>
<P>
 Decor is simple and nostalgic. Walls are blanketed with Eagles, Phillies and 
Sixers memorabilia, as well as photos depicting famous sons of the city, such 
as basketball star Dr. J and former talk show host Joey Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 Philly's Best is inexpensive. Sandwiches are $3.99 to $5.25. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken is the first Southern California branch of an outfit that 
already has more than 400 branches nationwide, with plans to double that by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish them luck, but so far I can't tell what makes this concept so special, 
or at all peculiar to Boston. I happen to come from Boston, and I never saw a 
spit-roasted chicken there (outside a supermarket) until I moved away. This is 
good chicken, mind you, cooked on vertical rotisseries heated by white bricks, 
so it's reasonably juicy and tender, and it has a tasty brown sugar and garlic 
glaze that makes the skin stick to your fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, so it's good. With nearby Claim Jumper and the newly opened Kenny Rogers 
Rotisserie Chicken just down the street, Boston Chicken, which opened in the 
spring, faces a stiff test in its first few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem," opined a young manager when I asked how the chain planned to 
deal with the competition. "No one else around here offers 22 fresh side 
dishes, all made on the premises. Besides, our chicken tastes better." 
</P>
<P>
 Er, maybe. And it needs to be said that these sides have their ups and downs. 
The best of them are a delicious cranberry relish and a fine puree of butternut 
squash, two items dear to Yankee hearts. The cranberry relish is notable for 
crunchy nuggets of plump walnut, which add a welcome complexity. You can also 
get creamed spinach and garlic and dill new potatoes, both safe choices. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wouldn't recommend the salty, yet insipid, stove-top-type stuffing, and 
I can't say much for the baked beans, either, which are sugary enough to make 
your teeth hurt. All chicken orders come with a good, dense loaf of corn bread, 
made with so much shortening it doesn't need butter. 
</P>
<P>
 You might want to try the crusty chicken pot pie as an alternative to the 
roasted chicken. It has a rich top crust tasting faintly of cheese, and the 
filling is both shredded and chunked white meat, peas, carrots, potatoes and a 
well-crafted veloute sauce with a lingering fragrance of tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy to report that the uniformed young staff is unfailingly cheerful and 
polite, and that the dense, ultra-chocolatey fudge nut brownies are great. But 
I still don't think the words Boston and chicken go together like Philly and 
cheese steak.  
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken is inexpensive. Individual meals are $3.99 to $5.99. 
Specialties are $3.99 to $4.99.

PARKER'S PLACE: THEIR SECRET DOVE-HUNTING WEAPON: EGG ROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each summer as September approaches, a batch of Orange Countians begins to 
quiver with a sense of great excitement. This is because September marks the 
opening of the dove hunting season, which signals the final act of summer. Not 
that summer has been less than enjoyable for some of us -- it's just that after 
almost three months of anything, most of us are ready for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 In early August I got my first anxiety dream about the coming season. 
According to my informal polling over the years, nearly 80% of bird hunters 
have anxiety dreams before opening day. Typically, a bird hunter's anxiety 
dream involves forgetting your shells, your gun, your dog, or being part of a 
group of people who refuse to get to the fields on time. 
</P>
<P>
 In my case, the dream was even more odd in that I got up early on opening day, 
had my equipment and dog ready, and got to the field at sunrise. Unfortunately, 
the field of my dreams was the Big Canyon community of Newport Beach. I stood 
there and watched a dove flying high above me (far out of range) but shot 
anyway and of course missed, which is mandatory in hunters' anxiety dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the assembled citizens of Big Canyon began having a party 
unrelated to my hunt in their neighborhood. They pretty much ignored me. Then, 
a huge cop approached me and demanded to know why I was brandishing a shotgun 
in the city limits of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's opening day of dove season," I explained. 
</P>
<P>
 He glared at me. He was wearing an outfit of animal skins and moccasins. He 
looked like something out of "The Deerslayer." Then he gave me a nice little 
leather "license" that had my name engraved on it, and said if I was going to 
hunt Big Canyon this year, I'd need this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good luck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, sir!" 
</P>
<P>
 My second anxiety dream, a week later, was even worse. In this one, I dreamed 
that I was hunting in Arizona and my one-eyed dog, Cassius, fell into a 
flood-swollen river. He was being carried away to certain death. I awoke 
terrified and realized that this had actually happened just last year. I went 
downstairs to see if my four-legged soul mate was OK, and he just barked at me 
like I was The Times delivery person he so loves to torment. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Cassius ready for the season has not been easy. First, about three 
months ago, I put him on a diet because he'd gained so much weight, he'd begun 
to look like a sea lion. His idea of a perfect day was to rise, slide on his 
back down the hillside about 20 feet to wallow in the dirt, eat, then find 
shade and sleep for the remaining 23 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'd remind him it was just a few more months until bird season, he'd lift 
his head slightly, open the lid of his one good eye, look at me without 
comprehension, then crash back to sleep, his head hitting the deck like a 
dropped ham. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, my brother Matt took it upon himself to get Cassius physically fit 
for bird season. He walked Cassius up the hill and to the Alta Laguna 
basketball court almost every day for a month. There they played one-on-one, 
with Cassius developing quite a flair for defense. Then they'd hike back down 
the hill to the house, a two-mile round trip for Matt but a three-mile trip for 
Cassius, who lumbers away every chance he gets to chase lizards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things I like to do is get Cassius "birdy" before the season 
begins. This generally means getting a rock-hard game bird out of the freezer 
and throwing it into the bushes so he can smell it and bring it back. When he 
was a puppy we'd play this game for hours every day. But this summer he showed 
no interest in the pathetic icy treat. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, I suspected, is that we have so many quail, dove and rabbits 
loitering around the house these days. There is food and water for them, and no 
real predators, unless you count Cassius, who is so bored with them he won't 
even look at a covey of 15 birds as they hustle across the driveway. In the old 
days, I'd say "Cassius -- quail!" and he'd bolt after them. Now he just looks 
at me as if I'm addled, yawns, and falls asleep on the padded patio chair.  
</P>
<P>
 I tried to interest him in tennis balls, but he wouldn't lower himself. I 
tried a nice new leather softball dunked in quail scent from a local sporting 
goods store, but he showed no interest in that, either. I tried golf balls, 
racquet balls, even training dummies, but Cassius would retrieve them only 
once, then waddle to his water bucket, tip it over and fall asleep in the 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt solved the problem. He discovered that the only things Cassius would 
enthusiastically "retrieve" were frozen Chinese egg rolls. He knocked dozens of 
these into the hillsides with a baseball bat -- tasty little fungos sailing 
into the brush -- and Cassius found every one. Of course, he ate every one on 
the spot, which got expensive and worked counter to the strict dieting intended 
to make him svelte. 
</P>
<P>
 A few nights later I dreamed that I was hunting and Cassius went out after a 
downed bird but instead brought me back a complete dinner from the Golden 
Peacock Chinese restaurant in Laguna Beach -- minus the egg rolls. I fretted 
and couldn't get back to sleep because I was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting yourself ready for bird season isn't much easier. The trouble with 
doves is that you can only shoot them for a few days every year, so an entire 
year goes by between hunts. What this means is that you don't get anything 
close to realistic practice for these birds, and every season -- at least for 
people at my skill level -- seems as if it's your first. 
</P>
<P>
 So I haunt the local gun range, running up exorbitant bills for rounds of 
trap. By late August I'm usually knocking down 20 or so clay birds out of 25. 
But by now I know enough to expect considerably worse results on real doves, 
because they are fast and wily and can change direction twice a second at 40 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, by the end of a two-day dove hunt, I'll have wasted so much 
ammunition that -- when added to the gas, food, licenses, lodging and egg rolls 
for Cassius -- my table-ready doves will cost more per ounce than gold and only 
slightly less than weapons-grade plutonium.  
</P>
<P>
 So by now we're more or less ready -- man and dog -- to partake in the 
atavistic ritual of the hunt. We've honed our bodies and minds to predatory 
readiness. We've got bold new recipes picked out, should we come back with 
enough birds to actually make a meal. We look at the doves flying over the 
house each evening, imagine them marinated and grilling on our Weber. We look 
forward to doing something that men and dogs have been doing every fall, more 
or less, since the beginning of time.

CHRYSLER IS ACCUSED OF RESELLING 'LEMONS'; AUTOS: DMV SAYS VEHICLES WERE PASSED 
OFF TO UNWITTING CONSUMERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. COMPANY DISPUTES THE 
FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California state agency has accused Chrysler Corp. of reselling "lemons" to 
unsuspecting buyers without telling them it had repurchased the cars from 
previous owners because of defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles said the allegations involve 118 Dodges, 
Jeeps, Chryslers and Plymouths sold to consumers through dealerships in 
Northern California. The model years are 1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chrysler spokeswoman on Wednesday denied the allegations, saying the auto 
maker is in full compliance with California law and disputes with the DMV's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have evidence that we have made full disclosure and we have a 
meeting set up with the DMV to go over the material," spokeswoman Rita McKay 
said. She declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty, Chrysler faces possible revocation or suspension of its 
license to sell cars in California, though a fine is considered more likely. 
General Motors Corp. paid $330,000 in April to settle similar charges, while 
denying any intent to defraud or mislead consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV said its investigation shows that Chrysler delivered most of the 
repurchased vehicles to a Northern California auction house, which then 
allegedly resold them to auto dealers. The dealers then allegedly sold the cars 
to consumers. The dealers and the auction house have not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 A new car is considered a lemon in California if its defects are not fixed 
within four attempts or after 30 days in the shop during the first year of 
ownership. Car owners can sue manufacturers to force them to repurchase a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group, estimates that 
about 50,000 lemons are repurchased nationally each year. While it isn't known 
how many of them are then resold, consumer groups have called for closer 
monitoring of what becomes of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Voters, a Sacramento consumer organization, argues that cars with 
serious mechanical defects should be sold for scrap only. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the defects involved in the Chrysler case couldn't be learned 
Wednesday. Consumer advocates said that in general, auto makers repurchase cars 
only if problems are serious and beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the ones they buy back are the worst ones -- the ones they can't 
repair. But if the manufacturer can't fix it, how can anyone else fix it?" 
asked Rosemary Shahan, president of Motor Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV made the allegations against Chrysler on Aug. 17 in an administrative 
filing. It did not become public until Wednesday, when Motor Voters obtained a 
copy.  
</P>
<P>
 The charges will be heard by an administrative law judge, who will recommend a 
decision to Department of Motor Vehicles Director Frank S. Zolin. Zolin may 
accept or reject the judge's decision, or render a decision of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In its charges, the DMV accused Chrysler of fraud and deceit in connection 
with the sale of the vehicles. The agency said Chrysler failed to include a 
statement disclosing that the car was repurchased because of a defect. The law 
also requires manufacturers to tell buyers what was wrong with the car, which 
the DMV said Chrysler failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV said only that its investigation resulted from a consumer complaint. 
But San Francisco lemon law attorney Brian Kemnitzer said he turned over to the 
DMV records on 150 Chrysler vehicles that had been repurchased under the lemon 
law and resold to dealers at Golden Gate Auto Auction in Hayward. Auction 
officials could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The GM case involved 51 cars repurchased by the manufacturer and 34 Northern 
California dealerships, which were also charged. A DMV spokesman said the 
settlement with GM barred the agency from discussing the case. Lemon Aid 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, a new car is considered a lemon if a substantial defect 
affecting the use, value or safety of the car remains after four repair 
attempts or 30 days in the shop during the first year. Here are steps the 
consumer organization Motor Voters recommends to consumers who own lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to resolve problem with the dealer. Keep all work orders and records of 
repair attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * If that fails, write the manufacturer. The address is in the owner's manual. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're still not satisfied, check to see if the manufacturer has an 
arbitration program. If so, you may file a complaint with the arbitration 
board. Typically, a hearing is granted within 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you lose in arbitration, or if your vehicle manufacturer does not have an 
arbitration program, you may sue. A case may take up to a year to get to court. 
If you allege your car is unsafe or inoperable, it must be stored during that 
time. * If you believe you have purchased a car previously designated a lemon, 
you can also file a complaint with the state Department of Motor Vehicles.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SLIPS AS SKEPTICS QUESTION STOCKS' RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late-summer stock market rally stalled Wednesday, as losses in auto and 
technology issues pushed major indexes lower. The dollar and gold were slightly 
higher, but yields slipped.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.88 to 3,913.42, surrendering a small 
portion of a stunning 166-point increase logged over the previous six trading 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors believe there could be an even more serious correction later 
this week or next. "The skepticism about the rally is very widespread," said 
Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, Johnson and others said, is that advancing issues have not mounted 
a good lead on decliners. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, winners led losers by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 364.38 million shares, up from 294.52 
million on Tuesday but still unimpressive, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major financial firms recommended that investors reduce their exposure to 
stocks. Salomon Bros. cut its recommended stock holdings to 45% in a balanced 
portfolio from 50%, saying stocks were not likely to move much higher from 
current prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Securities recommended that investors cut their stock investments to 
50% in a balanced portfolio from 55%, but the firm said the recommendation is 
modest and does not indicate long-term bearishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's losses were minimized by big increases in consumer product issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris increased its regular quarterly dividend to 82.5 cents a share 
from 69 cents and announced a $6-billion share repurchase program. The 
company's stock rose 2 1/2 to 61. That alone helped boost the Dow industrials 
by more than 6 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar gained against most major currencies in quiet trading as the global 
foreign exchange market awaited word on whether Germany will cut interest rates 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The direction of European interest rates continued to play a role in the 
movement of the dollar, traders said. Lower rates in Europe would tend to boost 
the dollar's value by making investments dominated in dollars relatively more 
attractive. Higher rates in Europe would tend to weaken the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a surprise increase in French interest rates raised some concern 
that the decline in European rates over the past few years may be over, which 
helped weaken the dollar against the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traders saw the French move as temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market did not strongly react when the Commerce Department said its 
index of leading economic indicators was flat in July. Economists had expected 
it to drop slightly. Also, the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago said its 
prices-paid index rose to 79.3% in August from 71.9% in July. The report raised 
new anxieties about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets largely ignored a report that orders to U.S. factories fell 2.3% 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks fell after the Wall Street Journal reported that Chrysler 
insiders were selling the company's stock, worried that it may have topped out. 
Chrysler fell 1 1/2 to 48, Ford fell 1 3/8 to 29 1/4 and General Motors slid 1 
3/4 to 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texas Instruments shed 4 5/8 to 77 7/8 after a Japanese court ruled that 
Fujitsu Ltd. had not infringed Texas Instrument's Kilby semiconductor patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the ruling, SoundView Financial Group downgraded its rating on Texas 
Instruments to "short-term hold" from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Other semiconductor stocks also fell, with Intel down 1 1/4 to 65 3/4 and 
Micron Technology off 3 1/4 to 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Airlines parent AMR rose 3/4 to 60 1/4. NatWest Securities raised 
its 1995 earnings estimate on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug maker Warner-Lambert fell 3 1/4 to 83 1/2. PaineWebber downgraded the 
stock to "attractive" from "buy," noting its recent sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Counties Bancorp shot up 47 to 152 1/2 in Nasdaq trading on news of 
its merger with Meridian Bancorp Inc. Meridian dropped 5/8 to 32 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong stocks finished sharply higher, with the main index closing above 
the 9,900 level for the first time since March 14. Other overseas markets were 
slightly higher in slow trading.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ASSISTANCE LEAGUE VOLUNTEERS TO MEET

<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers for the Assistance League of Saddleback Valley, a broad-based 
community support group, will meet Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization takes on a wide range of needs from social work to library 
fund-raising drives in the South County area and is looking for people who can 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will take place at the Mission Viejo Country Club, 26200 Country 
Club Drive, at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistance league members are focusing much of their energy toward the 
Operation School Bell project, which purchases and distributes clothing to 
children in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District and the Capistrano 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who need clothing are referred to the program by administrators and 
social workers in the two school districts.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization also runs a senior meals program that delivered 980 meals to 
elderly persons last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's latest project is a push to help at the Mission Viejo and Lake 
Forest library branches. Volunteers mend worn and broken covers, and shelve and 
label books.FRANK MESSINA

LOS ALAMITOS; JOCKEY BETS ON RACETRACK MANAGEMENT CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Peterson is not your average jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Peterson, who will turn 22 on Sept. 7, leading the quarter horse 
riders' standings at Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico, he also is on his way to a 
bachelor's degree in business at Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 Having recently begun his senior year at UTEP after compiling a 3.75 
grade-point average in three years at Weber State, Peterson is planning a 
career in racetrack management. If it works out, he doesn't foresee being a 
jockey much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get my degree next year and I want to wait and see what kind of 
opportunities come up," Peterson said from Ruidoso. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like management. I like working with people. I like the idea of a business 
environment -- getting up in the morning, putting on a nice, clean suit and 
going to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Peterson, who is 5 feet 6 and 116 pounds, will ride in the 
remainder of the Ruidoso season, which ends Monday, then ride occasionally in 
the State Fair meeting at Albuquerque before moving to Sunland Park on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, he will also attend UTEP four days a week. His classes are 
from 6 to 9 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays, and from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3.4 student in high school and a member of the debating team, Peterson also 
competed in prep rodeos as a calf and team roper, which wasn't surprising 
because his father, Spence, participated in rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence Peterson also raised quarter horses and rode in match races at bush 
tracks, and his son rode in his first race at 15 in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, I didn't know very much," Billy Peterson said. "I just 
watched people and learned and asked lots of questions. I really worked hard 
because it was something I wanted to do really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 After riding in Wyoming, Nevada and Idaho, in addition to attending Weber 
State, Peterson went to Sunland last fall. He considered riding at Los 
Alamitos, but didn't like the way he was treated by Southland colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get an academic scholarship, and the schools I talked to 
weren't very friendly or helpful," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 UTEP awarded him a scholarship, and so did the American Quarter Horse Assn. 
Now, he regularly makes the three-hour drive from El Paso to Ruidoso Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can get (overwhelming) at times," said Peterson, who was married last 
October. "But my wife (Angie) is such a big help. She's always giving me 
support and she helps with school any way she can. Plus, she never misses a 
race, so that's one thing I have going for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, who won the West Texas Futurity at Sunland with Andrews EZ Effort 
earlier this year, is looking forward to his first mount in the All-American 
Futurity on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be aboard Doo Dominate, a son of Coup De Kas out of the Dash For Cash 
mare Ms Doo Dash. The fourth-fastest qualifier for the Futurity, Doo Dominate 
won his trial by a length. He broke his maiden by 1 1/4 lengths after finishing 
third in his debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been very impressive in his last two races," Peterson said. "I think 
he's got a good chance to get a piece of it. It will be an honor to ride (in 
the All-American). It's something I've always dreamed about, and now here we 
are." Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Totally Illegal, a nose loser to Sheza First Down in the Los Alamitos Derby 
earlier in the meeting, was the fastest qualifier in Friday night's trials for 
the $85,000 Governor's Cup Derby. In beating Movados by 1 1/2 lengths, Totally 
Illegal ran 400 yards in 19.85 seconds. Successful in the Governor's Cup 
Futurity last year, the Tolltac filly will try to join Corona Chick and 
Aladuino as the only horses to win both the Governor's Cup Futurity and Derby. 
She is trained by Blane Schvaneveldt and ridden by Henry Garcia. Also 
qualifying for the Sept. 9 Derby were Artesias Special Gal, The Money Crunch, 
Dash For Debbie, Follow The Sign, Daily Triple, Dream A Secret, Movados, 
Rainbow Sun and Ramblin Kind. Racing will be conducted on a Thursday-Monday 
basis this week because of the Labor Day holiday.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; CATCHER MOE BERG: A MYSTERIOUS SLEUTH WHO GOT CAUGHT; 
THE CATCHER WAS A SPY:THE MYSTERIOUS LIFE OF MOE BERG BY NICHOLAS DAWIDOFF ;

 One of the charms of baseball is that it has always sustained sportswriters 
who cover it by providing them with picturesque moments that have become the 
stuff of legend -- from the heroic (Babe Ruth waving his bat at the bleachers 
in Wrigley Field, ostensibly to predict a home run in the 1932 World Series) to 
the ludicrous (Bill Veeck, owner of the pitiful St. Louis Browns, sending a 
midget named Eddie Gaedel to pinch-hit during a 1951 game). 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Moe Berg, a Princeton graduate who entered the major leagues in 
1923, when most other players were small-town boys who may or may not have made 
it through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg spent 10 of his 15 major-league years as a backup catcher for the 
Washington Senators and Boston Red Sox, hanging on primarily because Walter 
Johnson and Joe Cronin, the teams' managers, liked him. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were all there was to Berg, who finished his career with a .243 
average and six home runs scattered among 1,812 at bats, he would only be 
another of the hundreds of obscure players listed in "The Baseball 
Encyclopedia," tucked in my edition between Lou Berberet, a .230-hitting 
catcher who spent most of his seven years with the Senators and Tigers, and 
Augie Bergamo, who got two years with the St. Louis Cardinals during World War 
II because most of their regulars were in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Berg was more than a mere educational anomaly (after all, stars like 
Christy Mathewson and Lou Gehrig were college grads). 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation was burnished by sportswriters who loved his displays of 
erudition, by his obsessive penchant for secrecy, and by the stories, when he 
retired, that he was a spy. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg claimed that he had taken films in Japan during an off-season baseball 
barnstorming tour in 1934 that were useful to the U.S. military after Pearl 
Harbor, and that he had worked for the OSS (predecessor to the CIA) in Europe 
during the war, assessing whether Germany might make good on its promise to use 
an atomic device as its last, and most devastating, super-weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Dawidoff's meticulously researched biography reveals that both 
stories were essentially true, although both were embellished by Berg, who 
spent the last quarter-century of his life as a freeloader whose currency as a 
house guest was not only his wide-ranging intelligence, but the assumption of 
most of his hosts, never contradicted by their guest, that he continued to be a 
spy. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't. Dawidoff describes a lonely soul who could bear only infrequent 
intimacy -- he had a few serious relationships with women, and no close male 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg never learned to drive, so he literally trudged though life, leaving 
behind a trail of newspapers (he read as many as 10 a day) and secondhand books 
that he occasionally bought or was given by store proprietors who enjoyed his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg's reputation as a spy rested first on his 1934 movie of Tokyo. Dawidoff 
makes the case that his footage revealed nothing of military value, but did 
serve as the calling card which got him his job with the OSS. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his work during the war, Berg, armed with a pistol and a poison 
capsule, attended a lecture in Zurich delivered by German physicist Werner 
Heisenberg in December, 1944, with instructions to kill Heisenberg if he 
revealed the Germans were close to constructing an atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg concluded from the presentation only what other OSS spies had reported, 
that the Nazi regime was not at all near completion of a bomb. Berg's 
confirmation came with hefty luxury-hotel bills, a fiscal characteristic that 
put him in bad odor when he tried to catch on with the CIA after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dawidoff tracks his elusive subject, it is easy to agree with a bookseller 
who described Berg as "a professional liar, a layabout who lived on his brother 
. . . a self-invented mystery, a charming chap, but an outright fraud. The 
mystery is that there is no mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, but in the last 40 or so pages, as Dawidoff describes Berg's 
difficult relationships with his brother and sister, and then assesses the 
effect of their emotionally distant father on all of them, the story becomes 
more than a search for the core of someone who spent his life making himself a 
mystery, but a dark, moving human tragedy.

A LONG WAY BACK TO ODYSSEY; THEATER: AFTER WINNING A TONY AND ACCUMULATING 
HUNDREDS OF ACTING CREDITS, JOHN RUBINSTEIN IS IN 'SIGHT UNSEEN,' BACK AT THE 
THEATER WHERE HE WROTE MUSIC FOR ITS OPENING PRODUCTION 25 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor John Rubinstein was at his Tarzana home reading the newspaper one 
morning when he came upon a review of Donald Margulies' "Sight Unseen" at the 
Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very moving, very interesting and very original," recalls Rubinstein, 
who had seen and admired the play in New York. "I started mumbling to myself 
that I wish I'd known it was coming here. . . . It's the kind of play that you 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Tony-winning actor got his chance the other day. His old 
college pal Ron Sossi, artistic director of the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, was 
recasting that very show for an extended run and gave Rubinstein a call. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing was right. And, last weekend, Rubinstein began playing "Sight 
Unseen's" Jonathan, a very successful painter who, looking for connection, 
visits his old girlfriend and her husband. He is rarely offstage, alternately 
aging and becoming young again, discussing everything from love and family to 
art and Judaism.  
</P>
<P>
 "John seemed perfect for the role," says producer Sossi. "The play requires a 
character who is intellectual, an artist (and) can indulge in some 
self-examination." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough, demanding part, perfect for a man who clearly relishes 
challenges. He's been acting, writing music and otherwise performing all his 
adult life, sometimes even commuting between the East and West coasts on a 
weekly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubinstein moved back to Los Angeles, where he was born 47 years ago, in 1992. 
Here, in his sprawling ranch home, assorted photographs, scrapbooks, books and 
magazines reflect that rich professional life. His two children from an earlier 
marriage are off at college; asleep down the hall is 6-month-old son Peter, son 
of the actor and his dancer-actress wife, Jane Lanier. Jonathan is the sort of 
complicated guy Rubinstein loves to portray onstage. Speaking of his characters 
in such plays as Mark Medoff's "Children of a Lesser God" and David Henry 
Hwang's "M. Butterfly," Rubinstein says, "These are people who have a surface 
manner that is one kind of thing, and slowly, as the play unfolds, you see all 
these other sides." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sight Unseen" began life at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa in 1991 and 
has since joined the ranks of regional theater's most-produced plays. 
(Elizabeth Norment, who originated the role of former girlfriend Patricia at 
South Coast, is in the Odyssey production.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful feeling to walk out on stage knowing you're going to tell a 
great story," Rubinstein says. "It's like the wonder in a child's eyes when you 
say, 'Once upon a time,' and you know where you're going and they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Sight Unseen' begins as a strange sort of comedy of manners (when) this 
alien comes into a world that he doesn't fit in," continues Rubinstein 
enthusiastically. "Then it very quickly turns into a sad, nostalgic love story. 
Then, suddenly, it's a very interesting and multifaceted discussion of art and 
the role of the artist in society. And it's all of a piece. It's not tacked on. 
It is what the play's about.  
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes a play about breaking with one's family and the weight of your 
family and the baggage they carry with them and pass on to you. And that is 
also true of art, be it painting, drama, sculpture, music or literature. We're 
learning from and working out of the traditions of the past but also trying to 
break from them and create our art in and of itself." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of play that hooked him into acting in the first place. The son 
of famed pianist Artur Rubinstein, the actor started piano lessons at age 4. 
But it became apparent very quickly, he says, "that I wasn't virtuoso concert 
pianist material. I was musically adept, gifted and I had a very good ear (but) 
in my family, I knew what a great concert pianist was." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially raised in New York, Rubinstein also knew what great theater was. 
"New York in those days, from the mid-'50s to mid-'60s, was such an explosively 
exciting time in the theater. I went to all the plays and it just lit me up on 
fire. I just couldn't turn away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to UCLA to study theater and was acting during his three years there. 
He and Sossi were both in a 1965 UCLA production of "Threepenny Opera," and, in 
1966, Sossi directed Rubinstein's first musical, "The Short and Turbulent Reign 
of Roger Ginzburg." When Sossi chose Brecht's "A Man's a Man" to launch his new 
Odyssey Theatre in 1969, he asked Rubinstein to write the music and do piano 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 All of his careers sort of grew simultaneously, he explains. He won a Tony for 
"Children of a Lesser God," which he originated at the Mark Taper Forum in 
1979, and starred in a reworking of Stephen Sondheim's "Merrily We Roll Along" 
at La Jolla Playhouse in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared in his first film, "Journey to Shiloh," in 1966, playing a dying 
Confederate soldier. Then, he says, came "hundreds of rapists, murderers, drug 
addicts and bad hippies." He sang barbershop quartet with Elvis in MGM's "The 
Trouble With Girls," then went on to appear in many films and, he says, on 
"virtually every television show."  
</P>
<P>
 Those are just his acting credits for, as he says, "I've always kept music 
going." The modern-day Renaissance man has written two more musicals, as well 
as theatrical incidental music. He has composed, orchestrated and conducted 
musical scores for five movies and more than 50 television films, plus weekly 
themes for TV's "Family" and "China Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubinstein shows no signs of slowing down now either. He has a recurring role 
on TV's "RoboCop," and just recorded the audiotape of Tom Clancy's "Debt of 
Honor." Cast as "a Donald Trump wanna-be" in "919 Fifth Ave.," the pilot for a 
new CBS show written by Dominick Dunne, Rubinstein is set to co-direct and star 
in a revival of Elmer Rice's 1931 play "Counselor-at-Law" later this fall for 
North Hollywood's Interact Theater Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sight Unseen" plays Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7 
p.m. through Sept. 25. Tickets $17.50-$21.50 from the Odyssey box office, 2055

GEARING UP FOR FIGHT NIGHT ON TUESDAYS; TELEVISION: WHO'LL WIN THE 'FRASIER' 
VS. 'HOME IMPROVEMENT' MATCHUP? IT WON'T BE VIEWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NBC comedy "Frasier," a spinoff of "Cheers," came flying out of the chute 
last season and in no time at all became a member of the ratings elite. 
</P>
<P>
 The big surprise, however, was how confident and stylish the show looked for a 
brand-new entry. The writing was snappy and smart. The cast, headed by "Cheers" 
veteran Kelsey Grammer, seemed like a closely knit veteran ensemble with 
several seasons already under its belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Paired with "Seinfeld," "Frasier" gave NBC a potent Thursday one-two punch, 
with both series almost automatically finishing in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 A network dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC had bigger dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck in third place in the ratings, NBC decided that "Frasier" was the lethal 
weapon it needed to build another strong night and boost its prime-time 
momentum on the long road back. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, NBC stunned the industry last spring by announcing that its new hit -- 
in which psychiatrist Frasier Crane returned home to Seattle to start a 
radio-advice show -- would switch to Tuesdays and challenge ABC's entrenched 
"Roseanne" series head-on this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some "Frasier" executives and cast members say they were "shocked," 
"horrified" and yet also flattered at the network's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more of a shake-up to come. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, probably sensing that "Roseanne" would still win but that the series was 
aging and vulnerable, last week yanked it from Tuesdays, switched it to 
Wednesdays and counterprogrammed "Frasier" with its big bazooka, "Home 
Improvement." Their first battle will be Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the seemingly invincible "Home Improvement," last season's No. 1 show, 
demolish "Frasier," as it did "Seinfeld" in the past? Will "Frasier" hold its 
own? 
</P>
<P>
 NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield thinks ABC has blinked. He 
quotes an advertising executive as saying: "The first big battle of the season, 
'Frasier' vs. 'Roseanne,' is over. The result: 'Frasier, TKO." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe. But "Roseanne" could also wind up No. 1 if "Frasier" and "Home 
Improvement" cut into each other's audience. It won't have any comedy 
competition at 9 p.m. Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield dismisses the notion that "Frasier" could get hurt by "Home 
Improvement," saying: "It won't. It's too popular a show. It's a rocket ship 
right now. Nothing can stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Counters ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert: "NBC picked this fight by 
moving 'Frasier' to Tuesday night at 9. Since they picked a fight, we'll finish 
it. I felt provoked to take action to protect the long-term interests of ABC on 
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 'Frasier' is very well done," he adds. "But everybody likes 'Home 
Improvement' -- all age groups and demographics. They don't get nearly the 
creative credit that they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back at the "Frasier" offices. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense mincing words," says Peter Casey, one of the creators of the 
series. "We were not happy at all being moved out of Thursday nights. We felt 
we earned that spot and performed incredibly well. We wanted to remain there. 
It bugged us because (NBC) moved our other show, 'Wings,' too" -- also to 
Tuesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds David Lee, another of the creators of "Frasier" and "Wings": "We don't 
mind being a good soldier, but we don't want to be the entire army." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne" looked tough enough to the "Frasier" producers. And then came the 
howitzer called "Home Improvement." But Lee, Casey and co-executive producer 
Christopher Lloyd (not the actor) maintain that they will not alter the series 
to adjust to the ABC competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did sophisticated stories," says Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to change the show at all," says Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 They also vow to avoid a lot of stunt casting. But former "Cheers" star Ted 
Danson is mentioned as a possible guest performer. Bebe Neuwirth, another 
"Cheers" regular whose character was once married to the stuffy Dr. Crane, was 
a notable guest-star on the "Frasier" series last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at NBC's strategy, Lee concedes that the move of "Frasier" is in a 
sense "flattering. They (NBC) made this bold move" -- and "Roseanne" was 
switched. "So they (ABC) blinked, and that's kind of neat." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we held 'Home Improvement' to a draw" in the ratings, cracks Casey, "I 
don't think you could find enough champagne in these halls. I understand what 
NBC is trying to do. They don't want forever to win (only) one night a week. In 
that case, I think NBC made a very good point. I wish they'd made it with 
'Seinfeld' and 'Mad About You' instead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 James Burrows, who directed 13 of the 24 "Frasier" episodes last season, says 
that NBC's move of the series "shocked" him "initially, and then I applauded." 
He thinks it's a smart tactic, "akin to moving 'The Simpsons' opposite 'Cosby.' 
I know they (NBC) did a lot of research. The fact that they made ABC screw up 
two of their nights is significant because TV-watching is a habit." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, of course, it comes down to networks' using hit shows as weapons, 
often to the chagrin of viewers who have to choose between highly popular 
series -- as with "Frasier" and "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two shows have distinctly different appeal, VCR use might 
increase during the competition, and overall network viewership conceivably 
could rise as people tune in the competing hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams, co-creator of "Home Improvement," isn't happy with the move of 
his series either. He says "Frasier" has "an appealing cast and it's 
well-written and that puts it in the front of the pack. It's funny and it's 
considered smart, and it is."  
</P>
<P>
 An NBC spokesman said Grammer declined to comment on the latest network moves. 
But Littlefield says that when he told Grammer that "Frasier" was being 
switched to Tuesdays, the actor had a positive response, saying he wasn't 
surprised and that he was confident the show would do well wherever it played. 
</P>
<P>
 If quality was all that counted, "Frasier" would indeed hold its own anywhere. 
It's one of the most consistently satisfying series to come along in years. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hyde Pierce, who plays Grammer's slightly askew psychiatrist brother, 
and Jane Leeves, the home-care worker, think a key reason the show has 
succeeded is the professional rapport that quickly developed among the cast 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the NBC and ABC program-switching, Pierce says: "Basically, everything 
that's happened has been a compliment. The fact that NBC would want to build a 
night around us is a compliment, and the fact that ABC had concerns about what 
kind of threat we might pose is a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sizing up "Frasier's" appeal, Leeves says: "It has a little bit of everything. 
There are these two intellectual windbags (Frasier and his brother) for the 
intellectuals. There's the working class -- me and Martin (the crusty, ex-cop 
father of the brothers, played by John Mahoney). And there's a dog (Eddie) for 
the kids. What more could you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing her own confidence in the show's future, Leeves says: "I think 
'Frasier' has its own legs. It doesn't need 'Seinfeld' as a lead-in. Obviously, 
ABC is worried."

 "What stands out to me," says Mahoney, "is I don't think we ever had a bad 
script. Over the summer, I've watched the reruns, and I'm constantly struck by 
the level of the writing."

 When the show was moved -- at first against "Roseanne" -- he says, "I was 
horrified. I thought, 'Well, you don't get very long to rest on your laurels.' 
" As for now going up against "Home Improvement," he says: "I don't think we 
have the same audience. We don't have any children on our show. We're a more 
cerebral show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly think that we'll have an audience. It's not going to be as big as the 
one we had, but I don't think we're going to go down the tubes. I think we're 
going to have legs of our own. I really don't think it's going to be as 
devastating as when I first heard about it."

BEAUTY AND CULTURE: A BEAST DECLAWED BY FEMALE WRITERS; COMMENTARY: TOPICAL 
STAGE PRODUCTIONS AND A TV SHOW CARRY ON THE TASK OF DEMYSTIFICATION.

 Does anyone remember the 1986 Newsweek story that said a 40-year-old single 
woman has as much chance of getting married as of being killed by a terrorist? 
Most people do remember it because Susan Faludi exposed the study on which it 
was based as insidious tripe in "Backlash," her 1991 bestseller. Have we 
traveled far from the time when our culture gleefully reinforced the myth that 
the worst and most useless thing a woman can be is single? Most women over 30 
know that we have not. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if we have made any progress at all in this respect, it's at least partly 
because female writers have enlightened the entire population as to another 
side of the story, another set of possibilities for understanding the world and 
its values. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lisa Loomer's dark comedy "The Waiting Room," at the Mark Taper Forum, a 
woman named Wanda (Jacalyn O'Shaughnessy) relates that her mother had sent her 
the infamous Newsweek article. Wanda did not go into a deep depression, nor did 
she throw it out and forget about it. Being a woman of action, she bet her 
mother a hundred bucks she'd beat the odds and, abetted by money from her 
father and various boyfriends, she "got to work." Several cosmetic surgeries 
later, still unmarried, riddled with cancer quite possibly caused by her breast 
implants, Wanda finds herself re-examining her priorities, her culture, her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loomer and O'Shaughnessy make us care deeply about this foolish, sharp-tongued 
party girl with the spirit of a heroine in a screwball comedy -- except that 
we'd like to think that our screwball comedy heroines would have the confidence 
to avoid massive plastic surgery. But what if Carole Lombard, say, didn't have 
that confidence until she was restructured? What if our culture makes it near 
impossible for some people to have natural confidence?  
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that we all need to examine our complicity in reinforcing 
dangerous standards of beauty, and this Loomer does with great humor and much 
intelligence. In a doctor's waiting room, Wanda befriends two women from other 
eras, one Chinese, whose description of the putrefying flesh that occurs in 
foot-binding shortens the minimal oxygen available to the other, a corseted 
Victorian, who nearly faints. No one could miss the connection between 
civilized butchery from the last century and today. This is not a subtle play, 
but this is not a subject that demands subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, a remarkably similar (and also remarkably unsubtle) musical 
comedy on this very subject played earlier this year at the Actors Gang in 
Hollywood. In "Hysteria," playwright Tracy Young asks us to consider two 
sisters who thumb through Vogue, asking themselves, "How do I differ/From 
Claudia Schiffer?" One of them decides to go for plastic surgery, another gets 
pregnant because the pill made her sick and her diaphragm gave her an infection 
and her husband, who has now left her, refused to use a condom. Young sets 
these painfully familiar dilemmas side by side with those of the sisters' 
grandmother, Miss Lilymoist Teagarden, whose lascivious doctors prescribe 
enforced bed rest for Lily's "hysteria," which of course makes this already 
nervous young woman a complete basket case. 
</P>
<P>
 Since bed rest did nothing for Loomer's high-strung Victorian in "The Waiting 
Room," the character's doctor husband is advocating ovariotomy. It's no 
coincidence that these two plays address identical ideas in a similar bright, 
comic voice, perhaps in the hope that if we can laugh at the ridiculousness of 
our own cultural habits, we can change them. The time has obviously come for 
women to confront the "beauty myth," as Naomi Wolf named it, that eats up so 
much of our confidence, money and valuable time. Perhaps it constitutes one of 
feminism's last frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 One local group that's joined the fight is the Sacred Naked Nature Girls, who 
regularly perform naked, and are at Highways through Sunday. How enlightening 
it is to see women strip themselves with no intention of catering to a man's 
eye. These women say in their bios they believe their bodies are their texts. 
Their texts. Watching them, we realize how unusual it is to see female nudity 
in a context that is controlled entirely by women. It feels different and, even 
though sex is a part of the Nature Girls' subject, it feels less erotic. As 
Michel Foucault pointed out, eroticism is apparently as learned and changeable 
as notions of beauty. Certainly Loomer suggests as much in a scene involving 
the fetishism of bound feet in "The Waiting Room." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanda comes to understand that notions of beauty and eroticism are dangerously 
erratic. She begins as the kind of good-time girl whose troubles some women 
have trouble feeling empathy for. Who would have three breast surgeries (not to 
mention the nose, cheek and jaw jobs) in order to look better for men, or, like 
the dancer in "A Chorus Line," to get more work? Fewer and fewer of us, one 
hopes. Who would spend, as Wanda has calculated, 6,750 hours of her life on her 
hair and makeup? Most of us would prefer not to tally up that one. If, in the 
search for beauty and self-image, there is a line between what is healthy and 
pleasurable and what is insane, it may lie in whether or not we do violence to 
ourselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course the line is different for every person, every culture, every 
generation. "She TV," a witty new ABC-TV comedy show about the travails of 
women, recently featured three wealthy ladies at lunch, discussing their latest 
operations. The world of cosmetic surgery is so familiar to them that when one 
mentions she is off for her acid peel, another estimates that her recovery time 
will have her back at lunch in 10 weeks, at Thanksgiving. "Thanksgiving?" 
offers the third woman. "No, please, with an acid peel she'll still be scarring 
and crusting at Thanksgiving." The women discuss this pleasantly then almost 
gag when one finds a hair in her endive salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Every culture has its disgusting, accepted customs. When critic Thorstein 
Veblen wrote "The Theory of the Leisure Class" in 1899, he noted that in many 
cultures, when a woman "is useless and expensive, she is consequently valuable 
as evidence of pecuniary strength." This explains both the constricted waist of 
the Victorian era and the deformed foot of the Chinese, and, arguably, plastic 
surgery as well. "The connection," writes Veblen, "between the aesthetic value 
and the invidious pecuniary value of things is of course not present in the 
consciousness of the valuer." Until, of course, the real, economic issues 
behind that aesthetic value are made absolutely clear, which robs the ideal of 
beauty of its objective truth. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Wanda finally dreams of in the end -- instead of perfect, 
surgically enhanced breasts, a kind of beauty that comes from within. Wanda 
imagines a time when women who want to know how they look will not go to the 
mirror held by the magician, that is, the plastic surgeon, or by anyone who 
profits in one way or another from a woman's insecurity. Instead, they will go 
to a friend who would say, "Oh, gimme a break, you look fine!"

 JANE DOE: The Dana Point Headlands area was awash with spotlights this week as 
a film crew from NBC's TV show "Unsolved Mysteries" finished an episode about a 
nearly 7-year-old mystery. It's the bizarre death of a still-unidentified 
strawberry-blonde teen-ager who leaped off a 150-foot cliff near Dana Point 
Harbor on Sept. 20, 1987. . . . "She told a cabby to take her as far as $18, 
which was the cliffs," producer Tim Rogan said. The young woman was picked up 
at the Hampton Inn in Mission Viejo, and where she came before that, "nobody 
knows." Tentative broadcast date: Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S COLLEGIATE? What college professors are wearing to class these days 
might not be what you'd expect (E1). Proponents of the surf-washed West Coast 
collegiate look say they are driven to jeans and shorts by the local climate 
and economics. . . . Example: At UC Irvine, administrators recently circulated 
a memo urging faculty and staff to "put away your coats, ties and pantyhose and 
slip into some cool cotton." The reason: It seems that the campus air 
conditioners were being overtaxed.

 BASEBALL FIX: With the major league baseball strike reaching Day 21 today, 
fans are desperate for baseball action (OC Live!). They're not eating faux 
peanuts yet. . . . But as a diet substitute, some of the best high school 
players in the world will meet in Long Beach this weekend at the ninth annual 
Goodwill Series at Blair Field. Eric Valent, a junior at Canyon High School in 
Anaheim, is the only county player on the 20-player U.S. roster. They play 
Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 ODOR BE GONE? Relief is on the way for Huntington Beach residents near Central 
Park who complained about their skunk problem. They can take a plastic bag to 
the Shipley Nature Center at the park, and will be given free a product called 
OdorGone. . . . Odorless and not harmful to humans, it supposedly acts like a 
magnet to attract offensive molecules. The city will also begin trapping the 
skunks this weekend for transfer to a wilderness area.

STATE SENATE SENDS PANTS-AT-WORK BILL TO GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reversing itself, the state Senate sent the governor a bill that would make it 
illegal for employers to deny women the option of wearing pantsuits or slacks 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), who previously had opposed the bill on grounds 
that it trivialized advancements made by women, cast the decisive 21st vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said Gov. Pete Wilson has not yet taken a position on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill emerged from the Assembly last spring as a relatively 
non-controversial proposal that would make it an illegal discriminatory 
practice for an employer to prohibit a woman from wearing pants at work. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was narrowly scuttled in the Senate twice last week by opponents who 
charged that it unnecessarily interfered with the right of employers to 
establish dress standards for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight female members of the Assembly then marched on the stately Senate 
chambers, suggesting that the upper house was making a mistake that could anger 
roughly half the voting population. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday in the final hours of the two-year legislative session, the 
Senate reversed itself, passing the measure 21 to 15 and sending it to the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 They inserted the defeated bill into a pending measure by Sen. Charles 
Calderon (D-Whittier), which would stiffen the fines for charging higher prices 
based on gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon offered the bill on the Senate floor Wednesday as an attempt to 
reduce discriminatory pricing and to recognize in the law the freedom of women 
to wear pants at work. "Why would any employer want to require dresses and 
skirts only?" Calderon asked. "We are not telling an employer how to run their 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park), who authored 
the original legislation, said the measure exempts employers who require women 
workers to wear uniforms or similar clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 On an initial roll call Wednesday, the bill fell two votes. Then, the 20th 
favorable vote was cast, followed by Killea's. 
</P>
<P>
 She later said that she still considered the pants issue an "inconsequential 
matter," but that she voted for the bill because she favored its new 
prohibitions against discriminatory gender pricing practices.

MISSING TITLE FOR OFFICIAL HALTS STUDENT CATALOGUE; EDUCATION: OXNARD COLLEGE 
CHANCELLOR, WHO HOLDS A DOCTORATE, WAS NOT DESIGNATED 'DOCTOR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a title? Not much, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard College President Elise D. Schneider thought it important enough to 
stop the presses when she discovered that county Community College Chancellor 
Thomas G. Lakin was identified only as a Ph.D. and not a doctor in the 
college's new catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 She halted printing a month ago after more than 1,000 catalogues that do not 
identify Lakin as a doctor already were printed. All but one of the other top 
administrators listed in the catalogue are identified as doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The leftover catalogues were checked with red ink in the upper left corner to 
prevent them from being sold or distributed to other colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxes of them now are being given away to teachers, freshman and transfer 
students. Meanwhile, across campus at the bookstore, new catalogues that list 
the chancellor as Dr. Thomas G. Lakin are being sold for $2.95 plus tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The alteration did not cost the college any additional money, Schneider said, 
because the books are published at the campus bookstore. "Anytime we find an 
error, we just correct it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every catalogue, whether naming the chancellor doctor or not, will be put to 
good use, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes have created a glut of catalogues available for counselors 
like Gil Ramirez, who said that in previous years he has had trouble finding 
enough of the books to give to his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we might give away maybe 20 catalogues, but now we have four cases 
(of 50 each) to give to students," Ramirez said. "They're usually very hard to 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin said he was unaware of any changes in the catalogues that identify him 
as a doctor. "I didn't even know they were having them reprinted," he said. "I 
don't know whether my name was changed or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The college each year prints about 5,000 of the catalogues, which are 
distributed throughout the school year. They describe classes offered by the 
school and detail requirements needed to transfer to universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was directed to take the books off the shelves that didn't have 'Dr.' and 
replace them with the corrected copies," said printer Augie Castaneda, 
assistant manager of the bookstore. "All the ones that were pulled were sent to 
admissions." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that for the last three years the catalogues have listed Lakin as 
a Ph.D., not doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 College Registrar Delores Tabor-King, who supervises distribution of the 
catalogues at the admissions office, said she sees no difference between the 
number of catalogues sent out so far this year compared to previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she could not explain why counselor Ramirez has 10 times more 
catalogues to give to transfer students this year than last. Nor could college 
Vice President Ronald Jackson, who supervises the transfer and counseling 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm curious as to that, too," Jackson said. "I was not aware that he only had 
20 (last year). We give our counselors catalogues based on their needs, and 
there was no shortage of catalogues last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Schneider's assurances, one college employee said he worries that 
removing 1,000 catalogues from sale could sap needed revenue from the college 
district, which is facing a $2.5-million budget shortfall this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In times when we're talking about possible layoffs and having to maybe even 
cancel some classes, that (money) could have brought in an extra part-time 
instructor or maybe save a position," said the employee, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students don't look at that first page to see whose title was left off," he 
said. "They look at the class requirements."

VELTHOEN SAYS HIS IMAGE WAS DAMAGED; PORT HUENEME: CITY MANAGER THREATENS 
'UNPLEASANT' CONSEQUENCES FOR COUNCILWOMAN IF SHE SPEAKS NEGATIVELY OF HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Port Hueneme City Manager Richard Velthoen has accused first-term 
Councilwoman Toni Young of damaging his reputation in comments to other public 
officials -- and threatened to respond with "unpleasant" consequences if she 
continues to discuss the possibility of his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 19 memo to Young and provided to the entire City Council, Velthoen 
accused Young of discussing with many people -- including three Santa Paula 
officials -- the possibility of "getting rid of Dick Velthoen." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is damaging to my reputation," wrote Velthoen, city manager for 19 
years. "It could impair my ability to get another job, should I wish to seek 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's comments to other officials could make agencies consider him a "lame 
duck" and undermine his ability to work on behalf of Port Hueneme, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he warned: "Stop this now. If you choose to continue this practice, 
expect some consequences that will be unpleasant. . . . I am not kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, 57, said in an interview Tuesday that he wrote the memo in response 
to negative comments the 42-year-old Young has been making since she first 
campaigned for City Council in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past two years I have had numerous occasions when people told me that 
she talked to them about getting rid of me," he said. "I told her I had 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a persistent critic of Velthoen and Port Hueneme's four veteran council 
members, said she was surprised and angered by the city manager's memo and 
considers it a direct threat to her political career. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has been targeted not only because of her comments to other 
officials, but because Velthoen and the rest of the council still consider her 
an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, who can be fired at any time by the council, enjoys strong support 
from every member but Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick resents me because I challenge his authority," said Young, who ran on a 
reform platform two years ago. "It aggravates him that I just don't trust him. 
. . . This is a direct result of my behavior on the council. I did not become 
enmeshed in the current system." 
</P>
<P>
 Young acknowledged Wednesday, however, that she did jokingly tell Santa Paula 
City Manager Arnold Dowdy, Santa Paula Councilwomen Margaret A. Ely and Robin 
Sullivan at an early-August gathering that the Port Hueneme council might fire 
Velthoen and hire Dowdy in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, you know, something like, 'We're going to get rid of Dick and hire 
(Dowdy).' But I was not serious," Young said. "I have said things in a way that 
people did not understand what I meant. And I am sorry. I did not mean to hurt 
Dick. . . . He's a fine city manager." 
</P>
<P>
 But she acknowledged making cutting comments about him on other occasions 
during the last two years. And she said she still believes that "anyone who has 
been a city manager as long as Dick has needs to step down. He has had that job 
for too long and we need a fresh face. We need change and that's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before she received Velthoen's memo last week, Young said the city 
manager called her to complain about her comments to the Santa Paula officials, 
and she assured him that she would no longer talk about him in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that I was sorry that what I had said caused him any type of 
pain," she said. But Velthoen has a different recollection of the conversation. 
He said she denied any negative comments about him to Dowdy. And he said he 
never received any assurance from Young that she would stop criticizing him 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said he decided to make his point in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving Velthoen's memo, Young said she considered consulting a 
lawyer. But she decided to frame the memo instead, and has placed it on her 
desk at a Port Hueneme real estate office as a reminder "to keep my mouth 
shut." 
</P>
<P>
 During her brief council tenure, Young has aggressively disagreed with the 
rest of the council -- and the recommendations of Velthoen's staff -- in 
fighting such high-profile proposals as construction of a recreational vehicle 
park at Hueneme Beach and levying the "view tax" on beach-area homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Ken Hess, Dorill Wright and James Daniels all praised Velthoen and 
refused comment on Young in interviews this week. Mayor Orvene Carpenter was 
out of town and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright refused to discuss the Velthoen memo, saying it "is a personal matter 
between the two of them. I don't want to add any fuel to the fire."

NEW '3 STRIKES' CHARGES FILED AGAINST OXNARD MAN; CRIME: SECOND SET OF COUNTS 
FACING DEFENDANT RESULTS FROM ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT CELLMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 52-year-old Oxnard man who allegedly tried to rape his cellmate while 
awaiting sentencing under the state's new "three-strikes" law was charged 
Wednesday under the tough statute a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Carlton McCowan is the first defendant charged under the 
three-strikes provision twice in Ventura County and might be the first in the 
state, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan already faced a 25-years-to-life sentence for stealing 18 bottles of 
cologne when he was charged last month with attempted forcible sodomy and 
attempted sodomy in a corrections facility, both felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Either charge could be used as a basis for a second 25-years-to-life sentence, 
since each new felony beyond the original three can trigger a three-strikes 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors announced their decision to seek the second three-strikes 
conviction against McCowan for the sodomy case during an arraignment Wednesday 
in which the stocky, bearded defendant pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted six months ago, the three-strikes law requires the long prison term 
for anyone convicted of a felony who has two prior serious or violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, McCowan could be ordered to serve back-to-back sentences of 25 
years to life if the sodomy charges against him lead to a conviction, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bob Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a judge wanted to, he could stack two 25-year-to-life sentences," Calvert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily, said prosecutors 
are abusing their authority. "My concern is when you throw enough weak cases in 
the air, the probability is that after a while something will stick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan is one of a handful of Ventura County defendants charged so far under 
the three-strikes law. But his case has drawn an inordinate amount of attention 
because he was first charged under the new law for petty theft, instead of a 
violent or drug-related offense. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling the three-strikes law to the public, supporters promoted it as a 
way to rid California streets of violent offenders and drug dealers. Ventura 
County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury has said that McCowan is violent and 
argued that the three-strikes law is being put to good use in his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddled with a long rap sheet -- including convictions for assault, burglary 
and robbery -- McCowan was accused of stealing 18 bottles of cologne from an 
Oxnard Sav-on Drugs store March 8. That was just one day after Gov. Pete Wilson 
signed the three-strikes measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Because McCowan had a previous theft offense when he stole the cologne, he was 
convicted of felony petty theft by a Superior Court jury July 21 -- paving the 
way for a mandatory three-strikes sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the cologne conviction, as his attorneys prepared an appeal, 
McCowan's 31-year-old cellmate told guards at the Ventura County Jail that 
McCowan had tried to rape him. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who had been serving a short jail term for petty theft, testified at 
a preliminary hearing that McCowan chased him around their small cell for more 
than an hour while trying to molest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors originally charged McCowan with forcible sodomy. But a judge 
reduced the charge to attempted forcible sodomy after hearing the victim's 
testimony. Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele set a jury trial in the sodomy 
case for Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily has filed a motion to overturn the cologne conviction. A hearing is set 
for Sept. 9 in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Calvert said the district attorney's office did not consider 
McCowan's cologne conviction when deciding to charge him as a three-strikes 
defendant a second time. In court papers, prosecutors cite a 1978 residential 
burglary and a 1988 robbery as his first two strikes, and reasons he should 
receive 25 years to life in prison if convicted of attempted sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We evaluate each case on its merits and make the decision, and that's what we 
did in this case," Calvert said.

WORDING OF STATEMENT ON BALLOT CHALLENGED; ELECTIONS: SENTENCE OFFERED BY 
SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATE IS ATTACKED, AND NOW THE PROPOSED REVISION IS ALSO 
CALLED FALSE AND MISLEADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying that a candidate's wording is false and misleading, the Ventura County 
superintendent of shools on Wednesday legally challenged the sample-ballot 
statement of a Ventura woman running for the county school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Elections officials said it may be the first time anyone has filed such a 
legal claim in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Miller, a conservative Christian candidate running for the County Board 
of Education, wrote in her campaign statement that county school trustees 
allowed Supt. Charles Weis "to waste taxpayers' money" when he fired his 
political rival, Dan Flynn, in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller indicated the county board spent money to settle a lawsuit by Flynn 
challenging his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such lawsuit has been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the county schools office telephoned Miller last week about the error, 
she agreed to take the legal steps necessary to change her statement before 
sample ballots are printed and mailed to voters beginning in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out the way I worded a sentence was not correct," Miller said 
Wednesday. "I made a righteous error." 
</P>
<P>
 But now the attorney for the county schools office says Miller's proposed 
revision to her campaign statement is just as false and misleading as the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 43-year-old homemaker, is challenging county schools Trustee Juanita 
L. Sanchez-Valdez for her seat in the district representing Ventura and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 All candidates in local elections have the opportunity to pay for statements 
of up to 200 words that are published as part of the sample ballots mailed to 
all voters. The cost ranges from $150 to $3,200 per statement, depending on the 
office being sought. Miller paid $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The offending sentence in Miller's original campaign statement read: "Recently 
the board allowed the superintendent to waste taxpayers money for a 
lawsuit/settlement after firing a political opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Her proposed replacement: "The board's flagrant failure to review Flynn's 
firing or hold Weis accountable has resulted in a probable costly lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson Parham, the attorney for the county schools office, said county 
school board members have no authority to review personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have no authority to review something, how can it be 'a flagrant 
failure?' " Parham asked. Miller's proposed revision, he said, "is an unfair, 
false and misleading statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than allow the revision to appear in sample ballots, Parham said the 
county superintendent's office will ask the Ventura County Superior Court to 
delete the sentence from Miller's written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's case is scheduled to come before the Superior Court on Sept. 8 -- one 
day before the deadline for printing all sample ballots for the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our point of view that she can delete the sentence and that's all she 
has to do," Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller, a Flynn supporter, has other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 She contends the question of whether the county school board has any authority 
over personnel decisions at county schools is a matter for debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, a former county schools principal, lost his job after unsuccessfully 
challenging Weis for his job in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn learned on June 23 that Weis was canceling his employment contract 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Weis said the firing was due solely to Flynn's poor performance as 
principal of the county's schools for juvenile offenders, Flynn's supporters 
contend the move was politically motivated. They urged the county school board 
to review Weis' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 County trustees -- some of whom expressed concern about the firing -- briefly 
looked into the matter but decided the law gives county school boards no 
authority over a superintendent's personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and some other Flynn supporters argue that the question of the board's 
authority is ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 And Miller said the county schools office has no power to force her to change 
her proposed revision to her campaign statement unless they can prove she is 
wrong in implying the board has some legal authority over personnel issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Any voter has the right to challenge the accuracy of a campaign statement 
prior to the printing of sample ballots, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bradley, the county's assistant registrar of voters, said this is the 
first time that such a legal challenge has been filed in the county during his 
14 years in the elections office, or possibly ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said such challenges will probably become more commonplace as an 
increasing number of candidates choose to buy space on sample ballots to get 
their message to voters. About 150 campaign statements were filed for the 
November election contrasted with only 25 in last November's balloting.

BUSY SATELLITE; STUDENTS CROWDING ONTO CSUN'S VENTURA CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While fall enrollment has plunged to a 21-year low at earthquake-damaged Cal 
State Northridge, the school's satellite campus in Ventura is scrambling to 
accommodate a record number of students this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the small campus -- housed in an office building off Seaward 
Avenue -- say 1,188 students are registered for the fall, a higher preliminary 
enrollment than in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time late registration closes Sept. 16, the number of students 
attending CSUN-Ventura is expected to surge past 1,400, topping last fall's 
final enrollment of 1,305. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the size of a small liberal arts college," campus director Joyce 
Kennedy said. "The taxpayers should be mighty happy because they're getting a 
lot of bang for their buck in terms of the number of students enrolled here." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment at the Ventura campus has risen steadily since its opening 20 years 
ago, growing from the equivalent of 16 full-time students in 1975 to 605 the 
past school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, however, enrollment dipped slightly after the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
despite predictions that the Ventura campus would be flooded with applicants 
fleeing the heavily damaged Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are going to sit out a semester, they normally take the spring 
semester off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the campus' growth underscores the need for a four-year 
university in Ventura County. The state has begun making plans to build a Cal 
State University campus in Camarillo, but budget cuts have left little money 
for new school construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exceedingly frustrating to have labored so long without notable 
progress," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago we had a site and no university. Today we have a university 
and no site," she added, referring to state-owned land in Somis that was 
designated for a campus but was later sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The swell of students this fall has forced administrators in Ventura to juggle 
classes, canceling three with low enrollment and adding eight new sections for 
the most popular courses. Among those added were classes to handle a large 
overflow of students in a Chicano studies class and a class on teaching 
physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time, the campus is offering a two-year credential program 
for bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Hernandez, 24, said she quit her job as an instructional aide in Santa 
Barbara and moved to Oxnard after hearing about the program. She said she likes 
the program's hands-on approach and year of student teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can learn just so much in theory," she said. "With this program, you can 
go into the classroom and practice what you learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Torres, 26, said he signed up for the program in Ventura after being 
turned away from a similar program at UC Santa Barbara, because he missed an 
application deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their goal was to include me in the program, not to keep me out," he said of 
administrators at the Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite last-minute course changes and confusion over room assignments, 
students said the first week of the semester has gone off without any major 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real problem, they say, has been finding a place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, students arriving for evening classes found the lots around 
the school jammed and cars lining both sides of Alessandro Drive near the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Saenz, 22, said he beats the crush by riding his bike from Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it here because it's close to home," he said. "It saves on the cost of 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz and about 20 other students met Wednesday morning for a class on the 
music of Mexico, a course added last week after another Chicano studies class 
was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said they preferred the Ventura campus over Northridge because 
of its size, location near the ocean and the availability of Kennedy and her 
seven-person staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having the smallness of a private school and the advantages of a 
bigger university," said Laurie Zatkowsky of Ojai, who returned to school this 
semester to earn a teaching credential. Student Body Enrollment is growing 
steadily at Cal State Northridge's Ventura campus. Figures represent full-time 
students. The hours of part-timers have been combined to equal full-time 
status. 02,14,07 Student Body 1987 187 1988 270 1989 376 1990 466 1991 520 1992 
553 1993 605 1994 * 600 * Officials expect this number to swell with late 
enrollment, which ends Sept. 16.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GANG MEMBERS HELD IN BIKE THEFT, 
BEATING

 A Thousand Oaks man was in jail Wednesday and a second was released on $20,000 
bail after the pair were arrested in connection with an assault on a man who 
tried to retrieve his wife's stolen bicycle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dario Lopez, 21, was released on bail Wednesday and is scheduled to be 
arraigned Sept. 21 on charges of burglary, strong-arm robbery and vandalism in 
connection with the Monday incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Maddens, 18, was still in jail Wednesday afternoon. He is scheduled to 
be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were arrested after Jerry Seck, who was driving to his house on 
Flittner Circle in Thousand Oaks on Monday, saw two men walking near his home 
with a bicycle resembling his wife's, Sheriff's Sgt. Harold Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Seck, 37, pulled into his garage and saw that the bike was missing, he 
drove around his neighborhood looking for the men. After spotting them a short 
distance away, Seck asked the men to turn over the bicycle, and the two 
attacked him, Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 One used a square liquor bottle to smash out the passenger window of Seck's 
1985 Volkswagen Cabriolet, cutting himself in the process, Humphries said. The 
man then hit Seck in the head with the bottle, Humphries said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man reached through the driver's window and punched Seck in the 
face, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seck drove away without the bicycle and went home to call the Sheriff's 
Department. He was taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, where he was 
treated for scrapes to his head, given a tetanus shot and released, Humphries 
said. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; INSANITY PLEA ENTERED IN BREAK-INS, 
ATTACKS

<P>
 A Newbury Park man accused of breaking into the apartments of two elderly 
Thousand Oaks women and attempting to rape them entered a plea of not guilty by 
reason of insanity Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Patrice D. Koenig said that David Paul Stewart entered the 
apartment of the women, ages 87 and 73, on May 14 and tried to sexually assault 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 33, had entered a plea of not guilty to two counts of residential 
burglary and two counts of assault with the intent to commit rape before 
changing the pleas during an arraignment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell ordered Stewart back to court on 
Sept. 19, after the defendant has been evaluated by two psychologists, who will 
try to determine both his current sanity and his mental state at the time of 
the alleged offense. 
</P>
<P>
 At a June 30 preliminary hearing in which Stewart was ordered to stand trial, 
the older woman said she fought Stewart off by hitting him repeatedly with a 
telephone after he entered her apartment. The other woman said Stewart came 
into her bedroom around 2:30 a.m., touched her and tried to kiss her. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found Stewart still in the apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's detective testified that a drunken Stewart had been spotted at a 
local bowling alley several hours before the attack, making advances at women 
and offering one woman money to have sex with him. DWAYNE BRAY

 Tiny, a 21-year-old former prisoner with a new life and a new attitude, will 
board a bus bound for home in New York on Saturday. Jane McGlory will see to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be praying for him," said McGlory, who since 1985 has run a 
group home in Pacoima for prisoners released from the California Youth 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny, a Puerto Rican from the South Bronx whose real name is Thomas Rosado, 
has lived in McGlory's group home about four years. He moved to Palmdale from 
New York in 1987 with his mother and got into trouble for drug dealing, robbery 
and burglary. His mother died while he was serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he calls McGlory "Moms," like the other residents in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at her and all her family as relatives," Rosado said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlory started working with young men like Rosado 20 years ago after her son, 
William, died of a heroin overdose. He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
 William McGlory died at UCLA Medical Center, where he worked as a patient 
escort. He was found in a bathroom, his body jammed against the door, and the 
paraphernalia of heroin and morphine use on the floor. He had been out of the 
U.S. Army less than a month after serving in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane McGlory got the news just after noon on Thanksgiving Day, 1974.  
</P>
<P>
 "I dropped the phone," said McGlory, who until then had no idea her son had an 
$80-a-day heroin habit. When she told the rest of the family, "It looked like 
time stood still. That was the hardest thing I have had to face in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 But out of the pain of that moment, McGlory made this pledge: "As long as I 
live, I will work so that another parent would not feel the way I felt." 
</P>
<P>
 So, she founded the Pacoima Community Gospel Choir and the Pacoima Community 
Youth Cultural Center, which offers tutoring and activities for teen-agers and 
young adults. The center works with the Boys & Girls Club of the San Fernando 
Valley to put on an annual Thanksgiving dinner for the poor and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 She started her first group home at a house she bought with $20,000 of the 
insurance money she received after her son's death. That three-bedroom house on 
Dronfield Avenue is vacant for now and the group home is now across the street 
at another house McGlory purchased.  
</P>
<P>
 She says she is waiting for divine guidance as to what to do with the original 
house. Maybe she will turn it into a foster care home, she said. "I refuse to 
rent out this house. I always want this house to be something useful for 
humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosado said he had expected McGlory's group home to be a "lock-down" place 
where McGlory would be just another cop issuing passes and controlling his 
life. But it was the love she offered, as well as the food she cooked, that 
helped turn him around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her food was so good." he said. Her fried chicken, sweet potatoes and "soul 
food," as McGlory puts it, were his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlory worked as a Los Angeles County deputy sheriff for six years, and she 
said that training has taught her to recognize when one of the residents is 
trying to con her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind, but I don't want them to mistake my kindness for stupidity," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosado finished his parole term July 15. It was "like getting rid of a 
headache . . . a huge relief," he said. On Wednesday, McGlory bought him a 
one-way ticket back to New York, where a job working with his grandfather, a 
carpenter, awaits him. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I got me a little job to occupy me, I'll be fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGlory is sending him off with a warning about drugs. "Once you do that 
one time, you're in for trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have promised to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this lady," Rosado said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; A SMALL DOG CAUSES LARGE FREEWAY TIE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though he lacks the nine lives of his feline counterparts, a 20-pound 
runaway dog chose to defy the fates Wednesday -- and the patience of motorists 
on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no reason why he wasn't killed over a hundred times on 
the freeway," said Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Animal 
Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The pooch's big adventure began about 1:45 p.m. when the black cocker spaniel 
mix started trotting against traffic in the freeway's northbound lanes at Rose 
Avenue in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 With the California Highway Patrol in pursuit, the dog veered from startled 
motorists and jogged all the way up to the Vineyard Avenue off-ramp before 
returning to the freeway, CHP Officer T.J. McAllister said. The dog then 
trotted another three-quarters of a mile to the Ventura Road off-ramp, where he 
exited for good, McAllister said. Traffic had snarled during the chase that at 
its peak, involved five sheriff's cruisers, an Oxnard police car, two CHP 
units, a motorcycle officer and some civilian motorists, Jenks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until about 40 minutes later, after Animal Control Officer Mike Stewart 
grabbed the dog as it darted from under a truck on Vineyard Avenue, did things 
return to normal, Jenks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But alarmed by the commotion, the dog gave Stewart several nips on his hands. 
The dog will be quarantined for 10 days to ensure that he has nothing 
contagious, Jenks said. She said the dog did not wear an identification tag.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; PANEL NOW OPPOSES JEWISH CENTER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council members have overturned an earlier 
decision to support the expansion of a Jewish worship center, saying the scope 
of the project has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 For about a year, members of the Chabad of the Conejo Valley have used a house 
on Conifer Street as a place to pray and conduct business. In March, they 
submitted plans for a 1,300-foot expansion, which outraged nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory council member Ron Stark said that on July 26 the council agreed to 
urge the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to issue the chabad only a 
six-month conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the council's meeting Tuesday night, a resident's attorney showed 
council members a copy of the chabad's application for a five-year permit, 
Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were also upset by the application's indication that the 
center would be used for evening classes, when they had envisioned it being 
used only on weekends for services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was entirely different than what we said we would support," Stark said. 
"It was like an all-or-nothing deal, so we turned it down." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabbi Moshe Bryski said plans for classes were no secret. "It's been there 
all along," he said, adding that county planners would not allow a six-month 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an application that will be heard before the Ventura County Planning 
Commission and most likely the Board of Supervisors, and that is where this 
will be decided," Bryski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's decision marked the second time the council has changed its stance 
on the expansion issue. The council initially recommended that the plan be 
approved, but reversed its opinion after residents protested this spring, then 
reversed itself again after some changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the council is only an advisory group, the plan will go before the 
County Planning Commission and probably the Board of Supervisors, Stark said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; LIKENESS OF ROBBERY, RAPE SUSPECT 
RELEASED

<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have released a composite drawing to help snare an armed 
robber who also allegedly sexually assaulted two Camarillo teen-agers. 
According to witness accounts, the rapist is a white male 18 to 23 years old; 6 
feet, 1 inch tall; who weighs about 200 pounds and was wearing a long-sleeved 
green shirt, dark baggy trousers and black combat boots. 
</P>
<P>
 The manhunt, directed by Sgt. John Fitzgerald of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department, included 20 to 30 law officers who were to canvass the Camarillo 
area Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said the detail included detectives and others from offices 
throughout the county, but deputies on regular patrol duties were not diverted. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, who wore a ski mask, attacked the 17- and 19-year-old clerks after 
taking about $100 from the cash register at a yogurt shop Monday night in 
Camarillo, deputies said. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; PAIR RESCUE MAN BY LIFTING TRAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cecil Rodriguez and his son, Frankie, are not tall -- about 5 feet, 5 inches 
-- and not especially muscular. 
</P>
<P>
 But they performed a herculean feat when their co-worker most needed it 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 While setting up a 60-foot mobile trailer at Meiners Oaks Elementary School 
near Ojai about 9:50 a.m., the older Rodriguez saw the structure shift from its 
moorings and then heard panicked cries for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Ayala of Riverside had been seated on the opposite side, his legs 
under the edge of the trailer as he worked the tie-down anchor into the earth, 
when the trailer dropped more than a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 46, said he rushed to the source of the cries and found the 
25-year-old Ayala pinched under the trailer, his body folded like a jackknife. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting their backs to the trailer to brace themselves, Rodriguez and his 
21-year-old son, also of Riverside, lifted it enough to allow Ayala to be 
pulled out by a third worker, 18-year-old Javier Arceo, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have been the old adrenaline rush," Deputy Rhett Searcy of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala, who had been trapped about 30 seconds, was taken to Ojai Valley 
Hospital for treatment of back pains and then transferred to Ventura County 
Medical Center, where spokeswoman Denise Stewart said he was in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, Rodriguez and his son attempted to demonstrate how they 
had lifted the trailer, but they could hardly budge it. Rodriguez simply shook 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailer, one of two to be used for the child-care program behind the 
school at 400 S. Lomita Ave., was estimated to weigh as much as nine tons. GREG

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; YOUTHS LIKELY TO BE TRIED SEPARATELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three defendants accused in a brawl that left a pair of Westlake High School 
students wounded probably will be tried separately, lawyers in the case said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys' comments came after the last of the three defendants, John Yi, 
17, of Thousand Oaks, pleaded not guilty to four felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 3 shooting occurred during a melee that pitted one group that 
included Westlake football players against another that included the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi's arraignment had been delayed twice as his family gathered money for the 
defendant's legal bills. Attorney William T. Graysen, who represented Lee 
during the initial stages of the case but declined to appear with his client 
twice in August, was back at Yi's side at Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm with it until the end," Graysen said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 Graysen added that his client definitely will not be tried with the two other 
defendants in the case who are in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark set Yi's trial for Dec. 15, while 
the trials for co-defendants Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet, 16, and William 
Huang, 17, have been set for Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual request, Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli had asked to have 
three juries, all seated in the same courtroom, hear the case. Clark's move to 
give Yi a different trial date indicates that will not happen, Graysen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanarelli declined Wednesday to discuss his three-jury proposal because the 
case is getting nearer to trial. But he said the three defendants would "most 
likely" have separate trials. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR TOURS YOUTH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Jersey's governor on Wednesday accompanied the wife of California Gov. 
Pete Wilson on a tour of a Ventura County juvenile program hailed for keeping 
emotionally troubled youths out of state institutions and saving thousands of 
government dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took a 15-minute walk through the Frank 
A. Colston Youth Center in Ventura with Gayle Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's Ventura Model program has a national reputation for 
rehabilitating repeat youth offenders before they end up in state mental 
hospitals and prisons, said Randall Feltman, county mental health agency 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Feltman said the program is run and staffed by the county's corrections agency 
in collaboration with mental health and school system officials. By working 
together on one program for Colston's 45 youth offenders, he said, Ventura 
Model has reduced recidivism rates by 30% to 40% since its inception in 1985. 
He added that Ventura County spends $8 million less per year on juvenile 
placements than the state average.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it certainly speaks to the effectiveness of coordination," Whitman 
said after the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman, who has been working to revamp New Jersey's juvenile justice system, 
said Ventura Model bolsters the argument that close coordination of government 
agencies can maximize services and minimize costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Kingdon, chief of the county's Children and Youth System, said Colston's 
13- to 17 1/2-year-old offenders are held for three to six months rather than 
the years they can sit in state institutions. "Instead of just locking them 
up," he said, "here there's more of a behavioral focus . . . that shows you can 
affect change." 
</P>
<P>
 Program participants' offenses range from vandalism to sex crimes and armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Three youths from the center led Wilson and Whitman on a tour of housing 
corridors, classrooms and athletic facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 "Do you stay with one group all the way through?" asked Whitman, referring to 
the 15-member groups the youths are placed in. "Yes, all day," answered one of 
the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The two guests were also shown charts of target behaviors the youths strive 
for each week -- such as staying positive, minding one's own business and being 
patient with staff members. Across the hall, they checked out more charts and 
written comments posted each day by staff members who keep track of each 
youth's progress in school work, chores and behavioral patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked on my alcohol issues; I've worked on my family issues with my 
dad," one of the youths told Whitman. "I feel very confident I can make it out 
there now." JASON GRANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY TO MONITOR JOB TRAINING AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County leaders agreed unanimously Tuesday to hire an analyst to 
monitor the financial operations of a local job training agency, intent on 
gaining better supervision of a program that has been troubled in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The new position comes a year after the U. S. Labor Department found that the 
county Job Training Policy Council had misspent $500,000 in the 1980s. State 
law passed months later made counties liable for such misspent funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "For that reason and because of the increasing emphasis on and need to link 
job training programs with community development and economic development 
activities, a higher level of county involvement, oversight and coordination is 
necessary," Supervisors John K. Flynn and Susan Lacey wrote in urging the board 
to pass the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk asked how the county could justify the new staff 
members after thinning the ranks of analysts in July's budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is taking on a great big liability," Flynn responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will contribute about $25,000 toward the salary and benefits of a 
senior analyst overseeing fiscal matters for the job training agency.  
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the $101,000 in costs will come from the jobs council. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1993, the Labor Department found that the council had improperly 
spent at least $500,000 during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the problem was that a former director, John Chase, was drawing 
salaries from two federal agencies at the same time, the Labor Department said. 
In addition, Chase had awarded a contract to a private firm that he headed, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges led to his firing in 1990, but a grand jury found insufficient 
evidence to indict him on charges of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Department officials reviewed the files and demanded that the jobs 
council or state officials overseeing the program repay the program. 
Legislation approved in October now shifts that responsibility to chief 
administrative officers in counties. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LANDFILL INITIATIVE BACKERS FILE NOTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of the Weldon Canyon landfill initiative filed a notice Wednesday 
asking the 2nd District Court of Appeal to overturn a judge's decision last 
week removing the item from the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice, however, consists only of a brief paragraph, and does not detail 
the reasons they say the initiative should be decided by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue at hand is the . . . right of the citizenry to vote," said landfill 
supporter Eloise Brown, the former mayor of Moorpark who said the county needs 
more landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
 "This jeopardizes the initiative process throughout the state of California," 
Brown said. "It says to me that any city council or an individual can use 
taxpayers' funds to obstruct the initiative process." 
</P>
<P>
 The notice asks the 2nd District Court of Appeal to reverse a decision by 
retired Santa Barbara Judge Richard W. Abbe, who ruled last week that the 
Weldon initiative "is not a proper subject for the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Landfill opponents said Wednesday that the notice of appeal is "a last gasp 
effort" to let voters decide whether a landfill should be located in Weldon 
Canyon north of Ventura to dispose of the west county's garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a ballot initiative that is a severe abuse of the democratic 
process," said Michael Shapiro, a director of the Coalition to Stop Weldon 
Canyon Dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Also clouding the issue is an announcement by Ventura County elections 
officials, who said Wednesday that the printing company needs all election 
materials by Sept. 9 to finish printing in time for the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she hoped the appeals court would rule quickly enough to get the 
initiative back on the November ballot. "If not, there's always the possibility 
of a special election," Brown said. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOLIDAY WEEKEND OFFERS MANY EVENTS

<P>
 Labor Day weekend will offer Ventura County residents an array of ways to 
celebrate the last official weekend of summer, from barbecues to beach parties 
to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh annual Labor of Love Family Picnic in Moorpark is expected to 
attract a large contingent of east county residents to the city's Peach Hill 
Park on Monday for music, food and fun. The free picnic is scheduled for 11 
a.m. to 4 p.m., with several local bands performing throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball aficionados left hanging by the major league strike may want to 
attend Ojai's annual Labor Day slow-pitch softball tournament. At least 42 
teams from as far away as San Francisco and San Diego are expected to compete 
in the three-day event, said Richard Torres, one of the tournament organizers. 
Games will be held at Ojai's Sarzotti Park, Soule Park and Nordhoff High School 
on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Torres said. For information, call Torres at 
646-7823. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats United of Ventura will hold its annual picnic Monday celebrating the 
holiday. The event, to be held from noon to 4 p.m. at Freedom Park next to 
Camarillo Airport, costs $15 for adults. There is no charge for children under 
12. For information, call Democrats United at 648-7150. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers in Ventura can get culture or burn calories at two events to be 
held at the Ventura Pier on Monday. Organizers are hoping for more than 80 
couples at Ventura's annual Sweatheart 10-kilometer run. The race costs $10 per 
couple and begins at 8 a.m. For information, call the Inside Track running 
apparel store in Ventura at 643-1104. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who prefer a slower pace, the Summer by the Sea Arts and Crafts 
Show will begin at 10 a.m. and run until 4 p.m., with exhibits lining the pier 
and promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping the weekend of events is a free concert by the Conejo Valley Symphony 
at Conejo Valley Park. The concert is set to begin at 5 p.m. with a range of 
pieces conducted by Jim Christensen, former music director at Disneyland. The 
symphony will perform Broadway show tunes and traditional music. SCOTT HADLY

ARTS PLAZA COPPER CURTAIN IS UNVEILED TO MIXED REVIEWS; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
$150,000 ARTWORK, A COLLECTION OF SKINNY STRIPS, HANGS FROM THE COMPLEX'S EAST 
WALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks took the wraps off its copper curtain Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where scaffolding once cluttered the blank, peach-colored east wall of the new 
Civic Arts Plaza, a $150,000 tumble of skinny copper strips fluttered slightly 
in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle nearly left resident Mark McGee speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it, huh?" McGee, an engraver at Thousand Oaks Trophies, said as he 
regarded the curtain from a sidewalk across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 He put his hands on his hips. He cocked his head to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh. Well. It . . . ah . . . it's all right," he said after a few moments. "I 
mean, I guess the idea of it's good, but how many people are going to know what 
it is? Does it look like a curtain?" 
</P>
<P>
 Civic Arts Plaza boosters certainly hope so. When they gaze on the hanging 
collection of 2,016 copper bands, they see more than merely artwork. To 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar, the 50-foot by-60-foot curtain is the symbol of the 
entire $64-million complex. It represents to motorists zipping by on the 
Ventura Freeway the glittering artistic performances that will soon be underway 
inside, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know -- 'The curtains go up,' " she said. "I think the curtain stations 
it, provides a real significant focal point as you are driving along the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "What other city can make a statement like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Gary Sturzenbecher isn't sure it is a statement. The owner of the 
Rhineland Deli, across the street from the Arts Plaza, has watched construction 
workers assemble the curtain for weeks. He wondered what would emerge from 
under the scaffolding. On Wednesday, to his surprise, he learned they had 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be a sign," he said with a sigh, looking at the 
curtain from his restaurant's patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturzenbecher likes the idea of the Arts Plaza, but thinks the building itself 
resembles a spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
 "From this angle, (the curtain) doesn't look like anything," he said. "It's 
just a big blob." 
</P>
<P>
 A deli customer, Lisa Gasser, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that supposed to be artistic?" she asked. "It looks unfinished." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Gasser says the entire Arts Plaza "reminds me of (Men's) Central 
Jail, like you see on TV, where O.J. stays." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Tomlinson, a secretary at Farmers Insurance Group on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard, said the curtain improved the building's Spartan exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it, actually," she said. "It's something different. It makes it an 
attractive civic auditorium." But her jaw dropped when she learned what it 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that pretty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore insists that the residents of his city are judging the 
plaza's architecture -- including the curtain -- too hastily. Wait until the 
lawn is planted and the trees are standing, he urges. Hold off on judgment 
until the chain-link fence surrounding the construction site comes down, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, people give reactions to things like this before it has a chance 
for maturity," he said. Fiore added that he received 20 calls on Wednesday 
about the copper curtain -- 19 were from enthusiastic admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, the curtain "is artistic, and artistic elements are 
subjective." 
</P>
<P>
 In the subjective opinion of Steve Rubinstein, the president of the Conejo 
Valley Chamber of Commerce, the curtain is the best thing that's happened so 
far to the plaza's severe, boxy facade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong," he said. "I'm the Civic Arts Plaza's biggest fan. But as 
much as I like the Civic Arts Plaza, it doesn't fit where it is. It is just a 
big box that overlooks the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes the box look better."

COUNTY FIGHTING TO KEEP OCEANSIDE TRASH OUT; WASTE: SIMI LANDFILL IS NAMED AS 
ONE OF FOUR POTENTIAL DUMP SITES. ENRAGED OFFICIALS DENOUNCE PLAN, SAYING IT 
WOULD INCREASE POLLUTION. 
</P>

<P>
 A proposal by the city of Oceanside to truck trash to the Simi Valley Landfill 
sparked anger and disbelief among Ventura County leaders who vowed to mount a 
fierce battle against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard denounced the plan at a news conference 
at her Simi Valley office Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blindsided," Howard said. "Now we're going to have to fight to keep 
this trash out of our county." 
</P>
<P>
 A report sent by the city of Oceanside to county leaders this week named the 
landfill just north of Simi Valley as one of four potential dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also lists landfills in Bradley, Lancaster and the City of Industry 
as possible dump sites for nearly 300 tons of Oceanside trash a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was joined at the conference by Simi Valley City Councilwoman Judy 
Mikels. "Every community has a responsibility to take care of its waste," 
Mikels said. "Simi Valley should not become the dumping ground for the city of 
Oceanside." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Howard said the trash would increase pollution in 
smog-plagued Ventura County. She also charged Simi Valley landfill operator 
Waste Management with misleading the county into believing Oceanside's trash 
would be shipped to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she will ask the Board of Supervisors to demand that the city of 
Oceanside conduct a full environmental impact report to assess the pollution 
the trash trucks could generate in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oceanside City Council will consider the Waste Management proposal at a 
Sept. 23 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management spokesman Greg Loughnane said it did not occur to his company 
to alert Ventura County of the Oceanside plan because under the proposed 
seven-year contract, trash would not start coming to Simi Valley for at least 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Loughnane said Simi Valley is one of several possible dump sites being 
considered for the Oceanside trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly if Simi Valley was the only possibility we would have been talking 
to them," Loughnane said. "As it is now, there is no guarantee that any of this 
trash is going to end up in Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and other city and county officials have long opposed any proposal to 
bring outside trash to the Simi Valley Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 That stance has led to clashes with Waste Management. In recent years, the 
amount of trash flowing into the Simi Valley dump has fallen off, and the 
company has sought other sources of trash to keep the landfill profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of this strategy, Waste Management last fall announced plans to bid on 
a contract to haul trash from Oceanside and other San Diego County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a Utah rail hauler outbid Waste Management for the right to handle 
Oceanside's trash. Howard said she and other county leaders took that agreement 
as an assurance that the trash would not end up in the Simi dump. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rail carrier ran into technical problems and early this summer Waste 
Management returned, offering the city a cheaper rate, said Dana Whitson, 
Oceanside deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a better deal from Waste Management," Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management has been plagued with trash trouble in Ventura County for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 After battling for more than a decade to open a landfill at Weldon Canyon 
between Ojai and Ventura, the company recently agreed to sell the lease on the 
property to San Diego-based Taconic Resources, which has resumed the struggle 
to open a dump at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nava, a board member of the Coalition to Stop Weldon Canyon Dump, said 
the concerns about the Simi Valley Landfill reaffirmed his group's opposition 
to building another dump in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the owner of the dump is a company, they need to make a profit, and if 
that means getting trash from the outside, so be it," Nava said. "This gives us 
a clear warning of what we can expect if we build another dump."

FINAL NFL DRAFT PICK MOORE IS GETTING THE LAST LAUGH AS STARTER WITH PATRIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday was a good day for Marty Moore, the last pick in this year's NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, the 222nd and final selection, will start at right inside linebacker 
for the New England Patriots in Sunday's regular-season opener in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 He will replace veteran Todd Collins, who has an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a 6-foot-1, 242-pounder from Kentucky, was dubbed the 19th "Mr. 
Irrelevant" after becoming the last player selected, and was the guest of honor 
at a weeklong festival in Southern California before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "My objective was just to make the team," Moore said. "I did that, then an 
unfortunate thing happened, so I'm going to get my chance to start the opener.

RESIDENTS AND POLICE CONNECT VIA COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Westside Neighborhood Watch groups have discovered a new meeting place -- 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, residents participating in Neighborhood Watch groups, and police 
trying to set up the programs, would swap information by mail, by telephone and 
in small gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, residents of Marina del Rey, Venice, Mar Vista, Playa Del Rey and 
Westchester can communicate among themselves and with police through a computer 
at the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the system is an electronic "bulletin board" connected to a 
computer in the Pacific Division's community relations office. Through it, 
police can answer residents' questions and distribute Neighborhood Watch 
information, said Venice resident Andrea DeFlyer, who came up with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFlyer said the department's need for a computer became clear to her when her 
Venice home was burglarized and she went to the Pacific Division to file a 
report. Police had to take the report in longhand. 
</P>
<P>
 So DeFlyer persuaded her boyfriend, Michael Rosenthal, who owns a security 
business, to donate a Compaq Presario computer and modem to the Pacific 
Division's community relations department. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for instance, the Pacific Division's newsletter, "Pacific Beacon," can be 
sent through the computer instead of being mailed to households -- saving money 
and possibly increasing the readership, Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an emergency you still call 911, but sometimes you just want to drop (the 
officers) a note. This makes telephones almost archaic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the system is just getting underway, already computer users are 
jumping on the free, on-line system. Recently, a resident sent a computer 
message praising the joint crime-fighting efforts of the police and residents 
in a Venice neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police rousted the normal deadbeats and they have not returned," the 
unnamed resident wrote. "The signs and calls to police made the place 
uncomfortable for them. This is true community-based policing."  
</P>
<P>
 Police said that eventually, they hope to set up a system under which police 
could electronically flash a suspect's description to area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 To register to use the system, call (310) 577-6515 by modem and access the 
Security World BBS on-line system. Twenty-four hours after registering, 
residents -- using the same telephone number -- can access a dozen electronic 
Neighborhood Watch "folders," including "Meet the LAPD" and "Community Meeting 
Schedules."

CREATORS HOPE COUPON BOOK SPURS INTEREST IN LOCAL BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 A coupon book is circulating that aims to give consumers a break while 
bolstering an area that has long been discounted economically.  
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Jenkins, president of Founders National Bank, recently began 
distributing a 67-page Community Buyer's Guide to selected bank customers to 
help tout local merchants and reinforce the notion that goods and services in 
Crenshaw and South-Central are worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps everyone all the way around -- the business owners in our service 
area, the customers and Founders Bank," Jenkins said. "We all need the 
advertisement. And merchants feel comfortable spending money on ads when they 
know they're going to big-dollar customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on heavy paper and boasting a wide array of goods and services -- from 
restaurants to art photographers to weight-control centers -- the book offers a 
different image from that of newspaper coupons and throwaway circulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it this way for a reason," Jenkins said. "Obviously, we want people to 
use them. We didn't want them to end up in the trash bin." 
</P>
<P>
 The guide grew out of an effort among Jenkins and several other business 
people to aid black business owners in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, West Covina Lincoln Mercury and Golden State Mutual Life Insurance 
Company agreed to underwrite the $3,000 it took to make up and print 2,500 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers are offering 10% to 20% discounts and free gifts to first-time 
customers through Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bulk of advertisers are in the Crenshaw and Central Los Angeles 
area, many are in Culver City, Mid-City and beyond. The idea, said advertising 
executive Rick Perkins, is to encourage people to recycle black dollars in as 
many areas of the Southland as possible, places they may not ordinarily think 
have black-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for black business owners to develop a base they don't 
normally have," said Perkins, whose Culver City-based agency Port & Associates 
Advertising did graphics work for the guide and sold most of the $50 to $150 ad 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point is to make people aware of the great businesses right in 
their own neighborhoods, and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 Guide co-sponsor Boyd Harrison, who owns the West Covina Lincoln Mercury 
dealership 35 miles east of Crenshaw, said the book will give him the exposure 
in Central Los Angeles that he has been lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of dealerships have closed along Crenshaw. I want people to know about 
me, a black-owned dealer, before they go buy a car," he said. "I've been here 
eight years, I live in Chino Hills, but I haven't yet had this kind of 
opportunity to advertise in L.A. It's also opening my eyes to a lot of 
businesses I didn't know about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides distribution to the bank's certificate-of-deposit customers, 
advertisers also get a free month of service from (800) Unite Us, an 
Inglewood-based phone referral bank for black-owned businesses. Jenkins said he 
and other sponsors were careful to not to duplicate businesses in the book so 
that advertisers wouldn't be competing with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Such advantages were enough to persuade restaurateur Ron Washington to 
advertise. Though he admits he has not received much response yet, he is 
confident he will. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're new, so it's crucial that we do everything we can to get the word out," 
said Washington, whose Uncle Darrow's Creole-style restaurant on Venice 
Boulevard opened in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good opportunity to do that. Folks come in, eat the product and 
tell other people, but you need more than that. You need to advertise in the 
community."

A CLASS ACT; ADLER SCHOOL OPENS DOORS ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BIRCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting West -- the school opened by the 
legendary acting teacher who has coached some of Hollywood's biggest names -- 
has found a new home in Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
 After suffering major blows -- a 1991 fire shut down the tiny conservatory at 
Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle Avenue; city officials had planned to demolish 
the building and use the site as a Metro Rail station before another location 
was chosen, and Adler died in 1992 -- the internationally known school and 
theater has settled into new quarters on Hollywood Boulevard near Highland 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing (Adler) said to me was 'Are you going to rebuild the theater?' 
" said Irene Gilbert, executive director of the conservatory and a close friend 
of Adler for more than 30 years. "I swore to her I would. I want her teachings 
to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's legacy will continue on the second floor of 6773 Hollywood Blvd., 
where after nearly 18 months of construction, the conservatory reopened its 
doors last month in time for fall classes just weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost half a million dollars to refurbish the 18,000-square-foot building, 
once the home of a posh nightclub. The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment 
Agency contributed $250,000 and the conservatory raised the other half. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1991 fire, the conservatory had no permanent home. A dozen teachers 
and about 100 students had to travel to theaters throughout Hollywood to attend 
classes, and some productions had to be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a setback for Adler, who had become an institution in the 
entertainment industry since opening her first school in New York City 35 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Her alumni list reads like a Who's Who of the film and television industries: 
Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Richard Dreyfus, 
Melanie Griffith and countless others. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler began instructing students in the early 1940s. Already a successful 
actress with film, theater and directing credits, she landed a teaching 
position at the Erwin Piscator's Dramatic Workshop at the New School for Social 
Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, she established her own school, the Stella Adler Theatre Studio, in 
New York City. Adler developed a two-year program offering classes in acting, 
speech and voice production, Shakespeare, makeup, movement, acting styles, 
characterization and scene preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the school's reputation for excellence grew, so did its enrollment. Adler 
added advanced courses to meet the needs of performers who already had 
professional experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, she renamed the school the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, and 
three years later brought her teaching styles to the West Coast. Adler 
periodically offered classes in California and spent more than 20 years 
traveling between Los Angeles and New York before opening the Stella Adler 
Conservatory of Acting West in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally built in the 1920s, the new location houses classrooms, a dance 
studio, dressing rooms, screening facilities, administrative offices and two 
theaters. The 99-seat Stella Adler Theatre will showcase small-scale 
performances while the Academy Theatre will be used for student productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although bigger than the old site, the new location still has maintained its 
charm. Scores of decorative certificates and elegant black and white 
photographs line the school's light gray walls. Most of the pictures were taken 
from the 1930s to the '50s and are glamorous movie stills of Adler and her 
family, a distinguished line of performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Russian immigrant parents, Jacob and Sara Adler, were considered the 
premier tragedians of the Yiddish American theater. All of the Adler children 
became actors, with Stella making her stage debut at the age of 4 in her 
father's production of "Broken Hearts" in 1906. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's mentors -- her parents and Konstantin Stanislavsky, father of the 
dramatic concept called the Method -- emphasized strict discipline and learning 
to draw on inspiration from within. She passed those same principles on to her 
students. She once said the ultimate aim of the rigorous training was "to 
create an actor who can be responsible for his artistic development and 
achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 The grande dame demanded that her students perform to their maximum 
capabilities. If a student's performance warranted praise, Adler did just that. 
But if the pupil did not measure up to his or her potential, she would scold or 
castigate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler once explained why she sometimes used harsh criticism: "My ability to 
bring out the students' talent is somewhere deep inside me, and I must do 
whatever I need to pull it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's teachings continue to inspire a whole new generation of performers. 
According to staff members, the conservatory continues to draw enthusiastic 
students from all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most come because they have a passion to act," said Mercedes Shirley, who has 
taught at the academy for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler's worldwide influence on the theater and cinema will not be forgotten, 
Gilbert said. "She had something to give to the world."

FOLK ART; EXHIBIT PAYS TRIBUTE TO ENDANGERED CRAFT

 Besides destroying life, war threatens traditional expressions of art, music 
and architecture. In Bosnia and Afghanistan, the cultural casualties include 
kilims -- flat-woven rugs originally made for personal use by women of the 
Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia during the latter part of the 19th 
Century and the first half of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 For four days beginning today, Westsiders have an opportunity to view an 
exhibition titled "Textiles From Vanishing Cultures," curated by Valerie 
Justin, co-founder of a textile gallery in the Pacific Design Center. The show 
represents more than 20 years of collecting and studying kilims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a warmth to these textiles," Justin said. "It has to do with the 
spirit of the women who wove them, (women) who knew that what they were doing 
was also a legacy of one generation to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Justin is co-founder of the Pillowry, a gallery specializing in woven goods 
including kilims, pillows fashioned from kilims, Oriental rugs, saddle and food 
bags, shawls and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 A Connecticut native, she came from a middle-class family but, in her words, 
"broke loose early" after graduating from the University of Connecticut with a 
degree in political science. She went to New York to become a documentary 
filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But filmmaking soon took a back seat to living the New York life. She married 
film producer George Justin and settled in. Years later, when she needed a rug 
for her apartment, she went to an auction house. She had no background or 
interest in rugs, but there it was -- a kilim, not just a rug but a piece of 
folk art. "I immediately responded to it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaving is among the oldest of crafts -- so old that many cultures attribute 
its invention to a god or goddess. In Egyptian tombs, excavators have found 
woven linen from the Badaric era (which lasted until 3400 BC). 
</P>
<P>
 The flat-woven rug is technically a tapestry-woven rug originating in the Near 
East. The weaver uses a loom, sitting in front of her tent or village hut. The 
finished rug, usually the only furnishing in the home, is placed on the floor 
or hung across the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The weavers, mostly Muslim women, live in agricultural societies with 
conservative traditions. But these cultures are vanishing -- particularly in 
war-torn Bosnia, where many of the world's kilims are made, and in Afghanistan, 
where continued conflict has altered tribal life. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bosnian women have been forced to leave their villages -- subjected to rape 
and bloody "ethnic cleansing" campaigns -- they have left their weaving 
traditions behind, Justin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable that they are able to take their looms with them," she 
said. "When they relocate to cities, they lose their identities, they have to 
take the veil and they no longer weave." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the kilim was never a commercial undertaking, it retains its folk 
integrity and style. Justin, who has written a book about kilims, maintains a 
traveling exhibition of kilims that recently returned from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhibit has been traveling for four years, and now I'm going to add other 
tribal pieces from other semi-nomadic cultures and hope that it will find a 
permanent home and be used for study purposes," Justin said. "In this cold 
technological world -- even though kilims don't connect to a family's 
traditions in Oklahoma, for instance -- people do connect to tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Justin wants to expose more people to these textiles, which she considers 
reminders of vanishing cultures. "There are breaks in tradition," she said. 
"But by preserving these pieces, at least the world will remember what was once 
part of its continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 The kilims will be displayed at the Ken Hansen Showroom, No. 770 in the 
Pacific Design Center's green building, 8687 Melrose Ave., today, Friday and 
Sept. 6 and 7. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Information: (310) 289 9400. The 
exhibit is free.

BRIEFLY; SCOUTING: TWINS EARN EAGLE RANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two local college students have been named to the Eagle Scout Court of Honor, 
attaining the highest rank in the Boy Scouts. Santa Monica residents Steven and 
Gregory Samarge, 18-year-old fraternal twins, have received congratulatory 
letters from, among others, President and Mrs. Clinton, Mayor Richard Riordan 
and Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice high school graduates attend Santa Monica College; at 6 feet, 285 
pounds each, they play center and offensive tackle on the college football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The rank of Eagle Scout, an honor received by only 2% to 3% of Boy Scouts, is 
attained in part by accumulating 21 merit badges, which are awarded to those 
who demonstrate mastery of various activities and subjects central to Scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both really excited," said Steven, the elder twin by 11 seconds. "It's 
a great honor. But mainly we did it because our father became an Eagle Scout. 
We wanted to follow in his footsteps."

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; HOTEL PROJECT POSES CHALLENGE TO ZONING CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in five years, plans have been submitted for a luxury, 
multistory hotel near the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Linden Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposal is by developer Bahador Mahboubi for an eight-story, 
274-room hotel that would include a three-story wing along portions of mostly 
residential Linden Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, called the Grand Plaza Hotel of Beverly Hills, would exceed the 
city's 45-foot building height limit on hotels by 52 feet. The developers would 
have to seek a change in the city's zoning code to allow the project to go 
forward, city planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans were delivered to the city last month and are under review by 
officials from several city departments. Formal consideration of the plan would 
not begin until the review is completed, which may not be for another month at 
the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hotel proposals have been submitted over the years for the 1 1/2-acre 
site at 9730 Wilshire Blvd., which is owned by the Mahboubi brothers and 
occupied by a medical office building and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Trustehouse Forte Hotels International expressed interest in building 
a six-story, 200-room Plaza Athenee Hotel, but the company never formally 
applied to build on the site. A similar hotel was proposed in 1992 but the 
developers withdrew for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Goldman, president of the Southwest Homeowners Assn., said the group is 
concerned about the size of the hotel and its effect on traffic and parking in 
the neighborhood. A Grand Plaza Hotel spokesman said the hotel would be 
adjacent to a private school, not homes, and the neighborhood is already the 
site of the Beverly Hills Inn, a four-story, 52-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about a pristine residential area, here," said Grand Plaza 
Hotel public affairs consultant Rudy Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahboubi, along with his brothers Dar, Kamyar and Behrouz, have extensive real 
estate holdings in Beverly Hills and own the Pacific Triangle Management 
Corporation. SUSAN STEINBERG

 The Hollywood Reservoir will remain closed until Saturday for chlorine

<P>
 The popular recreation area, closed since Monday, was due to reopen Wednesday. 
The postponement was blamed on a delay in the delivery of additives that are 
pumped directly into the water, the Department of Water and Power said. The

COMMUNITY NEWS: BRENTWOOD; TRAFFIC CONTROL OKD ON SIMPSON'S STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has given police the authority to close off the 
streets surrounding O. J. Simpson's North Rockingham Avenue estate to 
discourage gawkers and tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also considered a plan to give residents along Rockingham and 
three adjacent streets city-issued parking stickers to prohibit visitors from 
parking there. The preferential parking will be adopted only if two-thirds of 
the residents sign a petition supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude said the extraordinary move Tuesday was made because 
of the overwhelming public interest in the Simpson case.  
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department now has authority to erect temporary barricades to keep 
out all but residents and their guests when traffic becomes too heavy.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; ST. AUGUSTINE BY-THE-SEA RECTOR MOVING TO BATON 
ROUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Fred Fenton, a prominent clergyman known for addressing such issues 
as AIDS and homelessness, has held his last Mass at St. Augustine by-the-Sea 
Episcopal Church. He leaves at the end of the month for a church in Baton 
Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenton, rector at St. Augustine for 23 years, will be rector at St. James 
Episcopal Church, 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an exciting thing to get a fresh start at 59," he said. 
"(Louisiana) is a glorious area of the country. The people are warm and 
wonderful, and the food is the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica church, with 600 parishioners, has not named a new rector. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenton was well-known for his community service and for taking on sensitive 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he held one of the first Masses in the country devoted to AIDS 
patients and those who have died of the disease. He also helped establish the 
Turning Point Shelter, a transitional shelter for the homeless in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 As founder of the Westside Interfaith Council, an organization of more than 50 
Westside synagogues, churches and temples, Fenton had emphasized the importance 
of communication and tolerance among the faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Holocaust remembrance service held by Fenton in Santa Monica, 
worshipers dismantled a symbolic death camp fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He represented the ideal clergy-person to many people," said Janet Bregar, 
executive director of the Interfaith Council. "He was involved with interfaith 
groups that asked for his support, and tried to teach compassion and justice." 
</P>
<P>
 At Fenton's final service Sunday, attended by public officials including Santa 
Monica Mayor Judy Abdo, he received the Fred Fenton Award, created by the 
Interfaith Council board in honor of his service to the community. The award 
will be presented yearly to clergy committed to social justice and fostering 
relationships across religious lines. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Augustine's, church officials said Fenton's departure will be strongly 
felt. "We'll miss him a great deal. He has done marvelous things here in the 
parish. But we're glad for him to begin a new ministry," said Barbara Stewart, 
assistant to the rector at St. Augustine's, which was founded more than 100 
years ago. LORENZA MUNOZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB RAISES MONEY FOR RELIEF IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BIRCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After learning about the hardships facing thousands of sick and orphaned 
Rwandan children living in refugee camps, the youngsters at the Venice Boys & 
Girls Club were determined to help. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths wanted to raise money to donate to Doctors Without Borders and 
Operation USA, relief organizations providing assistance in Rwanda and other 
areas affected by the country's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty club members were able to raise $400 in donations, and the group last 
week presented a $300 check to Christa Thorne, a 10-year-old Rwandan and a 
representative from Operation USA. The remaining money will be donated to 
Doctors Without Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Wednesday, club members listened attentively as Christa, who now 
lives in Europe with her parents, spoke about Rwanda, where up to 500,000 have 
died since a civil war broke out in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Christa talked about how her mother fled Rwanda to neighboring Burundi and how 
her uncle was killed "fighting for freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Operation USA spokeswoman Roseanne Katon-Walden brought a detailed map of 
Rwanda to give club members a brief history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated money will go toward purchasing medical supplies, specifically the 
rehydration solutions to combat cholera and dysentery, Katon-Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing we got across is that their money will help save 
lives," Katon-Walden said. "We hope that some of the children think about 
careers in international relief." DONNA BIRCH

 The plan originally was scheduled for presentation before the committee 
Tuesday but minor changes had to be incorporated into it after a community 
meeting on the proposal Monday, said Nancy Burke, a deputy planner for 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. The changes include rules for outdoor seating for 
commercial developments and modifications in residential side-yard setbacks.

SCIENTOLOGY: RENAMING TAMARIND AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reporter Scott Collins wrote in your Sunday edition ("Scientologists File 
Petition to Rename Street," Aug. 28) that the city of Los Angeles will in 
upcoming weeks be processing a request to rename a small section of Tamarind 
Avenue to L. Ron Hubbard Way. 
</P>
<P>
 The application originated from an individual Church of Scientology member and 
was filed by the book in May. That included a petition signed by a majority of 
the neighbors on the immediate section of Tamarind Street south of Franklin who 
express their support of the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks later the applicant sent a letter to the city to shelve the 
application because of personal obligations that would not enable him to 
continue with the procedure at that time. Why the city is going ahead with the 
application is as much your guess as mine. 
</P>
<P>
 An even better question is why the L.A. Times now jumps on this "story" when 
the opposition -- the vital ingredient of the media's controversy formula -- 
happened well over a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, those quoted in opposition to the petition live on Tamarind Avenue 
north of Franklin Avenue. Their problems were attributed to the expense and 
inconvenience of changing addresses on personal and business items. Yet, the 
street name north of Franklin was never included in the application; these 
neighbors would not be affected.  
</P>
<P>
 Should the application go forward, the neighbors who oppose the change will 
get plenty of chances to have their concerns heard at the correct time and 
forum, just as in any similar city procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual who originated the petition felt that the accomplishments of 
Mr. L. Ron Hubbard were considerable and should be recognized. His legacy 
includes numerous social betterment activities which base their effectiveness 
solely in his philosophic writings -- programs such as Narconon, a very 
successful drug rehabilitation program; Applied Scholastics based on the works 
of L. Ron Hubbard has brought literacy to millions of people around the world 
and has begun to make inroads here in the L.A. area through programs such as 
the Compton Tutoring Project and Hollywood Literacy Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of Scientology has for more than a decade been a strong advocate of 
historic preservation in Hollywood. In fact, in January of this year, the 
church received the Preservation of the Arts Award from the Hollywood Arts 
Council for its restoration of the Manor Hotel. The Church of Scientology 
Celebrity Centre International in the past year has carried out many, many 
fund-raisers and special events to help carry out children's art programs, buy 
equipment to clean the Walk of Fame, and to buy Christmas toys at Christmas and 
obtain vitally needed supplies for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above events or programs have ever run in the L.A. Times, although 
news of them and many other events and programs have been sent to your L.A. 
Times office on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 SHIRLEY YOUNG President, Church of Scientology of Los Angeles * 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 As a longstanding member of the Flat Earth Society, I feel uniquely positioned 
to comment on the excellent idea to rename Tamarind Avenue as L. Ron Hubbard 
Way, by the Church of Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
 A novel and cutting-edge idea that would add to the revitalization of 
Hollywood! 
</P>
<P>
 I am amazed that Scientology has not petitioned for Bronson Avenue to become 
Tom Cruise Crescent, and Franklin Avenue to become Dianetics Drive. Anyway, 
full marks to the Hubbardists on their exciting plan!

BLUFFS: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article ("Key Hearing Nears on Bluff Protection Plan," Aug. 25), which 
included a photograph showing mansion-size housing above the Ballona Wetlands, 
misses the main opposition points to this pending ordinance. First of all, the 
vast majority of lots in the Specific Plan area have been developed. The area 
bounded by Pershing on the east, Culver on the north, Vista del Mar on the west 
and the Airport property to the south is already chockablock with housing. This 
area does not drain into the wetlands, is separated by strip commercial 
developments from the wetlands, does not have any parks or public vista points, 
and the fact that some one may want to add to their existing home will have no 
impact on the wetlands or on "animal movement and hawk flight" . . . or . . . 
"the burrowing owl and the last strip of coastal sage in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the ordinance is labeled as a "Protection Plan" and has a whole 
series of motherhood-type purposes that no one would argue with. The problem is 
when you peel off the facade and look at what type of development would be 
approved by the city, the opposite is true. The plan has no limitations on the 
amount of grading, but has strict requirements on building height, setbacks and 
lot coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this cause given high land cost? Any property owner will want to 
grade to the maximum extent whatever lot area is left after the imposition of 
all of these restrictions. The result: more not less grading of the bluffs will 
occur. For anyone wishing to remodel, a homeowner is confronted with a more 
daunting array of requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of these homes met the city's building codes when they were built 
40 years ago, they would need to be upgraded to meet current geo-technical and 
seismic requirements. In order to build within the perimeters of an existing 
structure (either by building up or by building under) as has been advocated, 
shoring up of the existing home and reconstruction of the foundation of the 
house would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances, the result of all of this work and expense would yield a 
very small additional square footage with limited usability. An ill-conceived 
concept that wouldn't "pencil out" for most homeowners and would again cause 
more, not less grading of the hillside. With the lack of restrictions on the 
amount of grading and need for even more retaining wall and foundation work, we 
will unfortunately also probably see more not less construction-related 
accidents resulting from the adoption of this ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the end result of the "Bluffs Protection Plan"? More not less of the 
bluffs will be graded, the bluffs will be destabilized, construction costs will 
escalate and the addition of a simple bath or family room will become 
prohibitive and construction-related accidents will increase. That is why this 
ordinance should be rejected by the City Council or substantially rewritten.

BLAZES: NEED FOR PREVENTIVE MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on fire prevention efforts ("Fire Officials to Enforce Brush 
Clearance Codes," Aug. 21) underlines the importance of the problem but 
addresses less than 1% of the brush and forest fire dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although forest fires can never be prevented, there are ways of containing 
such recurrent disasters, which strike the Malibu area every three or more 
years.The necessary steps are a grid of clear-cut 150- to 200-foot wide swaths, 
about one mile apart, through all forests and brush. By sacrificing less than 
4% of natural growth forests, the remaining 96% will be virtually immune from 
spreading fires. If a road is paved in each swath, perhaps with a water line, 
it would greatly improve the chances of localizing all fires and saving 
virtually all remaining forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the assorted conservancies and park services labor under the 
illusion that by some miracle all forests can be saved. Never mind a dozen 
heroic firefighters who sacrifice their lives every year, nor the hundreds who 
are injured. Never mind that untold deer become charbroiled venison and 
thousands of birds and critters perish miserably in every years' fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists must understand that men must cooperate with nature to 
protect nature and man, too. The blind opposition to any and all efforts to 
protect our patrimony in a sensible way must cease. A well-cared-for forest is 
more of a thing of beauty than a pristine soot-blackened mess -- with or 
without burnt-out homes. 
</P>

COVER STORY; COMING OF AGE AT CITY HALL; POLITICS: FROM 26-YEAR-OLD CITY 
COUNCIL NOVICE TO SUPERVISOR, IT'S BEEN 'MIND-BOGGLING' TO YAROSLAVSKY

 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district in cludes Bel-Air, 
Century City, the Fairfax district and Westwood, was elected to the County 
Board of Supervisors in June and will take office in December. During his two 
decades on the council, Yaroslavsky gained notoriety for calling for more 
aggressive oversight of the Los Angeles Police Department and pushing measures 
to limit commercial development in the city and block oil drilling off Pacific 
Palisades. His wife, Barbara, recently confirmed she would seek her husband's 
council seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Talk about the job at City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky: I'm going to miss City Hall. I don't think there's a more 
challenging job in politics than being a member of a local city council. A Los 
Angeles council member can be involved in every aspect of the city. To be 
elected to the governing body of the second-largest city in the United States 
at 26 years of age was mind-boggling. This wouldn't have happened in Europe. In 
most parliamentary systems in the world, it's not until you are 20 or 25 years 
into adulthood that you get that kind of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've hobnobbed with the rich and famous, including President Nixon's 
chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, who once called on you to ask for support in 
obtaining a building variance in Westwood for a client . 
</P>
<P>
 A: I said, "Bob, I don't think we'll have a problem with this, but I want one 
thing in return." And his eyes lit up. "Well, what is it, councilman?" "I'd 
like to go out to lunch with you and spend two hours talking about Nixon." That 
was the condition. And he said, "Oh, I'd be delighted." So we met at the 
Marquis hotel in Westwood for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 A very, very interesting guy. Totally different from the impression I had from 
reading about him. The variance was going to be fixed anyway. It was not a 
substantive variance, trust me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were your first days in office like?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My colleagues were quite good to me. They treated me as an equal. There 
were people here who were old enough to be my grandfather or my parents. Some 
of my worst adversaries even gave me a lot of slack. 
</P>
<P>
 The first vote I cast was to cut off a debate, and I voted no. I thought we 
were voting on the substance of the issue. The vote was 14-1, and I was the one 
vote. I later got a copy of the roll call sheet as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, I got involved in the Robert F. Kennedy assassination 
investigation, and my first major legislative act was to put in a motion to 
establish an ad hoc committee to investigate how the assassination had been 
handled by the police. 
</P>
<P>
 It was very controversial, and I hustled to get the votes. Council President 
John Gibson then appointed the members to the committee, and he was kind enough 
to appoint me to it. But the four others were totally uncooperative. So it was 
a Pyrrhic victory, if you will. I learned a lot that summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Whom will you miss most?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The person I really respected personally, not in a political sense but a 
personal one, was Ernie Bernardi. (Longtime Councilman Ernani Bernardi left 
office in 1993.) This was a man with a level of personal integrity that I 
aspired to. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote him a note on his last day in office, saying something to the effect 
that I loved him like I loved my father. And I really meant it. He walked over 
to me afterward and said that in 32 years at City Hall, that was the nicest 
thing anyone had ever said to him. For all his craziness and his habit of 
pressing the "no" button, we've all come around to his way of thinking on many 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You made a last-minute decision not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley's bid 
for a fifth term in 1989. Subsequently, Bradley became enmeshed in a scandal 
about his personal finances and only narrowly escaped being thrown into a 
runoff election. Do you have any regrets about the decision?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I never regretted it. I don't think anyone will ever understand why I 
pulled out until I sit them down and relate the chronology. I wasn't going to 
do a kamikaze attack. I didn't want out of government bad enough to put it all 
on the line in what I thought was a futile effort to unseat the mayor. Most 
people today look at what happened and for them the timing is blurred. Given 
what I knew on Jan. 8, or whatever it was, I made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll tell you this, I have thought about what would have happened if I'd 
won and we had had the civil disturbance we had in 1992 and the Rodney King 
fiasco in 1991. It could've been a hellish existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How was it possible for the city -- and its elected leadership -- to wake 
up one day and find itself with a Police Department that was seemingly out of 
control, abusive and racist?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it was a failure of all the elected and appointed people who had 
oversight over the Los Angeles Police Department, particularly the Police 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 I took on the Police Department. I took them on over the Public Disorder 
Intelligence Division and over police use of the chokehold, and I paid a price 
for it. The Police Protective League wouldn't even endorse me in one election 
where I ran unopposed. And Daryl Gates vilified me publicly -- at a time when 
he was popular. And all that sent a signal to every City Council member. I 
think all the people, the mayor, the Police Commission, said: "I don't want to 
be in Yaroslavsky's shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 But I was fortunate because I had a district that backed me up. I didn't 
represent Chatsworth or Tujunga. I had a district that was ready to back up a 
legitimate, aggressive look at the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did Tom Bradley's political history blind his Administration to police 
abuses?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Before Tom Bradley was elected in 1973, he had been defeated four years 
earlier by Sam Yorty. Most people will say that Tom Bradley's loss in 1969 was 
due in large measure to Yorty's successful attack, claiming that Tom Bradley 
was going to turn the Police Department upside down. I think Tom Bradley and 
Sam Williams (Bradley's longtime Police Commission member) had the 1969 defeat 
seared into their psyches. And they did everything in their power to avoid a 
public confrontation between Tom Bradley and the police. Most politicians will 
not admit to this, but they cannot afford to do battle with their police 
departments. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I've never said this before, but during the city's recent contract dispute 
with the police I had three flat tires of my city car in my driveway. I can't 
prove who did it. Alicia Katz, my deputy, had an industrial-sized thumbtack put 
sharp-end-up on the seat on her city car right in the middle of this thing. 
Fortunately, she saw it before she sat down. There was a lot of funny business 
going around. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted against the contract. I thought it was a bad deal, and I didn't think 
the overall aura of intimidation should be rewarded -- Jeff Garfield, the 
union's representative, saying they were going to dig up dirt on the mayor and 
the council. That was extortion. That was a threat. In fact, the city attorney 
wrote a memo to the City Council saying that might have been a violation of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's it like to represent the 5th District, which encompasses Fairfax, 
Westwood, Bel-Air, Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is the most politically challenging district in the city. Everybody in 
my district reads excessively about mundane things like local government. 
Everybody is involved in a neighborhood and active in their neighborhood 
association. Golda Meir (the former Israeli prime minister) once said when she 
was asked what it was like to be the head of a nation of 4 million people: "I'm 
prime minister of 4 million prime ministers." I'd have to say I'm councilman of 
300,000 council members. Everybody thinks -- and with some justification -- 
that they can do the job as well as if not better than the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have you liked least about the job?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The loss of privacy -- for my family, principally, not so much for me. My 
daughter has told me -- and she'll probably kill me if she reads this -- that 
sometimes she'd rather not be known as Zev Yaroslavsky's daughter. And she 
shouldn't be, and my wife should not be known as Zev Yaroslavsky's wife. But 
actually there are very few downsides to this job. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you think of Ed Davis, former police chief and former state 
senator from the San Fernando Valley?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Ed Davis and I have become good friends. In retrospect, when I have a 
chance to compare him with his successor, he was a pretty darned good chief of 
police. He never once threatened me or disrespected me in any way. I was a 
26-year-old snot-nosed kid. I can see now how Davis would have been right in 
saying: "Who is this punk, just out of college, telling me, a police officer 
for 25 years, what to do?" But he didn't. Now Daryl Gates did have that 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have a favorite accomplishment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: For pure satisfaction, other than my first election, there was nothing to 
compare to the political satisfaction of winning Proposition O (a 1988 city 
ballot measure to bar Occidental Petroleum from drilling in Pacific Palisades). 
We were outspent $10 million to $3 million. We had a little help from an oil 
rig explosion in the North Sea that summer. After all this, (Occidental 
Chairman) Armand Hammer and I became buddies again. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Armand Hammer was a fierce adversary of yours.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Proposition O was an absolute war with him. But a few months after the 
election and we had won, I got a call to meet with Armand Hammer to discuss his 
plans to build an art museum in Westwood. After a while, he said, "I want to 
talk to you alone." He asked what my plans were. He said, "Anything you ever 
want to do, you can count on me as a friend and supporter. I really think you 
would've made a great mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him, "Are you going to have a birthday party this year, Dr. Hammer?" 
And he said, 'Yes, as a matter of fact." And I said, "I'd like to come." In his 
later years, he celebrated his birthdays with a big bash where he'd bring 
Mstislav Rostropovich, the cellist, to town, and he'd usually play 
Tchaikovsky's "Variations on a Rococo Theme" and Dvorak's cello concerto, two 
of my absolutely favorite pieces of music. I used to get invited to these 
bashes until I voted against his oil-drilling deal. Then I was off the list. So 
my wife and I went. These were a thousand of Hammer's closest personal friends 
and we'd just cleaned his clock on the Prop. O campaign. If looks could kill 
that evening, I was dead 100 times over. But I did hear Rostropovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Another top accomplishment?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Lately I'm very proud of the work I've done to hire more women police 
officers. People have stereotypes about what their cops should be. They think 
they all should be like Kent McCord (star of the TV series "Adam 12"). But 
that's not what policing in the next century needs. We've set some goals for 
hiring women. It's going to be good for the city. They'll lower our exposure on 
police use-of-force cases, and they'll do much more for us as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your wife (has) confirmed that she will seek your council seat. Is this the 
makings of a political dynasty?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, the people who know Barbara Yaroslavsky know she has as individual a 
mind as there is, and certainly that has been the case over 23 years of 
marriage. She has her views, which are very much hers. Believe it or not, we 
don't spend a lot of time talking about politics and government, which is 
probably why our marriage has lasted 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess it's a natural question to raise. You would not ask that question of a 
man, but some ask that of a woman. Can a woman succeed her husband in a 
political job? In a way it's demeaning. She has got her own record. She is on 
the board of the L.A. Free Clinic, the Parents Advisory Council (and several 
other community, religious and educational organizations); she is an incredibly 
active person. She has got a following. She is very much her own person and I 
think that will become evident in the campaign. She is not going to inherit any 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 For those people who think she is going to be a rubber stamp for me, it's time 
for them to get in the '90s and recognize spouses are not puppets. They are 
going to be sorely surprised by the independence of this candidacy. This is a 
very strong individual with instincts that are second to none. She is going to 
have to go out there and run from scratch. In the final analysis, people should 
evaluate her not on who her spouse is but who she is, and if people evaluate 
her on who she is then she should get more votes than I did. PROFILE: ZEV

CARSON; NEIGHBORS SEEK TO BLOCK RAUCOUS CONCERTS AT OLYMPIC VELODROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carson residents who were shocked by the vulgar language and annoyed by the 
noise from a recent concert by the heavy metal band Metallica are trying to 
keep other loud groups from playing at the Olympic Velodrome site at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But they still face the Lollapalooza concert with 13 bands for Labor Day 
Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Metallica drew 23,000 to the concert grounds next to the Velodrome, an oblong, 
outdoor cycling arena with banked walls that was built for the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors were particularly bothered by the band screaming profanity between 
songs. "If they brought Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles, you could turn it up 
as loud as you want," said the Rev. Raymond LeBlanc, pastor at the First 
Lutheran Church of Carson and leader of a citizens group concerned about 
university concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say concert-goers at the July 26 Metallica concert took over the 
streets, turning them into bars, bathrooms and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating the Velodrome costs the nonprofit Dominguez Hills University 
Foundation $300,000 per year, much of which comes from concerts, said Nick 
Curl, Velodrome general manager. But Curl says the foundation is prepared to 
spend an estimated $10,000 to ensure that the university and its neighbors can 
continue to live side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 The first test will come Sunday and Monday , at Lollapalooza, a festival that 
features acts ranging from rock band Smashing Pumpkins to rappers the Beastie 
Boys. The sellout crowd is expected to swell to 30,000 each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Curl said the Velodrome will hire extra sheriff's deputies and private 
security officers, close off nearby streets and direct traffic with electronic 
message boards. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Velodrome will also place ads in the Carson Chronicle to inform 
neighbors of large, upcoming concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerts that draw 20,000 to 30,000 people are held two to three times a year, 
Curl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to find a happy medium," he said, "between keeping our doors 
open and not offending our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 A petition signed by more than 200 neighbors warns that Lollapalooza "is 
certain to be much worse in quality and quantity (than Metallica)." 
</P>
<P>
 But LeBlanc said he understands that the university cannot break its contract 
and cancel Lollapalooza. He said he will discuss the concert with local 
officials at a Sept. 8 meeting at his church. Residents and local officials 
have met twice. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBlanc said he hopes to negotiate a written agreement regarding future 
concerts. He also hopes to form a three-member citizens committee to monitor 
bands that play the Velodrome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curl says he does not expect Lollapalooza to drive a wedge between the 
university and residents because the bands will not be as vulgar as some heavy 
metal bands. 
</P>
<P>
 The university has been regularly holding concerts for almost three years, 
including a large one by Peter Gabriel, without any major incidents. But almost 
everyone agrees that the Metallica concert was uncharacteristically loud and 
profane.

LONG BEACH; ACADEMY CEMETERY HONORS K-9 HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tucked away in a quiet, immaculately landscaped corner behind the Long Beach 
Police Academy, guarded by the sprawling branches of an old and gnarled tree, 
the final resting place of some of the department's most beloved heroes can be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that black headstones, polished to gleam like a rookie's shoes on 
his first day at the job, pay tribute to a small legion of officers that 
expected no more than a pat on the head for saving their partners' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the Long Beach Police Department buries its police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think it's kind of silly to have this place," said Officer Robert 
Stuart, whose partner of eight years, a German shepherd named Kon, was buried 
last month in the unnamed graveyard. "But anyone who likes animals, or just 
appreciates life, can see that it's a respectful way of laying them down to 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve police dogs and an academy mascot -- a beagle named Snoopy -- lie at 
the cemetery, south of Carson Street near the vacant Long Beach Naval Hospital. 
The monuments bear names of dogs that are as unique as the stories officers 
swap about them: Justice, Kazan, Pax, Zeus, Bondo, Canto. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Argos, who once dashed through a crowd of 150 people to save an 
officer who was about to lose his gun to an assailant. Another time, after 
Argos nabbed a robbery suspect, the man called the German Shepherd a 
nice-looking dog and asked officers if he was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeus, who died in 1985, once baffled trainers when he captured a man who had 
cut himself while trying to rob a woman at knifepoint. The man left a trail of 
blood droplets that stopped after a few feet, but the animal continued on for a 
block and a half, up an apartment staircase and barked at a door that had blood 
on its handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dogs can (recognize) scents, but they aren't bloodhounds," said Sgt. Mike 
Kinrade, a 15-year veteran of the K-9 unit who now heads the program. "What 
that dog was tracking, nobody quite knows." 
</P>
<P>
 The police department's K-9 program was established in 1978. When the first 
dog, Kazan, demonstrated an ability to search an area much faster and more 
thoroughly than humans could, the program's popularity quickly spread. Five 
teams were added by 1980, and today the program has 12 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazan died while in retirement at age 14, and was buried in this green grove 
in 1988. But the first dog buried here was Bondo, a 4-year-old German Shepherd 
who died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondo was chasing a man suspected of burglary when the man hit the dog's head 
with a large pipe wrench. The dog was put to sleep after a series of seizures, 
the result of scar tissue that had formed near his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Police-dog burials are handled in different ways by various departments. The 
Los Angeles Police Department buries police dogs on a hill behind its academy. 
Police dogs from several cities in Los Angeles and Orange counties are laid to 
rest at a general pet cemetery in Huntington Beach called Sea Breeze. Some 
cities cremate police dogs after memorial ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the Long Beach graveyard on a recent hot summer morning, 
Kinrade, 50, is dressed casually in sweat pants and a T-shirt. His shirt has a 
picture of a large black Rottweiler and reads, "A true and trusting friend." 
Kinrade's first dog, a Rottweiler named Argo, was killed in a three-story fall 
while chasing a burglary suspect on the roof of the old Newberry's building 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dogs, however, retire at age 10 and spend their remaining years at 
home with their handler. At that age, "they begin to show the effects of police 
work almost overnight," Kinrade said. Currently, eight police dogs are retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the dogs are purchased from Germany and various Scandinavian 
countries at age 2, usually at a cost of about $4,000. They have had some 
obedience training, which gives officers a better foundation to begin the 
rigorous preparation for police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot tougher to find a good dog that's bred here," Kinrade said, adding 
that American breeders tend to in-breed to develop good-looking dogs, but the 
practice can cause health and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs end up with hip, back and even brain problems from all the 
in-breeding. They may look good, but you'll get a psycho dog on your hands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperament is a key concern of trainers. Kinrade said that only one in 100 
dogs -- even of the right breeds -- qualifies for police work. "You can't have 
a dog that's a biting machine or bites out of fear," he said. "Or think about 
the 4th of July, when dogs go nuts. We can't exactly have a dog that's afraid 
of gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the K-9 teams' work is searching for suspects hiding from police 
-- in residential areas, under houses, in buildings or near freeways. Most 
officers can cite numerous instances when their dogs have directly saved their 
lives by alerting them to a suspect who might be armed.  
</P>
<P>
 In July, which Kinrade called a fairly typical month, the teams conducted 52 
searches that resulted in 19 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The K-9 teams serve other functions as well. One dog is specially trained to 
detect drugs. Another can sniff out weapons that have been recently fired.  
</P>
<P>
 To participate in the K-9 program the officers must purchase the dogs 
themselves. The Long Beach K-9 Officers Assn., an independent nonprofit group 
that boasts more than 400 members, helps pay some food and medical costs, 
through donations and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs and their trainers live and work together, which officers say helps 
the animals in social situations, such as community and school demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter and son grew up with Kon," said Stuart, referring to the German 
shepherd that died recently. "That dog was part of the family,"  
</P>
<P>
 Kinrade added: "You spend more time with them than you do with your family." 
However, he said, "you can't really look at this as a pet relationship. You 
have to rely on the dog to protect you, and the dog will lay down his life for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, officers say, is the reason they spend about $500 apiece for 
headstones, which have laser-inlaid photos of the dog and handler. 
</P>
<P>
 "In eight years," Stuart said, "the only reward Kon ever asked for was a pat 
on the head or rub on the stomach. This is just a way of showing our respect 
for what they did for us."

SPORTS; CULVER CITY HIGH QUARTERBACK IS ARMED, DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An electronic throwing machine fired footballs between 60 and 70 miles an hour 
at Culver City High receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 A thud was followed by a gasp as each player struggled to gain control of the 
ball ricocheting off his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 This drill was a prelude to the real test: catching a pass from Centaur 
quarterback Damon Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can tear your hands up," slot back Jahmal Wright said. "I have to ice my 
fingers every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams can throw hard whether it's a short pass to a running back or a long 
one to an end racing down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him taking three-, five- and seven-step drop backs in practice," Coach 
Robert Moore said. "The ball was humming. It was sizzling." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City, with an abundance of talent and Williams leading the way, is 
attempting to win its first Southern Section title since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want nothing short of a championship," Williams said. "This is the team to 
do it. If we don't do it, it will be five or 10 years before this school has 
this many skilled athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Williams and Wright, the Centaurs return receiver and Division 
I prospect Jasiri Rodell, tailback Aki Wilson, flanker Rashad Stroops and tight 
end Vince Sims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs have won or shared the Ocean League title the past three seasons. 
In 1993, Culver City finished 8-4 and was 4-0 in league play. The Centaurs 
advanced to the Division VII quarterfinals, where they lost to Arroyo Grande, 
35-30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good shot to go all the way if we stay focused and determined," 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams began his football career in Pop Warner with the Culver City Lancers. 
He switched from receiver to quarterback after a growth spurt weakened his left 
knee and limited his speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting kind of slow," Williams said. "I moved to quarterback after one 
of my Pop Warner coaches saw me throw a pass off of a reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams built up his arm strength by working out religiously in the weight 
room. When it came time to try out as the varsity quarterback, Williams was 
ready. So were the Centaurs, who have found success moving receivers to 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Dameron Ricketts, the Centaurs' starting quarterback in 1991, and Tommy 
Covington, the 1992 starter, began their football careers as receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither had the success throwing the ball like the 6-foot-4, 195-pound 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Williams passed for a school-record 1,986 yards and 12 
touchdowns. He also caught a game-winning touchdown pass with no time remaining 
in a 14-13 first-round playoff victory over Azusa and another touchdown pass in 
the loss to Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected to The Times' 1993 Westside All-Star Football first team and 
to the Southern Section Division VII first team. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-sport athlete, Williams was also second-leading scorer on the 
basketball team with a 17-point average and a first-team selection as a pitcher 
on The Times' Westside All-Star baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type of player a team builds around," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams competed at a scouting combine at Warren High in April and finished 
among the top-rated quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He throws the ball with authority," said Dick Lascola of the Fallbrook, 
Calif.-based Scouting Bureau Services. "His ball doesn't dip or flutter. He 
puts it on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the ball reaches the receiver? 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," Moore said. "Lot of guys complain he throws too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 One player who rarely complains is Rodell, Culver City's leading receiver and 
Williams' best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I warm him up before the games," said Rodell, who caught 32 passes for 871 
yards and nine touchdowns. "It takes getting used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodell seeks his revenge with video games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to play Bill Walsh College Football," Rodell said. "I spank him all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It might be the only football game Williams loses this season.

 SHEDDING STRIPES: Friends of Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman are predicting that one 
of his first changes as new Air Force chief of staff later this year will be to 
scuttle the controversial officers uniform launched by his predecessor, Gen. 
Merrill A. McPeak, in 1991. The design, which combines an airline-style jacket 
and trousers with naval officers' stripes on the sleeves, was intended to bring 
American Air Force uniforms closer to those of Britons and other NATO allies. 
But it bombed here at home, where Air Force veterans derided it as "looking 
like a bunch of Delta Air Lines pilots who are working for the Navy." . . . As 
a result, career officers have been slow to make the transition. Williamson 
Murray, an Ohio State University military history professor who has known 
Fogleman for years, says the new boss is likely to drop the uniform -- which 
officers must buy themselves -- early in his term. "He's very conscious of 
tradition," Murray says, "and the fact is that the Air Force emanated from the 
Army, not from the civilian airlines."

 THE DI-FI FLY: No single piece of legislation has meant so much to Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.) as the crime bill, which includes a ban on 19 types of 
assault-style weapons that stands as her greatest legislative achievement. So 
it was no wonder her face went blank and she left an interview in mid-sentence 
to fly FloJo-like back into the Senate chamber last Thursday night when told 
she, of all people, had failed to vote. . . . In fact, Feinstein already had 
proudly cast her "aye" vote loudly enough for everyone to hear -- everyone, 
apparently, except the recording clerk who was taking roll. Panting, she set 
the record straight, averting what would have been a final paradox in the 
bill's tortuous path to approval.

 STANDING ALONE: Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., formerly the executive director of the 
NAACP, now must realize how fickle fame can be, especially if there's a whiff 
of scandal in the air. A day after he was fired as the leader of the nation's 
oldest civil rights group, Chavis hosted a 2 1/2-day summit of African American 
leaders in Baltimore. . . . Usually such an event would attract many of the 
nation's best-known, traditional civil rights leaders. Not this time. The only 
big name attendee was Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and he skipped 
out after just one day. Chavis was fired after revelations that, without NAACP 
board knowledge, he disbursed $64,000 of the organization's money -- and 
promised to spend up to $332,000 -- to settle a threatened sex discrimination 
and wrongful discharge lawsuit brought by a former aide. . . . Chavis is suing 
his former bosses to regain his job. Abbey Hairston, Chavis' attorney, has 
argued that the firing damaged Chavis' reputation among civil rights leaders. 
The absentee list at his summit might be Exhibit A.

 CANDIDATE ORSON: Remember Orson Swindle, the memorably named Vietnam war hero 
who managed Ross Perot's second campaign for the presidency in 1992? He's back 
in politics, running for Congress as a Republican from his home state of 
Hawaii. . . . His first order of business, it seems, is trying to overcome a 
moniker some might regard as a handicap. His solution: play down Swindle and 
trumpet Orson. His campaign stationery, bumper sticker and even his business 
card depict his first name in large bold letters, with "Swindle" in very small 
print underneath. In a letter accompanying a folder of campaign material and in 
his official biography, he is consistently referred to as "Orson."

SACRAMENTO FILE: ASSEMBLY OKS NEW PENALTIES FOR TICKET BROKERAGE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly has passed and sent to Gov. Pete Wilson a bill increasing 
penalties for ticket brokers who fail to deliver tickets at previously agreed 
upon prices for events such as the Rose Bowl football game and rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 A 44-31 lower house vote was cast on the measure (AB 2513) sponsored by 
Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). It previously passed the Senate 
on a 23-10 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation provides that any ticket broker who cannot deliver a promised 
ticket at the contracted price would be liable for 200% of the price, plus 
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the purchaser in attending or attempting to 
attend the event. Current law provides that consumers can only get their money 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most ticket brokers are honest and deliver a service that people are willing 
to pay for," Bowen said, "but those ticket brokers that can't deliver on what 
they promise and are flat-out ripping off consumers must be held accountable."

BOLSHOI BOUND; LAGUNA NIGUEL TEEN TO SPEND SPRING IN MOSCOW WITH FAMOUS BALLET 
COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his short blond hair, bright blue eyes and ruddy cheeks, 15-year-old Ryan 
Turley looks like the quintessential surfer dude. 
</P>
<P>
 But his talents lie in a wholly different realm -- the world of pirouettes and 
plies , tights and tendus . 
</P>
<P>
 Turley, a Laguna Niguel resident, is one of the best young male ballet dancers 
in the country, one of only eight American youths to be chosen to spend next 
spring honing their dance skills with the Bolshoi Ballet Company in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost didn't take the Russians up on their offer, for he was also offered 
a full year's scholarship to the San Francisco Ballet School. Trying to better 
his chances of soon joining a major ballet company, he has decided to end his 
instruction in San Francisco next February and hop a plane to Russia.  
</P>
<P>
 There, he hopes to further improve at the activity he most enjoys and that 
consumes his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the strictness of it," said Turley, a 5-foot-8, 120-pound sophomore at 
Aliso Niguel High School in Aliso Viejo. "Every day you can learn something new 
or perfect a step. You have to work really hard, but you can achieve a lot of 
things with it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a little boy, Turley never thought he'd become a ballet dancer. When he was 
11, his older sister was taking ballet lessons and one day dared him to join 
her. He began with tendus , simple exercises, and plies , a basic ballet 
movement in which dancers slowly bend their knees outward while keeping their 
backs straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he graduated to more difficult moves, such as air jumps, in which 
he jumps and turns around twice in the air before landing gracefully. He liked 
the precision and discipline ballet entails so much that now ballet is his 
entire focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be technically perfect," said Turley, who practices at least two 
hours a day, six days a week at the prestigious Coast Ballet Academy in San 
Clemente. "It takes as much strength as other sports, but you have to keep it 
more confined because it's an art. You can't be like a football player and go 
'Aargh.' You have to make it beautiful to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time this budding ballet star has spent months away from 
home. He spent the first semester of last year studying at the School of 
American Ballet in New York, and has worked with the Bolshoi's summer academy 
in Vail, Colo., the last two summers. When he is away at ballet schools during 
the school year, he takes his academic high school courses by correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast ballet director Lawrence Rosenberg said Turley is agile and flexible and 
a self-motivated quick learner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in here an 11-year-old boy who had no idea of what ballet was. He had 
no clue," Rosenberg said. "But he is very gifted and has gone from zero to 60 
in a very short time."

SANTA ANA TEEN CHARGED IN KILLING OF UCI STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old from Santa Ana was charged Wednesday with murdering a UC Irvine 
engineering student and with lying in wait, a special circumstance that would 
make him eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinh Quoc Ta was also charged with a second count of attempted murder of a 
young man who was a passenger in Robert Sapinoso's car when Sapinoso, 19, of 
Westminster was fatally shot.  
</P>
<P>
 The friend, a 20-year-old student at Cypress College, was unharmed and later 
provided police with a detailed description of the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso, a bashful computer whiz nicknamed "Zap" for his lightning-fast 
typing, and his friend were at the friend's house in Garden Grove on Aug. 17 
when they saw a passing van they believed had been involved in neighborhood 
vandalism days earlier. They got into Sapinoso's car to chase it and get the 
license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had jotted down all but one digit when someone in the van got out, 
walked up to Sapinoso's car at a stop light on Newland Street and opened fire, 
killing Sapinoso. The friend was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta and a second suspect in the slaying, who is 17, were arrested last week in 
Boston while riding in the van used in the killing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Vickie Hix, a member of the district attorney's anti-gang 
unit, said it is as yet uncertain if the death penalty will be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Hix said the charges filed Wednesday in Municipal Court in Westminster allege 
that any prison sentence should be extended because someone involved in the 
slaying was carrying a gun and the crime was committed in connection with a 
street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying that the defendant was the one who had the gun," said 
Douglas Woodsmall, supervising attorney for the gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Garden Grove Police Department has said that police 
believe others were in the van at the time of the shooting, but are unsure how 
many. The spokesman said officers had names of other suspects thought to be 
members of a "loose," locally based gang. 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment at which Ta will enter his plea to the charges was scheduled 
for Wednesday. But at the hearing, Municipal Judge Robert H. Gallivan appointed 
a public defender to represent Ta and then agreed to postpone the arraignment 
until Sept. 16, apparently to give the lawyer time to study the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallivan also ordered Ta to be held in Orange County Jail without bail, Hix 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodsmall said the second suspect arrested in the slaying, who is 17, is 
scheduled to appear today in Juvenile Court to enter his plea to a homicide 
charge. At that time, he said, the judge will schedule another hearing to 
consider the district attorney's request that the youth be tried as an adult.

SCHOOL HIT BY SCANDAL WELCOMES FRESH START; EDUCATION: WITH CLASSES RESUMING 
TODAY, STUDENTS, TEACHERS AT BREA OLINDA HIGH SEEK TO OVERCOME GRADE-CHANGING 
CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Brea Olinda High School journalism students return to school today, their 
first assignment will be to investigate the transcript tampering scandal that 
surfaced last spring, clouded the summer and is yet to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to ask my students to get the story and try to find out the source 
of the problem," said Dorcas Hufferd, the school's journalism teacher, who 
spent Wednesday preparing her classroom for the students' arrival. "I'm going 
to make sure that they do a very thorough job, because one of the things that 
helped this situation was getting it out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and students on the campus of the award-winning school Wednesday 
acknowledged that the grade-changing controversy -- which involved about 600 
alterations to student transcripts, many of them illegal -- has tarnished the 
school's reputation -- and has prompted them to strive to regain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a real hard job," said Kristi Liscon, 16, a cheerleader who 
was practicing in the school's dance gymnasium Wednesday. "No one respects this 
school or the (administrators) anymore . . . and it's going to be hard to build 
school spirit again." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the negative publicity over the summer, Assistant Supt. Peter J. 
Boothroyd said, dozens of parents from outside the school's attendance 
boundaries have been trying to enroll their children at the high school, which 
last year was named a Blue Ribbon school, the nation's highest academic honor. 
About a dozen names have been placed on a waiting list, Boothroyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know it's a good school," Supt. Peggy Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers and students are not at fault," Hufferd added. "So basically, 
education is going to be the same. The quality is still the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript tampering was brought to light when a former math teacher filed 
a grievance with the teachers union in May after discovering that one of her 
students' grades had been altered without her permission. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month investigation, an independent auditor hired by the school 
district revealed in August that hundreds of students had letter grades 
illegally changed to "pass" notations or received double credit when they 
repeated a course to improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor also reported that Brea Olinda inconsistently calculated failing 
marks in a student's grade-point average if he or she repeated the course and 
posted a passing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal John Johnson admitted that he knew of the grade changes as early as 
July, 1993, but did not alert his superiors. School trustees, who first became 
aware of the problem after the grievance was brought to their attention in May, 
took action to correct it and launched a separate investigation to determine 
who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 That probe by an attorney for the county Department of Education is not 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Liberty, who advises the school's cheerleaders, said she believes that 
most students are "taking (the scandal) in stride." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of an adult thing," she said. "These kids are willing to bring the 
spirit back into the school, and it starts with them. If they don't have it, 
nobody else will." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Kolb, an English teacher who complained about the grade changes to the 
state association that credentials educators, said she plans to discuss the 
meaning of integrity in her classes today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone knows what occurred here, and I am going to focus my first 
lesson on self-pride," she said. "Pride really comes from within. We need to 
recognize an unfortunate, debilitating situation when it occurs and not let it 
wreck our own self-worth." 
</P>
<P>
 "The students have the right to ask questions as far as re-establishing faith 
in our school," she said. "We learn from pain and mistakes, and we are 
responsible for our own actions or inactions. Ultimately, in order to maintain 
self-worth, we must act with integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Added English teacher Estelle Waslosky: "We should be able to take something 
that went wrong, fix it and become better from the experience. That's what 
makes a Blue Ribbon school."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN MIDDLE-CLASS THEME QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both sides in the gubernatorial race chose Orange County to do battle 
Wednesday, with Democrat Kathleen Brown appealing to the middle class during a 
speech on the economy while a high-profile surrogate for Gov. Pete Wilson 
inferred that Brown has shifted her focus to middle-income voters on the advice 
of President Clinton's pollster. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hastily called news conference at the Hyatt Regency Irvine, where 
Brown was to deliver a luncheon speech on her economic recovery plan, New 
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, said the state treasurer's 
middle-income message was devised by the Democratic National Committee in order 
to help party members win elections in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not seen it as being a major concern of (Brown's) until now," Whitman 
said. "All of a sudden, now it's a major concern. That's something that voters 
should watch very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown later contended that Wilson was hiding behind his wife and Whitman while 
avoiding her challenge to five debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her speech to the nonpartisan, nonprofit Orange County Forum, Brown 
told reporters: "Pete Wilson is unleashing Gayle Wilson, Christine Todd Whitman 
and every person he can find to attack me. . . . Why doesn't Pete Wilson come 
out and debate me like a man?" 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Reese, Brown's deputy campaign manager, said that since the start of 
the campaign, Brown has consistently talked about the economy, crime, education 
and about "how failures (on these issues) are undermining the middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is expected to discuss specifics of her economic recovery strategy for 
Southern California at campaign appearances today in Los Angeles and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was billed as a preview of her proposal -- but was more a recap of her 
previously disclosed plan to provide incentives for economic growth statewide 
-- Brown told the Orange County audience that a separate economic strategy is 
needed for Southern California because it has been hardest hit by the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to demonstrate how the "California dream" has faded, Brown said that 
since Wilson took office, Orange County's unemployment rate has increased by 
65% -- now at 6.6% -- and that home and business foreclosures have gone up by 
743%, with 3,000 occurring this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "No wonder people are scared, no wonder they are angry, and no wonder they are 
frustrated," Brown said. "I think that these times call for a governor who 
understands those fears, who can explain to our workers, explain to our 
businesses, explain to our people what is happening to our economy and lay out 
a plan and then fight to get us where we need to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has proposed new industries, such as "advanced transportation" systems, 
as well as shoring up the aerospace industry that has suffered because of 
defense budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of about 500 -- polite but generally unenthusiastic -- applauded 
Brown when she said she supports a ban on the sale and possession of assault 
weapons and when she pledged to carry out the death penalty even though she 
personally opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to play politics with you, I am not going to play politics 
with the death penalty, I am not going to be playing politics with your lives," 
Brown said. "I am going to uphold the law, uphold the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 While trying to focus the campaign debate on the sagging economy, Brown has 
included other issues, such as education, crime and immigration, in her 
economic recovery package. But it is Wilson who set the campaign agenda early 
on by focusing on crime, welfare reform and immigration and who made Brown's 
personal objection to the death penalty a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earlier news conference by Whitman, the New Jersey governor cited 
California's "three strikes" sentencing law as one that helps define Wilson's 
leadership on issues. Whitman, considered a rising star in the GOP, was in 
Texas earlier this week campaigning for Republican gubernatorial candidate 
George W. Bush, son of the former President, who is challenging Gov. Ann 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Whitman's news conference, the Wilson campaign claimed that Brown's 
"middle-income voter" theme had emerged only after Clinton pollster Stanley 
Greenberg detailed in a July memo how Democrats could win elections in 
different regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenberg memo stated that in hypothetical races in the deep South and 
West Coast, "the Democratic incumbent fighting for the middle-class agenda was 
seen as nearly 20 points more convincing than the Republican attacking big 
taxes, gays or big government." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Brown campaign's assertion that the middle-income message has 
always been their main theme, Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said the 
theme did not emerge in their campaign commercials until a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said that if Clinton follows through with plans to help Brown raise 
money in California this month, he will be watched "to see whether his lips are 
moving or not."

FAMALARO WILL NOT CONTEST RETURN TO O.C. IN HUBER CASE; COURTS: SUSPECT IN 
NEWPORT WOMAN'S KILLING WAIVES EXTRADITION IN ARIZONA AND IS TURNED OVER TO 
COSTA MESA POLICE. HE MAY BE TRANSPORTED HERE AS EARLY AS TODAY.

 Murder suspect John J. Famalaro waived extradition Wednesday and could be 
transported to Orange County as early as today to face charges he bludgeoned a 
Newport Beach woman and kept her nude, handcuffed corpse in a freezer for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, answered in a loud, steady voice when Yavapai County Superior 
Court Judge Raymond W. Weaver Jr. asked whether he was prepared to return to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am, your honor," Famalaro replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver then ordered Famalaro into the custody of Costa Mesa police and the 
former house painter, wearing an orange jail uniform, his hands and ankles 
shackled, shuffled from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials have remained tight-lipped about Famalaro's travel 
plans. Arizona defense attorney Thomas K. Kelly said he believes the process 
will be kept secret because of safety concerns for Famalaro, one of Orange 
County's most notorious murder suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Lake Forest resident has pleaded not guilty to the charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a possible death sentence if convicted of killing Denise Huber, 23, 
who disappeared in June, 1991. Her body was found July 13 in a freezer stowed 
inside a stolen rental truck parked in the driveway of Famalaro's country club 
home in Dewey, near Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents made public Wednesday also reveal the lengths Famalaro 
allegedly went to in order to keep the freezer operating. 
</P>
<P>
 When moving the appliance earlier this year from Orange County to Yavapai 
County, Famalaro stopped several times at various stores to plug in the 
freezer, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance of Famalaro's, Jason Clabaugh, told detectives he helped 
Famalaro make the move in exchange for $100 and a return flight to California, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Clabaugh -- who said his mother once dated Famalaro -- said Famalaro insisted 
on plugging the freezer in for at least an hour at a time. Famalaro claimed he 
did not want meat and groceries to spoil in the freezer, which was duct-taped 
shut, according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities found the freezer in the same condition when they discovered it at 
Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Clabaugh also told authorities he also helped Famalaro move the freezer in the 
summer of 1992 from a storage facility in Laguna Hills to a storage locker in 
San Clemente, according to the records filed in support of Famalaro's 
extradition.  
</P>
<P>
 Huber was last seen alive on June 3, 1991, as she was returning home from a 
rock concert. Her car broke down on the Corona del Mar Freeway less than two 
miles from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who once was enrolled in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's training 
academy for reserve officers, was arrested after law enforcement officers 
investigating a report of a stolen truck in his driveway found the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurisdiction later shifted to Orange County when authorities said they 
discovered traces of Huber's blood in a Laguna Hills storage facility where 
Famalaro was living at the time of her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe that Famalaro kidnaped, lured or forced Huber to 
the facility, and bludgeoned her. Some law enforcement officials speculate 
Famalaro may have been posing as a police officer, using a homemade uniform 
found in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents filed in support of a search warrant show Famalaro purchased the 
23-cubic-foot freezer on June 10, 1991 -- just days after Huber's disappearance 
-- and charged the $562.49 total to his American Express charge card. The 
appliance was delivered to the Laguna Hills storage facility on June 12, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A delivery receipt was signed "J. Famalaro," according to the records made 
public Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood at the storage facility and the purchase of the freezer have led 
authorities to believe Huber was murdered shortly after her abduction and kept 
in the freezer ever since.

THEO LACY JAIL EXPANSION PLAN RAISES SAFETY ISSUES; FACILITY: PROPOSAL TO ADD 
BEDS AND HOUSE MAXIMUM-SECURITY INMATES CAUSES CONCERN FOR SEVERAL NEARBY 
PROPERTY OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The proposed Theo Lacy Branch Jail expansion has sparked serious safety 
concerns among several nearby property owners, including the county's Social 
Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Leaman, director of the Social Services Agency, told county planners 
that the Orangewood Children's Home -- located next to the jail -- would need 
two sheriff's deputies 24 hours a day and additional surveillance cameras to 
offset the effects of the jail expansion and increased activity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaman said Wednesday that he wants to alert county planners to possible 
trouble spots, but he added that his agency is not opposed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just acting in our role as advocate for our kids and our department," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County planners, who are reviewing the environmental impacts of the jail 
expansion, also received letters this week from others concerned about the 
plans: UCI Medical Center in Orange, the city of Orange and a developer 
interested in buying a shopping center across the street from Theo Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to safety issues, some of the letters address concerns such as 
traffic, construction and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have proposed the Theo Lacy expansion as a short-term 
solution to chronic overcrowding at local jails. The problem has been 
compounded in recent months by violent jail disturbances and an increased 
demand for jail beds caused by the state's new "three strikes and you're out" 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the expansion proposal, the county is prepared to increase the number of 
jail beds from 1,326 to as many as 4,480. The plan also calls for the placement 
of maximum-security inmates at Theo Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Orange officials sued the county over the housing of such inmates at 
Theo Lacy, which was originally intended for minimum- to medium-security 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange officials, however, are not alone in their concerns over the future of 
Theo Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "With an increase in prisoners at the expanded location . . . we are extremely 
concerned that the public will feel or perceive a lack in security in the 
area," Jerry Engen, development director for the Mills Corp., wrote in an Aug. 
25 letter to the county Environmental Management Agency. His company is 
planning to revitalize The City Shopping Center, which is down the street on 
The City Drive from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are also worried that maximum-security measures, if used, would provide a 
visual expression of a penitentiary and cause customers to avoid the center," 
Engen added. "Frankly, your possible location of an expanded jail facility 
across the street from an area which we are considering for a major investment 
causes us a great deal of concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Demerjian, director of UC Irvine's office of campus and environmental 
planning, said the university is worried about any negative fallout the 
expansion might have on its medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the community's heightened awareness of the expansion and the housing 
of maximum-security inmates "will invariably have a detrimental impact on the 
medical center's efforts to improve its image as an outstanding medical 
research center and regional, comprehensive patient-care facility that operates 
within a safe 24-hour environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates, who vigorously supports the expansion, also wrote to the 
county, urging planners to bypass the environmental review process and begin 
work immediately. He also encouraged county officials to consider expanding 
other jails, such as the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea of expanding the Irvine facility did not go over well among 
community leaders there. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden Irvine is everyone's whipping boy," Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond complained. "They must think that we have it too good or something." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Irvine already takes on its share of "regional burdens" by 
accommodating military bases, two major freeways, an airport, two dump sites 
and the Musick facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should look to other communities to share the impacts and take 
on their fair share of the burdens," Hammond said. "I would be opposed to 
expanding at Musick." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes Musick, 
said he also would resist expanding the Irvine facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for the sheriff, but I made a promise to the community" that 
Musick would not be expanded, Riley said.

CHIEF DEFENDS LAPD'S RECORD IN SHOOTINGS; SAFETY: WILLIAMS SAYS THERE ARE TOO 
MANY PROBLEM INCIDENTS, BUT SEES NO 'INORDINATE PROBLEM.' A REVIEW WILL TRY TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER OFFENSES ARE CONCENTRATED IN ANY PART OF THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, facing questions about the 
frequency of police shooting errors, said Wednesday that he believes there are 
too many problem shootings on the force, but he told City Council members he 
sees no "inordinate problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's explanations drew praise and occasional skepticism at a hearing 
before the council's Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas pressed Williams on whether he considers it 
acceptable for about 20% of department shootings to be found "out of policy," 
suggesting that such problems have fueled "an incredibly high number" of often 
expensive lawsuits against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman, who represents South-Central Los Angeles, said he wants police 
officials to compile statistics showing whether problem shootings are 
concentrated in any particular area of the city. Williams, flanked at the 
half-hour hearing by his top deputy for training issues, said his staff would 
start on the request immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that firearms safety is a top priority in the department and 
that the LAPD's system for reviewing shootings serves as a model for other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "I'm not satisfied that 20% of our shootings are judged out of 
policy. I'm never satisfied when we have any shootings that are found to be out 
of policy. That means that something is significantly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pull (the trigger of) a gun, you can never bring that bullet back. I 
think the only standard (for out of policy shootings) should be zero," the 
chief said.  
</P>
<P>
 Council member Laura Chick, saying she "wanted to compliment the department," 
told Williams: "I can't think of a thing that you're missing in terms of 
scrutinizing (shootings)." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, prompted by an Aug. 14 article in The Times that detailed 
patterns of errors in police shootings, marked the first time that Williams had 
personally addressed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas, writing for himself and Public Safety Committee Chairman Marvin 
Braude, told Williams in a letter two weeks ago that the article had generated 
a significant amount of interest among City Council members, and he asked the 
chief to respond to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times report found that in three out of every four police shootings since 
1989, police had found potentially life-threatening mistakes that required 
corrective action. In more than half of the nearly 700 shootings, officers were 
ordered to undergo retraining because of errors, while a quarter resulted in 
more serious discipline, including suspensions or dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes ranged from tactical but potentially dangerous lapses, such as an 
officer failing to take cover or splitting up with his or her partner, to more 
serious errors such as firing down a crowded street or shooting an unarmed 
suspect who did not display a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report has prompted state officials who oversee policing standards to 
consider a narrow review of their own into LAPD shootings, focusing on whether 
hearing-related problems may have played a part in communications breakdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 The state's Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training has recently 
begun a yearlong study into hearing guidelines for law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to find out if these (shooting problems) are misunderstandings that 
might have been precipitated in some cases by poor hearing," said Shelley 
Spilberg, an industrial psychologist with the agency. To find out, she added, 
the panel on peace officer standards may ask the department for access to 
recent shooting records. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have said officers often regard training in the wake of a 
shooting as a negative, punitive measure that reflects their shortcomings.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams disagreed Wednesday, saying that training is only intended to improve 
performance, not to punish the officer. "This commitment to continuous 
improvement has enabled the department to develop one of the most complete, if 
not the most complete, firearms and use of force training curricula in the 
United States," he said.

COUNTY URGED TO RETAKE CONTROL OF FILM OFFICE; MOVIES: CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE 
OFFICER SALLY REED WILL ALSO RECOMMEND THAT ITS RECENTLY FIRED DIRECTOR BE PUT 
IN CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an illustration of the movie industry's clout, county Chief Administrative 
Officer Sally Reed is recommending that the county take back control of film 
permitting operations from a private firm that has come under heavy fire for 
dismissing its popular film office director. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Reed said she will urge the Board of Supervisors to hire the deposed 
director, Stephanie Liner, to direct the county's film activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation came after a weeklong examination of film office operations 
and finances that was sparked by the Aug. 16 firing of Liner, who had won 
praise from film executives for her work in promoting industry affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The review of film office operations was ordered by the Board of Supervisors 
after about 30 film industry executives showed up at a public hearing last week 
to support Liner. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Reed said she concluded that there were no 
substantive problems with film office operations, but there appeared to be 
conflicts between the Economic Development Corp. and the county in defining the 
role of the film office director. The Economic Development Corp. was hired by 
the county in 1990 to run the film office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problems centered on differences in style and in ways of doing 
things," Reed said. "Our whole discussion centered around our belief that the 
work Liner was doing was important and that she played a critical role. We 
didn't seem to be able to reconcile that with the management at the EDC." 
</P>
<P>
 In her work at the film office, Liner had focused on easing restrictions on 
film crews, building community support for the industry and marketing Los 
Angeles County's production expertise to retain its status as filmmaking 
capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been credited with helping to stem the flight of filmmakers from Los 
Angeles, which gets $5 billion a year from film and television production. 
Liner had worked in the county film office for three years, the last year as 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Wednesday that she was still in shock over the events of the last few 
weeks but that she is willing to do whatever is best for the film industry and 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the proactive stance the county is taking is very encouraging," Liner 
said. "The film industry runs in a different fashion than other industries. It 
is changing all the time, and it really takes someone who can pay attention to 
their needs but who also has the ear of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives voiced cautious support for the proposed realignment of 
the film office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are comfortable with Reed's recommendations as long as it will 
preserve the level of service we want and . . . we can get strong assurances 
that the transition will be smoothly arranged," said Kathleen Milnes, director 
of governmental affairs for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television 
Producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the amount of attention this issue is getting is very encouraging. 
The county has taken a strong interest in the film industry and its needs, and 
this is another example of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said money for Liner's position would come from about $118,000 in surplus 
funds accrued by the film office in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who will make her recommendation to the board Tuesday, alluded to the 
importance the county assigns to its relationship with the film industry and to 
the industry's outpouring of support for Liner. 
</P>
<P>
 "These recommendations are not intended to be a slap at the EDC," Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the development corporation have declined to discuss Liner's 
firing, citing confidentiality. Speculation over her ouster, though, had 
centered on her support for merging the Los Angeles city and county film 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors has already approved the merger and has received the 
support of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. The City Council is expected to 
vote on the matter in the next few weeks. If the merger is approved, the county 
would form a nonprofit organization to handle the city-county film permit 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several supervisors said they had not had a chance to study Reed's 
recommendations and could not comment. Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who has been 
a vocal supporter of the film office, said it made sense for the county to 
control it until a merger can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is a step forward in our continuing effort to attract and retain 
the film industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Conley, president of the development corporation, said his organization 
also agreed with Reed that "in view of the concerns expressed by the industry 
and the county, this is the only way the issue could be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sensible solution, and overall in everyone's best interest," said 
Conley. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed concern that Reed's recommendation not be seen as a criticism of 
the development corporation's efforts to promote the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have . . . an outstanding track record of assisting and serving the film 
industry through the film office, and we've done a great number of things on 
our own to promote the industry. We expect to continue to do that," he said.

FORMER L.A. DRUG KINGPIN IS SET FREE; CRIME: RICKY ROSS, ALSO KNOWN AS FREEWAY 
RICK, VOWS TO HELP YOUNGSTERS AVOID HIS MISTAKES AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM A TEXAS 
JAIL. HE ONCE RAN A COAST-TO-COAST COCAINE EMPIRE. 
</P>

<P>
 The notorious Los Angeles drug lord known as Freeway Rick, who once boasted 
that his coast-to-coast cocaine empire grossed more than $1 million a day, 
walked out of a Texas jail Wednesday and vowed to return home in search of 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Donnell Ross, 34, who in the 1980s probably rose faster and higher than 
any other drug trafficker from the streets of South-Central Los Angeles, said 
he hoped to head back to his old neighborhood as soon as possible and devote 
his life to warning youngsters about the mistakes that kept him locked up for 
most of the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely going to stage a turn-around," Ross said as he stepped out of 
the Smith County Jail, sporting dreadlocks, a trim beard and a movie star 
smile. "A lot of times we let our environment control us, instead of 
controlling our own environment." 
</P>
<P>
 For at least the next two months, Ross will be hooked to an electronic 
tracking bracelet at his father's home in Tyler, the small East Texas 
rose-cultivating community where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross had been in jail in Tyler since December, when he received a 10-year 
prison sentence for conspiring to transport cocaine to two cousins on the 
outskirts of town, located in a dry county where even the sale of alcohol is a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross, who spent the previous four years in federal prison for conspiring 
to ship nearly 20 pounds of cocaine from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, was given 
credit for his time served by Texas authorities, who were able to keep him for 
just eight months in a minimum-security jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done his time," said Ross' mother, Annie Mae, who drove from her Los 
Angeles home to hug her son as he stepped out on a steamy afternoon in a denim 
jacket and shiny white basketball shoes. "I think he's had a chance to learn 
quite a bit about life." 
</P>
<P>
 While behind bars, Ross said, he learned to read and write for the first time, 
studied the Bible and counseled younger inmates about the dangers of easy 
money. He also affirmed his commitment to build a youth center on the site of 
an abandoned Adams Boulevard theater, which he began to purchase years ago with 
his illicit profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, who once told authorities that he had nearly $2 million socked away 
before his empire crumbled, insists that he now has nothing to show for it -- a 
fortune lost to attorney fees, shaky business deals and double-crossing rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm broke," said Ross, who hopes to raise several million dollars through 
legitimate ventures for his proposed Freeway Academy when Texas parole 
officials allow him to return to Los Angeles. "I got $57." 
</P>
<P>
 A onetime tennis star at Dorsey High School, Ross entered the drug trade on a 
$125 investment, eventually supplying rock houses across South-Central before 
branching out to become one of the nation's most prolific cocaine wholesalers. 
Although he was functionally illiterate, Ross displayed shrewd business sense, 
negotiating bulk purchases directly from Colombian cartels and undercutting his 
competition by selling hundreds of kilograms a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the biggest-time dope dealer to come up from the streets of 
South-Central," said Jim Galipeau, a veteran of Los Angeles County's Probation 
Department gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Galipeau said Ross' reputation was enhanced by his eschewal of the flashy 
trappings flaunted by his high-rolling peers -- no gold chains, no luxury 
sedans, no fine Italian suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was more like a Robin Hood-type guy," Galipeau said. "You never heard of 
him getting high or drinking or beating women or dealing dope to kids. The guy 
really had a reputation for helping people out and giving money back to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 But he remained the nemesis of Los Angeles narcotics detectives, who formed an 
elite anti-drug squad for the sole purpose of dismantling Ross' operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies caught up with him in 1987, when they spotted Ross driving 
through South-Central and chased him until he pulled into a driveway and 
escaped by scaling a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers claimed that Ross fired a shot at them and left behind a kilo of 
cocaine in his trunk. But federal prosecutors, who later indicted the deputies 
on money-skimming and civil rights charges, said it was the officers who fired 
at Ross, then lied about finding the cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that incident, Ross moved on to Ohio, where he became known on 
the streets as the "10-million-dollar man" because of the huge profits that he 
was believed to be making. When authorities indicted him there, he was able to 
cut his 10-year prison sentence in half by testifying in Los Angeles against 
the corrupt deputies.

CHALLENGE TO ANONYMITY OF JURORS REJECTED; COURTS: MUNICIPAL JUDGE TURNS DOWN 
REQUEST BY PUBLIC DEFENDER, SAYING IT IS UP TO THE BENCH TO PROTECT PANELISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Wednesday rejected the first legal challenge to his unusual policy of 
withholding the names of all jurors in every criminal case tried in his 
Bellflower courthouse, saying that if judges don't take steps to protect 
jurors, no one else will. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing marked by the unusual spectacle of a judge arguing his own case 
from the bench, Philip K. Mautino, presiding judge of Los Cerritos Municipal 
Court, spurned an attempt by the Los Angeles public defender's office to 
disclose the names of jurors in an upcoming case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Steve Lund, echoing criticism leveled at Mautino's 
policy by legal scholars and defense attorneys, said juror anonymity violates a 
defendant's right to a public trial. It also biases a case against the 
defendant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It creates prejudice in the minds of the jurors that the defendant is 
dangerous and that they have something to fear," Lund said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office plans to ask the appellate department of Los 
Angeles Superior Court today to reverse Mautino, joining a similar challenge 
that was filed Aug. 19. The earlier case seeks to force the presiding judge of 
Downey Municipal Court, David Lord, to disclose the names of jurors in a case 
in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino has drawn national attention for presiding over what is probably the 
only courthouse in America where jurors in every criminal case are anonymous. 
Anonymous panels are generally employed in the rare cases in which jurors might 
face threats or harassment. But Mautino, saying that jurors are increasingly 
nervous about serving, decided in January to use anonymity in all five of the 
courtrooms in Bellflower, even though they handle only misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles public defender's office decided to challenge any policy of 
blanket anonymity it discovered. Cases being heard by Mautino and Lord have 
resulted in the only challenges so far. One other judge in the Downey 
courthouse and all four of the others in Bellflower use anonymous panels. 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel's office will defend the two judges. Deputy County Counsel 
Dan McCoy said he will argue that judges have the discretion to withhold 
jurors' names. But Lund argued that the California Code of Civil Procedure, on 
which Mautino based his policy, does not allow juror anonymity without a 
demonstration that there is a "compelling governmental interest" in it. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing Wednesday, Mautino said public defenders and prosecutors 
are advocates for their own positions, so looking after jurors' safety and 
peace of mind fell to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think, gentlemen, that there is anyone stepping up and advocating for 
the jurors' rights," he said, "and if the judge doesn't do it, I don't think 
there is anybody in the court process who is going to do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino said that since January, 1,800 jurors have reported for duty and been 
offered the choice of anonymity or use of their names. All have selected 
anonymity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Code of Civil Procedure allows jurors to have identifying 
information sealed after trial, Mautino said. But that is a "misrepresentation" 
because by then, jurors' names have been announced in open court and written 
down in lawyers' and spectators' notes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the intent of the Legislature is to protect jurors, Mautino said, the only 
way is to offer anonymity from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino said prospective jurors are more forthcoming about their lives in 
pretrial questioning than they were before he began using anonymity. That 
frankness, he said, is good for everyone because the defense and prosecution 
can better evaluate potential panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Ricciardulli, the deputy public defender supervising the appeals on the 
jury anonymity issue, said that if the appellate department strikes down 
Mautino's and Lord's practices, the decision will not be binding on other 
courts, but will be influential because "other judges know how to read the 
writing on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The case would have to be decided by the state appeals court to be cited as 
precedent for all California courts, Ricciardulli said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; LIBRARY PINS ITS HOPES ON VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the first tasks that Community Services Director Gary Wann faced when 
he started his job in July, 1993, was to tell 29 library staff members that 
they were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the distinct pleasure of bringing those people in and telling them," he 
said, shaking his head. The experience was symptomatic of the general state of 
the library, which has lost nearly $1 million from its budget over the past 
three years. The Santiago Hills branch had to close its doors last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet notices went out in August announcing that the library was expanding its 
hours. Children's story hours are continuing and schoolchildren can still rush 
in and ask adults for help with homework assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now comes the restoration period," Wann said. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish that, the Orange Public Library is relying on volunteer power as 
never before, even in some non-traditional areas such as check-out and 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to be nice to have," branch supervisor Robert Felthaus said of the 
volunteers. "Now they're necessary to have." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 volunteers already help out or are in training. And the search for 
more continues in an "all-out ad campaign," Wann said. The staff would like 30 
more to apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, City Manager David F. Dixon said he was forming an ad hoc committee 
of community members to look at the library's problems. Wann, who will serve on 
the committee of six or seven members, admitted that the announcement has made 
the library's Board of Trustees "a little testy." 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities to be considered by the committee include an assessment tax, a 
charitable foundation and joint use with Santiago Hills College, Wann said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he hopes the committee's eventual recommendations coincide with the 
library's own study, called Orange Public Library 2000, which will try to set 
policies to keep the battered institution alive and working. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at the last educational infrastructure in the state," Wann 
said of libraries, which are in crisis nationwide. "You lose the library and 
you lose a whole generation of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange has one of the smallest main libraries in the county. With a city 
population pushing 120,000, the library is only 17,000 square feet. According 
to national standards, that figure should be about 55,000, Wann said. The 
yearly book budget has gone from $300,000 to just over $100,000 since the cuts 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 With volunteers manning circulation desks, shelving books and taking care of 
children's needs, Wann hopes that trained librarians can concentrate on 
reference and other areas where their expertise is crucial. Any retired 
librarians will be welcome at these desks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They all anticipate the opening of most schools next week, when the real test 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "When schools open and the first few (homework) assignments are due, that's 
when we'll know," Wann said. "That's when the test of using volunteers in 
non-traditional areas will begin." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PENSION 'SPIKING' BELIEVED THWARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city could be off the hook of paying millions of dollars to city employees 
who had hoped to retire with inflated pensions, officials announced Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson said the state Public Employees' Retirement 
System (PERS) has notified the city it will not accept conversions of benefits 
for any period other than the 12 months just before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had estimated a tab of $10 million to $13 million for 153 city 
employees who converted such benefits as unused vacation days and car 
allowances into salary in order to increase their final compensation, which 
determines the amount of their pensions. The practice is known as pension 
"spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me that this policy of PERS could save the city from a liability 
of up to $10 million for those who have not yet retired," Councilman David 
Sullivan said, "because from the time they spike their salaries, they would 
have to retire within 12 months." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson also said the city may not be liable for most of that amount 
because a majority of the employees have not retired and most, according to the 
retirement system's policy, would not be eligible to pad their pensions. 
Moreover, most are not expected to retire for at least several years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said the city last week received a letter from PERS that 
spelled out its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer said City Council actions in recent months that 
questioned the practice of pension spiking "forced PERS to take a better 
accounting of how their rules are applied. . . . We did a service to the people 
of California." 
</P>
<P>
 The employees had requested the increased retirement pay before the practice 
became illegal in the state on July 1. Under past contracts with employees, 
conversion of the benefits to compensation was allowed.  
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said that because pension spiking was a questionable 
practice, "this council majority has been opposed to that practice and has 
tried to rid that from contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council prohibited the conversions as of Jan. 31, 1994, and five of 
the city's employee unions have agreed to stop the practice, officials said. 
The city and the firefighters' association have reached an apparent impasse in 
negotiations for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Robert Franz said he did not know how many of the 
153 employees who had hoped to increase their pensions have retired to date, or 
how many plan to retire soon and would be eligible to convert their benefits 
under the retirement system's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said about a dozen employees are expected to retire this 
year, fewer than the yearly average of 20 to 30 retirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city has yet to resolve the issue of paying a nearly $919,000 
bill from PERS to cover pension-spiking costs of employees who have already 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still discussing that matter with PERS," Sullivan said. DEBRA CANO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
GROUP SEEKS TO BLOCK MTA FARE HIKE AS DISCRIMINATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of community activist organizations Wednesday filed suit against the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, alleging that higher bus fares scheduled 
to start today violate civil rights protections by unfairly penalizing 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations have asked for a temporary restraining order to block the 
new fare structure from going into effect.Under a system adopted in July, basic 
fares will go from $1.10 to $1.35 -- the first hike in six years -- and general 
monthly passes will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the class-action lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that the new system 
disproportionately affects poor residents, who make up the majority of the 
MTA's ridership and who are mostly ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Terry Hatter is expected to rule this morning on the 
request for a temporary restraining order.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TAKES STEPS TO 
TIGHTEN PENALTIES FOR FALSE-ALARM CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to reduce or at least underwrite thousands of costly false-alarm calls 
to police, the Los Angeles City Council moved Wednesday to impose fines sooner 
on residents and business owners who summon help needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the objections of the security alarm industry, the proposal sent to 
the city attorney's office for review calls for alarm system owners to be fined 
$80 for each false alarm after the second call within 12 months. Police 
currently impose the fine after the fourth such call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two (false alarms) should be enough," Councilwoman Rita Walters said. "It'll 
be like the Auto Club: If you call them too often, they tell you to buy a new 
car."  
</P>
<P>
 Industry representatives were irate about the stricter fines, which they said 
disgruntled customers may force them to absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too drastic . . . and there's no rationale for the council to do it, 
except to make more money than they really need," said Vince Nigro, president 
of the Los Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, 95% of the 161,000 alarm calls made last year were false, 
making up nearly one-fifth of all calls for police service and costing the city 
an estimated $2.8 million in lost police time. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members acknowledged Wednesday that the proposed ordinance, expected 
to be enacted this fall, will not eliminate false alarms, which are generally 
triggered by human error, faulty equipment or bad weather. But the new law may 
lead to fewer human errors and put indirect pressure on alarm companies to 
improve the technology or hasten repairs, council members said. State law 
prohibits the city from imposing the fines directly on the alarm companies, 
even though they are responsible for false alarms caused by faulty equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, co-authored by council members Marvin Braude, Laura Chick and 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, also would make it a misdemeanor -- punishable by a maximum 
fine of $1,000 and a year in jail -- to fail to register a residential or 
commercial burglar alarm with police, which costs $31 annually. Currently, only 
about one-third of the 300,000 systems in Los Angeles are registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of unregistered alarm systems would be fined after the first false 
alarm under a slightly harsher system than the one proposed for registered 
owners.

 A teen-ager repeatedly hit with a baton by a Compton police officer in a 
beating captured on videotape was in Juvenile Court on Wednesday, though no 
criminal charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing in Compton Juvenile Court, like all criminal proceedings there, 
was closed to the public.Soltero is due back in court Sept. 7 to learn if 
charges will be brought and whether he will be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 But Felipe Soltero's attorney, Humberto Guizar, said afterward that if 
prosecutors decide to file charges against his client, he will take the unusual

 "It's a situation where they should have dismissed this case, and they've 
indicated to us that they may be filing felony charges in the adult court now 
because Felipe's 18," Guizar said.

 Soltero was arrested July 29 at the Westland trailer park in Compton. The 
arrest gained national notoriety after a local TV station aired a videotape of 
it that showed Compton Police Officer Michael Jackson repeatedly striking 
Soltero with a baton.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COLLEGE 
DISTRICT BOARD OKS $371-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community College District board of trustees unanimously 
approved a precariously balanced $371.3-million budget for next year as a 
special committee continued to look for more ways to reduce spending. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials cut central office operations to keep funding at each of 
the nine colleges at "essentially the same level of funding" as last year, 
according to interim Chancellor Neil Yoneji. But, Yoneji added in a budget 
cover letter to trustees, a committee will make recommendations for further 
reductions.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS ARGUE AGAINST CURBING POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony and Southern California Islamic leader 
Hassan Hathout took issue Wednesday with those who would place controls on 
worldwide population. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint statement, the two religious leaders said they disagree with the 
premise behind the United Nations conference, which will get under way in Cairo 
on Monday and run through Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Some population experts believe that the planet, with about 5.5 billion 
people, has roughly 2 billion more than it can support adequately, given 
existing resources.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mahony and Hathout said they are concerned about official programs aimed 
at curbing population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support . . . exploration of the serious problems linked to population 
growth. However, we are deeply concerned about a portion of the philosophy and 
strategy presented within the draft text of the Cairo Conference," the 
statement said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; STUDENT WHO GOT TB SUES DISTRICT, COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old woman who lost part of a lung as a result of a tuberculosis 
outbreak last year at La Quinta High School filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the 
county and the Garden Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi French contends in her lawsuit that the school district and the Orange 
County Health Care Agency negligently failed to warn the La Quinta student body 
after they learned in January, 1991, that a student had been diagnosed with 
contagious tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that French was diagnosed with TB in May, 1993, and only 
became aware in September that a similar strain of drug-resistant TB had been 
diagnosed among other classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 French, who lives with her family in Garden Grove, had part of a lung removed 
to halt the spread of the disease when more common drug treatments did not 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard E. McCain, her lawyer, said that French is seeking compensation for 
her past and future medical bills, which so far amount to "several hundred 
thousand dollars," much of which will not be covered by insurance. He said she 
also wants compensation for the emotional toll of her illness, which forced her 
to be quarantined and, ultimately, to drop out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, was filed after both the school 
district and the county rejected claims filed by French. 
</P>
<P>
 "In view of the facts, we have no recourse but to disclaim any liability on 
behalf of the county of Orange, its departments and employees," the county risk 
management department wrote to McCain in a letter dated Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh F. Stallworth, the county's public health officer, and Alan Trudell, 
spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District, declined to comment on 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta High School Principal Mitch Thomas said that French is expected to 
return to La Quinta to finish her senior year when school resumes next week.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 'STRATEGIC PLANNING' REAPS DISTRICT 
PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pupils and parents in the Huntington Beach Union High School District already 
are reaping a profit from the school system's new "strategic planning." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the goals of the district's newly implemented planning system was to 
have consultants guide teachers and staff in how to apply for federal and state 
grants. The district implemented that planning last year by paying $30,000 for 
the service of two grant-writer consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, according to Supt. David Hagen, was a total of $800,000 in new 
grants to the high schools in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen announced the grants on Tuesday night as part of the district's review 
of its new strategic planning system. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning involves representatives of teachers, parents, district staff and 
board members agreeing on major goals for the high schools. The 1993-94 school 
year launched the program, and the $800,000 in grants the district received 
more than paid for the $303,000 total cost of starting the new planning system, 
school officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has budgeted $297,000 for the strategic planning program in the 
1994-95 school year. That amount includes $40,000 for again hiring the 
consultants to help with grant writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consultants train teachers and administrators in how to write grants and 
what grant readers (in state and federal governments) are looking for," Hagen 
said. "They also tell us about possible grant opportunities out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, at its regular meeting Tuesday night, praised the new 
strategic planning system not only for the money it is bringing in, but also 
for the teamwork it encourages among parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved "strategic planning" goals for the forthcoming school year 
that include "long-range plans for infusion of technology into and across the 
curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
 The school district governs all public high schools in Huntington Beach, 
Fountain Valley and Westminster. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; VALENCIA HIGH COPES WITH EFFECTS OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers and administrators getting ready for the first day of school at 
Valencia High School face an additional challenge this year: Half of the 
school's administrative wing and hundreds of student records were destroyed in 
an arson fire in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all of the records can be re-created from computer data not destroyed 
in the fire, Principal George Allen said, it will take months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with the fire damage certainly has complicated the process of 
registering students and working out schedules," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 29 fire destroyed the wing that housed the school's counselor, two 
social workers, a psychologist and one of two assistant principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bailey, director of facilities for the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified 
School District, said that about 4,800 square feet of office space was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the records lost were discipline files that will be re-created as 
needed, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding is expected to begin this week. The project will take about four 
months and cost about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary facilities have been set up for the displaced staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire investigators have determined that the fire was deliberately 
set, but they have no suspects. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL BUDGET AGAIN PROVIDES NO RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Unified School District officials forecast another tough school year 
Tuesday night, unveiling a $98.7-million budget for 1994-95 that spares the 
district's 1,912 employees from layoffs but offers little hope for salary 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great deal we haven't been doing," said Paul Reed, deputy 
superintendent of business services, referring to what would be the third 
consecutive school year with no increased spending planned for programs or 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher salaries in the 21,500-student school district range from $26,000 to 
$56,000 a year, averaging $43,628, according to district statistics. 
Negotiations with all district employees, whose contracts expired in June, are 
expected to begin this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district and the teachers over the last couple of years have enjoyed a 
good working relationship during these difficult times," Irvine Teachers Assn. 
President Steve Garretson said. "But this is going to be three years without a 
pay raise and people are very anxious about that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine school district ended the 1993-94 school year with $4.2 million in 
reserves, which is 4.5% of its total budget and well above the 3% required by 
the state. But with the new South Lake Middle School opening in September, 
expenditures are expected to increase by $1.6 million for the school year that 
begins Wednesday, leaving a projected 3.3% ending balance for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reserve funds are still moving in the wrong direction," said Ken Horner, 
district director of business services. "It's a struggle every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Mary Ellen Hadley, Orange County director of the California School 
Boards Assn., said she finds no financial relief in sight because of ongoing 
state budget shortfalls. Irvine Unified has been spared layoffs, according to 
Hadley, through cuts in programs and hikes in fees for busing and food 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our pain pills early on," Hadley said.  
</P>
<P>
 The current state budget calls for no reduction in the $4,217 in funding 
provided for each Irvine student. But board members and district budget 
planners worry that lawmakers may suspend Proposition 98's funding guarantees 
for public education unless the state receives by November the federal funds it 
seeks as reimbursement for costs of handling illegal immigrants. The school 
board will vote on the adoption of the budget at its Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think that it's pretty unlikely there's going to be the necessary 
two-thirds of the legislators who would vote to suspend Proposition 98," said 
school board President Mike Regele. "But who knows? This adds a new level of 
uncertainty."RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; WATER DISTRICT GETS WARNING BY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an investigation sparked by a whistle-blower, the Los Alisos Water 
District has been warned by the state to improve its reporting of sewage 
spills, use of trained workers and maintenance of flow meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district, which serves Lake Forest, has presented a plan to the 
California Regional Water Quality Control Board on how it will accurately 
report sewage spills, allow only qualified personnel to oversee treatment 
plants and properly calibrate all water flow meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, sent to the regional board on Wednesday, has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Los Alisos employee had complained to the regional board about 
irregularities in maintenance, spill reporting and employee training. 
</P>
<P>
 In an inspection July 27, the board found that the district had failed to 
report two instances where sewage seeped through manholes. The first spill 
occurred on Nov. 31, 1990. The second spill, of 12,500 gallons of raw sewage, 
happened on March 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying really hard here," said Los Alisos general manager Tom 
McFadden. "Our crews went out and cleaned up after the spills. The failure is 
that we don't have a record of reporting them, even though our people thought 
we had notified the board." LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DRUG-SNIFFING DOG SHOWS HIS STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Wednesday demonstrated their narcotics-sniffing-canine program to 
four trustees of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, hoping to persuade 
them to use the dogs in Costa Mesa high schools this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presentation, Niro II, a 5-year-old Belgian sheep dog, successfully 
found marijuana, heroin and cocaine hidden in three of 65 training lockers 
outside the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things couldn't have gone better," Sgt. Karl Schuler, the department's canine 
supervisor, said of the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward Decker asked Supt. Mac Bernd to place the proposal to 
use drug-sniffing dogs in two Costa Mesa high schools on the trustees' Sept. 13 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, police would bring three dogs onto Costa Mesa and Estancia 
high school campuses to sniff student lockers and walk around cars in the 
parking lot this fall. If drugs are found, school authorities would be 
notified, Schuler said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And if it's a big case, they can hand it over to us," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and parents at Orange and Huntington Beach high schools have 
criticized their school districts' use of drug-sniffing dogs, saying the policy 
violates students' constitutional protection against illegal searches and 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker said he liked the idea of allowing canines on campus because they would 
serve as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Department has thought all this out very carefully and researched 
it, and I think (the board) should take advantage of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members at the demonstration in addition to Decker were Vice President 
Judith Franco, Roderick H. MacMillian and Forrest Werner. All four have said 
they are interested in the proposal but want community input before they vote. 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillian said he likes the program but is worried that the dogs might pose a 
physical risk to students. But Bernd said he found Niro II to be gentle. 
</P>
<P>
 The city owns three drug-sniffing dogs, but only two have completed their 
training. The third dog that would be used for the school searches is Dingo, a 
German shepherd that the Orange County Probation Department would lend police, 
Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief David L. Snowden first suggested using the dogs to sniff out 
drugs in the schools last spring while the department was in the midst of 
training them. The Police Department decided to give the presentation so board 
members would know more about the approach before formally discussing the 
issue.TOM RAGAN

MAN CHARGED IN CABDRIVER'S SLAYING, SUSPECTED IN 2 MORE DEATHS 
</P>

<P>
 When investigators found a Hollywood cabdriver slumped across his car seat 
with a fistful of bloodstained money, they had no idea he was only one victim 
in an apparent series of killings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Andrei Belei, 24, was charged with one count of first-degree 
murder in the cabdriver's death, and Los Angeles police said they suspect that 
he killed a man and a pregnant woman in Downtown Los Angeles. Police would not 
reveal the victims' identities until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old cabdriver was shot in the head about 12:30 p.m. Monday on 
Willow Glen Road in Hollywood. Investigators said he had the $33 in 
bloodstained bills in a "death grip" when his body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Belei, a truck driver for a shipping company, half a mile from 
the scene after he knocked on the door of a house, said he had been carjacked 
and asked that police be called. When officers saw Belei, he matched the 
description that witnesses had given of the suspect in the cabdriver's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was wearing a black leather jacket in 90-degree weather," Detective 
Andrew Purdy said, and was 6 feet, 4 inches tall. "It wasn't hard to spot him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found a loaded .38-caliber revolver, extra cartridges and a 
nearly seven-ounce rock of crack cocaine in Belei's pockets. Spent casings were 
found in bushes where police said Belei had been hiding.

<P>
 At first, Belei was suspected only of killing the cabdriver, but his 
statements to police implicated him in the slayings of the two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had discovered the two bodies, both with multiple bullet wounds, after 
neighbors reported hearing several gunshots in the small loft apartment before 
8 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Belei told police he had known the two and had visited them Monday morning. 
Police took Belei to the loft, where witnesses placed him at the scene about 
the time of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they also are investigating the killing Monday of a homeless man 
in the Downtown area that they believe may be linked to the loft murders.

LOTTERY WINNER ORDERED TO REPAY FRAUD VICTIMS; COURTS: JURY SAYS A. BERNARD 
SILVER MUST TURN OVER SOME OF THE $10.3 MILLION TO THE 200 PEOPLE WHO LOST $26 
MILLION WITH INVESTMENT FIRM HE MANAGED. 
</P>

<P>
 On Jan. 6, 1990, A. Bernard Silver hit the jackpot when he won $10.3 million 
in the state lottery. But on Wednesday the financial news wasn't so good. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica jury decided that Silver, formerly the chief financial officer 
of an investment group called the Marshal Plan, and the group's secretary, 
Edwin Feigin, must pay $4.38 million in damages to help pay back 200 investors 
defrauded by the company of $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the receiver, who was appointed by the state when the business was 
shut down, say that Silver and Feigin acted irresponsibly in managing the 
corporation, which brokered mortgages and bought and sold trust deeds, mostly 
to elderly investors.  
</P>
<P>
 The group was closed by the state in 1991 after complaints by investors that 
dividend checks were bouncing. When officials from the Department of Real 
Estate investigated, they found that company trust funds had been emptied and 
that investors had taken company files to track down their investments.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the corporation's president, Nell Marshall, who attorneys say used 
investors' money to pay for lavish parties and homes in Beverly Hills and 
Marina del Rey, was found guilty of five counts of grand theft and sentenced to 
seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never contended that he (Silver) had gotten rich or stolen money," said 
attorney Eric Edmunds, who originally sought damages of $13.5 million. "But he 
left the bank vault open and let a thief inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Eric Olson, who represented Silver and Feigin, called the verdict 
outrageous. "I can't imagine that the jury was seriously listening to what we 
were all talking about," he said. Olson also represented Silver's wife, who was 
cleared by the jury of any financial wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who has characterized Silver's role in the Marshal Plan as mostly 
ceremonial, said the award will probably be appealed. "I don't think there's 
any evidence that any of these people knew of this wrongdoing," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 For swindled investors, news of the judgment was bittersweet. "I don't know if 
that's enough," said one retired woman who declined to give her name but said 
she lost her life savings of $500,000. "I don't feel it's a stiff enough 
penalty."  
</P>
<P>
 Lance Douglas, 46, who lost more than $2 million, said the award is 
anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
 The receiver said he hopes most of the award can eventually be given to 
investors, although he does not know how much each would receive.

DINTENDO?; NOISE: CITING DANGER OF DAMAGE TO HEARING, ENTERTAINERS AND AUDITORY 
EXPERTS URGE THE VIDEO GAME MAKER TO DROP AN AD CAMPAIGN THAT URGES YOUNGSTERS 
TO 'PLAY IT LOUD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Nintendo television commercial opens with stern adults telling 
youngsters to behave and keep the noise down. Then it explodes into electric 
guitar-inspired defiance, bombarding viewers with cascades of music video and 
video game clips, urging children to "play it loud." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a group of grim-faced entertainers and hearing experts -- looking 
as though they could have stepped out of the ad -- said it wasn't funny. They 
urged Nintendo to pull the commercial, complaining that it and two other 
Nintendo "play it loud" ads will encourage youngsters to pump up the volume on 
their video games or music and lead to hearing loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nintendo makes a great deal of money off our children," hearing-impaired 
comedian Kathy Buckley said. "I cannot imagine why they would want to encourage 
our children to play it loud. . . . If children already have their hearing, by 
all means let them keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 A Nintendo spokeswoman responded that the activists were misinterpreting the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a literal thing," spokeswoman Perrin Kaplan said. Comparing the ads 
to Taco Bell's "make a run for the border" campaign, Kaplan said: "You don't 
see people suddenly running for the border" after seeing Taco Bell ads.  
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar national ad campaign, which began July 4 and is 
scheduled to run for the rest of the year, is aimed at 9- to 17-year-olds, 
Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Joseph Rizzo, executive director of the Better Hearing Institute, 
wrote to Nintendo asking it to withdraw the ads. Nintendo replied that the ads 
articulate a lifestyle rather than clamor for more noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo was not convinced, nor were other hearing activists who turned out 
Thursday to urge Nintendo to, in their words, "just turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ad campaign that's aimed at young children, teaching them to enjoy 
more volume," said Dr. John House, president of the House Ear Institute in Los 
Angeles. "It is important that we all take responsibility and do everything we 
can to discontinue their campaign and (pressure Nintendo to) convince children 
that their product is fun -- it doesn't have to be loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the commercials may encourage children to boost the volume on 
their television sets beyond 85 decibels, a level that can lead to hearing loss 
if maintained for long periods. "What Nintendo's doing is a slap in the face," 
said Kathy Peck, executive director of Hearing Education and Awareness for 
Rockers, a group that works with musicians such as Pete Townshend of the Who 
and members of the heavy metal band Metallica to guard against the effects of 
loud rock music. "It's just eliminating all the hard work we do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said that before the ads were released they were tested on many 
children by a professional research corporation, "and 86% of all the kids 
understood that it meant have fun, live life, play hard, and that it didn't 
mean anything about turning up the volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley, however, said she asked eight youths of varying ages in her North 
Hollywood neighborhood what they wanted to do after seeing the commercials. 
"Six of eight said let's turn it up and see what happens," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Steve Allen and actress Nanette Fabray joined the critics at a news 
conference Wednesday. A statement distributed by the group said that actors 
Leslie Nielsen and Richard Dysart also objected to the ads, and that Dysart has 
volunteered to lead a protest march on Nintendo headquarters in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who infuriated hard-core rock fans in the 1950s by mocking song lyrics 
and having Elvis Presley sing "Hound Dog" to a basset hound on Allen's national 
TV show, said "the world has gotten too loud recently, particularly the part of 
it that is man-made." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that what he and his fellow activists were urging goes against 
the grain of the rebellious lifestyle lauded in the Nintendo ads. His response: 
"In the 1960s some of the leaders said 'Don't listen to anyone over 30.' Well, 
they're now in their 60s and realize what a stupid thing they said."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; IMPROVEMENTS TO INTERSECTION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given final approval for major improvements to the 
intersection of Moulton and Alicia parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes that the council approved 3 to 1 at its last meeting will include 
double left-turn lanes and free right-turn lanes in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected $1.6 million in improvements, planned to begin by the end of the 
year, are expected to help traffic flow smoothly through the busy intersection. 
Cars currently back up during the morning and afternoon rush hours with 
commuters using it for access to the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor R. Craig Scott and Councilmen Joel T. Lautenschleger and L. Allan 
Songstad Jr. voted for the improvements, saying that waits will be shorter if 
cars don't have to stop when they make a right turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Randal J. Bressette voted against the improvements. Councilwoman 
Melody Carruth was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bressette said he was concerned about the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists 
who would have to cross the free right-turn lane. He said he felt a right-turn 
arrow might better ensure safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and two homeowners' associations next to the intersection are 
discussing the style of retaining walls to be installed after the intersection 
is widened. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homeowners in the Crestline and Lomas Laguna developments say they 
favor "green walls," which are covered by vegetation to prevent graffiti 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Engineer Ken Rosenfield said rock walls would be just as pleasing to 
the eye and would not be subject to the damage that could plague the green 
walls' sophisticated irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the improvement project comes from fees paid by housing developers 
along the Moulton corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Parkway is one of four Orange County streets that have been designated 
for "smart street" improvements, including synchronized traffic signals and 
dedicated turn lanes. Improvements also are planned for where Moulton 
intersects La Paz Road and Oso Parkway.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY TO REINFORCE NEWPORT BAY SLOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials plan to spend $111,000 later this year to repair crumbling 
slopes in Upper Newport Bay Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The slopes are next to Backbay Drive in Newport Beach and began eroding last 
year after heavy rainfall saturated the soil, said William L. Zaun, the 
county's director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials want to repair the slopes before a major landslide occurs, possibly 
closing Backbay Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is now seeking bids for the job, which will involve installing a 
drainage system in the hillside area. Workers will also compact some of the 
soil to make it stronger, Zaun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backbay Drive will be closed periodically during construction. Officials hope 
to have the job completed by the end of the year.

<P>
 A grant of more than $46,000 from the Magic Johnson Foundation is helping the 
Orange County Chapter of the American Red Cross expand its Youth HIV/AIDS 
Volunteer Educators (Y-HAVE) program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, which began in late 1992, high school students are trained 
in making presentations to their peers on HIV and AIDS awareness.The goal for 
the 1994-95 academic year is to train two student volunteers at each of 38 
Orange County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross Youth Director Penny Hughes said the program emphasizes preventing 
transmission of the disease and compassion for people who are infected with HIV 
or have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more persons in our circle of friends are going go be HIV-positive," 
Hughes said, "and it's really important that we have compassion for these 
people and not discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
 A kickoff rally for the expanded Y-HAVE program is scheduled for today at the 
American Red Cross Emergency Operations Center in Santa Ana. ALAN EYERLY

$700,000 FEDERAL GRANT TO AID IN EL TORO BASE REUSE PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly a year's delay, the Defense Department is sending Orange County 
officials more than $700,000 to chart the redevelopment of the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited federal grant is expected to pay for most of the conversion 
planning for the 4,700-acre base, which is due to close by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Wednesday that the grant confirms the Defense 
Department's "confidence" in local authorities to lead the base conversion 
process, long mired in political controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good news," Vasquez said. "This keeps our planning efforts intact. I 
think we are where we need to be right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are expected to be forwarded to the local El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority, the intergovernmental agency created to produce a conversion plan 
acceptable to the federal government, which owns the base. Vasquez is vice 
chairman of that planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although local officials said Wednesday that the award had been expected, 
funding was stalled for almost a year as the county Board of Supervisors and 
the cities surrounding the base battled for control over base conversion 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several months, however, municipal and county leaders have agreed 
to vest control of the planning process in the newly created intergovernmental 
authority, which includes members of the Board of Supervisors and the city 
councils from areas near the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have suggested that the grant may have been threatened because of 
the delays (in creating the local authority), but I didn't sense there was a 
reluctance or hesitation on the part of the federal government to provide the 
funding," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Carstens, the county's director of policy research and planning, said 
that the grant is critical to the base planning process and that news of the 
award "doesn't surprise us." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting that it would be approved all along," Carstens said. "In 
fact, we thought approval might be coming by this week. We're pleased to hear 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth H. Bruner, an aide to Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, 
said that Defense Department officials and members of the local base planning 
agency had been working together for some time to ensure that "funding would 
flow" for the base conversion process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy with the direction it was going all along," Bruner said. "We 
expected that the money was on its way." 
</P>
<P>
 The work of the local base planning agency is continuing, despite discussions 
of a possible land swap in which the federal government would give the Irvine 
Co. control of the base in exchange for environmentally sensitive acreage the 
company owns near the Cleveland National Forest.

WAY CLEARED FOR RETRIAL IN COIN SHOP KILLINGS; CRIME: APPEALS CURT REJECTS PLEA 
FOR A NEW PRELIMINARY HEARING IN THE 1989 NEWPORT BEACH CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though it scolded the prosecution for its conduct in the case, a state appeals 
court Wednesday cleared the way for the retrial of a former Tustin Marine 
improperly convicted of killing two people during the 1989 robbery of a Newport 
Beach coin shop. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 13-page ruling, the 4th District Court of Appeal rejected Thomas R. 
Merrill's argument that he deserved a new preliminary hearing because 
prosecutors illegally withheld from the defense critical evidence pointing to 
his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's two first-degree murder convictions were overturned on those grounds 
last year by Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson. But 
Aronson refused to grant Merrill a new preliminary hearing, a Municipal Court 
procedure to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to order a trial in 
Superior Court on felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice was not done here. The error was substantial and material," wrote 
Presiding Justice David G. Sills, noting that prosecutors failed to disclose 
important evidence during the case. Nevertheless, the appeals court ruled that 
Aronson had properly concluded there was enough justification to try Merrill 
based on circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Edward J. Wallin and Sheila Sonenshine concurred in the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Eric W. Snethen, who challenged Merrill's effort to win a 
new preliminary hearing, is on vacation and could not be reached for comment. 
Likewise, Merrill's attorneys were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill, who is serving two life sentences, and fellow Marine Eric J. Wick 
were convicted of murdering Clyde Oates and Renee King in March, 1989, at the 
Newport Beach Coin Exchange. King's husband, Bill, was seriously wounded in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's mother, Sara, said she found the decision "disgusting. I seem to 
remember the justices said (during oral arguments) that you could give Tom a 
new prelim and continue with the case. Keeping an innocent man in prison for 
six months is totally, totally outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's lawyers, William J. Genego and John D. Barnett, argued that because 
the prosecution withheld evidence Merrill was denied a chance to show during 
his first preliminary hearing that he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence in question involves a key eyewitness who says he told former 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson and his investigator Gerald Teplansky 
that Merrill was not one of the two men he had seen fleeing the coin shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, baker Finn Olsen, says he told prosecutors this shortly before 
Merrill's first preliminary hearing at which he was to testify. He said 
Robinson then told him to go home and that he would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Olsen, the prosecutor tried to coach him into saying that his 
inability to identify Merrill was due to an uncertain memory, failure to 
adequately observe the killers or even a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 When the effort to dissuade Olsen failed, the deputy district attorney and his 
investigator supposedly asked Olsen not to "volunteer" the information on the 
witness stand, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, now in private practice, has denied any wrongdoing. He contends that 
Olsen simply could not identify Merrill, which is far different from saying 
Merrill was not one of the men he had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aronson overturned Merrill's conviction, he did not resolve the 
disagreement, though he concluded -- without assessing specific blame -- that 
evidence had been withheld by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nonetheless, the facts alleged, if true, present an appalling picture of 
official malfeasance," Sills wrote. "Private parties have found themselves 
embroiled in litigation over spoilation of evidence based on much less than 
that alleged by Olsen." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices said the suppression of evidence resulted in "a great waste of time" 
because a new trial had to be ordered. However, they confined their scolding to 
Robinson and Teplansky, not wanting to imply that the case was representative 
of the way prosecutions are conducted by the Orange County district attorney's 
office.

VIETNAM VETS TELL THEIR STORIES TO COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At an emotional gathering full of sadness and pride, Vietnam veterans 
Wednesday night told their stories to a composer writing a symphony about the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Some made what amounted to political speeches decrying the politicians who had 
sent them to war. Several read poems or told stories about fallen comrades. And 
one played a tape reproducing the screams of a helicopter crew as their craft 
went down in the jungles of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 veterans and their families showed up at the Westin South Coast Plaza 
hotel to reminisce aloud about their wartime experiences at the invitation of 
composer Elliot Goldenthal of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenthal has been commissioned by the Pacific Symphony Orchestra, Orange 
County's major professional ensemble, to write a large-scale symphonic-choral 
work memorializing the Vietnam War. Scheduled to premiere at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in April, on the 20th anniversary of the war's end, the 
hourlong piece will feature two traditional American singers, a children's 
chorus made up of American and Vietnamese children, elements of traditional 
Vietnamese folk music both vocal and instrumental and, of course, the symphony 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The piece is being written to help put closure on an awful situation," said 
Louis G. Spisto, the symphony's vice president and executive director. "This is 
not a piece intended to have a political point of view. We only wish to honor 
the American veterans and Vietnamese whose lives were disrupted. There is still 
a huge amount of unresolved emotions about these experiences; the hope is that 
we can achieve the kind of healing in our art form, which is music, that the 
Vietnam Wall has helped achieve in art and architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing that, however, requires deep understanding on the part of the composer, 
who is not a Vietnam veteran. To help Goldenthal, Spisto said, the symphony 
organized a workshop Tuesday night featuring members of the orchestra working 
with a group of traditional Vietnamese musicians and singers. And on Wednesday, 
he said, Vietnam veterans from all walks of life were invited to share their 
letters, poems, songs and stories with the man who's already spent months 
penning a musical ode to their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give the folks who we're writing this piece for an opportunity 
to assist in its development," Spisto said. "We want them to assist us in 
getting closer to their actual feelings and experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of sharing seemed to be going on at Wednesday's gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a unique experience," Kurt Roberts, 49, said of the time he spent 
fighting in the war. "I've had some difficulties coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fred Norris, 45: "Vietnam has changed me, even to this day." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Luters, 46, told the composer, "Right now I'm still trying to deal with 
the past. The symphony might help me deal with the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenthal said of the project, "This is not an easy task. This is the type of 
direct communication I want to bring into the piece. I want stuff that comes 
directly from the gut." 
</P>

D.A. REVIEWS BEATING AS POSSIBLE HATE CRIME; COURTS: JUDGE'S COMMENT ABOUT 
'VICIOUS' ATTACK ON BLACK TEEN-AGER IN TRABUCO CANYON PROMPTS RECONSIDERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is reconsidering a possible hate 
crime prosecution for an attack on a black teen-ager that a judge called "one 
of the most vicious beatings I've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a decision was made last week not to prosecute the beating of 
15-year-old Ruben Charles Vaughan III of Tustin as a hate crime, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Bruce Patterson said Wednesday that the matter is being reviewed in the 
wake of Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles' statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly going to discuss it with the people in our special 
assignments (division) who deal with hate crime cases," said Patterson, who 
heads the district attorney's South County office. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack came on the night of Aug. 5 when 20 to 30 youths surrounded Vaughan 
in a Trabuco Canyon cul-de-sac, yelled "Get the nigger!" and beat him 
unconscious, breaking his nose and jaw and stabbing him seven times, an 
investigator has said. He was hospitalized for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles on Tuesday ordered two men, charged with assault with a deadly weapon and 
causing great bodily harm, to stand trial. Derek Thomas Jones, 20, of 
Huntington Beach and Russell T. Scarce, 19, of Lake Forest have pleaded not 
guilty and are being held in Orange County Jail. Bail for each is $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles, long a champion of victims' rights, said Tuesday during a preliminary 
hearing that the accused are lucky the charges were not stiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney could easily have filed this as attempted murder," Iles 
said. "There is sufficient evidence for that in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan's father, Melvin Aaron, praised Iles for making her bold statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess justice is somewhere on the horizon," said Aaron, a professor at Cal 
State Long Beach. Aaron has been advocating a stringent prosecution since the 
day after the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigator Richard A. Jacklin of the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
testified Tuesday that two groups of youths arrived at a home on Live Oak 
Canyon Road in Trabuco Canyon where an advertised "flyer party" was to be held 
that night, but there was no party. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a group of youths, most of them graduates of or students at El Toro 
High School, faced off with four youths from Santa Margarita High School, one 
of them being Vaughan. There is a history of animosity between the two groups, 
including another fight only a few days before the Aug. 5 incident, according 
to witnesses and Scarce's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 After Scarce began the melee by punching Vaughan's friend, Chris Collins, 
three of the Santa Margarita High youths -- including Collins -- ran to their 
car and drove off, leaving Vaughan alone to face the attackers, Jacklin 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Jones and Scarce have argued that Vaughan was caught in the 
middle of a turf war and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  
</P>
<P>
 "The race thing just isn't there," Michael B. McClellan, a deputy public 
defender and Jones' attorney, said Wednesday. "This was supposed to be a 
fistfight in revenge for another fistfight. This was no predetermined plan. 
There was no premeditated thing to isolate one particular guy because of his 
race."

2 PLAN APPEAL OF SONS' MURDER CONVICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mothers of two teen-age Latinos who were convicted last week of 
second-degree murder for a gang attack in which a San Clemente youth was killed 
said Wednesday that they will file an appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defended their sons during a meeting here of 75 members of Los Amigos, a 
Latino rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Amigos members voiced their support of Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, and Hector 
Penuelas, 17, San Clemente residents who were convicted in last year's slaying 
of 17-year-old Steve Woods, whose skull was pierced by a paint-roller rod 
during a confrontation on a San Clemente Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the salt of the earth, they are our brothers, and we can't separate 
ourselves from their plight," Amigos Chairman Amin David said of the youths, 
who may be sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. "If there is anything we 
can do, just let us know." 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers, who spoke after the meeting, proclaimed their sons' innocence and 
contended that court-appointed attorneys failed to adequately defend them. They 
said they were not sure when they would file the appeal, but by law they cannot 
file it until 60 days after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is innocent, this was all an accident and he was just in the wrong 
place at the wrong time," Maria Perez said of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything wrong," said Penuelas' mother, Elena Penuelas. "The 
defense attorneys just didn't know how to defend them. They had no defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The two remain in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolando Penuelas, 15, said he talks to his brother Hector as much as he can by 
telephone. He too says he is convinced of his brother's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother wasn't in a gang," he said. "And everybody thought he was, which 
is probably why they thought he was guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither defense attorney could be reached for comment on the case.

JOAN IRVINE SMITH SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith has settled her dispute with a Fallbrook art dealer she had 
accused of withholding more than $4 million in California Impressionist 
paintings he bought with her money, her lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Allen, lawyer for the 61-year-old granddaughter of the Irvine Co. 
founder, said the terms of her settlement with art dealer Michael Johnson are 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith filed the lawsuit a year ago in Orange County Superior Court, alleging 
breach of contract, among other complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had called Smith's charges "ludicrous" and countered that Smith owed 
him $750,000 in unpaid commissions for his help in obtaining $15 million in 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stemmed from a whirlwind buying spree, starting in the fall of 
1991, in which Smith astonished the art world by becoming the largest buyer of 
California Impressionist art in the nation. Some of the art has been displayed 
at the Irvine Museum, which she founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said Johnson was employed as Smith's agent from the fall of 1992 through 
the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Johnson reached an agreement Aug. 8 and on Aug. 15 the lawsuit was 
dismissed, Allen said. He said the lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial 
Sept. 12.

POP BEAT: GUITARS RULE; ONE-HIT WONDER STAYS IN POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Explaining this week's column of reviews of recent local alternative-rock 
releases is a bit like trying to lay out the machinations of a soap-opera plot 
line complicated by incest. Rob Rule and Rule 62 share half a name. Rule 62 and 
One Hit Wonder share one full drummer. Rob Rule is named after the guitar 
player it swiped from One Hit Wonder. Is that clear? Judging from the solid 
music-making involved, all this incestuousness has not weakened the gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under consideration are the Swamp Zombies, who went to Hamburg to record 
their new single but maintain the humorous, roughhouse charm that has been 
evident since they emerged from Irvine. A new Costa Mesta label, TRUK Records, 
serves up a two-volume compilation of local alterna-punks dubbed "By the Banks 
of the Mighty Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been perfect, if a bit unwieldy, if the two seven-inch vinyl EPs 
could have come encased in concrete slabs, just like the mighty Santa Ana 
itself. Ratings range from * (poor) to **** (excellent), with three stars 
denoting a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 One Hit Wonder "Long Beach vs. the World"(7-inch vinyl single) 
</P>
<P>
 Doctor Dream "Not in This Town" (7-inch vinyl single or cassette) 
</P>
<P>
 Lethal It's not inaccurate to categorize One Hit Wonder as a power-pop band, 
but saying that the Long Beach-Orange County foursome plays power pop is a bit 
like saying that the protagonists of "Natural Born Killers" play with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Root, the singer-guitarist, has sounded like a natural-born slasher since 
his late-'80s days as lead player for Tender Fury, honing his razor-strokes 
with a keen sense of catchy, economic riff construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In drummer Christopher Webb and Randy Bradbury, the most exciting bassist on 
the local grass-roots/alternative scene, One Hit Wonder has a rhythm section 
sufficiently massive and thrusting to call to mind a jumbo jet rushing toward 
liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
 As hard-charging as the sound is, One Hit Wonder strikes just the right 
balance between assaultive energy and pop savvy; all the songs on these first 
two releases are highly hummable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach vs. the World" (part of Doctor Dream's "Your Town vs. the World" 
series of vinyl 45s) was recorded in 1993 and captures the band as it 
originally was conceived: a partnership of two equal 
singer-songwriter-guitarists. 
</P>
<P>
 Root and then-sidekick Robbie Allen trade vocal lines on "Therapy Lounge," a 
suitably manic, rumbling evocation of the 1992 Los Angeles riots as seen on TV. 
The B-side, "Brazil," strikes a plaintive yet angry note as it sounds an 
environmental alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen left the band about a year ago to devote full time to Rob Rule, which 
had landed a major-label deal. Root gnashed his teeth for a while, then got on 
with the business of carrying the vocals load himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially a reluctant performer who looked to Allen for encouragement, Root 
has since emerged as one of the local scene's liveliest and most engaging stage 
performers. With Bradbury stepping up capably on backing vocals, the "Not in 
This Town" single finds One Hit Wonder carrying on with undiminished force and 
songwriting skill. 
</P>
<P>
 The title track continues the band's practice of writing songs that are 
socially aware, but not heavy-handed: Root sings sardonically about sudden 
disasters disrupting the lives of those who had thought themselves safe, with 
just a touch of anguished humanity tempering the insolence in his bark. The 
acoustic-folk coda is an imaginative touch, signaling a willingness to strive 
for the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-side offers "Green Grass (Means High Times for Us)," a ditty about a 
screwed-up family that is as strong as the A-side. One Hit Wonder also tosses 
in a raucous, speeded-up thrashing of Andy Prieboy's superbly bitter "Tomorrow 
Wendy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bands turn up almost every day trying to wed pop song-craft to punk-inspired 
zoom. Along with the estimable O.C. band Joyride, One Hit Wonder does it as 
well as any I've heard. 
</P>
<P>
 (Doctor Dream Records, 841 W. Collins Ave., Orange, CA 92667; Lethal Records, 
P.O. Box 14868, Long Beach, CA 90803-1414). 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Rob Rule "Rob Rule" 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury This debut album shows obvious promise, but its flaws are equally 
apparent. The playing is accomplished, but the production by Don Gehman (whose 
credits include albums by R.E.M. and John Mellencamp) is too polished. 
</P>
<P>
 The singing of newcomer Eddie Anisko is attractive, but he sounds too much 
like a callow youngster who lacks the seasoning to convey much emotional depth. 
The result is an album with surface appeal, but little resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles band takes its name from the stage moniker guitarist Robbie 
Allen used when he was the Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitar technician and would 
pull double duty as a solo opening act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob Rule" might have cut deeper if it let its namesake turn loose his rough, 
whiskey-soaked voice on a couple of songs. "Around Again," a world-weary 
ballad, and "Never," a moody portrait of romantic obsession that Allen used to 
sing in his One Hit Wonder days, need more grit than Anisko can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngster's apparent lack of experience is most plain on a cover of the 
Allman Brothers' "Melissa." Set against memories of Gregg Allman's hurtin' and 
dreamin' original rendition, Anisko's almost casual reading sounds as if he 
simply has not acquired the fund of experience to summon the haunted, dejected 
feelings embedded in the song. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoning may be all Anisko needs, though. His voice is clear, strong and 
instantly pleasing. And his frequent model is Paul Rodgers, possibly the best 
blues-rock singer ever (at least at his peak with Free). Aiming high is always 
a good sign in the young. 
</P>
<P>
 Instrumentally, Rob Rule has plenty of punch, with Mary's Danish alumni David 
King, the Hendrix-inspired lead guitarist, and drummer James Bradley Jr. 
(drums) anchoring the band. The songs are a tad sketchy lyrically, but convey a 
young man's progress through the school of hard-knocks experience, with 
occasional moments of transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the successful Big Head Todd & the Monsters, Rob Rule works from a wide 
palette, incorporating bluesy or country-tinged roots rock, '60s heavy-guitar 
sounds and spacious psychedelia, together with pleasing, folk-inflected 
balladry. But the band's path on its debut is too smooth and easy; next time it 
should take a rougher road. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Rule 62 "Love and Decline" 
</P>
<P>
 Lethal Near the top of the list in my own book of rules is the one that says 
never go to Chicago in the dead of winter. Rule 62 did just that earlier this 
year to record its debut album at the home studio of producer Steve Albini, of 
Nirvana and Pixies fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering what it got the band in sonic snap, the results hardly justify the 
cost in air fare, lodging and the suffering entailed in subjecting sun-warmed 
California blood to the bitter mercies of a January wind howling off Lake 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Weston produced, rather than Albini, and his philosophy seems to have been 
to get out of the way and let the band play live in the studio without 
embellishment. The result is a bare-sounding document of Rule 62's music. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitars get the best of it, as Frank Agnew's leads and Brian Coakley's 
rhythm work come across with good, scraping immediacy. But the singing of 
Coakley, an impassioned performer with a husky voice, doesn't jump from the 
speakers as vividly as it should. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Webb, a model of explosive bashing on the One Hit Wonder singles, 
sounds like just another drummer here. Libby Agnew (Frank's wife) plays bass 
but is pretty much lost in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Coakley's main gig is with the Cadillac Tramps; Rule 62 is a side band that 
allows him to step forward as a singer. He is solid in that role. There are 
fleeting echoes of the Smithereens' Pat DiNizio, and some Elvis Costello, too, 
on ballads where Coakley stretches and strains impressively to convey 
full-hearted feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyrically, there's plenty of decline in evidence and no fulfilling love to 
stop the slide. Unlike Cadillac Tramps, who balance brooding songs with others 
that carry a swaggering gallows humor, Rule 62 takes a straight-and-narrow walk 
on the dark side. Lyrics tend to be blunt and direct declarations from 
characters who are either on life's downward side, or clinging tenuously to a 
ledge. 
</P>
<P>
 As with his some of his writing for Cadillac Tramps, Coakley hints, in "Don't 
Ignore Me" and "Obsolete Machine," at the connections between socioeconomic 
decline and personal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 While everything rocks well, Rule 62 comes closest to truly ruling when 
Coakley burrows into an anguished, dramatic ballad like "I Believed" or the 
searing "Friends?!" 
</P>
<P>
 Also promising is the merger of Coakley's bluesy approach with Frank Agnew's 
pure-pop sensibility on two songs they wrote together, "Obsolete Machines" and 
"Broken Down." They sound like a good team in the making.

 Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "By the Banks of the Mighty Santa Ana, Vols. I & II" (7-inch vinyl EPs) 
</P>
<P>
 TRUK  
</P>
<P>
 TRUK, a new label affiliated with the Costa Mesa punk-alternative record shop, 
Noise Noise Noise, offers a good sampling of O.C.'s grass-roots rumblings on 
these four-song compilations. 
</P>
<P>
 Vol. I (** 1/2) gives us four bands that stay close to pure-punk roots while 
using the medium, in time-honored fashion, to grouse. Snide but snappy, 
Guttermouth ("What's Going Wrong") gripes because it can't get a gig. Sincere 
and Angst- ridden, the Iron-Ons ("Ed's Song") can't get the girl. 
Tongue-in-cheek heirs to the Dickies and Vandals, Supernova ("Bad Haircut") 
can't get a decent trim and plots vengeance against a hapless barber, at whom 
they're sufficiently steamed to deliver a well-wrought, mock-heraldic anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure what the Hiddys' gripe is in "Pabst Blue Ribbon," because their 
hard-and-fast assault is too rapid-fire, leaving most of the lyrics 
indecipherable. But two yelping, nasal voices and a dense, pummeling attack 
make it more than a routine hard-core rant. 
</P>
<P>
 Vol. II (***) takes a post-punk approach that's more crafted and restrained. 
The prize of this one is "Song No. 40" by Big Drill Car. Having plied a speedy, 
hard-riffing but sometimes predictable brand of melodic blitz-pop on five 
previous albums and EPs, the band shows an entirely new dimension here. 
</P>
<P>
 It slows the pace, adds an organ to thicken the sound, and splashes on noisy, 
country-hued Neil Young-ish guitar. Frank Daly's frayed singing achieves new 
levels of fullness and emotional depth on this boozy, rootsy elegy. A promising 
development from a veteran band. 
</P>
<P>
 Naked Soul's "Suckerfish" is that band's swan song; it recently broke up. It's 
a typical Naked Soul anthem with heft, hooks and relationship woes. It wouldn't 
have made the cut on the fine 1993 album, "Visiting Your Planet," but it's 
better than most of the originals on the group's 1992 "Seed" EP. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch's "Gentlefolk" is a punkish anthem that gets a bit too self-righteous as 
it condemns religious factions for being too self-righteous. It also goes on 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Misery of Your Company" is a fine, dyspeptic screed from the Women, an 
all-male band that, in this song, seems to be having little luck with women. 
The real attraction is the dense, roiling production, which combines 
Stooges-style heavy garage-rock with spacey, psychedelic touches. The Women 
come through with a good, meaty helping of over-the-top excess. 
</P>
<P>
 (TRUK Records, 1505-A Mesa Verde Drive East, Costa Mesa, CA 92626.) 
</P>
<P>
 *** Swamp Zombies "Hamburg vs. the World" (7-inch vinyl single) 
</P>
<P>
 Doctor Dream Another in the "Your Town vs. the World" series. Never ones to do 
the straightforward thing, the Swamp Zombies adopted Hamburg, Germany, as their 
town for series purposes and recorded there on tour last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 This is prime Swamp Zombies: a loose, brawny, clattering attack that is 
somewhat akin to the Violent Femmes but actually is very much their own, a 
wryly affectionate appropriation of roots-rock sources (on the rockabilly-based 
"Matador") and a humorously skewed appreciation for the weird side of life. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, "Matador" is an old-fashioned car song, but the guy lusting 
for the titular vehicle seems a tad unhinged. On the B-side, "Temecula," we 
step into the Swamp Zombies' own little acre of the Twilight Zone for a slice 
of on-the-road weirdness: "Was a corpse in the passing lane / Had been hit 20 
times / I made it 21 / No one could ever bring it back again." 
</P>
<P>
 Who says the Germans have no sense of humor?

 "The Mousetrap," by Agatha Christie, has been playing continuously in London 
since 1952 -- which makes it the longest running play ever. There must be a 
reason. And after all these years, it can't just be the secret of whodunit. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the chance the play gives actors, generation after generation, to 
re-create characters that are plummy and idiosyncratic. In any case, that's 
exactly what's happening under Darlene Hunter-Chaffee's direction at the 
Huntington Beach Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Without giving anything away to those who have not seen this play, the story 
centers on the opening of the Monkswell Manor Guest House in the English 
countryside. Mollie Ralston has inherited the property and plans to operate it 
with her husband, Giles. Their first roster of guests, during an immense 
snowstorm, is an odd lot: a flighty, fey young architect; a female 
ex-magistrate; a mannish British woman expatriate; a Col. Blimp ex-officer, and 
a mysterious Italian whose auto just happened to flip over just outside the 
manor. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a dashing police sergeant who has skied through the woods in an 
effort to solve a murder in London, where a clue indicated that the killer's 
next victim would be found at the manor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the scenes move a little slowly, Hunter-Chaffee has timed the 
culminating action expertly, particularly several silent scenes where tension 
mounts as the guests wait for something -- what? -- to happen. She also has 
captured the aura surrounding a lonely British manor house enveloped by storm. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the British accents don't always sound as natural as they might, 
they are accurate and effective, carefully not overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mollie and Giles, Lara Doucette and Darren Boyette manifest a nice sense of 
naivete and wonder that works well. Tracy London's expatriate is crisp and 
hard-edged as she should be, and the starchy quality of Ann Hodgkinson's 
retired magistrate is totally Christie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McElenny's Major Metcalf mumbles and grumbles admirably, and Gary Page's 
policeman sounds and acts like cops do everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a sometimes needed shot in the arm is provided by two actors who have 
played their roles before: Michael Leslie White as the architect (whose name is 
Christopher Wren, a delicious Christie red herring) and Michael Scott Davies as 
the Italian. White is opulently extroverted while keeping his lustful eyes on 
the policeman, and Davies sniffs about as suspiciously as a greedy ferret.

TIME WARNER, GE IN TALKS FOR NBC; ENTERTAINMENT: THE OWNER OF WARNER BROS. 
WOULD BUY NETWORK AND ITS CABLE INTERESTS FOR $2 BILLION TO $2.5 BILLION, 
SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Time Warner Inc., the New York-based entertainment conglomerate that owns 
Warner Bros., HBO and Time magazine, is in negotiations to buy the NBC 
Television Network for between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, industry sources 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock-swap deal would be the first major merger between a television 
network and a company owning a Hollywood studio and, if successful, could 
trigger another round of combinations among the giant media and entertainment 
companies. Government regulations that once barred such mergers have been 
eased, paving the way for talks between networks and studios. 
</P>
<P>
 According to people familiar with the talks, Time Warner would acquire NBC's 
television network, its cable channel CNBC and other cable interests. However, 
Time Warner is not negotiating to acquire the seven highly profitable TV 
stations owned by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would give Time Warner a network with more than 200 affiliates and an 
important outlet for its TV programs. Warner Bros. is the largest producer of 
TV programming in Hollywood, with hits such as "Murphy Brown" and "Full House." 
Sources said one of the factors propelling Time Warner is the entertainment 
giant's fear that recent deregulatory actions will lead to a smaller market for 
its programs. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's parent, General Electric Co., declined to comment and Time Warner could 
not be reached for comment. Sources close to the talks described them as "very 
serious" but cautioned that the negotiations could still fall apart. The past 
year has seen two big media deals collapse after they were announced: the 
merger between cable TV company Tele-Communications Inc. and regional phone 
company Bell Atlantic Corp., and the proposed merger between CBS Inc. and home 
shopping channel QVC Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC has been rumored to be for sale almost since the day GE acquired it in 
1986. GE bought NBC as part of its merger with RCA at a time when the network 
was achieving its prime-time ratings apex due to such mega-hits as "The Cosby 
Show" and "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the nearly 10 years since GE acquired NBC, the network has 
steadily lost its grasp on the ratings crown and is now ranked No. 3. Under GE 
management, NBC has trimmed hundreds of jobs and invested heavily in the cable 
TV industry. In the process, Robert C. Wright, the GE-appointed chief executive 
of NBC, has led the campaign to make the network more competitive and free it 
from decades-old regulatory restrictions in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would make Time Warner, already a powerhouse in cable TV, even 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The company already owns HBO -- which has been built into the largest pay 
cable TV network in the world under Chairman Michael Fuchs -- and its sister 
channel Cinemax; a minority stake in Turner Broadcasting System, and 50% of 
Comedy Central. In addition to owning CNBC and the new cable network America's 
Talking, NBC -- through its partnership with Cablevision Systems Corp. -- owns 
stakes in American Movie Classics, Bravo and 12 regional sports channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources said Time Warner and Cablevision Systems Corp. may try to 
negotiate a third-party deal whereby Cablevision would swap cable systems it 
owns in the New York area for NBC's stakes in the programming services. Such a 
deal would give Time Warner the dominant cable operator in the country's 
biggest market. 
</P>
<P>
 By not acquiring NBC's owned TV stations, Time Warner is ducking a potentially 
difficult regulatory hurdle that prevents broadcast companies from owning cable 
systems in the same markets where they operate TV stations.  
</P>
<P>
 GE may also want to hold on to the stations because, unlike a broadcast 
network, they are a reliable source of revenue. In the past, GE Chairman John 
Welch has said the network is not for sale, but last year he signaled his 
willingness to do something "strategic." 
</P>
<P>
 One question mark is what Time Warner plans to do with a fifth broadcast 
network it is launching in January in conjunction with TV station group Tribune 
Broadcasting. Under current government regulations, companies are allowed to 
own only one broadcast network. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, several interested buyers have approached GE about acquiring 
NBC, including cable entrepreneur Ted Turner, former Fox Inc. owner Marvin 
Davis, QVC Chief Barry Diller and even an investor group headed by NBC's top 
star, Bill Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
 But GE has balked because it has NBC valued on its books at more than $4 
billion and did not want to take an offer below book value. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros. boasts Hollywood's most stable management team in co-Chairmen 
Robert Daly and Terry Semel. The studio ranked second behind Disney in domestic 
box office share last week with hits such as "Natural Born Killers" and "The 
Client." Warner also had its share of box office disappointments this summer, 
including "Wyatt Earp."

THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; CONSOLIDATION WAS ALREADY IN THE EQUATION; RIVALS 
NOT ALTERING THEIR FLIGHT PLANS 
</P>

 Southern California's defense industry doesn't need to adopt a new game plan 
in response to the proposed merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., 
however daunting the combined behemoth might appear. 
</P>
<P>
 For many local defense giants, the situation already called for an aggressive 
search for takeover targets. 
</P>
<P>
 And that means the industry is expected to keep shrinking rapidly as the firms 
buy and sell assets to counter the long slide in Pentagon spending. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, some defense executives acknowledged that the sheer size of the 
$10-billion Lockheed-Martin deal -- which would create the nation's largest 
defense company by far -- will pressure smaller rivals to act more quickly than 
they had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've needed some kind of a dramatic change for a shakeout, and maybe this is 
it," said John M. Leonis, chief executive of Litton Industries Inc., a Beverly 
Hills-based builder of Navy ships and defense electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some of California's biggest defense players and their 
responses to the Lockheed-Martin merger: 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp.: The St. Louis-based aerospace giant, whose Douglas 
Aircraft unit is based in Long Beach, would be replaced as the Pentagon's 
largest vendor if the Lockheed-Martin merger goes through. 
</P>
<P>
 But McDonnell -- a big maker of fighter jets, rockets and other spacecraft 
that has been largely on the sidelines during the industry's consolidation -- 
says that prospect won't compel the firm to rush into a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel any particular pressure to get into the acquisition picture 
because of what happened," spokesman Tom Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason McDonnell may be reluctant to do a big merger: The company is 
involved in billion-dollar legal disputes with the U.S. government over the 
C-17 transport and the canceled A-12 bomber, and it is wary of spending big 
money for a merger that might not sit well with Uncle Sam, said Paul Nisbet, an 
analyst with JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp.: The Seal Beach-based producer of defense 
electronics, spacecraft and other military gear has also been largely absent 
from the industry's merger trend so far, and it gives no sign of feeling 
threatened by the Lockheed deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rockwell is always reviewing opportunities," spokesman William Blanning said, 
declining further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, with $10.8 billion in sales in its fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, 
has been busy moving away from defense and investing in such commercial lines 
as factory automation equipment and truck components. 
</P>
<P>
 Though itself the product of mergers, Rockwell is known to move slowly on deal 
making. With a strong financial performance lately, analysts say there's no 
reason to change that habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co.: This Los Angeles-based unit of General Motors Corp. has 
been active in the defense industry's merger binge, buying General Dynamics' 
missile line in 1992 for $484 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' strategy is to "invest or divest" to survive the decline in defense 
spending, both by acquiring defense properties and by expanding its commercial 
divisions, such as communications satellites.  
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Hughes is always considered a potential buyer -- particularly in 
the satellite market, which is widely thought to have too many players. 
Likewise, TRW Inc.'s Redondo Beach-based satellite group is often spoken of as 
a potential takeover candidate, though the firm has stalwartly denied plans to 
sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes spokesman Ray Silvius said Hughes will not accelerate any plans in 
response to the Lockheed merger -- "unless it caused an opportunity to present 
itself to us."  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman Corp.: The Los Angeles-based maker of the B-2 Stealth bomber 
has been among the most aggressive defense predators of late. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, it acquired Grumman Corp. for $2.2 billion, and on Wednesday it 
bought the 51% of aircraft parts maker Vought Aircraft Co. it didn't already 
own, for $130 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman said the Lockheed deal "doesn't have any impact on what we've 
charted as a course," which includes "keeping our options open" on even more 
takeovers, spokesman Jim Taft said. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton Industries Inc.: The company -- a mid-tier player with $3.5 billion in 
sales in its fiscal year ended July 31 -- is frequently mentioned as a 
potential takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton thinks otherwise, believing it must buy or die to remain in defense. It 
has been actively shopping, particularly for a defense unit of a diversified 
company, and that strategy has not changed, Leonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, those diversified firms have been reluctant to shed their defense 
lines, because they are generating handsome cash flows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockheed deal could change that, Leonis said, by showing such firms they 
"have no prayer of continuing to be a major player" in defense "and that maybe 
this is the time to get out."

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON MEXICO; DESPITE NAFTA, BARRIERS REMAIN FOR 
SMALL BUSINESSES; TRADE: COMPETITION IS TOUGH IN INDUSTRIES WHERE MONOPOLIES 
STILL EXIST, AS ONE U.S. ENTREPRENEUR FOUND OUT.

 Getting cut off is hardly a surprise for telephone callers in Mexico, but Brad 
Tirpak was shocked when it happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirpak runs an international long-distance service called Access Telecom that 
rents 800-number lines owned by Telefonos de Mexico, the national telephone 
monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 His customers used the lines to call the United States and place long-distance 
calls at a savings of up to 22% over Telmex rates. The company had just begun 
to turn a profit after months of investment and losses when, without warning or 
explanation, Telmex cut off Tirpak's eight lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear-cut example of a large company squishing a small company, 
with no reservations about doing it," Tirpak said. Telmex officials would not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirpak's case is an exceptionally blatant illustration of the barriers that 
small and medium-sized U.S. companies may face if they try to carve a niche for 
themselves in a Mexican market geared to big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Telmex had the right to cut off Tirpak because it has a legal monopoly on 
long-distance service until 1996. Other corporations in supposedly competitive 
markets are more subtle but just as ruthless, small-business owners complain. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mexico passed its first anti-monopoly law more than a century ago, its 
first trust-busting agency, the Federal Competition Commission, is barely a 
year old. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first annual report, the commission acknowledged that it is fighting to 
reverse a decades-long trend toward monopolies, fostered by regulations that 
created artificial barriers to the entry of new competitors and the lack of a 
vigorous competition policy. Government concessions -- exclusive, long-term 
contracts of the type Telmex received -- also played a role, according to the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican economy has inherited a substantial number of business activities 
where competition has been needlessly curbed," the report said. "This may have 
a negative effect on efficiency and equity for many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission took a vigorous approach to breaking up monopolies in its first 
year -- investigating price fixing among banks offering credit cards, forcing 
the government oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos to offer more gasoline station 
franchises, and even taking on Telmex indirectly by setting conditions for a 
merger between two copper wire companies -- one owned by Telmex shareholders -- 
that are major suppliers to the phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report notes that "conduct regulation is always an imperfect 
substitute for a market structure which forces firms to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the government itself has found the adjustment to an anti-monopoly 
mentality difficult. Only one of the commission's first 17 anti-monopoly suits 
was decided in favor of the company making the complaint. The rest were 
dismissed, several on the recommendation of state governments or federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, federal programs to support small companies are geared mainly to 
helping suppliers of major corporations, which provide orders that are used 
almost like collateral for small-business loans. Entrepreneurs who want to 
compete with, rather than supply, major companies face a struggle, as Tirpak 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the idea for Access when he was a graduate student doing field work in 
Mexico during the 1993 spring semester. He tried to call his U.S. bank's 800 
number and found it didn't work in Mexico. His original idea was to create a 
way for callers to reach U.S. 800 numbers from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 He incorporated the company on graduation day, excited to be in on the ground 
floor of the continental business cooperation promised by the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, which was then being negotiated. Tirpak signed a 
three-year contract with MCI to provide him with 800 lines out of Mexico. MCI, 
in turn, bought the service from Telmex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide lines to the United States for overseas companies," said Alan 
Garratt, a spokesman for MCI. "Most use them within the company. MCI does not 
inquire into the reasons for the service." 
</P>
<P>
 As Tirpak began marketing his service, he found that potential customers were 
interested in more than calling U.S. 800 numbers. They wanted to call all over 
the country, especially once he learned that he could contract with a variety 
of U.S. long-distance carriers and offer his callers the cheapest rate 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did not make money the first six months," Tirpak said. But by December, 
his call volume was high enough that he could renegotiate a better rate with 
MCI. He used the additional income to hire more salespeople, garnering a staff 
of seven by early July, when his volume of calls reached 9,600 a week for 400 
clients. At that rate, Tirpak had a $3-million-a-year business. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of July 19, Tirpak signed up a new client and made a test call. It 
was the last call Access Telecom would place. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he returned to his office, his lines were down. A few hours of 
checking revealed that the problem was not technical. Service had been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 "MCI is caught in the middle," said Garratt. "Telmex, under their rules, is 
allowed to discontinue this type of service up until 1996," when long-distance 
competition is to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirpak received the same explanation from Mexican Communications and 
Transportation Ministry officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his experience, he said, "it's hard for me to say that small and 
medium firms should invest in Mexico. Go to Tennessee and get some tax breaks 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
 He does not have much real hope of keeping his company in business, but he 
figures he'll try try to negotiate a deal with Telmex. "I put a year and a half 
into it," he said. "I might as well give it another two months."

THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; VIEW FROM THE TOP: WHAT DEAL MEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 How will the proposed mega-merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta affect 
employees, facilities, competitors, the defense industry and national policy? 
</P>
<P>
 The principals in the transaction, Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep and 
Martin Marietta Chairman Norman R. Augustine, discussed the deal, its impact 
and a wide range of issues facing the defense industry in an interview 
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is this merger going to affect your competition? 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine: I was out in the Midwest this morning, and the newspapers there 
were quoting people from two or three companies, Hughes, McDonnell Douglas. 
Those people were saying that they didn't think it would affect them very much. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised that that was the reaction. Frankly, I was a little 
disappointed, because I would hope they would have said this is something we've 
all got to do, and we need to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: I really believe that the boards of other aerospace companies have got 
to be putting the question to their management, what do we make of this, what 
should we do, if anything, in response. If nothing else, I think it's going to 
provoke some additional thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that Lockheed Martin would have so much technical and 
financial strength that you will be able to steamroll your competition? 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine: I think that's unlikely. It certainly helps us. We're going to be 
able to take out a lot of costs, and we're going to be able to remove 
duplicative research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't very many years ago that Martin Marietta was about a $5-billion 
company, and we competed against Boeing all the time -- they were a $20-billion 
company. We did all right. The reason was that they were in a lot of different 
businesses, and we were in fewer businesses. So you tend to match up your 
strengths against their strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people are worried that even if this consolidation doesn't run into 
antitrust problems, you might wield too much political clout. You will have at 
least 2,000 employees in states that would represent a voting majority in the 
House. Is that a concern? 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine: For years we've had between 8,000 and 15,000 employees in Colorado, 
and I don't ever remember getting a single vote on anything we believed in in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: Our calculus was based on the technical synergies of the corporation, 
complimentary businesses, and that was the focus that compelled us to go 
forward. If there are some collateral political benefits, which is 
questionable, then that was a tertiary factor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What percent of the Pentagon's acquisition and defense budget would your 
sales account for? 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: If you just take the R&D budget, we would represent about 17% of that. 
About half of that goes directly through us to other subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With defense sales dropping and non-defense rising as a percentage of your 
revenues, do you see overall sales of the new company growing or falling? 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: Modest sales growth. Single digit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With only modest sales growth and a need to improve efficiency, what will 
happen to employment? 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine: I think in the long term, reasonably we should grow. But the 
defense budget is still being cut, so the question of whether we'll add 
non-defense jobs fast enough to offset the decline in defense is a big 
challenge. None of us have been able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how much will employment drop in the short term? 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine: I really wouldn't have the faintest idea how to forecast it because 
I'd have to know what the defense budget was going to be, and I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: Had we done nothing, we probably would have individually had some 
decrement in employment. So the question is: Does this make it any worse or any 
better? Certainly near term, there is going to be some dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
 What this whole thing is about, it's not about today, tomorrow, or the next 
month. It's really about building a globally competitive, 21st Century 
aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have four satellite plants, one is principally commercial and three 
principally government. Do you need four separate satellite manufacturing 
plants for your business outlook? 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: We're going to very carefully study that in the months ahead. That's 
an answer that probably shouldn't come from people at our level. It has to be 
people who know what machines are where and what business is where and what 
test equipment is where and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you have the outright blessing of the Department of Defense for this 
combination? 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: No, we didn't. The Department of Defense Review Board will be engaged 
shortly to render a formal report. I think that can't be done more rapidly than 
in four weeks, and probably eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have reason to believe the verdict will be favorable? 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep: If logic prevails, I think the answer shouldn't be unfavorable.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; THE STRONGEST SIGNAL 
YET THAT DEFENSE STILL LIVES BY THE SWORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much for that projected bull market in high-tech plowshares. The proposed 
$10-billion merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta offers the sharpest 
signal yet that the nation's top defense contractors don't care to convert. 
They'll stick to their swords, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from converting to the false profits of commercialism, the industry has 
become an even more devout group of defense fundamentalists. Defense technology 
is about weaponry, war and national security -- not turning military microwaves 
into medicine or new materials into prefabricated housing. The guiding 
principle of today's defense marketplace is greater consolidation, not 
innovative conversion. The economic risk of beating their swords into salable 
plowshares has proven too speculative, too great. 
</P>
<P>
 Past "attempts at defense conversion are largely unblemished by success," 
Martin Marietta's chief, Norman Augustine, commented just last month. "I'm not 
the least bit optimistic about the future success of the defense industry 
moving far afield from the things it does best. Just as you wouldn't expect the 
world's foremost maker of toothpaste to be able to put a man on the moon, why 
should we expect companies that put spacecraft on the moon to be able to sell 
toothpaste?" 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the belief that the end of the Cold War would see America's 
enormous defense establishment make the wrenching transition from Pentagon 
dependence to competition in the civilian marketplace is demonstrably wrong. 
There's a wrenching transition, all right, but it has nothing to do with the 
pursuit of innovation. Defense conversion of any size, scale or scope simply 
isn't happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense contraction hasn't been leading to new products, new markets or new 
industries, but rather to ever-rising rates of unemployment. The genuine hope 
that defense conversion would be a powerful engine of economic development and 
growth has proven to be a disappointing delusion. Therefore, the nation needs 
to find new strategies for absorbing hundreds of thousands of former defense 
workers into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Lockheed agrees to merge with a Martin Marietta for $10 billion, the 
marketplace is being told in the strongest possible terms that dollars invested 
in the defense industry will yield higher returns than dollars invested in 
diversification. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so sure it's a bad thing for defense companies to focus on the things 
they can do well," says Dan Burton, executive director of the Council on 
Competitiveness, a Washington-based policy group that lobbies on industrial 
productivity issues. "They should compete where they have a comparative 
advantage and hold to their assets and resources rather than try to diversify 
into things that are a stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done some surveys about obstacles to defense conversion," reports the 
Pentagon's Ken Flamm, special assistant to the deputy secretary for dual use 
technology policy, "and the No. 1 obstacle is not capital and it's not skills 
-- it's knowing about the marketplace, it's knowing information. Of course, 
within that there's a cultural component as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The unfortunate reality, however, is that it now seems wildly unrealistic and 
optimistic to believe that defense contractor conversion will have a meaningful 
impact on soaking up those employees made redundant by the near 50% drop in 
defense procurement since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 High-tech defense spinoffs and tech transfer initiatives like the Technology 
Reinvestment Program, while noble, seem incapable of doing much to fill the 
employment gap. 
</P>
<P>
 What's worse is that the honest assessments of the Labor Department and other 
agencies have overwhelmingly concluded that traditional retraining programs to 
help place skilled defense workers just don't work. In essence, the 
institutional and market mechanisms we hoped would ease the pain of economic 
transformation are failing us. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual -- not institutional -- responses to defense conversion dislocation 
need to be explored. Perhaps it's too early to call for a "DC Bill" in the 
aftermath of the Cold War in the same way there was a GI Bill after World War 
II. But there should be little question that government needs policies that 
facilitate the economic transition. Clearly, the defense conversion that 
matters will not happen company by company, but individual by individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "One idea which has been seriously discussed has been to pay out unemployment 
benefits as a lump sum rather than just on a monthly basis," says the 
Pentagon's Flamm. "That should give people more flexibility in how to invest 
their resources. . . . That's currently being explored within the 
Administration, and I think that idea has some merit." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, rather than set up massive retraining infrastructures, the 
Administration might propose making tuition and fees deductible for defense 
workers who choose to go to an accredited institution for education or 
training. To make it easier to pursue new job opportunities in other parts of 
the country, certain defense workers could be entitled to, say, a $2,000 
deductible on their moving expenses. Again, the choices are left up to 
individuals, not institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential issue here is not that defense contractors should be compelled 
to invest in commercial products or that the government is obligated to find 
jobs for everyone thrown out of work as the military-industrial complex 
continues to shrink. Rather, it's that it is simply good public policy to make 
it easier for individuals to take the initiative if their institutions can't or 
won't.

 Argentina Announces Sweeping Privatization Plan: The government, tightening 
its public finances to shore up what it calls its "economic miracle," said it 
will sell off all major concerns still in the hands of the state within 16 
months. By the end of 1995, all airports, the national post office, the mint 
and the nation's biggest petrochemicals plant will be sold off to private 
ownership, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo told the annual meeting of the 
country's top bankers.

 Blockbuster Shareholders Revive Suit Against Viacom Merger: The plaintiffs' 
lawyers will ask a Delaware judge to schedule a hearing next month, according 
to attorneys.The individual shareholders, who filed six lawsuits shortly after 
the transaction was announced in January, are seeking a preliminary injunction 
to derail the merger. The case had been dormant since April because the 
stock-swap merger had been given up for dead when Viacom's stock price fell. 
Viacom's stock has rebounded since June 1, prompting Blockbuster's board last 
week to back away from its threats to scuttle the merger agreement. The 
shareholders maintain that the acquisition price is too low.

 Litton Reports $59-Million Loss: The defense contractor said the loss amounted 
to $1.29 a share for its fourth quarter ended July 31.It cited previously 
announced charges for settlement of a federal whistle-blower lawsuit and debt 
retirement. The company earned $45.6 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same 
period a year ago. In July, Litton Industries Inc. announced it had agreed to 
pay $82 million to settle a lawsuit filed by a former employee who accused the 
company of cheating the Pentagon through questionable bookkeeping.

 Ralphs Posts Earnings Decline: Los Angeles-based Ralphs Grocery Co. reported 
net earnings of $7.2 million for its second quarter, compared to income of 
$12.9 million for the period a year ago.Sales for the quarter, a 12-week period 
ended July 17, fell fractionally to $625 million. The company said the weak 
California economy and price cutting by its competitors contributed to the 
sales decline. Ralphs also confirmed that it is in merger talks with Yucaipa 
Cos., owners of Alpha Beta and other chains, and said the companies have agreed 
on "substantial aspects of the transaction."

ORION TO BE FOLDED INTO GLOBAL MEDIA CONCERN; ENTERTAINMENT: BILLIONAIRE JOHN 
KLUGE'S EXPANDED METROMEDIA INTERNATIONAL WOULD BE FORMED VIA A FOUR-WAY STOCK 
SWAP WORTH $1 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Billionaire John Kluge is folding his ailing Orion Pictures and two other 
media companies into Atlanta-based holding company Actava Group to create a 
global media, entertainment and telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company, Metromedia International, is being put together via a 
complicated four-way stock swap worth about $1 billion and positions Kluge to 
again be a major force in media and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Being combined are Orion, Actava, TV and movie company MCEG Sterling and 
Kluge's existing Metromedia International, which until now has been a radio, 
cable and cellular company in Eastern Europe and Russia. Kluge controls Orion 
and Metromedia but has had no stake in MCEG, which has an interest in 
television's "Homicide" and "McKenna" and produced such films as the "Look 
Who's Talking" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Kluge will head the company as chairman and control it. He is relying on 
longtime associate and Actava Chief Executive John Phillips to implement the 
plan as president. In addition, Kluge aide Stuart Subotnick will serve as vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-profile company in the group is Orion, once known as one of 
Hollywood's top independents. Founded in 1978, Orion peaked in the early 1990s 
with two Academy Award-winning hit films, "Dances With Wolves" and "Silence of 
the Lambs." 
</P>
<P>
 But it also was a shambles financially, and its problems led Kluge to put the 
studio into bankruptcy proceedings in late 1991. He ended up putting some $200 
million into the company before it emerged less than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Orion's annual revenue reached $468 million in 1989. In its last fiscal year 
ended Feb. 28, the company's revenue was only $175.5 million. Orion is expected 
to get funds that could jump-start its movie-making operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kluge told reporters that he wants to make Orion a "top-tier" studio. 
Hollywood executives said they would welcome a healthy Orion, since it would 
create yet another buyer for films and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics said Kluge appears to be repackaging of some of his assets, and they 
noted that Orion, now run by veteran video and appliance executive Len White, 
has been promising to get back into the production business. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the link with MCEG -- led by respected entertainment executive 
John Hyde -- gives credibility to the operation and that Actava has about $250 
million in cash, some of which Orion could put to use bolstering its 
operations. Hyde and other MCEG executives are expected to have major roles at 
Orion. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kluge, 79, the transaction means he again heads a large media company. 
</P>
<P>
 Actava rose 37.5 cents to $13.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange; Orion 
surged $2.56 to $6.125 on Nasdaq.

CHRYSLER IS ACCUSED OF RESELLING 'LEMONS'; AUTOS: DMV SAYS VEHICLES WERE PASSED 
OFF TO UNWITTING CONSUMERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE 
FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A California state agency has accused Chrysler Corp. of reselling "lemons" to 
unsuspecting buyers without telling them it had repurchased the cars from 
previous owners because of defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles said the allegations involve 118 Dodges, 
Jeeps, Chryslers and Plymouths sold to consumers through dealerships in 
Northern California. The model years are 1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chrysler spokeswoman on Wednesday denied the allegations, saying the auto 
maker is in full compliance with California law and disputes with the DMV's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have evidence that we have made full disclosure and we have a 
meeting set up with the DMV to go over the material," spokeswoman Rita McKay 
said. She declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty, Chrysler faces possible revocation or suspension of its 
license to sell cars in California, though a fine is considered more likely. 
General Motors Corp. paid $330,000 in April to settle similar charges, while 
denying any intent to defraud or mislead consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV said its investigation shows that Chrysler delivered most of the 
repurchased vehicles to a Northern California auction house, which then 
allegedly resold them to auto dealers. The dealers then allegedly sold the cars 
to consumers. The dealers and the auction house have not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 A new car is considered a lemon in California if its defects are not fixed 
within four attempts or after 30 days in the shop during the first year of 
ownership. Car owners can sue manufacturers to force them to repurchase a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group, estimates that 
about 50,000 lemons are repurchased nationally each year. While it isn't known 
how many of them are then resold, consumer groups have called for closer 
monitoring of the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Voters, a Sacramento consumer organization, argues that cars with 
serious mechanical defects should be sold for scrap only. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the defects involved in the Chrysler case couldn't be learned 
Wednesday. Consumer advocates said that in general, auto makers repurchase cars 
only if problems are serious and beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the ones they buy back are the worst ones -- the ones they can't 
repair. But if the manufacturer can't fix it, how can anyone else fix it?" 
asked Rosemary Shahan, president of Motor Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV made the allegations against Chrysler on Aug. 17 in an administrative 
filing. It did not become public until Wednesday, when Motor Voters obtained a 
copy.  
</P>
<P>
 The charges will be heard by an administrative law judge, who will recommend a 
decision to Department of Motor Vehicles Director Frank S. Zolin, who may 
accept or reject it or render his own decision.

CHIP MANUFACTURER IS DENIED PATENT BY JAPANESE COURT; COMPUTERS: RULING THAT 
FUJITSU CHIPS DON'T INFRINGE ON TEXAS INSTRUMENTS' PATENT MAY IGNITE TRADE 
CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a decision that could reignite concern over Japan's willingness to protect 
American inventions, a Japanese court ruled Wednesday that computer chips made 
by Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. don't infringe on Texas Instruments' basic 
semiconductor patent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo District Court said Fujitsu's most advanced memory chips are made 
with a different method than the one described in TI's pioneering patent, and 
thus rejected TI's request for an injunction blocking Fujitsu from 
manufacturing the chips. 
</P>
<P>
 TI said it was disappointed with the ruling and would immediately appeal it to 
the Tokyo High Court. "The net effect of this decision is that our invention of 
the integrated circuit was never accorded patent protection in Japan," said 
Richard J. Agnich, general counsel at Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision highlights American complaints that Japanese courts interpret 
patents too narrowly, allowing firms to essentially copy American inventions if 
they make minor, incremental changes to the invention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious problem, one of the most serious we have with Japan," 
said a senior U.S. trade official. He said U.S. companies are more likely to 
hold important patents than Japanese companies and are more likely to be hurt 
by courts' narrow interpretation of such patents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent (bilateral) agreements we made are procedural and easy to 
implement," the trade official said. "It's much more difficult when you are 
dealing with the courts and subtle issues of interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo ruling will weaken TI's bargaining position when it negotiates 
licensing deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars with more than a dozen 
Japanese semiconductor companies in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>

 Jack Kilby, a TI engineer, helped launch the modern electronics industry in 
1958 when he came up with the idea of shrinking down complex electronic 
circuits and placing them on a single, flat semiconductor wafer. TI filed a 
patent application for the invention in the U.S. in 1959 and in Japan in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese patent office granted TI a patent on one aspect of the Kilby 
invention in 1977 -- just two years before it expired and too late for TI to 
obtain any benefit from the patent. The patent office granted another patent in 
1989 that was good until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 That patent helped TI negotiate big increases in royalty payments from 
Japanese chip makers in 1990. The negotiations were part of TI's strategy of 
milking patents for royalties -- one that netted the company about $1 billion 
but infuriated rival U.S. and Japanese chip firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujitsu, alone among the major chip makers, refused to cut a deal with TI and 
the two firms went to court in 1991.

INDICATORS SHOW ECONOMY'S PACE HAS MODERATED 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government said Wednesday that its chief economic barometer held steady in 
July and factory orders dropped more than they have in 2 1/2 years, fresh 
evidence that the economy is expanding only moderately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, aimed at 
predicting growth six months ahead, stalled in July after two months of modest 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that while the performance was slightly stronger than expected, 
it is still a signal that rising interest rates are slowing economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much what everyone predicted," said Kermit Baker of Cahners 
Economics, a Newton, Mass., forecasting service. 
</P>
<P>
 The index was unchanged in July after rising 0.2% in June and 0.1% in May. 
Three straight moves by the index in the same direction are considered a good 
gauge of where the economy is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department also reported that orders to U.S. factories fell 2.3% 
in July. Demand for cars plummeted as auto makers shut down plants for two 
weeks to retool and for vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in factory orders was the first in five months and the biggest since 
the indicator of manufacturing plans plunged 3.6% in December, 1991. Even 
excluding the volatile transportation component, they slipped 0.2%. Orders had 
increased 0.8% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Another report released Wednesday could add to the Fed's worries that 
inflation is on the rise. The Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago said its 
prices-paid index rose to 79.3% in August from 71.9% in July. The group's index 
of area business activity fell to 61.6% in August from 63.0% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets and analysts are now awaiting Friday's unemployment report 
for August. Leading Indicators

 * The market fell Wednesday for the fifth straight session, as profit takers 
were encouraged by higher interest rates and by new concerns about violence in 
the southern state of Chiapas. The Bolsa index lost 30.11 points to 2,702.73. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traders said the selloff started after the Bank of Mexico reported a 
half-point rise in 28-day treasury bill yields, to 14%. Sellers were further 
encouraged after Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos in Chiapas called 
for the resignation of Gov.-elect Eduardo Robledo Rincon, who is a member of 
the ruling party. Investors fear the rebels will resume terrorist activities 
against the government. SPOTLIGHT: TANZANIA 
</P>
<P>
 Tanzania, the birthplace of African socialism in the 1960s under former 
President Julius Nyerere, instituted sweeping economic reforms in the mid-1980s 
to help it overcome financial ruin. The country is still mired in poverty, but 
the government is pressing policies aimed at competing in the international 
market.

 Cereal Maker Tinkers With the 'Classics': Minneapolis-based General Mills 
Inc., second only to Kellogg Co. in the ready-to-eat cereals market, has new 
recipes for its top-selling Cheerios and "Breakfast of Champions" Wheaties. The 
strategy is seen as a response to competition at the breakfast table from 
no-name and me-too cereal brands. "New better-tasting, crispier Cheerios and an 
improved Wheaties with a milder whole-grain flavor began arriving on grocers' 
shelves in late summer," General Mills said in its 1994 annual report.

 GM to Expand 'Value Pricing' in California: General Motors Corp., aiming to 
wrest market share from Asian competitors, said it will extend its "value 
pricing" strategy in California to 70 models from 46. Selling equipped cars and 
trucks at preset prices without rebates has been paying off for the largest 
U.S. auto maker, GM marketing officials said. The company began the pricing 
strategy in California about a year ago, and some of its car divisions have 
been expanding the program nationwide.

 Key Mortgage Rate Climbs Again: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th district cost of funds, the rate to which many adjustable-rate 
mortgages are tied, rose to 3.860% in July from 3.804% in June. It was the 
fourth straight monthly increase in the rate after it steadily declined during 
the previous 3 1/2 years. The rate measures the average cost of funds to the 
thrifts and financial institutions in the bank's 11th District, which covers 
California, Arizona and Nevada.

 AT&T Withdraws From Video Game Market: AT&T Corp.'s consumer products unit, in 
an abrupt reversal, said it was canceling plans to manufacture a modem that 
would have allowed users in different locations to play video games with each 
other over phone lines. The device would have been used in conjunction with the 
Sega Genesis and 3DO game machines. In a statement, the AT&T unit said it was 
refocusing its efforts on digital wireless telephones for homes and small 
businesses and globalization of its telephone products, because those areas 
have better profit potential than video game players and peripheral products.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SLIPS AS SKEPTICS QUESTION STOCKS' RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late-summer stock market rally stalled Wednesday as losses in auto and 
technology issues pushed major indexes modestly lower in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average eased 3.88 points to 3,913.42, surrendering a 
small portion of the stunning 166-point gain logged over the previous six 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising stocks still outnumbered losers by 12 to 9 on the New York Stock 
Exchange and by 15 to 12 on the Nasdaq market, a sign of the revived demand for 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But that breadth failed to impress most Wall Street pros. Many argue that the 
market's advance in recent weeks wasn't as powerful as the Dow's gains made it 
seem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skepticism about the rally is very widespread," said Hugh Johnson, market 
strategist at brokerage First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearish Wall Streeters also said the market's inability to mount a strong 
advance in the face of Wednesday's high trading volume -- 355 million shares on 
the NYSE -- was a bad sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, two major financial firms recommended Wednesday that investors reduce 
their exposure to stocks. Salomon Bros. cut its recommended stock weighting to 
45% in a "balanced" portfolio, from 50%, saying stocks aren't likely to move 
much higher from here. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Securities recommended that investors trim their stock investments to 
50% in a balanced portfolio, from 55%, though the firm said the change doesn't 
indicate a shift to long-term bearishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got little direction from the bond market Wednesday. Yields closed 
marginally lower, paying scant attention to mixed economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said its index of leading economic indicators was flat in July, 
another sign of a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago, in a survey of regional 
manufacturers, said its prices-paid index for materials rose sharply in August, 
a potential warning sign of future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield closed at 7.45%, down slightly from 7.46% on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bond market players appear to be holding back on buy or sell decisions 
until Friday, when the government will report August employment -- the first 
major look at economic activity last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, continued to strengthen, which may help stocks and 
bonds in the long run, analysts say. The dollar closed at 1.5815 German marks 
in New York, up from 1.5769 on Tuesday. It also closed at 100.15 Japanese yen, 
up from 99.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Some currency traders, however, worry that Germany's Bundesbank could surprise 
the markets by raising short-term interest rates today. Europe's economy is 
recovering, and that has prompted increases in short-term rates in France, 
Sweden and Italy recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks tumbled in heavy trading after the Wall Street Journal reported 
that some Chrysler executives have been selling their personal shares. The 
market often regards insider selling as a sign that management is bearish on 
the company's near-term prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler sank 1 1/2 to 48, GM dropped 1 3/4 to 50 1/4 and Ford lost 1 3/8 to 
29 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks led tech shares lower. Texas Instruments slumped 4 5/8 
to 77 7/8 after a Japanese court ruled that Fujitsu had not infringed TI's 
Kilby semiconductor patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Other semiconductor stocks falling included Intel, down 1 1/4 to 65 3/4; 
Micron Technology, off 3 1/4 to 40 1/4; Cirrus Logic, down 3/4 to 27 5/8, and 
Advanced Micro Devices, down 1/2 to 29. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, Philip Morris surged 2 1/2 to 61 after the tobacco company 
increased its regular quarterly dividend to 82.5 cents a share from 69 cents 
and announced a $6-billion share buyback plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense stocks continued to rise in the wake of Tuesday's merger deal 
between Lockheed and Martin Marietta. Lockheed jumped 2 to 78 3/4, Marietta 
gained 2 1/8 to 50 7/8, Northrop Grumman added 1 to 45, E-Systems rose 7/8 to 
43 and Logicon was up 1 to 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index inched up 1.7 points to 3,251.3, and 
Frankfurt's DAX index added 2 points to 2,212.85. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index 
gained 36.41 points to 20,628.53. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index tumbled 30.11 points to 2,702.73. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong was a bright spot: The Hang Seng index soared 242.83 points to 
9,929.39, the first close above 9,900 since March 14.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT ON MEXICO; STEER CLEAR 
OF BUSES, EAT A FILLING BREAKFAST AND DON'T FORGET TO TIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the North American Free Trade Agreement now in place, more U.S. companies 
will be sending employees to do business in Mexico. Here are some general tips 
for getting around. 
</P>
<P>
 For business trips, the most likely destinations are Mexico City, Guadalajara 
and Monterrey. However, NAFTA is expected to bring new business to some of the 
smaller cities as well, including Villahermosa and Merida in the southeastern 
section of the country. Entry Requirements 
</P>
<P>
 Though you don't need a passport or visa if your stay is less than 180 days, 
you do need proof of citizenship and photo identification to enter the country. 
Upon entering, business travelers must also complete a business pass form 
authorizing them to conduct business, good for 30 days. The pass is free. For 
more information, contact the Mexican Embassy in Washington at (202) 728-1600. 
Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 Most business travelers to Mexico advise using cabs to get around. "The roads 
don't make much sense down there," said Chuck Hamilton, senior manager in the 
parts division of American Honda in Troy, Ohio, who travels to Guadalajara 
about 20 times a year on business. "They aren't like anything you've ever 
seen."  
</P>
<P>
 Trains and buses aren't the best choice, either. "For business travel, this is 
not the way to do it," said Jay Rifkin, head of corporate travel for FHP Inc. 
in Fountain Valley. Trains tend to be slow and unreliable, Rifkin said, and 
buses, which vary from the antique variety to the brand-new, can be confusing 
for people unfamiliar with the routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabs, however, are pretty easy to find, said Susan Devine, director of Mexico 
marketing for Hyatt Regency. And tips are not expected. Check to see if the cab 
has a meter. If it does, law says the meter must be used. If it doesn't, ask 
whether a fee has been set for your destination. Also make sure the driver 
knows where you want to go. Some won't, and many don't read maps. If in doubt, 
wait for another driver. Ask the concierge what to expect to pay for cab rides. 
</P>
<P>
 If you must drive, the U.S. Embassy advises, don't travel on Mexican highways 
after dark, especially in isolated areas, because of the risk of robbery. 
According to the U.S. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs in 
Washington, these criminals may represent themselves as Mexican police or local 
officials.  
</P>
<P>
 You can drive in Mexico with a U.S. driver's license, but Mexican insurance is 
required. If you drive to Mexico City, note that cars are restricted to control 
air pollution. The days you can drive are determined by the numbers on your 
license plate. If your plate ends in 5 or 6, you can't drive on Monday. If it 
ends in 7 or 8, you can't drive on Tuesday. A plate ending with 3 or 4 means 
the car is restricted on Wednesday; 1 or 2, on Thursday, and 9 or 0, on Friday. 
Saturday and Sunday are free days. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. airlines serve at least one or two cities in Mexico, and Mexicana 
and Aeromexico have extensive routes. If you're flying between cities in 
Mexico, Mexicana and Aeromexico, as well as regional airlines such as Taesa, 
Saro and Aerolitoral, have regular flights. Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the expected increase in business travel, some of the major 
business hotel chains, including Hyatt Regency, Holiday Inn and Fiesta 
Americana, are renovating properties or building new ones. Hyatt, for example, 
has completely redone its hotel in Guadalajara. The renovation includes a new 
tower of business-class rooms, private concierge and full business services. 
</P>
<P>
 All the major business hotels have translation and fax services. Some have 
separate business centers where travelers can find translators, photocopiers, 
fax machines, computers and printers. Hyatt, for example, has found that its 
business centers at its foreign properties get more traffic than those in the 
United States, Devine said. "I think the U.S. traveler uses it (the business 
center) more when traveling internationally."  
</P>
<P>
 Some major business hotels recommended by business travelers in Mexico City 
include the Nikko (Campos Eliseos 204 CP11560; telephone: (52-5) 203-4800); the 
Marquis Reforma (Paseo de la Reforma s/n CP06500; (52-5) 211-3600), and the 
Camino Real (Mariano Escobedo 700; (52-5) 203-2121). 
</P>
<P>
 In Guadalajara, business travelers can stay at the Camino Real (Ave. Vallarta 
5005; telephone: (52-3) 647-8000), the Fiesta Americana (Aurelio Aceres 225; 
(52-3) 625-3434); the Crowne Plaza Holiday Inn (Lopez Mateos 2500; (52-3) 
631-5566), or the Hyatt Regency (Lopez Mateos Sur and Moctezuma; (52-3) 
622-6688).  
</P>
<P>
 In Monterrey, business travelers tend to stay at the Camino Real (Hidalgo 310 
Ote at Carranza; telephone: (52-83) 406-390); the Fiesta Americana (Jose 
Vasconce 300 Ote; (52-83) 633-030), or the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaze 
(Constitucion 300 Ote; (52-83) 196-000). Money 
</P>
<P>
 Tipping is customary in hotels and most restaurants and the guidelines are 
similar to those in the United States. Also expect to tip anyone -- from 
customs officials to traffic police to reservations clerks -- who might help 
you get faster service. Don't expect them to break the rules for you, however, 
unless you actually bribe them. Bribing is fairly common, though it is frowned 
upon in major corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 You can exchange money at banks between 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. or at casas de 
cambio (exchange offices) at airports. Hotels will also change money, but you 
will get a better rate at the bank or exchange office. 
</P>
<P>
 Carry a minimum of N$100 (new pesos) in small bills of mixed denominations to 
cover tipping and miscellaneous expenses. If traveling to remote areas, be 
aware that large bills may be difficult to change. Credit cards, including 
MasterCard, Visa and American Express, are widely accepted. Diner's Club cards 
are occasionally accepted. Traveler's checks are also usually accepted, but it 
is best to ask first. Safety 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller cities are relatively safe for walking around, Devine said. 
However, you should always check with the concierge of your hotel about areas 
to avoid, and avoid carrying valuables with you. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Bureau of Consular Affairs, street crime is common in urban 
areas, so be cautious. Travelers should check with the U.S. State Department 
for the latest security information before embarking. (For recorded travel 
information, call (202) 647-5225.) Business Meetings 
</P>
<P>
 Business hours are from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. Lunch is eaten 
between 2 and 4 p.m., which takes some getting used to for Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans should be aware that many businesses shut down during lunch. 
However, it is acceptable to do business over meals, and Mexican business 
contacts generally appreciate being taken to lunch. Caveat 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to drink only bottled water. Don't use ice cubes, and avoid raw fruit 
or vegetables unless you've peeled them yourself.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON MEXICO; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE ... 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico is eager to expand international investment in its country but is still 
building a suitable infrastructure, including technological improvements. 
Business practices are heavily influenced by the country's Latin culture. DO 
</P>
<P>
 * Start making appointments for your time in Mexico several weeks in advance 
and request confirmations by fax the week before arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of the distances between appointment sites and allow enough time 
for transit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat a good breakfast. Lunch can be as late as 4 p.m. and is never served 
before 2 p.m., except in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be ready to schedule meetings as late as 9 or 10 p.m. The business day is 
long in most parts of Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 * Find a driver who knows the city you are visiting. Time saved in not getting 
lost or looking for parking is well worth the price. Besides, rental cars can 
easily cost as much as hiring a taxi for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared to offer financing. Interest rates are still high and capital 
scarce. The ability to provide financing can make or break a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen carefully. Because direct refusals are generally considered rude, 
people may be raising objections or even saying no in subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire your own Mexican lawyer to review any agreement to make sure it 
complies with the law, reflects standard business practices and is enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be flexible. Traffic, a call from a superior or any number of other problems 
can interrupt carefully planned schedules. Always have an alternative 
available. DON'T 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect instant results. The first few trips or appointments may be 
getting-acquainted sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't rely on public telephones, which are scarce and almost never work. 
Make calls from your hotel before leaving in the morning. Most first-class 
hotels offer cellular phone rentals.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't assume that everyone is comfortable speaking English. Many Mexican 
executives and government officials are fluent in English, but it is best to 
arrange for an interpreter if they are not.  
</P>
<P>
 * Never be condescending. Mexicans who are still in business have guided their 
companies through an extremely difficult decade. They are astute and capable 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't try to circumvent the law. Mexican rules on foreign investment have 
been liberalized considerably, but the restrictions that remain are taken 
seriously. Illegal deals leave the participants vulnerable in the case of a 
bureaucratic reshuffling or a partner's change of heart. JUANITA DARLING

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON MEXICO; THE MEXICAN ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its most open presidential election in 65 years just completed, Mexicans 
are again focusing on economic development and attempting to build on the 
economic achievements of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The 
North American Free Trade Agreement thus far has mainly increased U.S. exports 
to Mexico, but the country still needs further industrial development, in part, 
to slow migration to the United States. Maquiladoras 
</P>
<P>
 In cities along the U.S.-Mexico border and elsewhere, foreign manufacturers 
have built plants that produce parts or assemble goods for shipment back to the 
foreign company under special trade rules. About half a million Mexicans are 
employed in such plants, which attracted 70% of the foreign investment in the 
nation in the last 10 years. Tourism 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's lovely coastlines help a large tourism industry attract more than 7 
million visitors a year, mainly from the United States. About $3.4 billion was 
earned in tourism during 1990. Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mexico has developed dramatically in recent decades, it remains 
strongly agrarian. According to the 1990 census, 22% of the labor force was 
employed producing food, a sector that makes up about 8% of GNP. Industry 
</P>
<P>
 The industrial heart of the country is Mexico City, which accounts for about 
half the national manufacturing activity and 45% of that sector's employment. 
Guadalajara and Monterrey are also major centers. Oil 
</P>
<P>
 The country is the world's fourth largest oil exporter of crude oil, with 
proven reserves of more than 45 billion barrels, primarily in the southeast and 
in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1992, oil production averaged 2.67 million barrels a 
day, about half exported.

MPS PHOTOGRAPHIC SUES CARD FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MPS Photographic Services Inc. in Fountain Valley has filed a lawsuit against 
Upper Deck Inc. and onetime California Angel third baseman Doug DeCinces, a 
former president of the sports card company. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, filed Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that DeCinces 
and Upper Deck committed fraud and breached a July, 1993, service contract with 
MPS Photographic. 
</P>
<P>
 MPS says it was contracted to supply services including printing, 
color-processing design and photography. The lawsuit also alleges that the 
contract was made at a time when DeCinces was negotiating to sell his stake in 
the company, and further accuses him of never intending to fulfill his part of 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo studio said that it provided $75,000 worth of services to Upper 
Deck, for which it was never reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did their part and they expect to be paid," said Steven H. Hertz, a 
partner in the Anaheim law firm of Moen & Hertz, which is representing MPS. 
Hertz said MPS is seeking payment from Upper Deck and "if that happens, we 
don't need to go any further." 
</P>
<P>
 DeCinces and representatives of Upper Deck could not be reached late Wednesday 
for comment.

TOSHIBA CREATES SUBSIDIARY TO BUY DEALERSHIPS; ELECTRONICS: ACQUISITIONS BY 
TOPAC USA INC. WILL GUARANTEE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIRM'S COPIERS AND FAX 
MACHINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Toshiba America Information Systems Inc. said Wednesday that it has started a 
new unit to buy copier and facsimile machine dealerships across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of Topac USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toshiba, comes as 
large numbers of independently owned copier and fax dealers are being bought up 
by large regional retail distributors such as Danka Business Systems in Florida 
and Alco Standard Corp. in Pennsylvania, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, manufacturers like Toshiba are concerned about major distributors 
shutting them out of the channels by favoring only certain brands. Owning 
dealerships directly is one solution for them, said Pete Davidson, a market 
researcher and newsletter publisher based in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Topac subsidiary has acquired an independent Atlanta dealer, Omni 
Business Products Inc. Omni has been the largest Toshiba dealer in the Atlanta 
area for more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first of several acquisitions that we intend to make to 
strengthen our distribution of office automation equipment," Atsutoshi Nishida, 
Toshiba America's president, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The division will be headed by Dennis Eversole, who will continue to hold his 
current position as senior vice president of Toshiba America. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson characterized Irvine-based Toshiba America as a "second-tier" maker 
of fax and copy machines, trailing such brands as Panasonic, Sharp and Canon in 
market share. Because of that, he said, Toshiba must take extra steps to ensure 
that retailers are carrying its equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reaching a point where they cannot count on independent dealers" because 
of the consolidation in the industry, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba America, a subsidiary of Japanese technology giant Toshiba Corp., has 
annual sales of about $2 billion. Toshiba's New Venture 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure that its copiers and fax machines are available in retail stores, 
Toshiba America Information Systems has established a subsidiary that will buy 
office equipment dealerships. The new unit at a glance:

 Name: Topac USA Inc.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; WESTERN NATIONAL GROUP IN ORANGE IS ONE STEP CLOSER TO 
FORMING REIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Western National Group, the largest apartment developer and manager in Orange 
County, has cleared the first big hurdle on its way to forming a real estate 
investment trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it recently received approval from the state Department of 
Corporations to apply for consolidation of the assets and liabilities of its 65 
existing partnerships, clearing the way for Securities and Exchange Commission 
approval of the REIT financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Orange, privately held Western National has more than $1 billion in 
assets and 27,000 apartment units under management. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has said it hopes to offer investors a stake in a REIT worth an 
estimated $167 million, according to an SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
 REITs, which offer developers a way to raise capital, have been popular on 
Wall Street recently.  
</P>
<P>
 The appeal for investors is that REITs can pass on most of their income to 
shareholders without being taxed, though the higher returns also mean greater 
risk.  
</P>
<P>
 In its SEC filing earlier this year, Western National said it expects to sell 
as many as 8.3 million shares at about $20 each.  
</P>
<P>
 Its underwriters would be New York investment bank Morgan Stanley & Co. and 
brokerage Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.

 Apartment Sales: Sales of Orange County apartment buildings during the first 
six months of this year remained strong, according to a report filed by CB 
Commercial Real Estate Group Inc. An estimated 39 apartment buildings of more 
than 20 units changed hands during the first half, compared to 24 buildings 
sold during the same period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 1,700 apartment buildings of more than 20 units in Orange County, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost for each unit was down $1,000 from the previous year, a sign 
of stabilization given the $8,000 falloff in prices that occurred between 1992 
and 1993, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely seeing a comeback to this market and a real run to quality 
projects," said Ray Eldridge, apartment broker at CB Commercial in Laguna 
Hills.

 Housing Permits: Through July this year, Orange County developers took out 
8,466 new-housing permits, compared to 3,809 permits for the first seven months 
of 1993, according to the Construction Industry Research Board, a trade group 
in Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of the permits -- 3,997 of them -- were pulled in June by 
developers rushing to avoid a fee increase that went into effect in July, the 
board said.

BIEHL KILLING CONFESSIONS READ IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His hands soaked with blood, one of the South African youths accused of 
murdering Newport Beach student Amy Biehl knelt over his young victim to stab 
her and later boasted of killing a white person, according to testimony in a 
Cape Town court. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about Biehl's brutal slaying emerged Wednesday when two of the murder 
defendants' statements to police were admitted into evidence and read aloud in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements, although challenged by defense attorneys for Mzikhona (Easy) 
Nofemela and Usumzi Ntamo, are crucial pieces of evidence in the continuing 
trial of Nofemela, Ntamo and a third youth, Mongezi Manqina. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth suspect, a 15-year-old who was not arrested until months after the 
three now on trial, will be tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the statements admitted by Judge Gerald Friedman, Ntamo told 
authorities that Manqina wielded the knife, which he had borrowed from a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mongezi got a knife and he stabbed the white woman," Ntamo told authorities 
in the statement. "He was on his knees over the woman when he stabbed her. . . 
. He said he was proud to have killed a white woman." 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old student activist and Fulbright scholar, Biehl was concluding a 
10-month research fellowship at the mainly black University of the Western Cape 
when she was murdered. She had also been helping to develop voter registration 
programs for the national elections that would put an end to apartheid and 
install Nelson Mandela as South Africa's first black president. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 25, 1993, the day she was stoned and stabbed to death, she was driving 
some of her fellow students home to the black township of Guguletu when her car 
was stopped by a band of youths looking for whites to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Ntamo told how he and the group of black youths went to 
Guguletu after a meeting of the militant Pan Africanist Student Organization 
and came upon the car carrying Biehl and her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to Bonteheuwel (an area of Guguletu) to destroy the boere stuff 
(whites)," Ntamo stated. "We met a car, and there was a white woman and two 
black women in it. We (tried to) stop it and when it would not stop we threw 
stones at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl was fatally injured when she was pulled from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the white woman was on the ground I threw bricks at her," Ntamo stated. 
"I (hit) her about three times on the head." 
</P>
<P>
 When the police arrived, the youths ran away, Ntamo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mongezi still had the knife and his hands were full of blood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially arrested seven youths in connection with Biehl's death, but 
three were released on the first day of the trial last November because a state 
witness refused to testify out of fear for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Nofemela admitted to throwing stones at Biehl's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Friedman's ruling on the confessions ended months of deliberation over 
whether the statements had been coerced from the suspects during beatings by 
the police. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the defendants have since denied any role in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling brought a measure of relief Wednesday to Biehl's mother, 
Linda Biehl, who worried that exclusion of the statements would have left 
prosecutors with little evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 State Advocate Nollie Niehaus, who is handling the case, had said that 
exclusion of the statements would "virtually ruin us," since several people who 
allegedly witnessed the attack have refused to talk to police or recanted their 
statements out of fear for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least now, I think there will be some accountability," said Linda Biehl, 
who recently returned from Cape Town where she was monitoring the court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see this resolved. I wish that these guys could be remorseful." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the confessions contained graphic accounts of her daughter's death, 
Biehl said Wednesday that she was anxious to review them. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks ago, Biehl said she was provided a copy of her daughter's autopsy 
report in which authorities found that Amy Biehl had suffered a fatal blow to 
the head and a stab wound through the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, we believed that she might have survived had she been cared for 
more quickly," Biehl said. "But we were told that her injuries were too 
serious. At least that was some relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's murder was condemned at the time by Mandela, who was elected to the 
presidency in April, nearly eight months after the widely publicized killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was scheduled to continue Thursday, but may be postponed due to a 
strike by court interpreters who translate the proceedings into Xhosa, English 
and Afrikaans, three of the nation's official languages. 
</P>

'ONE STRIKE' RAPE BILL PASSED BY STATE SENATE; CAPITOL: O.C. LEGISLATOR'S TOUGH 
SENTENCING MEASURE NOW GOES TO GOVERNOR, WHO HAS SAID HE WILL SIGN IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Legislature on Wednesday gave final passage to one of the most hotly 
debated crime bills of the year, sending to Gov. Pete Wilson an Orange County 
lawmaker's measure to require up to life in prison for first-time, violent 
rapists and child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The rape bill, sponsored by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), won final 
approval in the Senate on a 39-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing toward a scheduled midnight adjournment of the two-year legislative 
session, lawmakers also passed a comprehensive overhaul of the state's campaign 
finance laws that would limit contributions and spending and allow partial 
taxpayer financing of legislative campaigns. But the governor is expected to 
veto the measure because of his objections to public financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to establish a new, full-time commission to regulate gambling in 
California died after intense back-room negotiations as the session was drawing 
to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Also rejected when lawmakers went home for the year were measures to place 
bonds on the November ballot to pay for construction of school classrooms, 
prisons and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County lawmakers saw several measures score victories, and a few others 
fall to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill from Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to make possession of 
child pornography a felony was dashed after Republicans, who had supported the 
bill earlier this year, balked because of fears it might undermine the state's 
three-strikes law. But another Umberg bill to toughen reporting procedures for 
sex offenders was sent to the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) won approval for a bill that directs 
schools to punish pupils for hate crimes, but a measure that would have 
toughened vagrancy laws to keep gang members from stalking school campuses 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 A measure by Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) that gives the Balboa 
Bay Club a lease extension that will pave the way for a much-anticipated 
renovation project was approved, as was a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) designed to help Laguna Beach High School, which has 
been hurt by declining revenues since last year's devastating fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Laguna Niguel city officials came up short in their effort to push 
a bill that would allowed them to recapture $450,000 in revenue they lost 
during last year's state budget battle. The city faced stiff opposition from 
the county of Orange, which would have lost the revenue, and Bergeson, who is 
unopposed for a Board of Supervisors seat. Bergeson played the key role in 
getting the bill killed, pulling it into her Local Government Committee and 
then refusing to conduct a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 On other matters: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Senate protested Wilson's environmental policies by adjourning without 
confirming Jacqueline Schafer, the governor's choice to lead the state Air 
Resources Board. Schafer now must leave office in November, one year after 
Wilson appointed her to head the regulatory board. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said the members had no 
particular problem with Schafer, a former assistant secretary of the Navy, but 
wanted to send a message to Wilson that they are unhappy with what they 
perceive as his tilt in favor of the oil industry in air quality matters. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bill that critics say would cut corners on the cleanup of selected toxic 
dump sites in the state won bipartisan approval in the Senate and Assembly and 
now goes to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, by Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), is an attempt to speed 
the cleanup and settlement of financial responsibility for up to 30 hazardous 
waste sites covered by the state Superfund program. It sets up an arbitration 
procedure for deciding how clean a site should be, depending on its use, and 
for allocating costs among those responsible for the contamination. Calderon 
said the new approach is needed to unclog a system that has barely begun the 
job of cleaning up thousands of contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure, which came to life in the final weeks of the session, has 
alarmed environmental groups, who fear that it will allow incomplete cleanups 
and leave taxpayers liable for costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) contended that the 
bill would allow some sites to be covered over and developed without being 
completely cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly approved the measure 48 to 26; the Senate 21 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Senate, reversing itself, sent the governor a bill that would make it 
illegal for employers to deny women the option of wearing pantsuits or slacks 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), who previously had opposed the bill on grounds 
that it trivialized advancements made by women, cast the decisive 21st vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said Wilson has not yet taken a position on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Senate, on a 21-11 vote, sent to Wilson a bill to overhaul a 
controversial new school performance test, formerly known as the California 
Learning Assessment System. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would give parents a larger role in the development of the test and 
bar certain questions that would elicit comments from students on their 
personal beliefs about family life, sex, morality or religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is expected to veto the measure because it does not provide for 
individual assessments for each student in every school. His veto would kill 
the testing program, which only a year ago was being hailed as a model for the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's rape bill, is expected to be signed by Wilson, who since 1990 has 
campaigned for longer rape sentences and made this measure one of his top 
legislative priorities this year. But the governor would have preferred to 
sentence all rapists to life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bergeson first introduced the measure in the tougher form desired by 
Wilson, it drew broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups, 
including some district attorneys and women's organizations, who said the 
measure was so harsh it might hinder prosecutions or prompt sex offenders to 
kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was redrafted to delete all references to life without parole, 
substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for only the most brutal sexual 
assaults -- those involving torture, mayhem, kidnaping or burglary with the 
intent to commit rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser sex crimes could earn sentences of 15 years to life, but would have to 
include special circumstances such as the use of a firearm or dangerous weapon, 
more than one victim or the administering of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the maximum term for a single rape is eight years in prison, and the 
average convicted rapist spends fewer than five years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very strong bill," Bergeson said. "It's the product of a strong 
effort by the Legislature. Sex crimes simply cannot be tolerated. This bill 
responds in a very strong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, the governor's spokesman, said: "This is the toughest piece of 
crime legislation targeting rapists and child molesters to ever hit the desk of 
a governor. We would prefer an even stronger bill and will strive in the future 
for a stronger one, but are pleased with this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the one-strike bill, Bergeson pushed through a bill that increases 
fines and jail time for domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Umberg anti-pornography bill prompted one of the final day's more heated 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers said they opposed that bill because Democratic chieftains 
inserted an amendment exempting it from the three-strikes law. Democrat leaders 
have been inserting such amendments into a number of crime bills this year 
because they believe only violent felonies should be eligible for a third 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, however, said that such moves threatened to open the flood gates 
to exemptions that would undermine the three-strikes law. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said he wished the three-strikes amendment hadn't been added to his 
bill, but argued that Republicans should support it to put tougher pornography 
penalties in place. 
</P>
<P>
 His arguments drew the wrath of a fellow Orange County lawmaker, Assemblyman 
Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton), who hounded Umberg repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't play your damn cheap political games with us," Johnson roared at 
Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're absolutely right," Umberg barked back. "We shouldn't play political 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly passed and sent to Wilson's desk on a 42-32 vote a bill imposing 
limits on campaign contributions and spending and providing limited public 
funding for legislative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, by Senate President Lockyer, would limit contributions in 
legislative races to $2,000 from individuals and corporations and $5,000 from 
political action committees. The limits would apply separately to the primaries 
and general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending also would be capped, at about $800,000 in state Senate races and 
$560,000 in Assembly races, adjusted each year according to the number of 
voters in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending limits would apply only to candidates who accepted the partial 
public financing that the bill would create. 
</P>
<P>
 The public financing would match private contributions raised by the 
candidates on a ratio ranging from 5-1 to 2-1, depending on the size of the 
private donation. Candidates whose opponents exceeded the spending limit would 
get extra public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly passed the bill on a straight party line vote, with Democrats for 
it and Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), a member of the conference 
committee that fashioned the bill, called the legislation a "good start toward 
campaign finance reform." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The people don't care what the fine points are of campaign finance 
reform. They simply want us to put a system in place that caps the effect of 
special interest money on elections. And their view of the world is that the 
Legislature spends all of its time in the member's lounge playing Yahtzee with 
the people's money rather than doing the public's business. We need to restore 
public faith in the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross Johnson, who is also a member of the conference committee, urged a no 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely need campaign finance reform," Johnson said, "but this bill 
doesn't do it. What you are doing is creating an open-ended entitlement to 
funding politicians' campaigns. It is an unfair system designed to help 
Democrats and hurt Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the future regulation of the state's gambling industry went 
down to the wire Wednesday night after a measure backed by Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren to establish a five-member statewide gambling control commission was 
bottled up in the Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters sought to revive the proposal but said they could not overcome 
opposition from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-San Francisco), who pushed the gaming 
proposal, cited a combination of reasons, including Wilson's desire to control 
all five "patronage appointments" to the commission and Brown's reluctance to 
support "strict regulation of gambling."

IRA CALLS TRUCE IN FIGHT TO END BRITISH RULE IN N. IRELAND; EUROPE: MOVE COULD 
LEAD TO SETTLEMENT OF 25-YEAR CONFLICT, BUT GUERRILLAS' STATEMENT DOES NOT 
SPECIFY IF HALT TO VIOLENCE IS PERMANENT. LONDON OFFICIALS ARE CAUTIOUS.

 In a major development that could signal an end to one of the world's oldest 
conflicts, the Irish Republican Army announced Wednesday a "complete cessation" 
of violence in its struggle to end British control over Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to enhance the democratic peace process and underline our definitive 
commitment to its success, the leadership of (the IRA has) decided that as of 
midnight Wednesday, Aug. 31, there will be a complete cessation of military 
operations," declared a statement issued by the IRA in Dublin, the Irish 
capital. "All our units have been instructed accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 The brief statement, issued just before lunchtime here, ended days of mounting 
speculation that a major breakthrough in the conflict was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was immediately hailed by the Irish government and leaders of the Roman 
Catholic community in Northern Ireland as the end of the 25-year-long guerrilla 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a deep sense of history in this house today and, indeed, throughout 
the country," Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds told a special session of 
the Irish Parliament after the statement was issued. "It is a day that many had 
begun to fear they might never see." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who has quietly nudged the warring parties toward a peace 
formula since February, also hailed Wednesday's developments as "a watershed 
announcement" and said the cease-fire could "mark the beginning of a new era 
that holds the promise of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 But the omission of specific wording in the IRA statement that the cease-fire 
would be permanent triggered immediate concern among senior British government 
officials here, who said more was needed before the peace process could move 
forward as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an accord worked out in December, if the IRA agreed first to give up 
violence, the British and Irish governments agreed to give Sinn Fein, the IRA 
political wing, a voice in round-table negotiations that would search for a 
lasting settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In virtually all their references to the agreement, British officials have 
stressed the need for an IRA pledge for a permanent end to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also unclear if militant Protestants would carry out their threats to 
step up their own campaign of violence in the wake of the IRA announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this concern and the British reservations, the IRA announcement is the 
single biggest step so far toward ending a conflict that has claimed more than 
3,000 lives and left another 30,000 wounded in a quarter-century of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, just hours before the IRA declaration, the dispute claimed its most 
recent victim, as the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force kidnaped a 37-year-old 
Catholic, shot him in the head and dumped his body on a roadside. 
</P>
<P>
 The current clashes are merely the latest chapter in a centuries-old saga of 
violence that has pitted the Roman Catholic Irish nationalist minority against 
a mainly Protestant majority who see British rule as the lone guarantor of 
their identity. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hostility dates to the early 17th Century, when the first Protestant 
settlers arrived in Ulster from Scotland, the current struggle has its roots in 
the IRA's rejection of the 1920s agreement that gave Ireland independence but 
left the six northern counties, collectively the province of Ulster, in British 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The present chapter of violence began in Londonderry in August, 1969, when 
Catholics and Protestants rioted. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing that has ensued is only the visible aspect of a pervasive fear and 
misery in which an entire generation has matured: After hearing of Wednesday's 
cease-fire announcement, one Belfast resident said she dreamed of being able to 
leave her front door open again in the summer as she did in the years before 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were isolated celebrations in Northern Ireland, the prevailing 
mood among its 1.5 million residents was one of nervous optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of suspicion," said John Derby, a political scientist at the 
University of Colraine, in a mainly Protestant town. "I think it will be hard 
for the Unionists (Protestants) to sit down with people who've been killing 
them for the last 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, British Prime Minister John Major was seeking assurances 
about the IRA statement from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams that could lead to 
just such a meeting at the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he were to say tonight, 'This statement is unambiguous,' that the violence 
has ended for good, then within three months we could start talking with Sinn 
Fein on how to go forward with the peace process," Major told the British 
Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew, when asked if the IRA statement met 
British demands, answered, "No, I don't think it's clear." But he added that "a 
very few informal words" of assurances would be enough to start the process. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television interview late Wednesday, Adams said he would attempt to get 
the clarifications. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the cease-fire, Adams also called for a demilitarization of 
Northern Ireland -- a withdrawal of the 18,000 British soldiers stationed there 
-- and a return of the IRA prisoners to Northern Ireland from jails in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the absence of any reference to a permanent cease-fire in Wednesday's 
announcement fueled existing anger and suspicion among hard-line Protestants in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 With the kind of hate-fueled logic that has so often prevented progress toward 
peace among the warring factions in the past, Protestant militants are 
convinced that anything suggested or offered by the IRA, must, almost by 
definition, be bad for them. They believe the British and Irish governments 
must have made secret concessions to get the IRA to agree to a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 And celebrations Wednesday by Roman Catholic residents in the Ulster capital 
of Belfast, who drove through their neighborhoods cheering and waving the Irish 
flag, only reinforced Protestant convictions that the IRA cease-fire is part of 
a deal against their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Paisley -- the leader of the smaller, more radical of the two 
Protestant-based political parties in Northern Ireland and a member of the 
British Parliament -- denounced the wording of the IRA statement as "a clever 
Jesuit expression." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way for the IRA to prove this cease-fire is permanent is by giving 
up their killing machine and turning in their Semtex (explosives) stores, their 
guns, their mortars and their equipment," he thundered. 
</P>
<P>
 James Molyneaux, head of the more moderate of the Ulster Protestant-based 
parties, was less emotional, but stated: "It's a cessation of hostilities, 
that's all it is. It's not convincing." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's cease-fire announcement follows a series of low-profile meetings 
between Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, and 
leaders of all potential participants in a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also reportedly personally approved limited visas for Joseph Cahill of 
the IRA and Patrick Treanor of Sinn Fein, who traveled to the United States on 
Tuesday to explain the cease-fire arrangement to American groups active in 
backing the guerrillas financially. 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of possible U.S. economic aid to Northern Ireland, a senior 
White House official said Wednesday, "We're open-minded but we haven't 
committed anything on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials also said they believe that their behind-the-scenes 
meetings and letters helped push the IRA toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior official noted that Clinton talked to Major 15 times on the subject 
in August alone. He said there have been meetings and telephone conversations 
since Feb. 2.

DETECTIVES' LAPD FILES NOT RELEVANT, ITO RULES; SIMPSON CASE: JUDGE DEALS 
SETBACK TO DEFENSE STRATEGY. SELECTION OF JURY IS PUSHED BACK A WEEK TO SEPT. 
26. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's defense team will not be allowed to review the personnel 
records of four Los Angeles police detectives involved in the murder 
investigation of the former football great, the judge in the case ruled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of an elaborate hearing into evidence sharing and media 
objections to a proposed gag order, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito announced 
that he had examined some records of two of the officers that have been sought 
by Simpson's attorneys. The other two detectives' records did not warrant 
review by the court, Ito found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not find any . . . information that was pertinent to the issues in this 
case," Ito said. "And thus there is nothing at this point to turn over to the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Ito's ruling, Simpson's defense will not receive records of any of 
the four detectives -- Philip L. Vannatter, Tom Lange, Mark J. Fuhrman and 
Ronald Phillips. Defense attorneys have waged a particularly spirited attack on 
Fuhrman, suggesting that he is a racist who might have planted a glove to 
implicate Simpson in the June 12 killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors said in a surprise announcement that it could be weeks before 
they reach a decision on whether to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors and defense attorneys clashed bitterly over sharing evidence, 
with one Simpson attorney muttering an epithet that was overheard by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito pushed back the scheduled start of jury selection by a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lawyers for news organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union urged 
Ito to abandon his proposal for a sweeping gag order. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ito deferred a decision on whether to open a mystery envelope, saying he 
first needed to see the prosecution's witness list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's action on the police records was the day's most significant development, 
and it represents a serious setback to the Simpson attorneys' planned attack on 
the integrity of the officers -- a tactic revealed in a number of defense 
motions and argued in court on several occasions. Now that Ito has found that 
the personnel records do not support their argument that the officers either 
were racist or had shown a propensity to lie, Simpson's lawyers have little on 
which to base their challenges and could be forced to shift their strategy away 
from an assault on the investigating officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fuhrman's case, Simpson's lawyers have submitted a sworn declaration from a 
woman who alleges that the detective made racially charged comments to her in 
1985 or 1986. Fuhrman denies having had that conversation, and his lawyer, 
Robert H. Tourtelot, said his client was "ecstatic" about Ito's ruling. 
Tourtelot said the ruling gave Fuhrman "a clean bill of health." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers have presented no information about the other detectives 
that raises questions about their conduct in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem for the defense is that they've never had much evidence of racial 
animus or fabrication," said Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson, a former 
federal prosecutor. "They made a big issue out of Fuhrman and the likelihood 
that he planted a glove. Now there just doesn't seem the evidence to support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor who has closely followed the Simpson 
case, agreed that Ito's ruling makes it more difficult for the defense to 
attack the integrity of the detectives, especially Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense must be terribly disappointed to find that there's nothing of 
impeachment value in Detective Fuhrman's files," Arenella said. "Now I think 
we'll see a shift from attacks on the integrity to simple competency." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's session also included a surprise update from the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office: Prosecutors had pledged to announce whether 
they intended to seek the death penalty for Simpson but instead revealed that a 
decision may not be made for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman told Ito that it could be as late as Sept. 
19 before the committee weighing the death penalty issue determines how to 
proceed. Under a new trial schedule that was agreed upon Wednesday, jury 
selection would begin Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 That could leave lawyers for both sides with as little as one week's notice to 
plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is fundamentally unfair for us to be left in a situation where we 
don't know what to prepare for," said Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito agreed, saying he did not want to rush the district attorney's office in 
such a delicate and important matter, but he added that not knowing how 
prosecutors plan to proceed "complicates all of our lives immensely." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito asked prosecutors to alert him as soon as they reach a decision -- even if 
it means having the judge's clerk track him down on his upcoming vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing was dominated by a long discussion of evidence sharing 
between the two sides, and there were rare flashes of anger from two of the 
case's most subdued lawyers, defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen and Hodgman. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen initiated the exchange by accusing Hodgman and his colleagues of 
withholding their witness list, even though Wednesday was the deadline for the 
two sides to exchange information. Uelmen called that a "serious breach of the 
discovery scheme." 
</P>
<P>
 Clenching the lectern with one hand, Hodgman said: "I am slow to anger, but I 
am getting very angry with regard to what I feel is just absolute sandbagging 
by the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hodgman was speaking, Shapiro muttered something, and Hodgman accused 
Shapiro of uttering an expletive. Shapiro sat silently but later apologized to 
Hodgman, indicating later that he had said "bullshit." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to resolve the disputes over evidence, Ito meticulously reviewed each 
of the defense complaints outlined in a motion filed this week. In that motion, 
Simpson's lawyers argued that the prosecution's "staggered, piecemeal approach 
to the scientific testing" of that evidence and the disclosure of the results 
of those tests is keeping the defense from reviewing test results and data, 
"much less conducting its own independent tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito addressed each of the complaints, resolving some, dismissing others and 
directing prosecutors to turn over whatever material they reasonably could 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence sharing has reached a critical stage because the trial is fast 
approaching in the celebrated case. Ito announced Wednesday that he wants to 
postpone the beginning of jury selection from Sept. 19 to Sept. 26, but that 
still leaves less than a month for the two sides to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, a number of volatile issues still need to be resolved. Prosecutors 
announced that they expect to ask Ito to sequester the jury, a move that they 
say is needed to protect jurors from an avalanche of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 That poses other complications. If jurors are sequestered, they could face 
enormous hardship. Ito estimated that the trial could last six months, nearly 
twice as long as jurors were sequestered in the Rodney G. King civil rights 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ito has said he hopes to pick a jury before holding a potentially 
complex hearing on the admissibility of the DNA evidence. The trouble is that 
the hearing must take place outside the jury's presence, and Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Marcia Clark said Wednesday that she believes it could last a month or longer 
-- raising the question of what the sequestered jurors would do during that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether the jury is sequestered reflects the building intensity 
of the case and the publicity surrounding it as it moves toward trial. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports have disclosed much evidence in the case -- sometimes erroneously 
-- and the continuing bombardment of coverage has irritated Ito, who earlier 
this week gave attorneys a copy of a proposed protective order. If implemented, 
that order would bar people close to the case from talking about it and would 
require that all motions be filed under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Ito has directed attorneys to submit motions under seal. One result 
is that the public has yet to see defense motions asking Ito to dismiss the 
case against Simpson for lack of evidence and another asking him not to allow 
into evidence items discovered at Simpson's estate hours after the bodies were 
discovered in front of Nicole Simpson's townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, news organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union told 
Ito that his proposed order is unconstitutional. They urged him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the remedy, I think, is worse than the risk," said Kelli L. Sager, 
an attorney representing The Times and other news organizations. "More speech 
is the answer, not less speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Sager argued that gagging participants in the case would allow false reports 
to flourish and that cutting off the press's access to court files would 
deprive the public of a reliable source of information. Her comments were 
echoed by Douglas Mirell, a volunteer lawyer with the ACLU who successfully 
fought a gag order imposed during the King civil rights trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, who had not released the proposed order, sparred with Sager during her 
presentation to the court and complained that The Times had published excerpts 
from his proposed order despite his efforts to avoid public discussion of it 
until he had fine-tuned the two-page document. He cited that as an example of 
the difficulties he is confronting in controlling attorneys in the high-profile 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I issued my draft of this protective order, I admonished counsel that 
this was a draft, and it was not for dissemination," Ito said. "I then pick up 
the L.A. Times the next morning, and read the text of the protective order in 
the L.A. Times. . . . My admonishment was useless." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sager suggested that one way to protect a fair trial was to sequester the 
jury, as prosecutors had proposed, Ito responded: "Is the L.A. Times going to 
foot the hotel bill for the sequestration?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito argued that the release of the proposed protective order 
illustrated the need for him to take additional steps to control public 
discussion of the case, Sager countered that the inability of the court to keep 
the document from being leaked merely illustrates how difficult it would be to 
enforce any protective order. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previous case, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that 
"whether or not there was a sealing order, publicity would continue and leaks 
would continue," Sager said. "The only effect that a sealing order would have 
is to remove from the press the most accurate and verifiable source of 
information about what's happening in the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not rule on the gag order Wednesday, but his comments from the bench 
suggested that he was inclined against imposing at least the portion of it 
requiring all motions to be filed under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a short time remains before trial is to begin, new evidence 
continues to surface. Ito suggested that there still could be more surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are numerous pieces of evidence that have not been presented, that are 
still confidential, that will have a very direct and important bearing on this 
case," he said.

LEGISLATURE OKS TOUGH RAPE BILL, ELECTION FUNDING RULES; CAPITOL: WILSON HAS 
SAID HE WILL SIGN CRIME MEASURE. HE IS EXPECTED TO VETO CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
OVERHAUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Legislature on Wednesday gave final passage to one of the most hotly 
debated crime bills of the year, sending to Gov. Pete Wilson a measure to 
require up to life in prison for first-time, violent rapists and child 
molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing toward a scheduled midnight adjournment of the two-year legislative 
session, lawmakers also passed a comprehensive overhaul of the state's campaign 
finance laws that would limit contributions and spending and allow partial 
taxpayer financing of legislative campaigns. But the governor is expected to 
veto the measure because of his objections to public financing of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to establish a new, full-time commission to regulate gambling in 
California died after intense back-room negotiations as the session was drawing 
to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Also rejected when lawmakers went home for the year were measures to place 
bonds on the November ballot to pay for construction of school classrooms, 
prisons and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 On other matters: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Senate protested Wilson's environmental policies by adjourning without 
confirming Jacqueline Schafer, the governor's choice to lead the state Air 
Resources Board. Schafer now must leave office in November, one year after 
Wilson appointed her to head the regulatory board. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said the members had no 
particular problem with Schafer, a former assistant secretary of the Navy, but 
wanted to send a message to Wilson that they are unhappy with what they 
perceive as his tilt in favor of the oil industry in air quality matters. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bill that critics say would cut corners on the cleanup of selected toxic 
dump sites in the state won bipartisan approval in the Senate and Assembly and 
now goes to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, by Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), is an attempt to speed 
the cleanup and settlement of financial responsibility for up to 30 hazardous 
waste sites covered by the state Superfund program. It sets up an arbitration 
procedure for deciding how clean a site should be, depending on its use, and 
for allocating costs among those responsible for the contamination. Calderon 
said the new approach is needed to unclog a system that has barely begun the 
job of cleaning up thousands of contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure, which came to life in the final weeks of the session, has 
alarmed environmental groups, who fear that it will allow incomplete cleanups 
and leave taxpayers liable for costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) contended that the 
bill would allow some sites to be covered over and developed without being 
completely cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly approved the measure 48 to 26; the Senate 21 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Senate, reversing itself, sent the governor a bill that would make it 
illegal for employers to deny women the option of wearing pantsuits or slacks 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), who previously had opposed the bill on grounds 
that it trivialized advancements made by women, cast the decisive 21st vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said Wilson has not yet taken a position on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Senate, on a 21-11 vote, sent to Wilson a bill to overhaul a 
controversial new school performance test, formerly known as the California 
Learning Assessment System. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would give parents a larger role in the development of the test and 
bar certain questions that would elicit comments from students on their 
personal beliefs about family life, sex, morality or religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is expected to veto the measure because it does not provide for 
individual assessments for each student in every school. His veto would kill 
the testing program, which only a year ago was being hailed as a model for the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The rape bill, by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), was passed by 
the Senate on a 39-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has campaigned for longer rape sentences since 1990 and made this 
measure one of his top legislative priorities this year, has said he will sign 
the bill, though he would have preferred to sentence all rapists to life in 
prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its tougher version, the bill drew broad attacks from civil 
libertarians and other groups, including some district attorneys and women's 
organizations, who said the measure was so harsh it might hinder prosecutions 
or prompt sex offenders to kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was redrafted to delete all references to life without parole, 
substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for only the most brutal sexual 
assaults -- those involving torture, mayhem, kidnaping or burglary with the 
intent to commit rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser sex crimes could earn sentences of 15 years to life, but would have to 
include special circumstances such as the use of a firearm or dangerous weapon, 
more than one victim or the administering of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the maximum term for a single rape is eight years in prison, and the 
average convicted rapist spends fewer than five years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, the governor's spokesman, said: "This is the toughest piece of 
crime legislation targeting rapists and child molesters to ever hit the desk of 
a governor. We would prefer an even stronger bill and will strive in the future 
for a stronger one, but are pleased with this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly passed and sent to Wilson's desk on a 42-32 vote a bill imposing 
limits on campaign contributions and spending and providing limited public 
funding for legislative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, by Senate President Lockyer, would limit contributions in 
legislative races to $2,000 from individuals and corporations and $5,000 from 
political action committees. The limits would apply separately to primaries and 
general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending also would be capped, at about $800,000 in state Senate races and 
$560,000 in Assembly races, adjusted each year according to the number of 
voters in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending limits would apply only to candidates who accepted the partial 
public financing that the bill would create. 
</P>
<P>
 The public financing would match private contributions raised by the 
candidates on a ratio ranging from 5-1 to 2-1, depending on the size of the 
private donation. Candidates whose opponents exceeded the spending limit would 
get extra public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly passed the bill on a straight party line vote, with Democrats for 
it and Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), a member of the conference 
committee that fashioned the bill, called the legislation a "good start toward 
campaign finance reform." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The people don't care what the fine points are of campaign finance 
reform. They simply want us to put a system in place that caps the effect of 
special interest money on elections. And their view of the world is that the 
Legislature spends all of its time in the member's lounge playing Yahtzee with 
the people's money rather than doing the public's business." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia), also a member of the conference 
committee, urged a no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely need campaign finance reform," Johnson said, "but this bill 
doesn't do it. What you are doing is creating an open-ended entitlement to 
funding politicians' campaigns. It is an unfair system designed to help 
Democrats and hurt Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the future regulation of the state's gambling industry went 
down to the wire Wednesday night after a measure backed by Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren to establish a five-member statewide gambling control commission was 
bottled up in the Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters sought to revive the proposal but said they could not overcome 
opposition from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-San Francisco), who pushed the gaming 
proposal, cited a combination of reasons, including Wilson's desire to control 
all five "patronage appointments" to the commission and Brown's reluctance to 
support "strict regulation of gambling."

LIBYA THRASHING ABOUT TO SHAKE U.N. SANCTIONS HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of several desperate bids to ease the tightening grip of U.N. 
sanctions, Moammar Kadafi's troubled regime in Libya has held out the prospect 
of turning over an indicted CIA renegade to appease the U.S. government, 
according to U.S. sources and a former CIA official. 
</P>
<P>
 Libya also may be willing to pay millions of dollars in compensation to 
families of those who died in the 1988 bombing over Scotland of Pan American 
Flight 103 in hopes of eliminating its most outspoken critics and thus easing 
international pressure, according to families and their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the Clinton Administration nor the families of victims appear 
interested in either possibility because they want to maintain pressure on the 
Kadafi regime and hold it accountable for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves and other recent steps come as Libya today marks the 25th 
anniversary of Kadafi's bloodless military coup ending the reign of King Idris 
I in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sanctions imposed last December coupled with plummeting prices have cut 
annual oil revenues from $21 billion a decade ago to about $6 billion, making 
this the most difficult year of Kadafi's rule, according to U.S. and Arab 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Tripoli has spent at least $50 million in two years on ploys 
first to prevent sanctions, then to negotiate an easing of the punitive 
economic, arms and air travel restrictions, a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions were imposed after Libya failed to cooperate with investigations 
of the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster and the bombing in 1989 over Niger of a 
French airliner in which 171 died. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Libyans are out there trying to make as many inroads as possible," said a 
senior U.S. counterterrorism official. "Every third person who has ever held a 
government position in this town has called us and said they've been 
approached. And each claimed to have a great deal going." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the latest centers on CIA renegade Frank Terpil, a communications 
expert indicted with CIA undercover agent Edmund Wilson in 1980 for conspiring 
to kill a Libyan dissident and for selling tons of explosives to Libya. The 
episode was one of the CIA's darkest, most embarrassing moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Terpil -- convicted in absentia and sentenced in New York to 30 years on arms 
charges -- has spent the intervening years in Libya, Syria and Lebanon, as well 
as in Eastern Europe before communism's demise there. According to a former 
government official who keeps close track of the fugitive, Terpil recently has 
spent limited time in Libya and has been spotted throughout Eastern and Western 
Europe, as well as in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdullah Sanoussi, chief of Libyan intelligence, was scheduled to meet in late 
June in Cairo with former CIA counterterrorism expert Vincent Cannistraro to 
discuss possible assistance with Terpil's capture, according to Cannistraro and 
U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was postponed after Sanoussi, Kadafi's brother-in-law and closest 
confidant, was injured in a car accident, Cannistraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Arab League, headquartered in Cairo, set up the meeting, he 
said. Several Arab governments are unhappy about the U.N. sanctions because of 
the effect on their own economies or angry because of perceived Western 
anti-Islamic or anti-Arab bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt, for example, has about 750,000 workers in Libya whose remittances to 
relatives at home are vital to Egypt's economy. Egypt "also needs Libya as a 
safety valve for foreign employment of a significant portion of its labor 
force," a U.S. specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libya's approach to Cannistraro fits what has become its modus operandi of 
trying to hire well-known figures to plead its case. At the CIA, Cannistraro 
investigated Libyan links with international terrorism. Having appeared on many 
U.S. television programs and served as an ABC News consultant, he is now the 
most visible former CIA counterterrorism official. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Libya or its representatives have tried to hire such figures as 
Judge Abraham Sofaer, who as chief State Department legal adviser during 
terrorism attacks in the 1980s helped develop the case against Libya's use of 
state-sponsored terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Famed defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey, who represented five clients in the Pan Am 
bombing, went to Tripoli last year to discuss Libya's request that he defend 
Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, the two Libyans indicted by 
the United States and Scotland for the Pan Am bombing, in which 270 people 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey subsequently complained about not being paid a $40,000 fee for the 
four-day consultation, although the National Law Journal reported that he 
received $15,000 in expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannistraro said he agreed to talk with the Libyan intelligence chief as a 
"volunteer" and did not stand to benefit from the meeting financially or 
otherwise. He described Libya's motive as "an attempt to get out from under 
sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. counterterrorism officials, informed in June of the meeting, said 
Wednesday that they did not authorize any deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the Libyans are mounting a sophisticated diplomatic and public 
relations campaign," the senior official said. "The Libyans know our terms" on 
Pan Am Flight 103 and terrorism generally, "and they do not include Frank 
Terpil." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Carlos the Jackal, the terrorist extradited from Sudan to France last 
month, Terpil is a figure from the past and is no longer as urgently sought, 
U.S. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libya may have held him out as bait because he has been so elusive for 15 
years. His colleague Wilson was duped, in an elaborate U.S. scheme, into 
leaving Libya in 1982 for the Dominican Republic. There, officials put him on a 
plane for New York on grounds that his papers were not in order. Federal agents 
were waiting for him and he is now in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar scheme in Beirut in the early 1980s failed when Terpil slipped away. 
Later, in Prague, a planted intermediary offered him payment for a news 
"interview" to be conducted in London, but he did not take the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cannistraro predicted last week that the meeting to discuss Terpil's 
capture might be rescheduled for this week, he said Wednesday that he now 
believes the exercise was "strictly propaganda" and has disassociated himself 
from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern is also growing among some families of Pan Am victims that a 
class-action lawsuit would ease pressure to hold Kadafi accountable for the 
bombing. Many angry relatives of victims claim the lawsuit amounts to an 
attempt to get them to stop demanding accountability or tougher action. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks $3 billion or up to $11.5 million per family. It was filed by 
U.S. lawyer Allan Gerson against Libya in June. If the court agrees to hear the 
case, all victims' families are automatically included, unless they opt out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerson has argued that financial compensation is a form of punishment -- and 
may be the only recourse for families because of the inability of the United 
States and United Nations to get Kadafi to hand over Megrahi and Fhimah. "Even 
for an oil-rich country, $3 billion adds up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But several families assert that the ultimate goal is a pretrial settlement 
that might serve to help get Libya off the hook. Some families and their 
representatives believe the framework of a deal already may have been cut in 
exploratory talks between Gerson and Abdelhay Sefrioui, one of Libya's lawyers 
based in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripoli's maneuverings reflect its escalating problems. Since sanctions were 
imposed, Libya's deteriorating economy has taken a nose-dive, U.S. officials 
said.

NEW TEST SPEEDS DIAGNOSIS OF HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An inexpensive new blood test developed by Texas researchers could improve the 
treatment of heart attacks and save as much as $4 billion in medical costs each 
year by quickly identifying which patients who show up at emergency rooms with 
symptoms are actually having an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The test, which is already available to hospitals, could speed the treatment 
of heart attack patients and reduce the use of potentially hazardous 
clot-busting drugs on patients who have symptoms but turn out not to be having 
an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, only 10% of the 5 million patients who enter U.S. emergency rooms each 
year with symptoms are having a heart attack. Nonetheless, a majority of them 
are admitted to expensive intensive care units as a safety measure. Determining 
whether they are having an attack can require 12 to 24 hours, by which time the 
damage from the attack is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the new test, developed at Baylor College of Medicine, can 
identify actual victims in less than two hours, leaving time to minimize 
permanent damage to heart tissues, the team reports today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had this test been used as a screening test, we could have reduced our 
coronary care admission rate by 70%," said Dr. Peter R. Puleo, a Baylor 
cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this turns out to be as good as they say it is, it will give an enormous 
economic and patientcare benefit," said Dr. Pravin Shah of Loma Linda Medical 
Center, a member of the American Heart Assn.'s Council on Clinical Cardiology. 
"At the present time, emergency room physicians tend to play it extra safe, 
largely for medico-legal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The new test meshes well with the current debate about minimizing health care 
costs, said Dr. George Sopko, a cardiologist at the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute. "With the test, one can eliminate quite a few unnecessary 
hospitalizations, and therefore reduce the cost, as well as using existing 
health care facilities more appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about the test is that it can be used in just about every 
hospital . . . it's fairly simple, it can be done fast and it should be helpful 
for physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Heart attack is the single largest killer of both men and women in the United 
States. Every year, about 1.5 million Americans have a heart attack -- more 
correctly called myocardial infarction -- and an estimated 481,000 die of it. 
Fully 250,000 of those die before reaching a hospital -- in large part because 
half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 Television and movies tell us that physicians diagnose a heart attack by 
hooking up an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which measures electrical activity in 
the heart. That can be true, but only part of the time. About half of all heart 
attack victims display a peculiar wiggle, called a Q wave, in their EKG that is 
unique to heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In other heart attack cases, the EKG reveals little. In that case, physicians 
must rely on a detailed clinical history and blood tests. The most useful test 
looks for the presence of an enzyme called CK-MB that leaks into blood from 
damaged heart tissues. Existing tests for CK-MB take five to six hours and are 
about 50% accurate in diagnosing heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this lag in diagnosis, many patients with chest pain are admitted 
to intensive care by physicians practicing what Loma Linda's Shah calls 
"defensive medicine." No more than 30% of those admitted are having heart 
attacks. Studies have shown that the cost of this excess hospitalization is 
about $4 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Roberts and his colleagues at Baylor have developed a new, 
25-minute test that can detect an unusual form of CK-MB produced in heart 
attacks at the extremely low concentrations present shortly after an attack. 
The test is manufactured by Helena Laboratories Inc. of Beaumont, Tex., and has 
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for monitoring the progress 
of heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, Puleo and their colleagues studied 1,110 patients who came to the 
emergency room of Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston with heart symptoms, 
testing blood for CK-MB every 30 to 60 minutes for at least six hours. They 
found that it was 93.9% accurate in identifying those patients who had heart 
attacks, compared to only 48% for the conventional CK-MB test. It was 96.2% 
accurate in identifying those who did not have a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now," Roberts said, "we had no great reason to make a diagnosis in two 
to four hours because we didn't have treatments. Now we know that time is 
muscle and we have clot-busters to save (heart) muscle, so we have a greater 
impetus for early diagnosis. This allows us to do it."

NEWS ANALYSIS; FRUSTRATION, WAR-WEARINESS LED TO IRA MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Within a few hours of the Irish Republican Army's cease-fire announcement 
Wednesday, the leader of the group's political arm was extolling the sacrifice 
and dedication of those who had fought to end British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a generation of men and women who've fought the British for 25 years 
and have not been defeated by them," Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told a group 
of cheering supporters in the party's Northern Ireland stronghold of West 
Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
 While Adams is certainly correct that neither the presence of 18,000 British 
soldiers nor one of the best-trained, best-armed civilian police forces 
anywhere could crush the IRA's capacity to kill, the whole truth is more 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for many of those most familiar with the rhythm of violence that has 
been a part of Northern Ireland for the last quarter-century, it was the IRA's 
sober assessment that it had failed to make any real headway toward its goal of 
wresting Ulster from British rule in its long campaign that played a key role 
in Wednesday's decision to give up its armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a very personal motivation on the part of IRA activists to halt 
their campaign: While many key figures in the guerrilla army first became 
active when they were teen-agers, the ensuing 25 years had seen them become 
fathers of children who are themselves now at an age to become involved in the 
bloody struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those close to the republican movement, few of the hard-core 
activists wanted their children to lead similar lives. 
</P>
<P>
 This war-weariness is reflected, analysts say, in the fact that it was Sinn 
Fein, not the British government, that initiated the back-channel contacts that 
first began between them early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts also argue it is significant that the cease-fire reserved no 
right of reprisal to possible Protestant extremist attacks and that Adams has 
asked for no amnesty for the estimated 400 republican prisoners in British and 
Ulster jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his demand has been that those prisoners in Britain be returned to 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors besides IRA weariness also played a role. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Over a period of time, activist members of Ulster's Roman Catholic, Irish 
nationalist minority gradually came to realize that a lasting peace settlement 
could be achieved only with the consent of the Protestant majority. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hume, leader of moderate nationalist opinion, was the first adherent of 
this belief -- which gradually spread through the senior ranks of the Irish 
government in Dublin and eventually seeped into the thinking of the IRA's 
political wing, Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, who has met with Hume often in recent months, is now willing to take 
part in talks that would lead to a settlement acceptable to all strands of 
Northern Ireland society. 
</P>
<P>
 (Hume on Wednesday was among the most vigorous in insisting that the IRA 
cease-fire is a permanent one. "I see the statement as a complete cessation of 
violence," he said. "Complete means complete.") 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, moderate Protestant leaders realized that the political 
constituency represented by Sinn Fein had to be recognized and, therefore, 
included in any settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 As positions narrowed, the only real prerequisite to sit at a peace table 
became an unequivocal renunciation of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * For British Prime Minister John Major, the time was also ripe; going for an 
Ulster settlement by stating his willingness to sit down with Sinn Fein 
certainly is a political gamble for him but one that has become increasingly 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Major's personal image and his party's popularity are both near all-time lows. 
Playing the pivotal role in bringing peace to Northern Ireland would give his 
stock a major boost. Failure could hardly send it lower. 
</P>
<P>
 While the absence of the word permanent to describe the cease-fire in the IRA 
statement and the debate surrounding its absence is a setback to Major, he 
brushed aside questions in a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is ending bloodshed on the streets of Northern Ireland after 
25 years that has too often spilled over into the (British) mainland as well," 
he said. "It's time to end that and begin a new future." 
</P>
<P>
 * The attitude of a new Democratic Administration in Washington is also 
believed to have been a factor. The Clinton Administration was interested in 
playing a low-key role to nudge the talks forward and gained credibility as a 
mediator within the IRA by allowing senior republican figures to travel to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips by Adams earlier this year and by well-known IRA activists Joseph Cahill 
and Pat Treanor this week are believed to have boosted the IRA resolve to go 
forward with the cease-fire. In each of these instances, President Clinton 
reportedly personally approved the decision to grant the visa. 
</P>
<P>
 While these circumstances have opened the door to the real possibility of 
peace for the first time in a quarter of a century in Northern Ireland, the 
road to a final settlement remains littered with far more questions than 
answers.

 They came as conquering heroes 49 years ago but left Wednesday ideologically 
vanquished, economically broken and even pitied by the people they had once 
defeated: In a day of brass bands, goose-stepping and speeches, the occupying 
Red Army received its farewell salute from Germany and prepared to board the 
last trains home for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia also withdrew virtually all of its troops from Latvia and Estonia on 
Wednesday, formally ending its massive, 50-year occupation of the Baltic 
states. It completed its withdrawal from Lithuania exactly one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berlin, fewer than 3,000 Russian troops were on hand for the departure 
ceremonies out of the more than 330,000 that occupied East Germany at the Cold 
War's height. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers who remained marched in well-rehearsed drills and sang songs 
composed especially for the occasion, while Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
laid a wreath atop an imposing Berlin monument to the Soviet victory over 
German fascism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historical truth demands . . . that we remember that for hundreds of millions 
of people, all over the world, the hope of victory was linked to the Soviet 
army," said Yeltsin, who chose to concentrate on the Russian role in defeating 
Adolf Hitler's Germany rather than dwelling on Josef Stalin's 1948-49 Berlin 
blockade or any other Cold War unpleasantness. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin asserted that the Red Army's presence in Europe from the end of World 
War II until now had helped to keep the peace, although he acknowledged that 
"after today's final reconciliation, our relations can take on a new quality. . 
. . We are in a position to make our neighborly relations warmer and more 
human." 
</P>
<P>
 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who participated in the ceremonies with 
Yeltsin, spoke out against the Soviet blockade of Berlin but was otherwise 
cordial. He noted that much could be learned from both countries' previous bad 
behavior and thanked the then-Soviet troops for letting the East German 
Communist regime collapse peacefully in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the (Berlin) Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, the Soviet leadership decided 
not to offer resistance," said Kohl. "German unification would not have taken 
place without Soviet cooperation. . . . We Germans will always remember this 
with gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Small but surprisingly appreciative crowds of eastern and western Germans 
gathered as Yeltsin moved through the streets of central Berlin on Wednesday, 
laying wreaths on a number of World War II-era Soviet monuments, hearing 
concerts and making speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Berliners waved red hammer-and-sickle flags as his entourage rolled by. 
One woman tossed him a bouquet of flowers, while other people cheered, "Boris! 
Boris!" Still other Yeltsin-seekers pleaded with police to get a better look at 
him, complaining, "He'll never be back again!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Russians might have stayed" in Germany, suggested Arnold Hackel, 
54, a teacher from what used to be East Berlin. "They never did us any harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Soviets' use of tanks to put down an uprising in East Berlin 
in 1953, and again to support the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, Hackel 
said, "Oh, one is always wiser afterward. It was not their fault. Hitler 
started the war. That's why they came here. And I say this even though my 
family suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Joachim Benedix, 34, also a teacher, added: "I saw the Soviets, 
always, more or less as soldiers doing their service, and I felt sorry for 
them. They were locked up and disciplined all the time. I remember that once I 
went to (their headquarters) with a class. They served us pea soup, and we, as 
guests, got the biggest pieces of meat. And we knew that they didn't get meat 
very often. I didn't consider them an occupying force." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sympathy and even tolerance on the part of ordinary Germans for their 
impoverished Russian "friends" did not reflect official German attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 German officials had argued earlier this summer that the Red Army was an 
unwanted occupier of East Germany, in contrast with the three Western Allies, 
whom they called a positive force in the former West. On that basis, Germany 
rejected Russian requests that the four World War II Allies hold their 
departure festivities together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans even went so far as to propose that the Russians hold their 
departure parades in Weimar, a small city that the Red Army did not even 
capture in 1945. Although the Russians were successful in blocking that idea, 
they were not allowed to join the Western Allied farewell ceremonies, set for 
next week in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even less festive was Wednesday's departure of the Red Army from the Baltic 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet army occupied Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940 under a 
then-secret 1939 pact with Nazi Germany. Hitler invaded the three Baltic states 
in 1941, ending the pact. With the German retreat in 1944, the Soviet army 
returned; thousands in the Baltics were packed off to camps in Russia -- mostly 
Siberia -- as they had been during the first Soviet takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Baltic people never saw Russians as liberators and because 
negotiations for the Red Army withdrawals were long and acrimonious, no 
ceremonies were held in Estonia or Latvia. The Baltic talks were complicated by 
differences over the rights of thousands of Russians, particularly retired 
military officers, who have settled there. Both countries eventually agreed to 
let them stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia's government first planned a reception to mark the Russian withdrawal 
but canceled it. Officials in Riga, the Latvian capital, vetoed plans for a 
garden party downtown. Nationalists in both countries have argued that, with 
small numbers of Russians staying on, the occupation is not really over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago, it was Hitler and Stalin. Now, it is the West and Boris 
Yeltsin who are cutting deals over other people's destinies," warned an 
editorial in The Baltic Independent newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, churches in the Baltic countries tolled their bells in memory of 
those who suffered and died under Soviet occupation and the presidents issued a 
statement calling it "a momentous day for our three countries." 
</P>
<P>
 "With the final withdrawal of Russian forces . . . our peoples have again 
become genuine masters of their own fate," they said. "Russia now moves closer 
to the accepted norms of international behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Estonian President Lennart Meri, who vowed three years ago not to consume 
champagne as long as Russian troops occupied his nation's soil, drank a 
farewell glass at a reception Wednesday, just after speaking at a solemn 
observance at a World War II memorial in Tallinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today signifies the end of the saddest chapter in our history," he said. "But 
it is also true that today a new chapter is opened for an Estonia liberated 
from foreign troops, which we must all write together." 
</P>
<P>
 In Latvia, meanwhile, the last few Russian soldiers left Riga Wednesday 
morning in two passenger cars of a freight train laden with jeeps, trucks, 
armored personnel carriers, civilian cars and whatever they could strip from 
their base. Some brought wives, children, dogs and cats. Others had bid long, 
tearful goodbys to girlfriends in the shadows of boxcars the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Y. Nekrasov, 31, a contract private, left alone. He said his German 
wife, whom he had met in Latvia, left him three months ago, taking their 
18-month-old son to Germany. There was no place for his family to live in 
Russia, he explained, and he would never have found work in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our army is marching out of Germany with honor. Here, they are kicking us 
out," he said bitterly, standing on a flatcar. "The Russians got along well 
with people here. It was the politicians, the people at the top, who decided 
our fate." 
</P>
<P>
 After the train left, the last Russian officers departed on three military 
planes from Riga. On the way to the airport, the two top Russian commanders 
called on Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis to inform him that the occupation 
was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are leaving without hate," Ulmanis told reporters later. He 
added with a wry smile: "If they return, they will be welcomed as visitors and 
as tourists."

 The control room dials read zero. The uranium fuel rods are long gone. The 
cooling water, contaminated by radiation, has been drained into an underground 
holding tank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crew at this dismal nuclear weapons plant, cut into the South Carolina 
pine forest, has not yet locked the door or turned off the industrial 
spotlights that burn around the clock at K reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactor remains on standby, ready to resume producing fuel for nuclear 
weapons should urgent national security orders come from Washington. Upkeep for 
this and four other nuclear piles at Savannah River -- all built before Elvis 
Presley made his first hit record -- requires a crew of 400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War may be over, but the nation's nuclear weapons industry is hardly 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States quit producing bombs four years ago and has no 
plans to resume, the government is spending $4.4 billion this year on nuclear 
weapons. About 73,000 people report to work every week at 11 active nuclear 
weapons plants around the country, 41,000 of them maintaining America's huge 
nuclear weapons stockpile and most of the rest doing environmental cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Examination of the nuclear weapons complex by many top experts, however, has 
left grave concerns about the adequacy of the Energy Department's efforts to 
mind the bombs now that the end of the superpower arms race has lowered the 
profile of the nation's nuclear defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as U.S. concern grows over an overseas black market in plutonium and the 
proliferation of nuclear capability in the Third World, senior Defense 
Department officials, independent safety agency authorities, outside experts 
and even some Energy Department executives warn of a whole other set of nuclear 
woes. They say: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Energy Department has no comprehensive plan for restructuring the 
nation's nuclear weapons industry. Critics fault both Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary and James D. Watkins, her predecessor in the George Bush 
Administration, for failing to deal quickly with such pressing issues as 
management and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * The nuclear weapons bureaucracy is bloated, with too many workers and too 
much capacity in areas where they are least needed. The Clinton Administration 
has budgeted $4.4 billion for its nuclear weapons program this year, down from 
a peak of $8 billion in 1990, and some critics believe much deeper cuts are 
possible as the nuclear arsenal is slashed by about 80% through the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paradoxically, the government is losing some of the employees it needs most 
in the new climate. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San 
Francisco, for example, experienced bomb designers in the weapons directorate 
number only a dozen, many near retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
 * The government has delayed investing in the new facilities it will need to 
ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States quit producing nuclear bombs in 1990, after the fall of the 
Berlin Wall. However, the government intends to keep a permanent stockpile of 
at least 6,000 warheads -- a sharp drop from the 30,000 bombs at the Cold War's 
peak, but still an enormous stash and by far the world's most lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 Minding those bombs is no cinch -- even without much concern in the United 
States, unlike overseas, about terrorists stealing plutonium. To ensure that 
the weapons are safe from accidental detonation and to guarantee that they will 
work reliably if they are needed, the government maintains a huge complex of 
laboratories, production lines for non-nuclear parts, assembly sites and 
storage bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 The task is extraordinary, perhaps unique. Nobody has ever attempted to 
maintain any kind of electronic or mechanical device in perfect working order 
for two or three decades -- the intended life of a nuclear weapon -- without 
periodically testing or using it. 
</P>
<P>
 And nuclear weapons are not just any device. With an estimated 6,000 parts 
functioning next to a radioactive core and surrounded by up to 100 pounds of 
conventional high explosives, they are among the most complex industrial 
products in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to deal with the long-term strategic issue here," Watkins said 
in an interview. "What we want is to consolidate . . . cut costs, move some 
parts out to private industry. I don't understand why this is not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary O'Leary rejects concerns -- even those of her own 
subordinates -- that nuclear bomb safety may be deteriorating. "We are in a 
position where we can ensure the safety and reliability of the stockpile," she 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if there are problems with the way the nation's nuclear weapons are 
managed, the blame is bipartisan. John Conway, chairman of the Nuclear Weapons 
Facilities Safety Board, an independent federal agency, has issued dozens of 
safety recommendations to the Energy Department in recent years. Both Watkins 
and O'Leary, he said, have failed to heed calls for change from the safety 
board and others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of these charges, the problems run much deeper than 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a top-secret letter to O'Leary in late May, Deputy Defense Secretary John 
Deutch raised a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned that the present (Energy Department) nuclear weapons 
research development and test budget does not provide sufficient resources to 
maintain the technological capability that is required for future nuclear 
weapons missions," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials, in a series of interviews, point to two 
particularly worrisome consequences of the Energy Department's failure to 
devise a plan for the nuclear weapons business. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they say, O'Leary has dragged her feet in deciding on a new source of 
tritium, an important explosive booster in hydrogen bombs. Tritium decays 
radioactively and must be periodically replenished in weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States stopped making tritium at Savannah River in 1988, because of 
concerns about the safety of reactors there. After spending $2 billion to 
update K reactor -- a massive concrete ziggurat -- the decision to restart it 
was delayed and it continues in cold standby. But the lengthy shutdown has made 
it highly unlikely that the reactor will be used again. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is on course to run short of tritium by 2008; construction 
on a new reactor must start as early as next year to fill the need. But O'Leary 
said new tritium might not be available until 2010. She called the two-year gap 
an "acceptable" shortfall -- an assertion that raises hackles at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Defense Department officials worry that the Energy Department's 1996 
budget, still under preparation, will be so small that weapons work at Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory -- one of two where bombs are designed -- will be 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense officials want two laboratories so that in the absence of underground 
testing -- which has been subject to an informal global moratorium for five 
years -- each can review the other's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is that this is a complex where people have critical skills," said 
former Energy official Donald Kerr, an executive vice president at Science 
Applications International Corp., a weapons contractor in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight budgets already have led the Energy Department to stop work on some 
nuclear safety enhancements, including a bomb trigger that would have used 
optical fibers and lasers in place of electronic components. One weapons 
designer at the Energy Department's Pinellas plant in Largo, Fla., said the 
optical devices would have been more resistant to electrical disturbances, 
lightning and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick: To cut what is no longer needed and to keep what is, even as 
special interests from coast to coast try to protect their own pieces of the 
nuclear weapons business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of the Savannah River plant shows how politically difficult achieving 
that goal will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Savannah River's patron in Washington is no less a figure than Sen. Strom 
Thurmond (R-S.C.), whose 40 years of service make him the nation's most senior 
senator. And the plant, operated by Westinghouse Electric Corp., is by far the 
largest employer in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant's future "is a very big deal," said Hunter Howard, executive vice 
president of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. A major cutback, he 
warned, "would devastate the state's economy." 
</P>
<P>
 After Savannah River was built in the 1950s, it operated five nuclear reactors 
and two chemical processing plants for making tritium and bomb-grade plutonium, 
the explosive pit in most U.S. weapons. Today, the plant's only job is to 
recycle tritium from old bombs, providing a source of the radioactive substance 
for the remaining stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 2,600 layoffs last year, Savannah River has 18,000 workers, more than 
it had at the peak of the Cold War, according to Victor Rezendes, the General 
Accounting Office's top expert on nuclear weapons. Although nearly half are 
working on cleaning up radioactive waste, 9,000 workers are collecting 
paychecks from the bomb production program -- even though no bombs are being 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think for a second that we could lay off 9,000 workers at Savannah 
River even if we wanted to?" conceded one senior Energy Department official. 
"You have got to be kidding. Even if we tried, Strom Thurmond would make sure 
we had enough money so we couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In his efforts to ensure Savannah River's future, Thurmond has lashed out at 
O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears the men who built our successful nuclear deterrent have no impact 
and are ignored," Thurmond thundered in a Senate speech this summer. "Mr. 
President, it is said that one of the first things Mrs. O'Leary did at DOE was 
to take down the pictures of nuclear warships like the Nautilus. Mr. President, 
that was a symbolic indication of what was to come." 
</P>
<P>
 In a reflection of the success of the plant's patrons, the Energy Department's 
own inspector general has found Savannah River's staff to be bloated. Its 
investigation asserted that 1,206 of Westinghouse's 3,088 managers were excess 
baggage, kept on the payroll at a cost to taxpayers of $81.7 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The January report found that Westinghouse workers took three times longer 
than standard industry practice to paint a wall and three times longer to seed 
a lawn. At the facility's 15 maintenance shops, workers required an average of 
16 hours to change several standard water filters -- not unlike residential 
filters -- compared with three hours for Navy workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse executives declined to be interviewed. Mario Fiori, the chief 
Energy Department official managing the Savannah River operation, said the work 
force was no bigger than in 1988, even though the administrative and 
environmental workload had increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori said he has tried to save money where he could, reducing lawn mowing 
along the roads, for example. And he manages to sell $3 million worth of timber 
from the site every year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher Payne, a noted nuclear critic at the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental group in Washington, D.C., called Savannah River a 
"boondoggle. . . . Sen. Thurmond and the rest of the South Carolina delegation 
is well-positioned to protect that plant, which is exactly what they are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Savannah River is not the only nuclear weapons installation drawing such flak. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee found that workers at the Rocky Flats 
nuclear plant near Denver had so much free time that they set up a volleyball 
court. A committee investigator said supervisors eventually ordered that the 
games be played inside a top-security area, to avoid giving visitors a bad 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Energy Department's rank and file resists change, one layer of the 
nation's nuclear weapons managers is stampeding out of government service: 
those at the very top, who find little future in a dying industry and have the 
credentials to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the Energy Department is fast losing the top scientists who are best 
positioned to maintain the reliability and safety of nuclear weapons. As they 
depart, they are frequently leaving no substantial records about the bombs they 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuclear Weapons Facilities Safety Board reported last year that "the level 
of scientific and technical expertise in the (Energy Department) defense 
nuclear facilities and operations has been declining." 
</P>
<P>
 Conway, the board's chairman, warned: "A case can be made for the need for 
greater vigilance now throughout the weapons complex because of increased risk 
of equipment mishaps in aged facilities, loss of technical expertise through 
attrition and downsizing and a reduced inclination for young engineers and 
scientists to get involved in the nuclear weapons field." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the nation's leading nuclear weapons contractors are also getting out 
of the business. AT&T, duPont and General Electric have recently walked away 
from Energy Department contracts to run the bomb plants, a tacit vote of no 
confidence in the agency and a reflection that the contracts pose sizable 
liability risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Energy Secretary Watkins, in an acid letter to the GAO this summer, 
cited a "decline of attentive, committed and skilled leadership among those who 
have the responsibility for maintaining a safe and credible nuclear weapons 
posture." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have left . . . " said Victor Reese, assistant Energy 
secretary for the weapons program. "As I'm facing the new mission, which was 
described as a scientific stewardship program, I'm not sure we might not have 
gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
 In Reese's view, the problems posed by the nuclear weapons are unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 The average nuclear bomb, he says, is good for roughly 30 years before it must 
be torn down and fully rebuilt. With a stockpile of 6,000 weapons, an average 
of 200 weapons will have to be replaced or remanufactured every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things age," Reese said. "They were not designed to last for a long 
period of time. It's like an airplane that is designed for a 10-year life 
cycle. Now, we expect it to last indefinitely into the future. How long, we 
don't know. You'll never get an opportunity to see if it works, but we'll 
expect it to work 10 years, 20 years, 30 years down." 
</P>
<P>
 Failures have occurred in past tests when bombs fizzled, Reese said. Since 
1950, the Energy and Defense departments have acknowledged 32 major accidents 
involving bombs, though none have been catastrophic. The Energy Department has 
set an official standard that limits the probability of an accidental nuclear 
detonation to 1 in 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficult tasks ahead, Reese acknowledged that the Energy 
Department does not have a comprehensive, formal plan to restructure the 
industry, although it is making progress in developing such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are correct when they charge that the nuclear complex is as large 
today as it was during much of the Cold War, Reese said. But the high costs are 
justified, he insisted, because many of the agency's big, old factories -- 
which still are needed -- have high fixed costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the agency is dismantling 2,000 bombs per year, as well as 
storing many thousands of bombs in bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get that for nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is happening just at a time when, in Reese's view, the nation needs 
to invest in major new facilities to conduct sophisticated computer simulations 
of weapons and advanced types of laser testing. These would cost billions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics such as the NRDC's Payne and others in the arms control and 
environmental movements distrust these ideas, saying they betray an intent to 
perpetuate an unnecessarily large and costly nuclear weapons complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne argues there is no evidence that nuclear weapons age in unpredictable 
ways. "We have as much nuclear weapons research as we ever will need," Payne 
said. "We don't need a big, bulky nuclear research Establishment. We can afford 
to let these people go. We can let technical staffs atrophy." 
</P>
<P>
 The root problem, critics contend, is the Pentagon's plan to maintain up to 
6,000 nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts such as Sidney Drell, the influential physicist who is director of the 
Stanford Linear Accelerator -- a nuclear physics research facility -- have 
argued that a stockpile of 1,000 to 1,500 weapons would provide sufficient 
deterrence for the future. With that many bombs, the entire nuclear complex 
could be consolidated to a single site, many experts contend. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Cold War was ending in 1989, the Energy Department was in the midst of 
an ambitious effort to rebuild the nuclear weapons industry -- a project of 
which the $2 billion invested in Savannah River's K reactor was only a small 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Energy Department was slow to recognize the political changes that were 
going on in the world," said Rezendes, the GAO nuclear expert. "As a result 
they still are coming to grips with what the national nuclear strategy should 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Physicists and politicians want to build a multibillion-dollar laser at 
California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Critics call it nuclear 
pork. Where the Bombs Are Made 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States quit producing nuclear bombs four years ago and has 
no plans to resume, the government is spending $4.4 billion this year on 
nuclear weapons. About 73,000 people work at nuclear weapons plants around the 
country--41,000 of them maintaining America's huge nuclear weapons stockpile 
and most of the rest doing environmental cleanup. Here is a listing of 
contractor employment at major nuclear weapons installations*:

'3-STRIKES' LAW USED TWICE AGAINST OXNARD SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 52-year-old Oxnard man who allegedly tried to rape his cellmate while he 
awaited sentencing under the state's new "three-strikes" law was charged 
Wednesday under the tough statute a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Carlton McCowan might be the first defendant in the state to be 
charged twice under the three-strikes provision, authorities said. He is the 
first in Ventura County to be charged twice. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan already was facing a 25-year-to-life sentence for stealing 18 bottles 
of cologne when he was charged last month with attempted forcible sodomy and 
attempted sodomy in a corrections facility, both felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Either charge could be used as a basis for a second 25-year-to-life sentence 
because each new felony beyond the original three can trigger a three-strikes 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors announced their decision to seek the second three-strikes 
conviction against McCowan for the sodomy case at an arraignment Wednesday in 
which the stocky, bearded defendant pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted six months ago, the three-strikes law requires the long prison term 
for anyone convicted of a felony who has two prior convictions for serious or 
violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, McCowan could be ordered to serve back-to-back sentences of 
25 years to life if the sodomy charges against him lead to a conviction, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bob Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a judge wanted to, he could stack two 25-year-to-life sentences," Calvert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan is one of only a few Ventura County defendants charged so far under 
the three-strikes law. But his case has drawn more attention because he was 
first charged under the new law for petty theft instead of a violent or 
drug-related offense. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling the three-strikes law to the public, supporters promoted it as a 
way to rid California streets of violent offenders and drug dealers. Ventura 
County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury has said that McCowan is violent and 
argued that the three-strike law is being put to good use in his case. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan, whose long rap sheet includes convictions for assault, burglary and 
robbery, was accused of stealing the cologne March 8 from an Oxnard Sav-on 
drugstore. That was just one day after Gov. Pete Wilson signed the 
three-strikes measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Because McCowan had a previous theft offense when he stole the cologne, he was 
convicted July 21 of felony petty theft by a Superior Court jury -- paving the 
way for a mandatory three-strikes sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the cologne conviction, as his attorneys prepared an appeal, 
McCowan's 31-year-old cellmate told guards at the Ventura County Jail that 
McCowan had tried to rape him. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who had been serving a short jail term for petty theft, testified at 
a preliminary hearing that McCowan chased him around their small cell for more 
than an hour while trying to molest him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors originally charged McCowan with forcible sodomy. But a judge 
reduced the charge to attempted forcible sodomy after hearing the victim's 
testimony. Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele has set a jury trial in the 
sodomy case for Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily, could not be 
reached for comment after Wednesday's arraignment. Daily has filed a motion to 
overturn the cologne conviction. A hearing is set for Sept. 9 in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert said the district attorney's office did not consider McCowan's cologne 
conviction when deciding to charge him as a three-strikes defendant a second 
time. In court papers, prosecutors cite a 1978 residential burglary and a 1988 
robbery as his first two strikes, and reasons that he should receive 25 years 
to life in prison if convicted of attempted sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We evaluate each case on its merits and make the decision, and that's what we 
did in this case," Calvert said.

COURT UPHOLDS REINSTATEMENT OF GAY SAILOR; APPEAL: FEDERAL JUDGES AGREE THAT 
MAN'S DECLARATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR DISCHARGE. BUT 
THEY THROW OUT RULING THAT SAID MILITARY'S POLICY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>

<P>
 In an opinion that contained good and bad news for gay activists, a federal 
appeals court Wednesday upheld the reinstatement of a gay sailor, while 
throwing out part of a lower court decision in the case that declared the 
military's gay policies unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Affirming the reinstatement, the San Francisco appeals panel said it is 
improper for the military to bar gay men and lesbians based solely on their 
statements that they are homosexual -- a conclusion that carries troubling 
implications for the Clinton Administration's "don't ask, don't tell" 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, issued by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, was the latest in 
a series of judicial opinions that have, to at least some degree, come down on 
the side of gay service members challenging the military's policy on 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the judges upheld a District Court opinion reinstating Navy 
Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged in 1992 after he disclosed 
during a TV news show that he is homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The military can bar homosexual conduct, the opinion said, but the Navy went 
too far in assuming that Meinhold would engage in such illegal conduct simply 
because he identified himself as gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a statement that shows a "concrete, fixed or expressed desire to commit 
homosexual acts despite their being prohibited" justifies an involuntary 
discharge, the appeals panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the decision applies to military regulations replaced last year by 
the Clinton Administration, legal scholars said it holds significance for the 
new policy as well. "The 'don't tell' part of the new policy is brought into 
serious question by this decision," said Stanford Law School professor Kathleen 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, the military no longer asks recruits about their sexual 
orientation, but if a service member says he or she is gay, they have to prove 
they are not engaging in prohibited homosexual conduct to stay in the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Touching on the distinction drawn between homosexuals and heterosexuals by the 
military, Judge Pamela Rymer noted in the 3-0 decision that "no similar 
assumption" is made that heterosexuals will engage in prohibited conduct such 
as adultery simply because they are heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least a serious question is raised whether it can ever be rational to 
presume that one class of persons (identified by their sexual preference alone) 
will violate regulations whereas another class (identified by their preference) 
will not," Rymer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a stunning statement -- for a conservative judge to say that there's 
a serious equal protection question here," said Sullivan, who described all 
three judges who signed the opinion as conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Rymer said the court would defer to the Navy's judgment that 
the presence of people who engage in homosexual conduct or who demonstrate a 
propensity to do so by their statements "impairs the accomplishment of the 
military mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the panel struck down part of U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter's 
ruling forbidding the government to take any action against gay service members 
based solely on their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meinhold, the judges noted, had not filed a class-action lawsuit and Hatter 
was unnecessarily sweeping in applying his order to all service members. 
"Beyond reinstatement, and not separating Meinhold on that basis, (the 
Department of Defense) should not be constrained from applying regulations to 
Meinhold and all other military personnel," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in San Diego, where Meinhold is on temporary assignment, 
he and his lawyer praised the appellate court ruling. They said it will bolster 
future challenges to the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, even though the court 
did not address the constitutionality of that rule directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision says quite explicitly that it's improper for the government to 
make presumptions about improper conduct based upon a service member's 
acknowledgment that they are gay or lesbian," said John McGuire, Meinhold's 
lawyer. "That presumption is exactly the linchpin of the Clinton 
Administration's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. And that is exactly what this 
court has said the government can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuire said the reversal of the sweeping lower court decision against 
military gay policies was not a major setback, arguing that Wednesday's ruling 
prevents the military from discharging people for simply saying that they are 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan saw a far more limited impact, saying the opinion would take legal 
precedent within the 9th Circuit in cases pending against the old military 
policy on gays. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department declined comment on the decision, 
saying department attorneys were reviewing the opinion and had not decided 
their next step in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the challenges against the military gay regulations will be 
settled by the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to take up one of the 
dozen or so cases making their way through the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 Meinhold said that during his legal battle he has "learned to have more faith 
in the system of justice, the military and even the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Meinhold, who works as a sonar operator on combat flights, is stationed at a 
base at Whidbey Island, Wash. He cited his current assignment -- classified 
anti-submarine warfare research in San Diego -- as proof of good treatment by 
the Navy.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS AN OUTSIDER 
VS. A POLITICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican Mike Huffington on Wednesday cast his race for the U.S. Senate as a 
battle between the special-interest insiders backing Sen. Dianne Feinstein and 
his own outsider crusade for a government of citizen legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington told an audience of business professionals that by campaigning with 
his personal money and limiting himself to two terms, he has the independence 
to stand up to powerful interests -- including his own political party and some 
of its sacred cows, such as big business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to say to you today, I am running because I am not part of the 
system," Huffington told a luncheon meeting of the Comstock Club, a group of 
business leaders. "I am a maverick. . . . This speech I hope one day will be 
looked at as the speech that started the change from the career politician to 
the citizen politician." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a Santa Barbara congressman, also addressed critics who say that 
he is trying to buy the election by spending, so far, at least $10 million from 
a personal fortune he made in the 1990 sale of his family's Texas petroleum 
company. Huffington told the audience that his self-funded campaign should be 
viewed as a personal sacrifice to challenge the traditional power of 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so far put $10 million into this campaign," he said. "How many people 
in America do you know would be willing to sacrifice their hard-earned money 
for that? It's not for the office . . . it's not for the power or the glory or 
the perks -- I had more in my private life. It's because I care deeply about 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's speech was portrayed by the Huffington campaign as an attempt to 
define sharp differences between the two leading candidates and to frame the 
issues Huffington would like voters to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Since both Feinstein and Huffington are considered moderates in their parties, 
some analysts have downplayed the policy differences. Both candidates agree on 
a number of political litmus tests -- support for abortion rights and gay 
rights, gun control -- including the ban on assault weapons -- and President 
Clinton's Family Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his speech, Huffington sought to challenge the notion that he and 
Feinstein are similar, arguing that the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I run against Mrs. Feinstein, it is because she and I are diametrically 
different," he said. "She believes in the power of government to solve the 
problems. . . . I am running against the establishment that says give us more 
of your money and we will solve the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Huffington and Feinstein were elected to federal office at the same time 
in 1992, but he noted that Feinstein has been a politician for more than 25 
years, since she was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He 
sought to portray her as an entrenched politician in Washington by noting her 
support for many of President Clinton's programs, particularly his 1993 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has voted against most of the appropriations bills to come before 
Congress because he believes they are too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials responded Wednesday that they are happy to wage 
the contest on a comparison of the two lawmakers in Washington. They say the 
campaign is that of a fighter for California interests versus a political bomb 
thrower who is quick to criticize but who does not work for solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians do want leadership, but Michael Huffington has never offered any 
leadership on anything and Dianne Feinstein, on all of the issues he raises, 
has been in the thick of it," said Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata. "He 
is making up things about Dianne Feinstein. That's not leadership, that is 
being a typical politician." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Huffington hardly touched on his proposal to end the federal 
welfare system, a plan he referred to last month as the "central theme of my 
campaign." Since he broadcast a commercial highlighting the plan, skeptics have 
questioned whether it is realistic. The candidate said he will continue to 
discuss his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington focused most of his comments Wednesday on what he said was the 
independent voice he brings to the campaign. As proof that he has been willing 
to stand up to powerful influences, Huffington boasted about how he rejected 
the advice of GOP leaders who asked that he not run against veteran GOP Rep. 
Robert Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party said, 'You're a great Republican . . . but you're 
running against an 18-year Republican congressman and we don't want you to run 
against somebody who is already in Congress,' " Huffington said. "Well, I said 
I have different views than that person does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Quayle, the vice president at the time, called me and asked me to get out 
of the race," he continued. "George Bush and Dan Quayle, most of the Republican 
congressmen; they all backed my opponent. But I went to those 10,000 homes (in 
the district) . . . and what they said is, 'We don't want more of the same.' "

A HOT TOPIC COOLS OFF; SEX HARASSMENT SUITS' LOW PROFILE REFLECTS CHANGING 
TIMES IN THE CAPITOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At any other moment in the legislative year but this one, this double-time 
dash to the finish line, the details of sexual harassment accusations against 
two legislators and their chiefs of staff might be meat and drink in this 
gossipy marble hive. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, though, both the man who oversees the handling of the Assembly's 
sexual harassment training and a Senate staffer who feels not enough is being 
done agree -- one with pride, the other with dismay -- that "This is not the 
topic du jour, it really isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what they call progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen or 20 years ago, in the Capitol's droit de seigneur atmosphere of a 
private men's club where a legislator could -- no joke -- show off in front of 
a lobbyist by pitching pennies into a secretary's blouse and getting a big 
laugh, "sexual harassment" was a phrase from an alien vocabulary; such behavior 
wasn't even on the misconduct map. 
</P>
<P>
 Says one longtime Democratic staff woman: "I think any woman who has worked 
any length of time in the Capitol probably has been sexually harassed at one 
time or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Men in power did it because they could, and women who worked for them "put up 
with it," says a veteran legislative staffer, for fear of losing their jobs. 
"Before, you knew going into it or thereafter that it was part of the job, or 
there were expectations, and no one said anything," she said. "That's not true 
anymore." In the past, someone who complained might be told, with a shrug, "You 
know how they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after Anita Hill, after new laws and big lawsuits, "they" are taking 
some notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases that brought the issue home here in recent weeks involved Assembly 
members Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) and Rusty Areias (D-San Jose). An Assembly 
investigation corroborated most of the sexual harassment allegations against 
Conroy and his chief of staff by a former legislative aide who is suing the 
pair. Investigators found that their actions were the product "not of malice, 
but of ignorance and/or poor judgment." Areias and his chief of staff have been 
sued by a woman who claims the chief of staff made advances, and Areias ignored 
her complaints of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican staff member who says she has never encountered overt sexual 
harassment has realized that in the last couple of weeks, even men who reached 
out innocently to pat her on the back "stopped before they touched me. . . . I 
think it's made people think about what they say and do." And in any case, 
"there's so much information out there -- lawsuits, training, seminars. I'd 
expect that people who live in a fishbowl would be more careful of their 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years after she came here as a teen-age intern and witnessed some 
"troubling" antics, Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) carried the 
measure that brought the Legislature into compliance with federal harassment 
laws, beginning the internal training and disciplinary processes that are in 
effect today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, on a break from the marathon sessions, she was in her Assembly 
office tending her 3-week-old daughter -- something else that wouldn't have 
happened back then, because there were almost no women legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victims," she says, "recognize they're being taken seriously. In the early 
'70s, they weren't. Is (the climate) better? I think so. Have members and staff 
become more sensitive? I think they have. Is this still a place where it will 
continue to be a problem? I think so." 
</P>
<P>
 For Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), a legislator for more than 15 years, 
the "lifestyle" of the Legislature -- long, late hours, sometimes far from 
families, makes people "become very relaxed around one another," and there is 
casual talk at which "some people would be offended: Some of it is blunt, at 
times off-color. If you'd not been around that kind of thing, I think it could 
perhaps be somewhat intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 While women should always speak up -- "if it gets too bad I just walk out of 
the room" -- at the same time "there has to be a sensitivity to what is 
offensive, and that's why we've been trying to set the standards," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a workplace historically populated by men, Bergeson says, they were "likely 
to say anything that comes into their heads; I think that's more prevalent than 
this obvious 'If you don't go to bed with me, I'm not going to give you a 
raise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the supermarket-sweep rush to the end of the session Wednesday, two telling 
bills passed that some years ago would have been considered ridiculous, and the 
member who dared to bring them to the floor might have been laughed out of his 
gilt-and-white chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 One bill would prohibit merchants from charging more money for goods or 
services such as haircuts, clothing alterations and dry-cleaning, based solely 
on a person's sex, and would bar employers from dictating that women employees 
not wear slacks to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) wrote a bill awaiting the governor's 
signature that would allow alleged victims of sexual harassment to sue certain 
professionals, such as bankers and landlords. It soared through the Assembly 
with a good dozen votes more than its author expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that women legislators have made a vast difference in the 
climate and the substance of this place. When it comes to sexual harassment, so 
have words like "liability." 
</P>
<P>
 "The liabilities associated with these penalties can be very expensive," said 
Speier. "And the question will be raised, should the taxpayers pay for this" if 
public officials are found liable? 
</P>
<P>
 That also plays into Bob Connelly's thinking. The Assembly's chief 
administrative officer, Connelly organized the training sessions, the 
guidelines put out on yellow paper reserved for must-read matters, and the 
88-minute videotape that is required viewing for everyone from the Assembly 
Speaker on down. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that, he believes, "if people are still afraid to make complaints, 
then they haven't gotten the word, or we haven't gotten the word out as well as 
we should." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Blackshaw is a veteran women's issues activist now working for Hayden. 
She is the Senate staffer who is sorry that recent sexual harassment 
accusations are not Topic A. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no shortage of the institution saying sexual harassment is wrong, not 
to be tolerated by members or employees, but it's the follow-up . . . that's 
where they fall short. . . . If women feel they're not believed, they're less 
inclined to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Even progress, she worries, is not what it seems. "That's often what's more 
dangerous. We have this feeling that things are different, that we no longer 
tolerate that kind of behavior, but really it's just dispersed in different 
forms . . . more subtly."

JAPAN TO COMMIT $1 BILLION TO ASSUAGE 'PAIN' OF WW II; ASIA: FUNDS WILL BE 
ALLOCATED OVER NEXT 10 YEARS, PRIME MINISTER SAYS. BUT SPECIFICS ARE LACKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama formally announced Wednesday that Japan -- to 
"face squarely" its "acts of aggression" and colonialism -- will commit $1 
billion over the next 10 years to a "peace, friendship and exchange 
initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be launched in 1995, the 50th anniversary of Japan's defeat 
in World War II. It will seek to overcome the "pain" of the past and "clear up 
the future of the Asia-Pacific," he said in a statement read to reporters by 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi. 
</P>
<P>
 But the effort, at present, amounts to more of a compendium of hopes than a 
program of action. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the $1-billion commitment, the announcement said only that 
historical research by Japanese and foreign scholars, exchanges and support of 
international pushes for the advancement of women -- including vocational 
training centers -- would be carried out. No specifics were offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Igarashi repeated the government's position that all claims against Japan from 
its former enemies have been settled by peace treaties. He also said no 
official payments would be made to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But he held out the possibility that the government might help establish a 
private fund of as much as $100 million from which such compensation could be 
made. Whether to set up such a fund, however, is still being debated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups ranging from former British and Dutch prisoners of war to Korean and 
Filipino women forced to act as sex slaves for Japanese troops have condemned 
Tokyo's refusal to compensate individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama confronted the issue many times recently on a tour of several Asian 
nations, where he offered numerous apologies for Japan's wartime conduct. The 
formal announcement of the plan for Japan to make amends was expected and 
officials said they were only awaiting the Socialist prime minister's return 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there may be criticism of our plan, I hope people will give us a 
little more time to demonstrate our sincerity," Igarashi said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Foreign Ministry official said the government still has not committed itself 
to decisions on atonement plans, even though Aug. 15 next year will mark the 
50th anniversary of Japan's surrender. The diplomat told foreign correspondents 
that Murayama's announcement was timed to ensure that money for the program 
could be committed in the 1995 budget, which is now being compiled, even though 
details have yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously missing was any word on what Japan intends to do for Asian women 
-- as many as 200,000 by unofficial estimates -- recruited as "comfort women" 
for Japanese troops during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than two years have passed since Japan officially acknowledged 
its responsibility for the sex slaves, Murayama offered only another apology 
and a declaration of hope to find "an appropriate way" for the Japanese people 
to express their regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said other actions designed to make 1995 a year of reflection on the 
war will be taken later. These include some form of Japanese government 
consolation to victims of atomic bombs dropped by the United States on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

VATICAN STEPS UP ATTACKS AGAINST CAIRO CONFERENCE; POPULATION: DELEGATION WILL 
FIGHT DRAFT RESOLUTION THAT ENDORSES ABORTION RIGHTS, LOWER GROWTH RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fighting from a script written by Pope John Paul II, the Vatican on Wednesday 
fired a new broadside against a planned U.N. population conference, attacking 
the United States in general and Vice President Al Gore in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-member Vatican delegation leaves today for Cairo, carrying papal 
instructions to oppose unflaggingly a draft resolution for the Sept. 5-13 
conference that endorses abortion on demand and takes a liberal view of human 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by the United States, other governments and feminist groups around 
the world, such proposals are, nevertheless, seen by John Paul as a blatant 
assault on the sanctity of life, which he says begins at the instant of 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro, a member of the high-level 
delegation, took issue with Gore, who will head the American delegation and has 
said that the United States does not seek to proclaim a universal right to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The draft of the document, which has the U.S. Administration as its principal 
sponsor, in reality contradicts Mr. Gore," Navarro told reporters at a Vatican 
briefing. The Clinton Administration would allow American funds to flow to 
international groups that support abortion, reversing the policy of Republican 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Decrying what he called the document's attempts to pass off "social 
engineering under the guise of human rights," Navarro said Vatican delegates to 
the once-a-decade conference would seek to modify ambiguous language, 
clarifying draft phrases such as "reproductive rights" and "sexual health." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of its fiercest, most outspoken international diplomatic initiatives in 
recent years, the Vatican has repeatedly attacked the 118-page draft, which 
explores ways for slowing rapid population growth that it portrays as a brake 
on economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope himself has spoken repeatedly against draft proposals, which he says 
would encourage promiscuity and homosexuality, erode moral values and undermine 
the family. John Paul, above all, wants the conference to ban abortion as a 
means of population control. It would also be disastrous, he believes, to 
assert that abortion is a woman's fundamental right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should (the conference) give further legitimacy to the legal practice of 
abortion, humanity would suffer another great failure of rights and justice," 
the Pope said in a recent attack on the U.N. proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican sees efforts by planners, economists and aid donors to limit 
population in developing countries as "biological colonialism." It decries it 
as an effort to impose First World moral values -- or the lack of them -- on 
poorer and often more traditional Third World societies. 
</P>
<P>
 In attacking the conference, the Vatican has found common cause with some 
Islamic countries also opposing the thrust and content of the U.N. draft. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, top Islamic scholars in Saudi Arabia called on all Muslims to 
boycott the Cairo conference. The Supreme Council of Ulemas, or religious 
scholars, said in Riyadh that the "immoral and heretical" draft document 
encourages abortion, contraception, premarital sex and the spread of sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 After four days of deliberations, the scholars concluded that policies 
proposed by the document would transform Islamic society into "one of 
disease-ridden sex perverts without morals."

LONG-TERM FOOD AID FOR RWANDA SEEN; AFRICA: U.N. MISSION PREDICTS A SHARP DROP 
IN FARM OUTPUT BECAUSE OF TURMOIL, SAYS 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE WILL NEED HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.N. mission has warned of yet another bitter harvest from the murderous 
ethnic turmoil in Rwanda: catastrophic drops in farm output that necessitate 
immediate outside food aid for no less than half the population. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of genocide, civil war and a colossal exodus of refugees, this 
autumn's crop of cereals and beans in the Central African country will plummet 
to 40% of last year's total, U.N. specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequence: Farmers, orphans, the poor and disabled and members of other 
"vulnerable groups" totaling 2.5 million people will need five months of direct 
food assistance starting this month, an assessment mission of the U.N. Food and 
Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a long-term emergency," said Brenda Barton, Nairobi-based 
regional information officer for the World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts at some non-governmental aid organizations questioned the U.N. 
specialists' alarming calculations, citing the mission's own estimate that 2.2 
million Rwandans had fled their nation. That enormous outflow should mean that 
food requirements, like production, have dropped sharply in the violence-racked 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there are fewer people in the country right now," said Barton, whose 
agency functions as the U.N. system's food aid organization. "But the potential 
for people to come back is still there. And if they do, how will they survive?" 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, since a separate harvest this winter is dependent on what is 
gathered now and replanted as seed this month and in October, a drop in output 
now will ignite a chain reaction of declining food production. The U.N. report 
said that danger demands "emergency" action. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of what used to be a nearly self-sufficient agricultural sector is 
only the latest calamity to befall Rwandans. Up to half a million members of 
the country's Tutsi minority were annihilated this spring in the swiftest wave 
of genocide in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-month war, the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front defeated 
government forces and sent swarms of refugees from the Hutu majority stampeding 
from the landlocked country into Tanzania and Zaire, where they now hunker in 
reeking, disease-plagued camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined effects of lethal violence and mass fear were so potent that only 
half of the 7.9 million people living in Rwanda at the beginning of the year 
are still in their homes, the U.N. agricultural mission estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the population has been killed, it said. Along with the huge 
numbers who crossed the borders, an additional 700,000 Rwandans have been 
displaced inside their country, the specialists estimated. They put the 
country's current population at 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. agricultural specialists found in their nine-day inspection tour of 
all but one of Rwanda's 10 prefectures last month that the large-scale killings 
and refugee exodus had impeded or completely halted work in the fields. In many 
places, weeds and pests had overwhelmed the crops. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few bright spots in the report. Its authors said much of Rwanda's 
banana, root and tuber crop, including vital staples like potatoes, manioc and 
sweet potatoes, could be salvaged. But "important losses" are occurring because 
of looting and premature harvesting by people who have nothing else to eat, the 
U.N. study said. 
</P>
<P>
 It estimated banana production would drop by 27% from last year, while roots 
and tubers would decline by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Total grain imports of 156,000 tons will be required to make up this year's 
shortfall in production, the mission said. Since civil war, ethnic murder and 
refugee flight have slashed Rwanda's tea and coffee exports to negligible 
levels, "all import requirements will have to be covered by food aid," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton said the World Food Program had previously estimated the number of 
Rwandans requiring food aid at 1.5 million. Those people already receive 
assistance through the World Food Program and the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the new, higher estimate of the needy and the likelihood of a succession 
of poor harvests mean "we have a disaster facing us now, and a disaster facing 
us later," Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
 One crucial but still unknown factor in the struggle to save Rwanda's 
agricultural sector from complete collapse is how successful the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front will be in enticing Hutu refugees back to their farms and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, U.N. officials voiced hopes that farmers who fled into Zaire or 
Tanzania would return immediately and plant their winter crop before the rainy 
season begins in earnest later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the winter harvest will be disastrous and Rwanda will need another 
year's worth of emergency food aid, said Georgia Shaver, another World Food 
Program official. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not encouraging them to return so they can support the new 
government," Shaver told a news conference Monday in Rome. "We want them to 
create a healthy farming infrastructure and ensure there isn't dependency on 
food aid." 
</P>
<P>
 But World Food Program officials acknowledged they expect only half a million 
refugees to return home by the year's end.

AMERICAN ALBUM: AILING CITY IS POISED TO RECLAIM ITS FALLEN LEADER; MARION 
BARRY IS BACK FROM THE POLITICAL DEAD. WASHINGTON VOTERS COULD MAKE THE 
CONVICTED DRUG ABUSER THEIR MAYOR AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Forget Bill Clinton. Forget Oliver L. North. In this city's political boxing 
ring, there's only room for one true "Comeback Kid." Marion Barry is taking a 
shot at that title and trying to regain another one: mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving a six-month jail term for cocaine possession, the former mayor 
and current city councilman is aiming for a fourth four-year term. The 
58-year-old Democrat, claiming to have overcome his drug addiction, has emerged 
as the front-runner in the upcoming mayoral primary. But Democrats and 
Republicans alike are worried that a Barry victory could deliver another blow 
to the city's already tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics believed he was vanquished forever when the FBI videotaped him 
smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room four years ago. And Barry acknowledges 
that traveling the road to recovery has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a prizefighter," he says. "You get knocked down and you just know 
you can't win if you get up, so why get up? You've got to have a winning 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents still smart at mention of the videotape. But two years later, he 
still enjoys widespread support in most sectors of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking our message of hope, healing, recovery of our city and guns off 
the streets to the people, and it's catching on," Barry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sept. 13 election is only a primary, Washington's overwhelmingly 
Democratic electorate is virtually certain to deliver a Democratic winner the 
keys to the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cities, Barry almost certainly would be ruled out early. But he always 
has held a special place in the hearts of Washington voters, who believe his 
up-from-the-streets background enables him to empathize with common people. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't hurt to have God in your corner, either. Barry credits a "god 
force" with aiding in his recovery from cocaine addiction and emphasizes that 
he could not have returned to politics without help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people who go through what I've gone through don't come back," he said. 
"Either they just wallow in their own self-pity or they're in jail or dead or 
in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 More than demographics or faith, however, his mayoral bid is being fueled by 
bitter voter disappointment in Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, who after Barry's fall 
swept into office promising to "clean house." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly -- who won with heavy support from white and upper-class voters -- has 
presided over the city's worst-ever public housing crisis, has not been able to 
slow the urban crime wave and has entangled city finances to the point that 
Congress is threatening to withdraw federal aid if she does not improve her 
management skills. One recent poll showed her approval rating in the teens, 
dropping her to third place in the primary behind John Ray, a city councilman 
who has lost a slew of previous mayoral races. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry is trying to appeal to frustrated voters by vowing to reduce gun-related 
crime and introduce jobs initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheers may be the last thing he'll hear on Capitol Hill, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone in the federal government is excited about the prospect 
of Marion Barry's return to office," one Republican congressman said. "It would 
not send a clear signal that there is an attempt to eliminate drug use and 
crime in the district." 
</P>
<P>
 One House Democrat lamented that Barry's criticism of Kelly's financial record 
is somewhat unfair because he created many of the problems during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a Barry victory would set up prime opportunities for GOP partisans to 
bash Democrats for being soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry dismisses his Capitol Hill critics, saying they lack courage. But he 
wholeheartedly agrees with their assessment that his election would shake 
things up. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think what bothers the people on Capitol Hill is the fact that the 
D.C. government is such a mess that it's embarrassing," he says. "Since I'm 
going to straighten a lot of things out and I'm going to be a better manager 
than the one they have now, they're going to welcome me coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they do not, many of the voters who first put him in office will. 
Since he instituted a major summer jobs initiative during his first term, Barry 
has been able to count on the city's youth to campaign and vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens and residents of the city's poorer precincts have also been 
avid supporters. With promises to establish a gun court to speed processing of 
firearms violations and to treat alcohol and drug addiction as medical, rather 
than criminal, problems, he is winning their praises again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the common man's candidate," said David Williams, 51, a city vendor. "He 
came from a humble background, and he was active in the civil rights movement. 
The other candidates just don't have that background. You'll see them walking 
down the street and they're just not reachable. But I think he is."

U.S. USES TOUGHEST LANGUAGE YET ON HAITI; CARIBBEAN: OFFICIALS SAY 
MULTINATIONAL FORCE WILL BE USED EITHER IN PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO RULE BY 
DEPOSED PRESIDENT OR TO DEFEAT DICTATORIAL REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, using its most strident rhetoric so far, said 
Wednesday it will use the multinational military unit it is assembling to 
restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti either to 
keep order after a peaceful transition or to defeat and depose the island's 
dictatorial government. 
</P>
<P>
 By declaring the American government's determination to restore democracy to 
Haiti no matter what it takes, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and 
Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch seemed to cut away much of the 
Administration's room to maneuver, leaving it with no graceful way to avoid an 
invasion unless Haiti's military government, headed by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
steps down soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The multinational force is going to Haiti," Deutch said in reference to a 
U.S.-dominated army that is training at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto 
Rico. "The (only) issue is the circumstance under which that force enters 
Haiti. It could be under a permissive circumstance at the request of the 
legitimate (Aristide) government . . . or it can be under contested 
circumstances if the de facto government, the illegal government in Haiti, does 
not come to its senses." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Deutch said, the Pentagon expects to resolve the matter soon. 
Although he did not set a deadline, he said one or two weeks of training will 
be enough to prepare an invasion force after all the elements of that force are 
assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott said Washington continues to prefer a peaceful end to the crisis in 
which Cedras and his supporters agree to surrender control to Aristide, the 
winner of Haiti's only internationally certified free and fair modern 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 But he gave no indication Washington expects such an outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott and Deutch briefed reporters at the State Department one day after 
obtaining from the 11-nation Caribbean Community an endorsement of the use of 
military force to dislodge the Cedras military government. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the nations agreed to send a token contingent of 266 soldiers to join 
the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the single company of troops from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, 
Barbados and Belize, Talbott said Britain and Argentina have agreed to 
contribute naval ships and crews but no ground forces. He said the 
Administration hopes to enlist more foreign contingents but declined to say 
which countries are likely to send them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be continuing to work with our partners in the international 
coalition between now and when it is necessary and appropriate to deploy the 
(multinational force)," Talbott said. "We're very confident when the time comes 
we will have what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch said the United States hopes to enlist about 1,000 foreign troops to 
join at least 10,000 Americans. But he left little doubt that the American 
government can go ahead whenever it thinks the time is right, regardless of the 
size of foreign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch said the invasion force would be large enough and sufficiently well 
equipped to assure overwhelming superiority over the ragtag Haitian army of 
about 7,000 men. That is the best way to minimize casualties, both among 
combatants and civilians, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question the invasion will be primarily an American effort. Deutch 
said the commanders will all be Americans and American troops will lead the 
initial assault. He said "the bulk of the non-U.S. troops would be deployed 
within the first 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott said events in Cuba will not affect planning for the Haiti operation.

3 INDIAN DOCTORS SLAIN IN SOMALIA FIELD HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen opened fire on a field hospital in Somalia on Wednesday, killing three 
Indian doctors and wounding several other people, a U.N. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified attackers apparently fired a rifle grenade or a mortar at the 
hospital in Baidoa, the spokesman said.It was not immediately clear how many 
people were wounded in the attack or who was responsible for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors were part of India's U.N. peacekeeping force, but also treated 
Somali civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 22, seven Indian peacekeepers were killed and nine wounded in an 
ambush by Somali militiamen in southwestern Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 India has about 5,000 peacekeeping troops in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting between clans and the appearance of armed militiamen has increased 
since U.S. troops left Somalia in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, the U.N. Security Council agreed to reduce the U.N. 
peacekeeping force in Somalia from 18,700 troops to 17,200 by the end of this 
month, and to 15,000 by late October. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said that the size of the 
peacekeeping force in Somalia should be reduced and possibly the entire 
operation scrapped if national reconciliation in Somalia fails.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MOSCOW'S STRATEGIC FOCUS SHIFTS AS TROOPS PULL OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

 There was little breast-beating. No moaning about strategic territory lost. 
Russia's equanimity on Wednesday as it watched what some here call "The Great 
Retreat" pointed up just how deeply the Kremlin's foreign and military doctrine 
have changed since the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a few spasms of nostalgia, Moscow marched away from the German bases 
that for decades served as the beefed-up vanguard for a possible land war in 
Europe. President Boris N. Yeltsin called the Russian withdrawal "natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the final pullout from the Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia raised 
hackles here, and that was not because of the land but because of the people 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The geopolitical situation has changed radically and there is no more threat 
from the West," said Sergei Blagovolin, a top Russian national security 
analyst. "But I am really worried about the uncertainty of the fate of the 
Russians left in the Baltics." 
</P>
<P>
 The scenarios that most concern Moscow's strategic planners do not focus on 
East-West war these days, but rather on potential threats to Russians in other 
former Soviet republics that could force Moscow, still a nuclear-armed colossus 
with nearly 2 million troops, to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, according to its 1994 military doctrine, has no enemies. But, as 
Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev put it, "It has its vital interests. We are 
ready to defend them and we are capable of doing this," even if that involves 
stepping over the border. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little of the black-and-white clarity of the Cold War here, more of 
the murkiness of the era that follows. But as vital interests are being 
defined, they appear to boil down to defending rights of Russians in the 
"near-abroad" -- former Soviet republics -- and maintaining powerful Russian 
clout while seeking stability throughout the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia and Estonia, where sizable Russian minorities have been denied full 
citizenship rights, may be just the tinderbox Moscow fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine this scenario, said Dmitry Evstafiev, a military analyst at the 
prestigious USA-Canada Institute in Moscow. With the last Russian soldier gone, 
Baltic parliaments refuse to ratify agreements with Moscow to play fair with 
their Russian populations and instead appear to prepare for "ethnic cleansing" 
in heavily Russian areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's political opponents "call to sweep the Baltics into the sea," 
Evstafiev projected further. "Yeltsin puts the troops of the Leningrad military 
district on alert, international pressure doesn't help. . . . " And large-scale 
confrontation results. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, is a far-fetched, worst-case scenario. But it seems far 
likelier now than a European land war. The 25 million Russians who ended up in 
the "near-abroad" are the only foreign policy issue that has real political 
resonance here. And many Russians are feeling decidedly hostile toward the 
Baltics, Evstafiev noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But aside from the potential tensions there, Russia's strategic view has 
narrowed to the point that the other top concerns stemming from the Great 
Retreat are mainly domestic. 
</P>
<P>
 First on the list is the shortage of housing for returning officers and of 
military infrastructure for troops, some of whom have reportedly found 
themselves newly deployed in empty fields. Estimates vary, but apparently 
50,000 officers' families have no apartments in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very likely that the slowness in addressing the housing issue will 
eventually lead to open discontent among officers when the troops withdrawn 
from the Baltics and Germany arrive here," Col. Yuri Deryugin, a military 
sociologist, wrote last week in Nezivisimaya Gazeta. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted eventual "social upheaval" in the Russian armed forces. He noted 
that the Great Retreat would worsen tensions in the army, not only because of 
housing problems, but because of a special virus that the soldiers from Germany 
are carrying: virulent military corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 As Russian and German sources describe them, soldiers returning from Germany 
have been corrupted to the toes of their boots -- if they haven't sold them 
yet. They reportedly engaged in rackets ranging from selling off duty-free 
cigarettes to hawking arms to neo-Nazis. The corruption is believed to have 
penetrated even to the top brass of what was known as the Western Group of 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these bootleggers are returning home -- and Deryugin warned that a 
"military commercial clan" may now be unleashed on the army. 
</P>
<P>
 If the withdrawal is sounding few alarms otherwise, that is because Russia, as 
it has defined its new interests, is looking largely south and east for new 
threats to itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia retains bases or facilities in almost all the former Soviet republics. 
Ukraine remains a particular source of anxiety, because of the restive Russian 
population of the Crimea and because of the chance of eventual civil war 
between its Russian-leaning east and Ukrainian nationalists in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Caucasus and Central Asia, Russia is especially assertive about 
maintaining its troop presence, usually arguing that it must preserve order 
near its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Caucasus politicians, particularly in Georgia and Azerbaijan, believe 
that Russia purposely foments conflicts in areas where it wants an excuse to 
bring in forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In their view, Russia may be ending its half-century occupation of Eastern 
Europe and the Baltics, but its dominion in the south has lasted centuries and 
will not prove so transient.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: PROPOSED GAG ORDER POSES THREAT FAR BEYOND SIMPSON 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If my only connection to the newspaper was as a reader, I'd applaud Judge 
Lance A. Ito for trying to dam the flow of news leaks that have helped make the 
O.J. Simpson case such a circus. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the private lives of victims and the accused splashed in a 
lurid and often erroneous manner and reading and watching stories attributed 
only to various unnamed sources, I'd cheer his proposed order restricting cops, 
defense attorneys, prosecutors and others from talking about the case, and 
limiting access to legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't simply be the bad taste many of the bad stories have left in my 
mouth, although that would be a factor. Most important, I would wonder, as 
Judge Ito did in court Wednesday, how a fair trial is possible, how 12 
impartial jurors could be selected, amid this unprecedented torrent of news. 
</P>
<P>
 But my perspective as a journalist is different. I see judicial gags as real 
threats that go far beyond the Simpson case. They interfere with political 
debate, investigations into government corruption and even with the rights of 
the defendants the orders are supposed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone I've talked to says Ito is a terrific judge. He's a clear-thinking, 
intelligent jurist who proved his ability to handle tough cases when he 
presided over Charles Keating's fraud trial. He also has a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was easy to sympathize with him Tuesday as he wrestled with an old 
conflict in American law, trying to reconcile the demands of the 1st Amendment, 
guaranteeing freedom of speech, and the 6th Amendment, which assures defendants 
a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He felt the 1st Amendment side -- the reporters and the prosecution and 
defense leakers who have been feeding them -- was overwhelming the 6th 
Amendment forces, burying them with stories that will prejudice the minds of 
potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The overflow of information, he said, has been heightened because of the 
proliferation of news coverage and the enhanced ability and desire of 
television to cover big crime trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito was especially bothered by the leaks. I don't blame him. Whatever ethics 
lessons are taught in law school, they don't include a warning against leaking. 
Give a lawyer a piece of the Simpson case and he or she becomes a sieve. Even 
Ito's proposed gag order, which he wouldn't give to news organizations, leaked 
into print. Sounding annoyed, he told how he'd picked up The Times Tuesday 
morning, and read what he had wanted to keep confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's take the issue beyond Judge Ito and his particular frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 What he sought in his proposed order was total control over what anyone 
involved in the case said or wrote -- over all documents, evidence, lawyers' 
remarks, just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, Ito seems to be a fine judge. But some of his colleagues don't 
measure up to that standard. Some are political hacks who got their jobs by 
raising money for the governor that appointed them. Some, while qualified, are 
part of the fairly small layer of business people, politicians and powerful 
lawyers who shape events around here. 
</P>
<P>
 If a reporter reveals government corruption, resulting in an indictment, a 
judge hostile to the press could impose a gag order, sharply limiting the 
press's ability to poke deeper into the case and find out if more people were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Gag orders have been used to muzzle criticism of public prosecutors and limit 
debate on public policy. In the federal trial of the police officers accused of 
beating Rodney King, Judge John G. Davies ordered defense attorney Harland W. 
Braun to stop "publicly impugning the motives" of federal prosecutors in the 
case. The order was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with such orders, Braun told me, was that "in this country, we 
decide fundamental issues of public policy in the courts. The King case 
involved a huge public issue." By attempting to silence him, Judge Davies was 
cutting off Braun's right to speak out on public policy, and to criticize the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, gag orders, although supposedly designed to protect defendants, often 
end up harming them. Simpson's attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, made that point in 
court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said that in the next four weeks, "we understand that numerous media 
are going to be airing various shows, docudramas, interviews with family 
members." A gag order, he said, would prevent the defense "from giving any kind 
of response at all," even though "the majority of people who appear on 
television " are prosecution witnesses or associated in some way with the 
victims of the crime. "If false information is disseminated and we don't have 
any opportunity to reply," Shapiro said, Simpson is prevented from getting a 
fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's motive obviously is to protect potential jurors from news manipulation 
by both sides. But they have already been inundated, and so what. Kelli L. 
Sager, an attorney representing The Times and other news organizations, noted 
that widespread publicity didn't prevent acquittals of auto executive John 
DeLorean on charges of smuggling cocaine or William Kennedy Smith, who was 
tried for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Secrecy is the real danger in government. It breeds inaccuracy and rumor, and 
promotes illegality and injustice. As Sager told Judge Ito, "More speech is the 
answer, not less speech."

SIMPSON TEAM SEEKS ACCESS TO POLICE FILE ON UNSOLVED SLAYING IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their effort to show that O.J. Simpson is not a killer, his defense lawyers 
want to look at an unsolved murder that has similarities to the slayings of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in that case was Brett Cantor, a popular young underground music 
executive found dead July 30, 1993, at his home in Hollywood with his throat 
slashed and his body punctured with knife wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with that case said there are also a number of possible links 
between Cantor and the two people Simpson is accused of killing. Simpson's 
ex-wife frequented a nightclub for which Cantor did music promotions and 
Goldman once worked there part time, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers want to look at the so-called "murder book," or the Los 
Angeles Police Department investigative file, in the Cantor case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, after listening to the 
defense lawyers tell him privately why the Cantor case might be relevant, 
agreed to review the file himself to determine if the defense should be given 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a link" between the two cases? said one defense source, after Ito 
made that decision. "We don't know. But there could be."

JURY CONVICTS SACRAMENTO TEEN-AGER FOR SEVERAL RACIALLY MOTIVATED FIREBOMBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Sacramento man described by his attorney as a racist has been 
convicted on five of 12 felony charges involving a series of racially motivated 
firebombings last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Campos showed no emotion when the jury returned its verdict Monday 
after four days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The conviction on five counts carries a maximum of 14 years in prison, 
authorities said. Superior Court Judge James Ford declared a mistrial on the 
remaining seven counts and dismissed the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors did not say whether they would seek a retrial on the remaining 
charges, which include one count of attempted murder against Sacramento City 
Councilman Jimmie Yee. Campos was convicted of firebombing the Asian American 
councilman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on arson and related charges involving bombings of the 
Temple B'Nai Israel and the offices of the Sacramento National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People and the Japanese American Citizens League. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos was found guilty on two counts involving the firebombing of a state 
Department of Fair Employment and Housing office and on two counts of 
possession of destructive devices. Sentencing is Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called 50 witnesses in the case, but Campos' attorney, Michael 
Brady, rested without calling any witnesses. He contended that prosecutors did 
not prove their case and that "even racists are entitled to justice."

BOBBITT IS JAILED FOR BATTERING EX-FIANCEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt was convicted Wednesday of misdemeanor domestic battery 
against his former fiancee by a judge who said Bobbitt has an "attitude 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice of the Peace William Jansen sentenced Bobbitt to 60 days in jail, then 
suspended 45 days of the sentence.Bobbitt was led from the courtroom in 
handcuffs to begin serving his sentence immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt also was sentenced to six months probation and ordered to attend 
impulse control and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe you have an attitude problem," Jansen told Bobbitt. "Your 
attitude problem is caused by your drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt, 27, was charged with striking Kristina Elliott, 21, a former exotic 
dancer he met while in Las Vegas on a publicity tour. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces another trial Sept. 26 on a second domestic battery charge involving 
Elliott. In that case, prosecutors say, he slammed Elliott against a wall 
during an argument May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt became famous in June, 1993, when his wife, Lorena, sliced off his 
penis while he slept in their Virginia home. She said she did it because 
Bobbitt had sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt's penis was reattached surgically and he was acquitted of marital 
sexual abuse in November. A jury in January found Lorena Bobbitt innocent by 
reason of insanity of mutilating her husband. The couple's divorce is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Bobbitt appealed for leniency, saying all the facts did not come 
out at the two-day trial.

CLINTON HAS LITTLE TO OFFER CUBA AT TALKS; MIGRATION: NEGOTIATIONS ON REFUGEE 
CRISIS BEGIN TODAY. THE PRESIDENT IS RELYING ON CASTRO FOR RELIEF, BUT HOLDS 
OUT ONLY MINOR CONCESSIONS IN RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Administration begins talks with Fidel Castro's Cuba today, praying that 
Castro will bail President Clinton out of the crisis over uncontrolled 
migration from the Caribbean island -- but also insisting that it will not 
offer Castro any major political incentive to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and State Department officials said that U.S. envoy Michael Skol 
has been instructed to offer easier legal immigration for discontented Cubans 
and possible relaxation of new sanctions that Clinton imposed last month after 
Castro allowed thousands of his people to head for Florida on rafts and small 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the eve of the talks, they also reassured Cuban American leaders that 
the Administration will not lift any part of the U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba or offer Castro any other form of normal relations -- even if the Cuban 
leader cooperates on the migration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not prepared to lift the embargo or enter negotiations until Cuba 
solves its own problems by instituting democracy and human rights," a senior 
White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that Bill Clinton is resolute on this issue," said Rep. Robert 
G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), a leading advocate of tough measures against Cuba. "He 
has shown that he is firm on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials telephoned Torricelli and Jorge Mas Canosa, the 
powerful president of the Cuban American National Foundation, to reassure them 
that the negotiations would be restricted to immigration and would not stray 
into the broader issues of trade or political relations with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the resulting negotiation stance appears paradoxical: Clinton wants 
Castro to use his police to stop would-be refugees, even as the United States 
maintains sanctions on Cuba's collapsing economy -- the problem that produced 
the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 And the flow of refugees increased again on Wednesday. The Coast Guard 
reported that its cutters picked up 2,044 Cubans by 6 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. position is based on domestic political considerations as much as 
any foreign policy judgment. In his 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton 
actively sought the support of Cuban Americans in Florida, and won praise from 
Mas, a conservative Republican, for his anti-Castro stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after Clinton reversed U.S. immigration policy and barred raft 
people from entering the country, he invited Mas, other Cuban American leaders 
and Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles to an unusual meeting at the White House. He 
asked their policy recommendations and promised them that he would not relax 
the U.S. trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles, a Democrat in a potentially tough reelection race, has also been 
seeking Cuban American support -- and won a considerable boost from the 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Americans make up only about 8% of Florida's voters, but that is not the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats in Florida don't expect to win the Cuban American vote but they all 
want to force their Republican opponents to spend time and money pinning down 
the constituency," noted Robert Jaffee of the Mason-Dixon Poll in Miami. 
"Clinton didn't win Florida in 1992 but he forced (then-President) George Bush 
to spend more time here than he wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 And, one Administration official noted, there's another reason: "Florida is 
one of the money centers of the Democratic Party. You can't raise money there 
unless you campaign there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's Cuba policy is not based solely on domestic political 
judgments. Many officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
have argued that it would be a mistake to offer political concessions to Castro 
in exchange for help on the migration issue -- because it might encourage him 
to continue using refugee flows to influence U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have also been debating the idea of offering Castro a 
gradual relaxation of sanctions in response to specific political and economic 
reforms in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher referred to that idea in a television interview last weekend, 
saying: "If he does move toward democratic change in Cuba, the United States 
will respond in a carefully calibrated way." 
</P>
<P>
 But other Administration officials quickly disavowed the idea, saying that the 
secretary of state had not meant to send a signal of impending concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leading members of Congress have criticized the Administration's position 
as too rigid -- including some conservative Republicans like Sens. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.) and Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.). The chairmen of the two 
congressional committees on foreign affairs, Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) and 
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), have also called for more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the migration crisis has given their views new exposure in a 
national debate on Cuba policy, it has not appreciably changed the political 
climate in Florida -- or on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We passed the Cuban Democracy Act (which toughened U.S. economic sanctions) 
in 1992 by a majority of two-thirds," said Torricelli, the law's principal 
author. "If we needed another bill, we'd get more votes now than we had then." 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.S. base in Guantanamo, Cuba, on Wednesday, the evacuation of 2,200 
military spouses and children, schoolteachers and other civilian workers and 
their dependents began. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation was spurred by fears there could be escapes or riots at the 
growing refugee camps as well as the need to relieve the strains from the new 
residents on the small base's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the evacuees were bitter. As they prepared to board the charter flight 
for Norfolk, Va., three sisters whose parents are in the Navy wore protest 
T-shirts that read: "American refugee from Cuba" and "I am a dislocated, 
relocated, evacuated, unemployed Gitmo resident." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard. All of a sudden you have to leave," said Kia Sawyers, 20. "It's 
disrupting my life. . . . They spare no expense on the immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Cubans were seriously injured Wednesday outside the U.S. Navy base at 
Guantanamo Bay while crossing a minefield between U.S. and Cuban territory, the 
Pentagon reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were among a group of 28 would-be refugees who tried to walk onto 
the base, where refugees picked up at sea are being detained. They were stopped 
at the base fence by U.S. Marines and told to return to Cuba, in keeping with 
the Marine's "standing guard orders," the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred as the group tried to recross the minefield. The Coast 
Guard said that it plans to transport all three to Miami for treatment. One 
victim lost his leg between the ankle and knee, the Pengaton said.

SCIENTISTS FIND DEFECTIVE GENE LINKED TO SKIN CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists have identified a defective gene that appears to cause an inherited 
tendency to the deadly skin cancer melanoma and may also play a role in 
non-inherited melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
 In its normal state, the gene acts as a brake on cancer. But people who 
inherit a defective version apparently lose part of the protection, making them 
unusually vulnerable to melanoma, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 32,000 melanoma cases and nearly 7,000 melanoma deaths are expected in 
the United States this year. Only about 10% of melanoma occurs in people with 
an inherited tendency and it is unclear what percentage of inherited cases are 
because of the gene. 
</P>
<P>
 Defective versions of the gene may also be involved in many, or maybe even 
most, cases of non-inherited melanoma, researchers said. In those cases, the 
gene would be inherited in normal form but later damaged by sunlight or other 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Studying the gene may eventually lead to better treatments for the 
non-inherited disease, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 More immediately, the discovery of a susceptibility gene could be used to 
screen for people at risk for melanoma. They could be counseled to take steps 
such as limiting exposure to the sun, keeping track of possibly precancerous 
moles and using sunscreen, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The normal gene tells the body how to make a protein called p16, which helps 
regulate cell division. Prior studies suggested the p16 gene discourages 
tumors. Previous studies also indicated defective versions play a role in 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new work is reported in the September issue of the journal Nature Genetics 
by two independent teams of researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 One study was done by Nicholas Dracopoli of the National Center for Human 
Genome Research, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., 
and colleagues at NIH and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 They found nine of 18 melanoma-prone families they screened showed defects in 
the p16 gene that appeared related to the disease. In the nine families, the 
gene was defective in 33 out of 36 people with melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The second study was done by Alexander Kamb of Myriad Genetics Inc. in Salt 
Lake City with scientists at the University of Utah and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 They studied 13 families who already appeared to have a predisposition to 
melanoma from some abnormality in the neighborhood of the p16 gene. The 
researchers found a defective p16 gene in two of the families. They found no 
evidence of a defective p16 gene in 38 other melanoma-prone families. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Utah and NIH studies "really support each other, 
fundamentally," Kamb said, noting that two types of p16 gene defects appeared 
in both studies.

 Rapid job growth since President Clinton took office has failed to offset 
growing wage and income inequality in the United States, as workers lacking 
advanced education and uneasy with new technology find themselves locked out of 
the middle class, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the changing nature of the workplace on the eve of the Clinton 
Administration's second Labor Day in office, Reich said that Americans who are 
not computer literate and do not possess other advanced skills have been walled 
off from the benefits of the economic recovery. In fact, he offered a decidedly 
mixed assessment of the status of the American work force, one far less upbeat 
than most economic pronouncements by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few months, the White House has sought to focus public attention 
on the nation's overall employment and economic gains that have come since 
January, 1993, and senior officials repeatedly have complained that the 
President has not received enough credit for his handling of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Reich did note that the Administration deserves praise for the 4.1 
million jobs generated since Clinton took office, the emphasis in his speech 
was still on the deep-seated structural problems in the American work force, 
which Clinton hopes to address with new training and educational initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich, in a speech to the Center for National Policy here, warned that the 
growing ranks of poorly educated workers is creating a new, "anxious class" of 
Americans whose traditional status as full-fledged members of the middle class 
has been eroded, perhaps permanently. High school dropouts no longer can expect 
to move easily into suburban lives on paychecks from high-paying assembly line 
jobs and often find themselves thrown back down the economic ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental fault line running through today's work force is based on 
education and skills," Reich said. "Well-educated and skilled workers are 
prospering. Those whose skills are out of date or out of sync with industrial 
change anxiously contemplate their prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich also noted that the "computer revolution" has deepened existing 
divisions within the work force. Two-thirds of college graduates use computers 
at work, compared with only one-third of high school graduates and fewer than 1 
in 10 high-school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the educational and technological demands of the new American 
workplace are driving a wedge between the haves and the have-nots in the 
economy. In 1979, a male college graduate earned 49% more than a male with only 
a high school degree. By 1992, that gap had grown to 83%. 
</P>
<P>
 "More recent data are not available, but there is no reason to believe this 
trend toward inequality has been reversed," Reich said. "At every level of 
education and training, the pattern holds: The higher the skill level, the 
higher the earnings, and the gap has been growing." 
</P>
<P>
 In a thinly veiled criticism of the Federal Reserve, Reich also complained 
that it is wrong for policy-makers to worry that the rapid pace of job creation 
over the last year is generating inflationary pressures in the economy. "In a 
seeming paradox of today's economic news, financial markets fret that 
unemployment is too low to contain inflation, even while 8 million American 
workers remain jobless," Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve officials privately have argued that the unemployment rate is 
now so low that it has forced them to raise interest rates to avoid an 
inflationary flare-up. The nation's central bank has hiked interest rates five 
times this year in its controversial, preemptive strike on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the central bank now believe, in fact, that the unemployment rate 
cannot go much below 6% without resulting in a threat from rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's jobless rate in July was 6.1%, and so Fed officials believe the 
rate has just about fallen to the level at which further reductions will lead 
to rising inflation -- what economists call the "natural rate of unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reich said that the Fed's inflation-fighting strategy ignores the fact 
that a "wasted work force is walled off by skill barriers from the leading 
edges of the economy where capacity constraints loom." 
</P>
<P>
 In a rebuke to the Fed's concept of a "natural rate of unemployment," Reich 
added: "There is no fixed number of good jobs to be parceled out, nor any 
natural limit to the ingenuity of the human mind and the new products and 
services it can concoct." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich's indirect attacks on the Federal Reserve seemed to put him sharply at 
odds with the White House, which has tried to avoid publicly criticizing the 
nation's central bank for fear of losing credibility on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Administration economists, led by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who 
chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, generally agree with the 
Fed that there is a "natural rate of unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson argues that the rate may be slightly lower -- around 5.7% -- but has 
refused to complain about the Fed's increasing reliance on that barometer.

MAN ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON RIGHTS PIONEER ROSA PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected in Tuesday night's attack on civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks 
was captured at a grocery store Wednesday by several neighborhood residents who 
recognized him from composite sketches and held him until police arrived to 
make an arrest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been confirmed through independent evidence that the person we have in 
custody is the person who is responsible for the break-in and the assault on 
Ms. Parks," Deputy Police Chief Benny Napoleon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also should be noted that this person is also responsible for, we believe, 
at least two other break-ins and assaults on elderly women in the same area." 
His identity was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the arrest, Parks said the assault and robbery at her home won't 
slow her down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bruised. I believe I can go on with what I planned to do," said 
Parks, who is active in the community, speaking at youth events and advocating 
nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, 81, is known as the "mother of the civil rights movement" for her 
refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955. 
Her arrest triggered a 381-day boycott of city buses and sparked the modern 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 She described in detail Wednesday how a black man knocked down her door late 
Tuesday before beating and robbing her. 
</P>
<P>
 The man never indicated that he knew who she was, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she went upstairs to get some cash, he followed, demanded more money and 
began to strike her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If you don't give me more then I'm going to have to hurt you,' " 
Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man left immediately after Parks gave him the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks was treated for bruises to her face and chest, then spent the night at 
the house of her executive assistant, who lives across the street. Police are 
providing security for an indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' executive assistant, Elaine Steele, said messages were coming in for 
her from as far away as Japan. "They're calling from Phoenix, Australia, 
Alaska," she said. "It's amazing the outpouring of support."

SYSTEM TO MEASURE FRUGALITY IN CONGRESS; CAPITOL: COMPUTERIZED PROGRAM TO RANK 
LEGISLATORS BY THEIR SPENDING HABITS IS UNVEILED BY CONSERVATIVE GROUP. CRITICS 
CONTEND IT WILL GIVE DISTORTED DATA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new computer-linked system that will show those in Congress who have been 
most inclined to vote for spending programs as well as those who have most 
often voted for budget cutting will be unveiled today by the 
conservative-oriented National Taxpayers Union Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex ratings system, known as Votetally, makes available for the first 
time a detailed breakdown of Senate and House voting records to computer users 
and could influence the perennial battles over deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Votetally is designed to track the cost of each bill approved by the House or 
Senate and rank members of Congress on the net amount of spending and 
budget-cutting for which they voted during the 103rd Congress. Its scoring, 
however, is sure to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 The amounts of most spending increases are based on estimates by the 
Congressional Budget Office but in some cases the accounting is complicated. 
Supporters of the defense authorization bill, for instance, were cited for 
additional spending since the final version of that measure restored funds that 
had been reduced in an earlier stage of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics contended that the new score card will give a distorted view of 
congressional actions, its sponsors argued that it will provide the first fair 
evaluation of lawmakers' decisions on spending or reductions in federal 
outlays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give hyper-accountability and drastically reduce the power of the 
(Democratic) leadership and of interest groups," said Paul Hewitt, executive 
director of the foundation who devised the ratings system that will be 
available in a few weeks on CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Chapman (D-Tex.), often regarded as a moderate, was listed as the top 
spender in the House while Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) had the 
best record for economizing of the 432 members studied. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, it was Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) who topped the spending 
list, while Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) came in last -- or first in terms of 
frugality. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman issued an instant rebuttal, declaring that the foundation based its 
ranking of him mainly on his vote against President Clinton's budget reduction 
and tax increase bill along with his vote for the defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a pity that a group calling itself a taxpayers' union salivates so 
strongly for tax increases and the complete crippling of national defense," 
Chapman said. "I regret the National Taxpayers Union believes (that) we should 
tax more and cut national defense to virtually zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the first report indicated that Congress was twice as likely 
to increase spending as to reduce it with a typical member voting for 81.7% of 
all increases in federal outlays but favoring only 48.7% of proposed 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 More surprisingly, however, the voting breakdown indicated that Southern 
Democrats and Republicans were more than twice as likely to be among the top 50 
on the spending list than lawmakers from other parts of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In another unexpected twist, members of the Conservative Democratic Forum 
showed higher average spending levels than members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, traditionally regarded as the most liberal group in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic congressional aides, who asked not to be identified, challenged the 
methodology of the Votetally rankings, contending that voting for funds to run 
the government was not wasteful as the ratings implied. 
</P>
<P>
 But the aides acknowledged that the specific placement of House and Senate 
members could be politically damaging, anyway, since it is likely to put 
lawmakers on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real easy hit for a regional reporter," said one former press aide to 
a Democratic member of Congress. "It puts you in a box." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman J. Ornstein, a specialist in congressional affairs for the American 
Enterprise Institute, said he was skeptical about ratings systems devised by 
advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system does not take into account votes for tax breaks, he said, 
although they represent a form of government spending because of a loss of 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can use this (system) to gauge the hypocrisy levels, that has more 
value to it," Ornstein said. "Many members call themselves budget-cutters but 
don't vote that way and the hypocrisy, I think, is more likely on the 
conservative side." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the ratings are available to computer users, Hewitt suggested, many more 
citizens will be sending electronic mail to members of Congress that will slow 
the federal spending spiral.

L.A. EXECUTIVE EXPECTED TO GET HELMICK'S IOC SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch probably will 
recommend that James L. Easton, president of archery's international 
federation, fill the U.S. vacancy in the IOC, sources close to Samaranch said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Samaranch endorsement would virtually ensure Easton's election by the IOC's 
89 members Monday. If this occurs, both IOC representatives in the United 
States will be from Los Angeles. Anita DeFrantz was elected in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaranch was expected to meet with U.S. Olympic Committee officials at the 
conclusion of the Olympic Centennial Congress' second session Wednesday night 
to inform them of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, USOC President LeRoy Walker presented Samaranch with a list of four 
preferred candidates that included former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations 
Andrew Young, USOC Executive Director Harvey Schiller, USOC Vice President 
Michael Lenard and International Swimming Federation Vice President Ross Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaranch expanded the search to include the three international federation 
presidents from the United States -- Easton, George Killian of basketball and 
Don Porter of softball. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, sources said, it was Easton's involvement with a sports federation 
that earned him Samaranch's support over Young, chairman of Atlanta's 
organizing committee for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
 In step with the Congress' theme of unity, Samaranch has promised to give 
federations more representation within the IOC. Of 10 members due to be elected 
Monday, he said this week that six will be presidents of international 
federations. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been so much political infighting among candidates for those 10 
positions and their supporters that Samaranch has threatened to postpone the 
election until next year. That, sources said, would be the only obstacle 
preventing Easton from becoming an IOC member Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would be frustrating for those involved with the Olympic movement in 
the United States, which has been without a second IOC member since Robert 
Helmick resigned under pressure amid a conflict-of-interest inquiry in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton, 59, is president of a $100-million-a-year international sporting goods 
manufacturer, James D. Easton, Inc. and Easton Aluminum, Inc. of Van Nuys. 
Started by his father, the company was initially known for the aluminum arrows 
it manufactured but has diversified under Easton's leadership to produce ice 
hockey sticks, baseball and softball bats, golf club shafts, ski poles and 
bicycle tubing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like DeFrantz, Easton was an official with the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing 
Committee in 1984. Besides his duties as commissioner of archery, he also was 
mayor of the athletes' village at his alma mater, UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected in 1989 as president of FITA, archery's international federation, he 
introduced changes to the competition that are credited with persuading the IOC 
that the sport should not be considered for elimination from the Olympics.

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; CLASS OF THE AFC RESIDES IN L.A.; OVERVIEW: 
EVERYBODY ELSE IS TRYING TO CATCH UP TO AL DAVIS AND THE RAIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, but it has been a difficult summer for the AFC brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to hold a longtime enemy up to the light, they have examined him with 
trembling hands. 
</P>
<P>
 They have marveled at his timelessness, chuckled at his peculiarities, become 
quietly outraged at his efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to look anymore without screaming, they have carefully put him down. 
Wiped their forehead. Swallowed hard. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have said it: 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis was right.  
</P>
<P>
 They have said it even though they would no sooner admit that they hate their 
coach, love their stadium lease or have made a first-round mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Davis was right.  
</P>
<P>
 They have said it not with words, but things far more lasting, such as roster 
shakeups, free-agent signings and draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the only way to explain the foolishness that has occurred in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The furiousness in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive shakeup in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The panic in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hand-wringing everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Raiders representing everybody's clear favorite to return to the 
Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years, everybody in the conference wants to 
look just like them. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of scorning him, the AFC inhabitants really do want to be like Al. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a frightening thought, really. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of an entire professional football conference walking around in shiny 
black shoes and white socks, and slicked hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of men from every part of the country speaking in southern accents. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, appearance is not what they are imitating. 
</P>
<P>
 Football philosophy is. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning their backs on the previously popular short passing game, conference 
powerhouses are adopting offenses that can be described in two words: Go deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Where complicated pass rushes and zone coverages were once the rage, a more 
primitive directive is popping up in AFC playbooks: Kill the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 For 31 years, Al Davis has subscribed to those beliefs. But lately, as his 
team has gone 2-5 in playoff games since its last Super Bowl victory in January 
1984, nobody has paid him much attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, what with it being hard to miss a bomb from Jeff Hostetler to Tim 
Brown. Or a sack by Anthony Smith. Or Terry McDaniel climbing into the face 
mask of Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams have noticed, and been put on notice. And one by one, they have taken 
steps to either imitate the Raiders or, at the very least, slow them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this be done in the next six months? No idea. But isn't this a lot more 
fun to discuss than whether the Bills can go to a fifth consecutive Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 A rundown of those with the best chance to outdo the Raiders at their own 
game: FOSTERING AN ATTITUDE 
</P>
<P>
 Circle Nov. 27 on your calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Then put a big red slash through it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the day the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the one Raider game you don't want to miss but shouldn't be caught 
dead attending. A good day to find a bar with an NFL satellite contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Steelers came to town, in 1990, the violence was so bad that 
somebody was carried from the game in a coma. Not a player, a fan . 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it could get even bloodier. And we're not even talking about the 
end zone seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers knew they had to get faster, so they dumped most of their 
terrible wide receivers and made Colorado's Charles Johnson their first-round 
draft choice. Johnson caught a couple of passes in traffic during the team's 
first workout and has been a starter ever since. With good progress from former 
third-round pick Andre Hastings on the other side, the Steelers now believe 
they can sprint with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 They could already punch and kick with anyone. Linebackers Greg Lloyd and 
Kevin Greene are plain mean. Cornerback Rod Woodson is the game's best when 
Deion Sanders is on a baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Smith and Chester McGlockton won't easily run past the likes of 
tackles John Jackson and Leon Searcy, or the game's best center, Demontti 
Dawson. Then there is the one thing the Steelers have that the Raiders don't. 
His name is Barry Foster, and don't think Al Davis wasn't dying to acquire him 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to take a deep breath and get ready to jump back on the roller 
coaster again," Steeler Coach Bill Cowher said. "Everybody has stepped it up." 
THEY NEED MORE THAN MARINO 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Dolphin fans have spent the summer wondering about the return of 
quarterback Dan Marino from an Achilles' tendon injury that sidelined him most 
of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 They should have been worrying more about a guy named Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphin season collapsed last season not after Marino departed in the 
fifth game, but after cornerback Troy Vincent left on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins didn't win a game after Vincent tore knee ligaments against the 
Steelers with three games remaining. He recently returned to the lineup in the 
Dolphins' fourth exhibition game and hopes to be ready to start the season in a 
revamped defensive backfield with new safeties Gene Atkins from the New Orleans 
Saints and Michael Stewart from the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Dolphins to compete with the Raiders -- they play in Miami on Oct. 
16 -- that defense may need one more man. His identity can be discerned by 
looking at the "Prime Time Bucket" hanging from a locker room bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphin players so desperately want to sign free agent Deion Sanders, they 
are taking up a collection to help his salary fit under the cap. THE LESS, THE 
BETTER 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills shouldn't feel that they have to catch the Raiders after 
defeating them in the AFC semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did win by only six points. And they were trailing until the final 12 
minutes. And the Raiders shot themselves in the foot, once again, with many 
silly penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders would win that game if it were played today, particularly in warm 
weather, which is what they'll play in this January. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they will lose home-field advantage during the regular season because the 
AFC East is no longer easy street. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of salary-cap restrictions, their best attempt at keeping up with the 
rest of the conference this summer was to move Andre Reed from the slot to true 
wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantages of his quickness are far outweighed by the disadvantages of 
losing key players to the salary cap, including Pro Bowl offensive lineman 
Howard Ballard and Pro Bowl cornerback Nate Odomes. ROCKY MOUNTAIN PSYCH JOB 
</P>
<P>
 We know now why the Denver Broncos did so much to improve their offense, 
acquiring receivers Anthony Miller and Mike Pritchard and running back Leonard 
Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Because with the horrible defense they have assembled, they are going to 
require 50 points to beat the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos acquired cornerbacks Ben Smith and Ray Crockett, but everywhere 
else, there are holes. While spending this summer sparring with the Raiders 
over Tim Brown, the Broncos should have been tracking down then-retired Scott 
Davis or soon-to-be-moved Greg Townsend. ALL CHARGED UP 
</P>
<P>
 Their offensive line was finally starting to block people. Their starting 
quarterback was sound for the first time in more than a year. Their defense was 
inspired again. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the San Diego Chargers thought they needed one more part to start 
the season with a finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 But $850,000 later, they realized that part was not wide receiver Vance 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, slowed by age and a broken ankle, was paid $425,000 per exhibition 
season catch. He has been the Chargers' only recent mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 With Marion Butts gone, running back Natrone Means will become a superstar. 
Quarterback Stan Humphries has inexperienced targets in Shawn Jefferson, Mark 
Seay and Tony Martin but has shown he can work veteran magic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the AFC, there will be no other serious contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, maybe Houston, but then, Haywood Jeffires has jokingly referred to Oiler 
quarterback Cody Carlson as a "mama's boy." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't start talking about the Kansas City Chiefs. At least not until it's 
certain how many games Joe Montana will play and how well Marcus Allen will 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals have no chance at anything but last place, yet they 
will capture the national stage at least once, in the conference's most serious 
regular-season game. It will be played in Cincinnati on Oct. 2, when Don 
Shula's Dolphins play son Dave's Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time in major professional sports history that a father 
and son will compete against each other as head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Don has 327 career victories, the all-time high. Dave has eight. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave could have bigger numbers when it comes to the support of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good time talking about it this summer," Dave Shula told reporters. 
"We spent a few days on vacation with everybody but one of my sisters. We were 
each lobbying in our own way to see which side people lined up on. I think I've 
got everybody but my dad's new wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, they don't line up and play." 
</P>
<P>
 That must mean none of them have any size or speed. Otherwise somebody in the 
AFC would have signed them. Bet your white socks on it.

JIM MURRAY: GIVEN HIS HANDICAP, HE PLAYED LIKE A CHAMPION

<P>
 Bert Yancey played golf about as well as anyone on the tour in his time. He 
had this gorgeous upright swing, this smooth putting stroke, and he won seven 
tournaments and was a factor in almost every one he entered, particularly if 
the track was a tough one. When the ribbon clerks were run out, Bert was one of 
the high-rollers left in. 
</P>
<P>
 But he played in this kind of catatonic state, almost as if he were in a daze 
or had been hit over the head with a sash-weight before he teed off. We put it 
down to the kind of competitive funk all the great ones put themselves in, the 
kind of "What elephant?" brand of golf. He was "in the zone" all top players 
are supposed to be in. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked after the ball like a guy dragging leg chains. He seemed so spaced 
out there were times you felt like shining a light in his eyes or pricking his 
toe with a pin and saying anxiously "OK, Bert, did you feel that?" Or asking 
him what his name was or what day it was. Yancey seemed to have a permanent 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 We were, I'm ashamed to say, obtuse. In all the big tournaments where he got 
out in front, he always seemed to find a way to lose. We thought he was 
choking. Turns out, we were the ones who were choking. We didn't do our 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, we knew Bert had washed out of West Point for something called a "nervous 
breakdown," but we put that down to the stresses of military life. We didn't 
realize the demons he had to play through on the course, and they had nothing 
to do with pot bunkers, lateral water, doglegs, two-way breaks or greens that 
were 10 on the stimpmeter. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought golf was his lithium. The tranquillity of the game, the leisurely 
pace, we thought, had calmed his torments. We should have known better. A U.S. 
Open is no place for a guy who already has bad nerves. A six-foot putt is the 
last thing in the world a mental patient should be confronted with. 
</P>
<P>
 I think Bert's crackup really began during the Open at Oak Hill in Rochester 
in 1968. He was sailing through that Open. He led by a shot going into the 
final round. He was hardly ever off a fairway for three rounds. He led Jack 
Nicklaus by seven shots. He led a golfer named Lee Trevino by one shot, but 
since Trevino had never won a tournament, we thought it unlikely he was Bert's 
real problem. Trevino would probably shoot 80 on the final day. We thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was Bert who began to unravel. I will never forget how startled we 
all were when he showed up on the first tee that day. "Look at Yancey," someone 
whistled. "He looks as if he just saw a flying saucer." He was as pale as a 
prison guard. He looked as if he had just been pulled from a train wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino, meanwhile, was having the time of his life, spitting on his hands, 
chatting up the gallery, sinking everything in sight. Yancey, playing with him, 
looked more as if he just heard a noise in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember, on one green, Bert almost made the mistake of a career. He was 
bending down to move a ball marker, an action I believe might have cost him two 
strokes or maybe disqualification. Trevino, as I recall it, leaned over, put a 
hand on his arm and said, "I don't believe you want to do that, Bert." 
</P>
<P>
 Bert staggered in that day with a 76. Trevino beat him by seven shots. Even 
Nicklaus passed him -- made up nine shots on him. Yancey finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we knights of the press got the message that day. There was nothing 
funny about Bert's idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
 We had always found it amusing the way Bert fixated on the Masters. Winning 
the Masters was more than an ambition, it was an obsession. He hankered to win 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 He came tantalizingly close. But, as in the Open, he found a way to lose. In a 
strange way, maybe he didn't really want to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the race driver, Eddie Sachs, who almost deliberately seemed not to want 
to win the Indianapolis 500, Bert behaved at Augusta as though he were afraid 
to win it. He led the Masters after three rounds in 1967, then yipped away the 
fourth round to finish third behind Gay Brewer and Bobby Nichols. The next 
year, he did the opposite. He limped through the first three rounds, then shot 
65 the last day. Again, he was third. In 1970, he was two shots out of a 
playoff with Billy Casper and Gene Littler. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert began to disappear after that. He made a brief stand in the '74 Open, but 
an opening-round 76 undid him there. He began to drift out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on golf's conscience. The reports began to come in -- Bert was caught 
nude prowling the streets in South Carolina, Bert was climbing a post in an 
airport. He was seeing things and hearing voices no one else could. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tee of a major tournament is hardly the place for a 
manic-depressive. Like every game, golf has to be played by an athlete with an 
abundance of mental health, belief in himself. The golf ball takes unfair 
bounces. Virtuosity is not always its own reward. You need to be able to shrug 
off a bad hole, a bad round, a bad tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 That Bert couldn't always do it, oddly, seemed a reflection on the game 
itself. We scribes guiltily pored back through our print archives to see if we 
had understood or made light of Bert's personal terrors. It's easy to do in the 
give-and-take of the press tent. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bert loved the game. He found the medication that allowed him to play 
it, to live life fully. But he never approached stardom again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert died on a golf course the other day. Too soon. But as I'm sure he would 
have wished. With a driver in his hand and a tournament to be played, a golf 
course to be solved. It's where he found what peace he ever could. It's 
probably where he came the closest to getting rid of those strange sounds, 
strange commands ringing through his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is a game where you play with a handicap. Given his, Bert Yancey's net 
was nothing short of magnificent. I'm sure wherever he is today, he's looking 
for the first tee.

THEY'RE BACK ON THE RUN; RUSHING GAME LOOKS BETTER FOR THE TROJANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time USC's 1993 season had passed through Penn State, Arizona and Notre 
Dame, Coach John Robinson knew two painful truths about his team: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Trojans, particularly against good teams, did not have an effective 
running game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Trojans, particularly against good teams, could not stop an effective 
running game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is uncertain whether USC's defensive line has improved sufficiently to stop 
opponents' running games. 
</P>
<P>
 But, from what's happened so far in practice, the coaching staff believes the 
former deficiency has been at least partially corrected with the arrival of 
three new running backs and a returning starter, Shawn Walters, who improved 
markedly late last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, a sophomore from Arlington, Tex., earned the starting tailback job 
midway through last season and showed he could be a tailback with a big-time 
future at a university where the position was practically invented. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, his position coach is Charles White, 1979 Heisman Trophy winner. If 
Walters still feels he needs more guidance, he can walk down the hall and talk 
to Athletic Director Mike Garrett, the 1965 winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, six feet and 225 pounds, averaged 4.7 yards a carry last season and 
finished eighth among Pacific 10 Conference runners with 641 yards. At USC, 
that doesn't put him in the all-time top 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But cut him some slack. He was a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters is expected to start Saturday in the opener against Washington at the 
Coliseum but might have to play a notch or two above last season's level to 
hang on to his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters took over at tailback after early season starters Scott Fields and 
David Dotson faltered -- and after he stopped trying to be Carl Lewis in pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shawn, like a lot of good high school backs, thought he could just go to the 
sideline and outrun everyone at this level," Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But he's a big, physical guy, and I wanted him to ricochet off tacklers, not 
try to run around them. It took a while, but he finally started taking the ball 
up the middle.  
</P>
<P>
 "He got stronger over the summer too. I think he's a fine tailback, a solid 
football player." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Houston in the season's second game a year ago, Robinson was 
unimpressed by Walters' first big play as a Trojan, a 54-yard touchdown run 
during which no defender touched him.  
</P>
<P>
 "All that showed me was that he can run 54 yards without falling down," 
Robinson said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 White said yet another glitch has been blipped out of Walters' running style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally got him to quit hesitating a split-second at the line of 
scrimmage," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Shawn tries to be perfect every play, and sometimes he concentrates so much, 
the hole opens and closes while he's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking is a major theme with White when talking about young running backs.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big difference between doing it and understanding it," he said. "I 
want to make sure they all know what they're supposed to be doing out there, 
running down the clock or trying to get out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I have questions about their toughness. Can they get two yards for us 
with the game on the line and no blocking? Can they move the pile? Can they 
play hurt? It might take us a year to learn all that. We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 For Trojan partisans, nothing quickens anticipation of the opening game quite 
like the arrival of three new tailbacks: LEONARD GREEN 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, Robinson said Green is the most polished. He's a 6-0, 180-pound 
junior college transfer from Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green comes in here as an experienced, mature player," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very quick, elusive kind of runner with a great burst through the 
line. He's also an excellent receiver and blocker." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a junior, rushed for 1,922 yards, averaging 6.4, in 22 games for Mt. 
SAC, fumbling only once in two years. However, he has sat out recent practices 
because of a hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Said White: "All three of these guys are something special, but that burst 
Leonard has through the line -- it's special . He's a nice package; he carries 
a lot of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Green's junior college coach, ex-Trojan Bill Fisk, said Robinson, White and 
offensive coordinator Mike Riley will find Green at his best when he's matched 
against linebackers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Leonard is so quick that if they can effectively isolate him on linebackers, 
they'll see no linebacker can cover him," Fisk said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a complete offensive player -- he's got great hands, he can run and he 
can block." RODNEY SERMONS 
</P>
<P>
 Sermons is a 6-0, 175-pound freshman who hasn't played a down, and already 
Washington Coach Jim Lambright is worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what kind of player Rodney is -- we recruited him, we had him up here 
on a visit," Lambright said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a general way, Robinson compared him recently to another USC Heisman 
winner, Marcus Allen, when Allen was a freshman in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real all-around back, a guy with a broad range of skills," Robinson 
said. "Allen showed us early he could do a lot of stuff, and so has Rodney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sermons averaged 7.2 yards in 145 carries last season at Bishop Amat, scoring 
19 touchdowns. He also started five games as a defensive back and had two 
interceptions. DELON WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-11, 190-pound freshman, Washington scored 55 touchdowns at Kimball High in 
Dallas, including 29 last fall, when he averaged 6.9 yards a carry. Then he had 
best times of 10.33 and 21.82 seconds for the 100 and 200 meters on the track 
team last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has lit up a couple of scrimmages at USC, gliding through seams in 
the defensive line and popping loose from linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got great moves; he can escape out of tackles like Napoleon Kaufman," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 White marvels at Washington's hands at the start of a running play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes the handoff so smoothly, sometimes I think he's fumbled it," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has told all of his tailbacks to think of themselves as being 
"interchangeable," that is, capable of contributing at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robinson, Dotson, one of last year's tailbacks who is probably 
the best blocker in the group, will be "fully involved" at fullback, as will 
another returnee, Terry Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tailback contender is redshirt freshman LaVale Woods, a 5-7, 
190-pounder who sat out last season after suffering an ankle sprain.

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; CLASS OF THE AFC RESIDES IN L.A.; RAIDERS: 
AFTER PLUGGING HOLES, THEY ARE PICKED BY MANY TO REACH SUPER BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They haven't won a game, scored a point or even played a down. Yet the Raiders 
are in the 1995 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Says who? 
</P>
<P>
 Say many of the hundreds of football experts in broadcast booths, press boxes, 
newspaper offices and coaching positions across the nation. The Raiders have 
become the hot pick to emerge out of the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Weren't the Raiders the team whose owner, Al Davis, had 
supposedly lost touch with the game? 
</P>
<P>
 Weren't the Raiders the team that had lost its mystique and many of its fans 
during several lean years? 
</P>
<P>
 Weren't the Raiders the team that finally rebounded last season, making it to 
the second round of the playoffs, only to lose its final game, its stadium and 
its star defensive player for more than decade, Howie Long, within a two-week 
period last January? 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months and $60 million later, the earthquake-ravaged Coliseum is 
structurally better and stronger than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months and $29 million later, the Raiders appear better and stronger 
than before. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the amount they spent in a highly productive off-season to bring in 
the key personnel that have generated such optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, rather than losing touch, displayed a magic touch, working with Coach 
Art Shell, director of football operations Steve Ortmayer and other members of 
the team hierarchy to plug the holes that had prevented the Raiders from coming 
all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether they have actually acquired the right material 
to fill those gaps. The Raiders must show they can run, can put an effective 
middle linebacker on the field and can blend this new cast of characters into 
an effective, cohesive unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell has done his best to turn the applause meter way down to keep his 
players from being overwhelmed by overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been hard to ignore the praise. Promise anonymity, and the players 
all seem to whisper the same sentence: "We are loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Following is a look at the pluses and minuses: QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: The Raiders are solid with Jeff Hostetler, coming off a career 
year in which he passed accurately, threw bombs and scored in the air, on the 
ground and with teammates who came to admire his ability to keep getting back 
on his feet despite injury and adversity. All Hostetler needs is a repeat 
performance, and the Raiders will be thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: The team has a good combination of experience and youth with 
39-year-old Vince Evans, who seems to grow better with age, and 23-year-old 
Billy Joe Hobert, who seemed to grow better with the expanded playing time he 
got in the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: If Hostetler -- cover your ears, Al Davis -- should go down with 
an injury, either Evans or Hobert would have to rise to a new level for the 
season to be salvaged. RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: As expected, Tom Rathman was named starting fullback Wednesday. 
Add to his all-around skill as a runner, receiver and blocker his leadership 
ability and experience as a veteran of eight years with the San Francisco 49ers 
and two Super Bowls, and it was hard to keep him on the bench. At tailback, 
however, Ty Montgomery, a converted receiver, has held off the challenge of 
Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: Williams can't really be classified as a backup since Shell has 
indicated that the ball-carrying duties will be a team effort. If you get hot, 
you get the ball. And there'll be different assignments for different backs. In 
short-yardage and goal-line situations, Napoleon McCallum will play. Rookie 
Calvin Jones will have to take a number and get in line. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: The entire running game. The Raiders will go only as far as their 
legs will carry them. They finished 26th in rushing last season in a 28-team 
league. They can't get to the Super Bowl from there. RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: The Raiders can boast of having one of the NFL's best big-play 
performers in Tim Brown on the right side and the two-time winner of the NFL's 
Fastest Man race on the left side in Alexander Wright. Brown is coming off a 
career year that included an AFC-leading 1,180 receiving yards. At tight end, 
the loss of Ethan Horton to the Washington Redskins has enabled Andrew Glover 
to move into the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: Pass receiving is not only the strongest area on the team, but 
perhaps in the entire league as well. How many clubs have a gold medal-winning 
track star like James Jett and a dominant figure in both college and the CFL 
like Rocket Ismail as backups? Take this unit to Atlanta in 1996, and it might 
do as well against Olympic competition as it would against the Falcons. 
Third-string receiver Daryl Hobbs might have a shot at the starting lineup on 
another team. Here, he can also take a number. Kevin Smith and former 49er 
Jamie Williams back up Glover. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: Glover has never caught more than 15 passes in a season. He needs 
to catch three times that many to fill the role of Horton, who caught 43 last 
season from Hostetler. The Raider quarterback sees the tight end as far more 
than just a blocker. OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: The left side of this line is solid, with Gerald Perry at tackle 
and Steve Wisniewski at guard. Don Mosebar remains the dependable anchor at 
center. But the right side, plagued by injuries and constant changes the last 
few seasons, has been the weak side. So the Raiders signed Dallas Cowboy 
stalwart Kevin Gogan to beef things up, playing him at right guard alongside 
tackle Bruce Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: Veteran Max Montoya, who flirted with retirement in the 
off-season, agreed to come back as a reserve. Greg Skrepenak, coming off an 
ankle injury that cost him last season, will put pressure on Wilkerson. Rich 
Stephens, Robert Jenkins and long-snapper Dan Turk fill out the backup roles. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: With Gogan next to him, Wilkerson must produce if this side of 
the line is to equal the left and give the Raiders options in the running game 
and the crucial protection Hostetler needs to make it through 16 games. If 
Wilkerson falters, Skrepenak, ankle permitting, is waiting for his chance. 
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: Not many teams could lose half their defensive starting line and 
not be in trouble. But the departure of Howie Long and Greg Townsend from the 
ends has been balanced by the return of former starter Scott Davis from 
retirement and the elevation of situational player Anthony Smith to a starting 
spot. Smith has 36 sacks in three seasons despite a serious thumb injury last 
season and his previous part-time role. Solid at the tackles are Chester 
McGlockton and Nolan Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: One thing the Raiders did lose along with Long and Townsend was 
depth. So they signed veteran Jerry Ball, who looks miscast with 300-plus 
pounds on his 6-foot-1 frame . . . miscast that is until the football is 
snapped. Then, Ball has shown an explosiveness that has left both opponents and 
critics shaking their heads. Even Shell says that Ball is "a better pass rusher 
than I thought." Veteran Aundray Bruce, draft pick Austin Robbins and converted 
tight end John Duff fill out this crew. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: Davis came back in good physical shape from a two-year layoff. 
But his timing and rhythm on the field were something else. He must show his 
old form and Smith must show he can play the run and maintain his intensity 
after becoming a starter for this line to remain effective. LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: There was a big question mark here after the end of last season 
and it remains, hovering over the middle. The loss of middle linebacker Joe 
Kelly, largely because of salary-cap considerations, must be overcome for the 
Raider defense to be successful. Second-year man Greg Biekert has been 
impressive in the exhibition season, but his start Monday night in the opener 
will be his first. Winston Moss, the right-side linebacker, is the most solid 
of the three. Aaron Wallace on the left is an effective pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: Top draft choice Rob Fredrickson has been shifted from his 
outside position in college to the middle, where he is trying to learn along 
with Biekert. Veteran Mike Jones is joined by two 1994 draft choices, 
second-rounder James Folston and seventh-rounder Rob Holmberg. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: Obviously, Biekert is the crucial factor here. A rugged hitter, 
he's been thrown into a tough situation, trying to play in the middle of the 
defense and also relay the defensive signals to a squad of veterans. Opposing 
teams will be overjoyed if Biekert falters. A strong performance by the line 
would lift some of the pressure off him, but not much. DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: Cornerbacks Terry McDaniel, a Pro Bowl player each of the last 
two seasons, and Lionel Washington, a solid veteran, are complemented by free 
safety Eddie Anderson and strong safety Derrick Hoskins. A year ago, Hoskins 
was in the same position Biekert is in this year -- a second-year man asked to 
replace an effective veteran with a first-round draft choice breathing down his 
neck. The Raiders will be happy if Biekert does as well as Hoskins, who 
replaced Ronnie Lott and kept the job despite the presence of Patrick Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: Veteran cornerback Albert Lewis, a four-time Pro Bowler and 
third in interceptions among all active players with 38, was signed in the 
off-season and is poised to take a starting position if the opportunity 
presents itself. The other reserves -- Bates, Dan Land and James Trapp -- 
figure to stay in that role, but will get plenty of playing time in passing 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: Washington, bothered by a hamstring injury in the exhibition 
season, will have to maintain the form that has enabled him to pick off 30 
passes in 10 years if he is to hold off Lewis. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 On the Field: The Raiders have some special players on these squads. Kicker 
Jeff Jaeger is coming off the best year of his career. In fact, no kicker has 
ever had a better one. He made 35 field goals, tying the NFL record, and scored 
132 points to lead the league. Brown, the punt returner, is the most productive 
player at that position in team history with a return total of 1,960 yards. 
Ismail, the kick returner, has been known for his accomplishments throughout 
his career. In his first NFL season, he led the league in that department, 
averaging 24.2 yards a return. Dependable Jeff Gossett is second on the Raider 
all-time punting list behind some guy named Ray Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Bench: Behind Brown are Ismail and Hobbs. Joining Ismail is Williams, 
with Wright in reserve. Behind Jaeger and Gossett is the waiver wire. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Spot: With the new rules that figure to provide more running room on 
kickoffs, Ismail must get the Raiders in good field position on a consistent 
basis. New field-goal rules will make it difficult for Jaeger to equal last 
season's totals.

WINFIELD GOES TO INDIANS IN FIRST TRADE OF STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first trade since the baseball strike began Aug. 12, Dave Winfield was 
acquired by the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday night for a player to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was announced only 30 minutes before the midnight deadline for 
postseason rosters.Although teams may be able to bring up players from their 
minor league systems if there is a postseason, the deadline remained as far as 
acquiring players from other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield, 42, had been with the Minnesota Twins since the start of the 1993 
season. He played 77 games this season and hit .252 with 10 home runs and 43 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should the season resume, Dave would be an invaluable asset to this club 
during the pennant drive and certainly during the postseason," Indian General 
Manager John Hart said. "He is a leader and a winner and in addition he 
provides us with another right-handed power batter." 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield is in his 22nd major league season and this is his sixth team. He 
played for the San Diego Padres, the New York Yankees, the Angels, the Toronto 
Blue Jays and the Twins. The 12-time All-Star has 3,088 hits, 463 home runs and 
1,829 RBIs.

IT INCREASINGLY APPEARS THE SEASON IS LOST; BASEBALL: FEDERAL MEDIATORS SEE NO 
REASON TO BRING OWNERS, PLAYERS TOGETHER FOR NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal mediators met separately Wednesday with negotiators for baseball's 
club owners and striking players, and determined that there was no reason to 
bring them together for further bargaining at this time. There have been only 
two negotiating sessions since the players went out on Aug. 12 and none since 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The calendar now reads September, and what remains of the 1994 season is about 
to go under. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing scheduled and no reason to believe anything will be 
scheduled soon," said Donald Fehr, the union's executive director. "The 
mediators are out of ideas too." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr confirmed a story that appeared in Wednesday's editions of The Times, 
saying he has had informal contact with an owner, Jerry McMorris of the 
Colorado Rockies, but wouldn't discuss the nature of their talks. He did not 
classify them as secret negotiations and maintained that nothing substantive 
has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 20 of the strike, mediators met in New York for more than three hours 
with representatives of the owners, then spent only 15 minutes with the union's 
staff, assured that there has been no change in the union's resistance to a 
salary cap and no indication that the owners plan to withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch said: "I'm optimistic by nature, but I have 
nothing more than nature to base it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said the union's ongoing refusal to discuss issues of cost and how 
revenue can be divided on a percentage basis is inexplicable and that the 
losses being absorbed by the clubs because of the strike significantly reduce 
the amount of money they will have to spend on player compensation next year. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounded like a threat, but Ravitch said the $1 billion guaranteed the 
players in the owners' proposal -- based on a 50-50 split of all revenue -- 
would still be there if the players accepted the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, he said, the owners would have to reduce other expenditures to 
compensate for strike losses, which could exceed $200 million if play is not 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch also said the $140 million that the owners had at risk in postseason 
TV revenue is now less than that since advertisers, concerned about the 
uncertainty of the playoffs and World Series, are spending their money 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 That situation is so bleak, sources said, that the postseason -- barring a 
settlement -- could be buried by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ravitch and Fehr said their constituents understood the risks of their 
respective courses. The players missed their first full paycheck Wednesday. 
First distributions from their $175-million-plus strike fund will be mailed on 
Sept. 15, a normal payday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players understood that a strike costs the industry money and costs them 
money, and that's an indication of how strongly they feel (about a salary 
cap)," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cap, Texas Rangers pitcher Kevin Brown said Wednesday, is not an option 
"this year, next year or in 1996," meaning the union is prepared to stay out 
indefinitely, as Fehr has predicted, if the owners unilaterally put it in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig said the prospect of the strike continuing in 
1995 is a "grave concern," but the long-term consequences of failing to 
establish a system of cost certainty would "be even graver."

TRAINING CAMP LOCKOUT IS AVOIDED IN THE NHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL training camps will open as scheduled, the league notified teams 
Wednesday, although the possibility of a later lockout has not been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the news today, but obviously, it could change at any moment after 
camp opens," Mighty Duck wing Stu Grimson said. "I think from the players' 
standpoint, we're all very encouraged that things seem to be progressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam McMaster, general manager of the Kings, called the league communique "good 
news." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to sit, and I'm sure Mr. Bettman doesn't want to sit and I'm 
sure the players want a deal," McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings report Saturday and are to take the ice Monday at the Iceoplex in 
North Hills. The Ducks report Sunday, with their first practice scheduled 
Monday at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that players would be locked out intensified last week after NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman received authorization from the league's Board of 
Governors to shut down camps if he believes insufficient progress is being made 
in collective bargaining talks. The players have been without a contract since 
last Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Winnipeg Jets scheduled to open camp today, a decision was necessary. 
After a five-hour meeting Tuesday with Bob Goodenow, executive director of the 
NHL Players Assn., Bettman decided against a lockout -- at least for the 
present. The possibility of a later one remains, and a league source said 
Bettman is working with the idea there is a "30-day window" for a lockout 
between now and the beginning of the season on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The league made no formal announcement that camps will open, contending that 
none was necessary since it had never announced the possibility of a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Another meeting between Bettman and Goodenow is scheduled today, according to 
Arthur Pincus, NHL vice president for public relations. Salaries are the main 
issue, with owners seeking to tie salaries to revenue and players intent on 
having salaries set by the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although camps are opening, the league is still imposing a series of 
unilateral rule changes, effective today -- except in the Canadian provinces of 
Ontario and Alberta, where labor laws regarding conciliation processes prevent 
the new provisions from taking effect until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Players must now pay for their own transportation to and from training camp, 
and their $54 per diem food allowance has been eliminated for camp and the 
regular season. Other changes include roster reductions and increased player 
contributions for medical and pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman notified the players of the rule changes on Aug. 1, saying it was an 
effort to make them return to the bargaining table.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHO KNOWS, PERHAPS THERE ARE HIDDEN TALKS TAKING PLACE NOW 
</P>

 We've found the solution to the baseball strike: Tommy Hawkins and Jack Kent 
Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another sport (basketball) and another era (1967), but the then-Laker 
player and then-Laker owner headed off a basketball strike almost by 
themselves. Cooke had built the Forum and didn't want a work shutdown just 
before the playoffs, so he intervened and asked Hawkins, a member of the 
union's negotiating team, to work with him behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the proposals and counterproposals being relayed through Hawkins and 
Cooke, differences were settled and the postseason took place without delay. 
They got it done, but never got the credit because the story didn't come out 
until years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what was happening was big, but it didn't really register to me, the 
impact of what we did and how important it was to the development of 
basketball," said Hawkins, now waiting out the baseball strike as an executive 
with the Dodgers. "I would have to say next to the salary cap, this was one of 
the most important periods in the history of the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Lakers: "He (Cooke) told me I couldn't breathe a word of what he did," 
Hawkins said. "He didn't want that publicized." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he wanted that type of exposure. . . . He said, 'If you 
appreciate your job, you will not mention how this came about.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cooke: "It's entirely Tommy's story and it's entirely true." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What team has gone the longest since winning the Pacific

Jimmy Johnson: 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Johnson left coaching, you'd think the greatest combination 
broadcaster-writer-analyst-raconteur and personality of all time had just 
stepped off the train from the future. Home Box Office signed Jimmy up in three 
days. Fox Network wasn't far behind. And Universal Press Syndicate has his nibs 
penciled in for a national weekly column. Is Dan Rather safe in his CBS anchor 
chair? 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, will Johnson be worth all the attention he has been 
receiving and the increased publicity that lies ahead when his words begin 
flying on network and cable television and newspapers everywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 "The guess here is yes. Discussing things with HBO "Inside the NFL" regulars 
Len Dawson and Nick Buoniconti earlier this week, touting the show's 18th 
season that starts Sept. 8, ol' Helmet Hair was the star of the show by a 
bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 What price, victory?It's $900,000, according to a Florida jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinter Walter McCoy was awarded that sum after a lawsuit in which he claimed 
that a plunging Holiday Inn elevator jammed his neck and kept him from making 
the 1988 U.S. Olympic team and winning a gold medal.

U.S. OPEN / WEDNESDAY'S MATCHES; SAMPRAS' ANKLE IS FINE AND SO IS HIS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most famous ankle since Cyd Charisse's passed its first test here 
Wednesday, when Pete Sampras easily danced his way through a first-round match 
in the U.S. Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' opponent was a qualifier named Kevin Ullyett of South Africa, ranked 
No. 206 in the world. But the real opponent was an injured left ankle that has 
kept Sampras out of competition since July 17 and has stirred up both 
speculation and hope on the men's tour that the longtime star of their show may 
be tapped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so. This one was clearly a Broadway smash, as Sampras went through 
Ullyett, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, in 1 hour 25 minutes on the Stadium Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' stellar matinee performance was followed up nicely by a packed-house 
evening session for Michael Chang and MaliVai Washington. And neither 
disappointed the gathered sellout of 20,529. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, the sixth-seeded Californian, who lists his residence as Henderson, 
Nev., most likely for tax purposes, won a fourth-set tiebreaker to finish out 
the 3-hour 2-minute match well after midnight. The score was 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 
(7-3) and the long rallies that transpired were no surprise to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "People realize when they come and see us, that they'll see lots of balls hit 
from the backcourt," said Chang, who beat Washington here in 1992 in five sets. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sampras match -- since he appeared to be as good as ever and as far 
above the rest of the field as he has been in winning here two of the last four 
years -- the discussion centered somewhat on perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he feel vulnerable going into the match? 
</P>
<P>
 "A little bit," he said. "I felt a little vulnerable coming in here, but it's 
like riding a bike. You're not going to learn -- you always remember how to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras remembered enough to hit 10 aces, 38 winners and take the point when 
he got his first serve in 95% of the time, or 36 of 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullyett, 22, making only his second appearance in a Grand Slam event, was 
asked if there was an element of awe involved in playing Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' injury has been diagnosed, most recently, as calcium deposits on the 
ankle, a condition that, while painful, should improve with time and not 
seriously impede his march toward a third title here. Sampras said afterward 
that the ankle was fine; the match said the same thing. U.S. Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Seeded women Anke Huber (14) and Amy Frazier (16) were ousted, and the Nos. 2, 
8 and 9 players passed tough tests. Arantxa Sanchez Vicario beat France's 
Nathalie Tauziat with a second-set tiebreaker that went to 8-6; Gabriela 
Sabatini was pushed to 6-1 in the third against Meredith McGrath, and Mary Joe 
Fernandez got through a 7-4 tiebreaker in the third to advance past former 
Stanford star Patty Fendick. . . . Huber, of Germany, lost to Leila Meskhi of 
the Republic of Georgia, 6-2, 6-2, and Frazier, winner of the Manhattan Beach 
tournament three weeks ago, went out to Natalia Medvedeva of Ukraine, 6-2, 6-7 
(7-3), 6-4. . . . Lori McNeil, who had been an upset victim Tuesday in singles, 
dropped out of the women's and mixed doubles Wednesday with an injury. . . . 
Besides Pete Sampras and Michael Chang, the only other seeded men's players 
scheduled were No. 8 Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine, who beat Gilbert Schaller of 
Austria, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0, and No. 14 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, who beat Jacco 
Eltingh of the Netherlands, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, 6-3.

COURT 25 SERVES UP COUPLE OF WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You get to Court 25 at the U.S. Tennis Center either with a Rand McNally map 
or a hired guide. It fits the cliche perfectly: It's not at the end of the 
tennis world, but you can see it from there. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting for a changeover at Court 23, you are allowed to venture on, 
into the back lots of the U.S. Open, where matches attract mothers, fathers, 
husbands and wives of those playing, plus a few degenerates sick enough to bet 
on mixed doubles. The Samprases and Grafs play in stadiums or grandstands, in 
front of thousands. On Court 25, they play in front of dozens on benches and 
folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." When the mayor had those planes 
rerouted a few years ago so as not to disturb the fragile superstars on Stadium 
Court, he apparently had the landing patterns re-vectored closer to Court 25. 
At particularly special moments, the train that runs directly behind the court 
gets its schedule synchronized with a plane taking off, and a couple of cars in 
the parking lot right next to the train tracks choose the moment for dueling 
horns. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be far from the madding crowd, but what remains is, indeed, 
maddening. 
</P>
<P>
 Errant balls from adjoining practice courts fly all over the place; a light 
pole sways in the wind and squeaks loudly. One court away, in a huge sponsors' 
area for cocktailing and socializing, the sound frequently gets turned up on 
the big-screen TV and wafts into the match: "Now, CNN Headline News takes you 
to Bernard Shaw in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd watching the match on Court 25 frequently is boosted by another 
dozen or so who watch from the ramps on the backside of the giant stadium that 
looms above. On a good day, such as Wednesday, the planes, trains and 
automobiles are joined in harmony with the squeaky light pole, the big-screen 
TV and a young couple on the ramp, arguing loudly about who forgot to bring the 
ATM card. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was on a day at the U.S. Open that will not live in infamy. Pete Sampras 
beat up on a guy ranked No. 206; Andrei Medvedev and Yevgeny Kafelnikov tested 
the typing ability of the American press corps with victories, and Arantxa 
Sanchez Vicario gave her 410th consecutive interview in which she said that she 
fought hard and hit lots of good backhands. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a silver lining Wednesday, and it was right there on Court 25, 
in the persons of Paul Annacone and Ken Flach, who made the venture into the 
hinterlands worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Annacone, played in the first match of the day there, a men's doubles 
affair in which he and his partner, Shelby Cannon, upset the 11th-seeded team 
of Henrik Holm and Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-1. The other, 
Flach, played in the last match of the day there, losing with partner Debbie 
Graham of Fountain Valley in a mixed doubles contest against Natalie Medvedeva 
of Ukraine and Hendrik Davids of the Netherlands, 6-3, 1-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Annacone and Flach won the Orange Bowl boys' 18 doubles title. In 
1986, for one brief, shining moment in Camelot, Annacone and Flach were the 
U.S. doubles team, beating an Australian duo in Annacone's only Davis Cup 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm undefeated in Davis Cup," said Annacone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 10-2," said Flach, who won 10 consecutive Davis Cup doubles matches -- 
nine with Robert Seguso -- in one span. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, both are 31, and like Energizer bunnies, still going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it because I'm a member of the ATP Tour board of directors and I should 
stay active if I can," Annacone said. "Also, I still enjoy it and can make a 
living at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Flach: "I still like this. It's still fun, I'm still competitive and it's 
hard to beat the money. Plus, I don't want to quit too early. I see guys like 
(Mats) Wilander trying to make comebacks, and I talked to Seguso the other day 
and he's thinking about coming back. I think once you leave, it's too hard to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Flach rarely plays singles anymore, Annacone not at all, but both still have 
annual incomes in six figures -- Flach perhaps as much as $300,000. Each has 
had great moments in the sport, Flach with many Grand Slam doubles titles and 
Annacone with, among others things, a memorable 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 L.A. Open final 
victory over Stefan Edberg in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 So there they were, two of the few real adults who have stood the test of time 
on the tennis tour, hidden away on Court 25. And refreshingly, neither 
complained about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ego isn't big enough to care about stuff like that," Flach said, "and 
neither is Paul's." 
</P>
<P>
 A footnote for the day on Court 25: Flach and Graham lost their match when 
Graham served a netcord in the final game, Davids hit a winner off it, and the 
chair umpire didn't hear it. When Flach questioned the chair umpire about it, 
she had to lean forward to hear him because a plane was taking off and a train 
was going by.

 Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach Rollie Massimino says he will not take legal 
action if the university decides not to honor a secret contract that was 
supposed to pay him an additional $375,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino also said he has no intention of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV interim President Kenny Guinn told the state Board of Regents that 
Massimino's secret contract is against state law because it was not brought 
before the regents for approval. Guinn also said he has no intention of 
bringing the contract before the regents for approval. Hockey

 The 299-pounds-per-man starting offensive line at USC lost a little tonnage 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson said 280-pound Clay Hattabaugh, a junior, had overtaken 
310-pound redshirt freshman Phalen Pounds in practice and would "probably" 
start at right guard against Washington Saturday in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hattabaugh's had a great camp and Phalen's played well, too. . . . It's just 
that we're a little concerned about Phalen's lack of experience," Robinson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pounds was the starter coming out of spring drills, and Hattabaugh was listed 
as the No. 3 center.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; TACKLE BECOMES SPECIAL 'ADVISER' 
</P>

<P>
 He is in shape at 315 pounds and at peace academically at UCLA. Sale Isaia has 
his position back, left defensive tackle, and is a senior who spends part of 
his time giving advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Do as I do, not as I did, is his message. "This is my last year, and now I see 
young guys looking up at me," he said. "Guys like Travis Kirschke and Vae Tata. 
. . . Coaches have their own problems, family and things like that, and I know 
I've had problems that I can tell the guys about, so that maybe they won't make 
the same mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The mistakes came last season, in which he almost didn't play. Isaia had been 
slow recovering from off-season back surgery and had nearly given up on 
football. With that thought, there seemed no reason to go to class or to work 
out, so when the back injury healed, he found himself out of shape, physically 
and academically. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally regained his starting job with five games left. 
</P>
<P>
 The embarrassment is behind him, and he speaks more clearly and positively 
about his senior season, which begins Saturday night against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I didn't take care of business off the field, so I took it on the 
field," he said. "This year, the off-the-field business is taken care of." 
</P>

 Play-calling is different this season under new offensive coordinator Bob 
Toledo. Last season and before, Homer Smith called plays from the press box, 
with receiver coach Rick Neuheisel sending them in with players. This season, 
Toledo will be on the sideline, and backup quarterbacks Ryan Fien and Rob 
Walker will use hand signals to get them to starter Wayne Cook. JIM HODGES

 Three NFL owners and representatives of the league's officials met for four 
hours in Chicago with no resolution of their contract talks, but with a 
guarantee that there would be no walkout on the opening weekend of the season.

 The officials are asking that game salaries, which range from $1,350 to $2,700 
a game based on seniority, be doubled and pension payments increased by 300%. 
</P>

 They argue that with meetings, seminars and weekday game preparation, they

STEELERS' GREEN SIGNS 1-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Green gambled Wednesday, rejecting the Pittsburgh Steelers' $10-million 
offer to sign a one-year contract worth $1.4 million so he can retain his right 
to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pro Bowl tight end, faced with reporting Wednesday or not playing Sunday 
against the Dallas Cowboys, ended a six-week holdout by signing the offer 
initially tendered him last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be compensated for what I've done, but the Steelers weren't 
prepared to do that," said the 290-pound Green, the NFL's biggest tight end. 
"I'll never know how much I'm worth until I'm on the free market." 
</P>
<P>
 By rejecting the richer contract, Green gambled that he'll have another big 
season.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RATHMAN WILL START AT FULLBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's official: The move that has been anticipated since the summer day he came 
trotting into training camp at Oxnard was made Wednesday when Tom Rathman was 
named the starting fullback over Napoleon McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
 Could this be anything to do with the fact that the Raiders open the 1994 
season Monday night at Candlestick Park against the San Francisco 49ers, the 
team for which Rathman played the last eight seasons, including two Super 
Bowls? 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't hurt, but it seemed inevitable that Rathman would start. The 
reason he headed south was the opportunity to remain a starter, an opportunity 
that no longer existed in San Francisco with the development of Marc Logan and 
the drafting of William Floyd. Rathman is the complete package at fullback, an 
effective runner, receiver and pass blocker. He also brings his invaluable 
experience and a calm demeanor developed through years of playing in big games. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his promotion, Rathman, 31, shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just another squirrel looking for a nut," he said. "It's exciting, but it 
wouldn't have mattered if they started Nap. He has made a lot of improvement in 
training camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman got the news at the Raiders' Wednesday morning walk-through. Coach Art 
Shell approached Rathman and told him that his brief spell as a backup was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either way they handled it, I would have been comfortable," Rathman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he given a reason for the switch? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need a reason," he said. "I just need to play." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum, who began last season on special teams and evolved into an effective 
short-yardage back, will continue to fill that role. He'll be the one the 
Raiders use when they near the goal line or need a few yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He got them for the Raiders last season. After scoring two rushing touchdowns 
in three previous seasons, he scored three last season, despite a mid-season 
appendectomy, and then added five in two postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are places for him," Shell said of McCallum, "and there are also places 
for Tom Rathman. That's not to say we won't use Napoleon McCallum at fullback. 
We will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders made one other lineup change official, moving Scott Davis to left 
defensive end and dropping Aundray Bruce to backup. Davis, who started every 
game for the Raiders in 1990 and '91, spent the next two seasons in retirement. 
He slowly played himself back into form on the second unit in the exhibition 
season. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; GILBERT HOPES TO PLAY SUNDAY

<P>
 His ankle might not be fully ready, but defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, listed 
as questionable, was in full uniform, practicing for Sunday's opener against 
the Arizona Cardinals at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, the team's top defender, had been sidelined since Aug. 20 because of 
the ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sore, real sore, but I expected that because I haven't practiced in a 
week and a half," he said. "There's about 40% strength there; it's not ready 
for four quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert wanted to work out to acquaint himself with the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not up to me; it's always in God's hands," he said. "As badly as I want 
to get out there and play, I can't pressure myself, because that won't serve 
anyone's purpose. I just have to wait until I'm ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Gerald Robinson and wide receiver Todd Kinchen, also listed 
as questionable because of injuries, did not practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals made a change in their lineup, replacing rookie Brent Alexander 
with veteran Terry Hoage at free safety. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 How intense is Arizona's preparation for the Rams? Coach Buddy Ryan, asked for 
his assessment of Bettis, said: "Tom Bettis, the defensive backfield coach?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he's a good tailback," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, ever quotable, was asked this week about the commercial diet he and 
Chuck Knox advertised several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he lost more than I did, but he looked a hell of a lot worse 
afterward," Ryan said. "They should have given him a tulip. He was ready to be 
buried." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The last time Cardinal quarterback Steve Beuerlein played at Anaheim Stadium, 
it was for Anaheim Servite High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing for the CIF championship against Long Beach Poly," Beuerlein 
said. "That would have been the fall of '82. We (won), 31-7." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Long Beach present a tougher defense than what he expects from the Rams? 
</P>

 "I'm not sold on the theory that this is a game we should win. That's what

TITANS TAP FRESNO STATE FOR NEW ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Easterbrook, associate athletic director at Fresno State, is expected to 
be named Cal State Fullerton's athletic director today. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11 a.m. news conference has been called by university President Milton A. 
Gordon to introduce the successor to Bill Shumard, who resigned in May and 
later became an assistant athletic director at his alma mater, Long Beach 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook, 55, has been at Fresno State for nine years and was hired by Gary 
Cunningham, the former UCLA basketball coach, shortly after Cunningham became 
athletic director there. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook was one of three finalists whose names were submitted to Gordon 
without ranking by a 12-member search group. The other two finalists were 
Judith Davidson, athletic director at Central Connecticut State, and Jack Mehl, 
business manager of the Rose Bowl, according to sources close to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson and Mehl said Wednesday night that they had not been offered the 
position. Easterbrook, contacted by telephone in Fresno Wednesday night, said 
any announcement would have to come from the university. He declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook is a past member of the Big West Conference basketball tournament 
committee and has been chiefly responsible for NCAA compliance for Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook was president and chief executive officer for American National 
Bank in Laramie, Wyo., before he took the administrative position at Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going into private business, he was an assistant football coach for 13 
years with stops at Idaho, Oregon State, Illinois and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook is a native of Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook and his wife Cynthia have three adult children.

UNCAGED FURY HOLDS ON TO WIN INVERNESS DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uncaged Fury, a 3-year-old running in his first stakes, won the $55,000 
Inverness Drive Wednesday. Ridden by Chris McCarron, he held off the 
late-rushing Flying Sensation to take the 6 1/2-furlong race. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief career, Uncaged Fury has three victories and a second. He had 
broken his maiden at Hollywood Park, moved up to allowance company and a second 
place before winning an allowance race earlier in the Del Mar meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a tremendous burst of speed," trainer Lewis Cenicola said, "but he's 
not seasoned yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The "seasoned" horses in this field were Winning Pact, 1993 Del Mar Futurity 
winner, and Fu Man Slew, third in a Grade II stakes at Laurel in July. Fu Man 
Slew was the 7-5 favorite; Winning Pact was 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Fu Man Slew went to the lead with Dream Trapp on his inside, but McCarron had 
Uncaged Fury positioned nicely in third on the rail. By the far turn, Uncaged 
Fury was on the lead and Winning Pact was being moved up on the outside by 
Corey Nakatani. Uncaged Fury seemed to get a second wind and needed only to 
contend with Flying Sensation's big stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, on a day of upsets, Uncaged Fury paid $20 for the victory. 
Flying Sensation was followed by Fu Man Slew and Winning Pact. DAVE DISTEL

DEL MAR; RACING GOES INTERNATIONAL THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign horses will add an international flavor to the upcoming weekend of 
Grade II stakes races here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's Del Mar Handicap and Monday's Del Mar Derby are replete with foreign 
intrigue, or at least intriguing foreign horses. Only Saturday's Del Mar 
Debutante will not have a foreign entry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Handicap, 1 3/8 miles on the turf for $250,000, had the Irish-bred 
Approach The Bench, the winner of the Grade I Eddie Read Handicap August 7. He 
is owned by John Mulhern, trained by Richard Cross and ridden by Corey 
Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Frankel-trained Regency will be making his U.S. debut, coming off Group 
II victories in France. His last start was in Deauville on August 11. He will 
be ridden by Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 A third entry with foreign roots could be Stavros Niarchos's Caesour, a 
Kentucky-bred whose nine previous races have been in France. 
</P>
<P>
 He has two victories, a second and a third, all on the turf, where the 
Handicap will be contested. His jockey will be Eddie Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the 10 horses invited to Monday's $300,000 Derby, a 1 1/8-mile turf 
race for 3 year olds, have foreign touches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluegrass Prince, making his U.S. debut, is from the stable of Rodney Rash, 
who also has Triple Crown runner Powis Castle in the field. He has been running 
in England, where he won the Group III Diamond Stakes in June.  
</P>
<P>
 Frankel's Eagle Eyed, owned by Juddmonte Farms, raced in France in 1993, but 
has been at Santa Anita, Golden Gate and Arlington this year. He was winner of 
the Arlington Classic, a Grade II race, under Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin's Faith, Irish-bred, has campaigned strictly in California. He won the 
La Jolla Handicap on August 14 by a nose over Unfinished Symph, another Derby 
entrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumo Di Londra, invited but considered an unlikely entrant, raced in Italy, 
Germany and England before coming to trainer Ron McAnally's stable earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The only "accent" in Saturday's $250,000 Debutante for 2-year-old fillies will 
be southern. Ten of the 16 entries were bred in Kentucky.

BLACK AND LATINO GROUPS SCOLD ROGERS; LEGISLATURE: CAUCUSES CRITICIZE THE STATE 
SENATOR FOR APPEARING BEFORE AN ORGANIZATION ACCUSED OF PROMOTING WHITE 
SUPREMACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking the unusual step of reprimanding a fellow lawmaker, the legislative 
black and Latino caucuses scolded state Sen. Don Rogers on Wednesday for his 
appearance last weekend before a group accused of promoting white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded missive, the Black Caucus told Rogers its members were 
"distressed and saddened " and "at a loss to understand your rationale for 
joining such loathsome company." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who says he does not hold racist beliefs, declined to comment on the 
caucuses' letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers spoke Saturday to the annual Jubilation Celebration and Conference in 
Bakersfield, joining a lineup of speakers that included one of the founders of 
the white racist Aryan Nation. It was Rogers' second appearance before the 
group in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime Republican legislator from Kern County, whose district reaches 
into the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys, also wrote an article published in 
the latest issue of the conference's sponsoring publication, The Jubilee. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-racist watchdog groups contend the newspaper is the voice of the national 
Christian Identity movement, a theology built on the belief that Christian 
whites are superior to other races or ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech before the Jubilee followers, Rogers spoke of reaffirming 
states' rights over federal mandates, a popular topic with conservative 
audiences. His article in the Jubilee attacked the federal Endangered Species 
Act as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Rogers did not speak or write in support of Jubilee racial 
views, Black Caucus members were alarmed that, as a state senator, he appeared 
before the gathering at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surely you were aware that your hosts and fellow speakers are in the business 
of promoting race hatred, homophobia and anti-Semitism," the letter said, 
noting that Colorado state Rep. Charles Duke pulled out of his scheduled talk 
that night, saying he had not realized what views the group espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamphlets on sale at the conference attacked gays, Jews and people of color. 
The event also featured talks by Robert Brock, an African American who urges 
all blacks to "repatriate" to Africa, and Louis Beam Jr., a former Ku Klux 
Klansman who is an Aryan Nation founder. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter signed by nine members of the Latino Legislative Caucus chided Rogers 
for both his decision to speak to the group and his "apparent unwillingness to 
concede that such behavior was improper." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the letterhead of Assemblyman Richard G. Polanco (D-Los Angeles), the 
letter said, "In the continuing struggle we endure to promote civil rights, we 
realize how much further we have to go when elected officials ignore the 
lessons of history and serve the purposed of those who peddle hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 Also signing the letter were Assembly members Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk), 
Joe Baca (D-San Bernardino), Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), Hilda Solis (D-El 
Monte), Martha Escutia (D-Huntington Park), Cruz Bustamante (D-Fresno), Denise 
Moreno Ducheny (D-San Diego) and Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead). 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), who heads the nine-member Black Caucus, 
said it was rare for the lawmakers to draft a letter objecting to another 
legislator's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing the letter were Assembly members Lee, Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco), Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), 
Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson), Curtis Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood) and Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles). Senators Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) and Teresa 
Hughes (D-Inglewood) also signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Assembly had stripped Rogers' name off one of his own bills in 
a retaliatory maneuver designed to demonstrate unhappiness with his weekend 
appearance. Rogers blamed the action on "disgruntled Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the black caucus wrote: "Senator, we are not merely disgruntled. 
Race hatred and its variants are not trifling matters; nor does your legitimate 
concern for states' rights . . . outweigh the public need to repudiate racist 
nonsense in the strongest possible terms."

ALL CHARGED UP; SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO CRAM MALLS THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year, as the summer draws to a close, shopping malls across the San 
Fernando Valley gear up for the Labor Day weekend onslaught of bargain hunters 
in search of back-to-school deals. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, because the Northridge earthquake knocked several malls 
temporarily out of business, the surviving malls are expecting the 
traditionally hectic weekend to be even busier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, without a doubt, we are gearing up for a very big weekend," said 
Cindy Chong, a spokeswoman for the Glendale Galleria. "We expect to have many 
more shoppers shopping than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley malls that opened their doors just days after the Jan. 17 quake, as 
well as those that have reopened after completing repairs, report that the 
consolidation of shoppers into fewer operating malls has boosted sales 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Panorama Mall in Panorama City, for example, sales are 40% higher than 
before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mall has been packed," said manager Mary Callahan. "Every weekend has 
been big here since Northridge (Fashion Center) and Laurel Plaza closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The 210-store Northridge Fashion Center, which has been closed since the 
quake, is not expected to reopen until next March. The Laurel Plaza Mall in 
North Hollywood also remains closed and does not have a target reopening date. 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, which reopened 11 days after the quake, most 
stores report that sales have increased between 15% and 20% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good year," said Topanga marketing director Annette Bethers. 
"A lot of our stores were the only stores available in the area because of the 
closures in other malls." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethers said the mall is getting ready for the weekend by asking employees not 
to park in mall parking lots as well as beefing up security and housekeeping 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Media City Center in Burbank is also expecting the weekend to continue its 
10% to 15% increase in sales since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot more people are familiar with Media City as a result of the other 
closures," said general manager Daniel Millman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although individual stores have launched back-to-school sales, managers of 
some Valley malls say the increased shopping traffic has made mall promotions 
unnecessary. But others, such as the Sherman Oaks Galleria and the Sherman Oaks 
Fashion Square, both of which suffered damage in the quake, have launched 
campaigns to remind shoppers that they are up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galleria reopened 11 days after the quake, but its Robinson's-May 
department store did not resume business until the end of July. Last weekend, 
the mall launched a program to reward frequent shoppers with coupons good for 
merchandise at its stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Fashion Square suffered about $5 million in quake damage, 
which closed the entire mall for about two months after the quake. Most of the 
shopping center has reopened, but a parking structure was demolished and a new 
one is under construction. Even with construction in progress, managers report 
that sales have increased 10% since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had a pent-up anxiety to shop or something after the quake," said mall 
vice president Brian Pickering. "They went on a bit of a spending spree." 
</P>
<P>
 To continue to attract shoppers, even those wary of limited parking, the 
Fashion Square began offering free valet parking for the back-to-school season. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, as malls prepared for the throngs of weekend bargain shoppers, 
the crowd-wary took care of business a few days early. 
</P>
<P>
 Shut out by earthquake damage at the Northridge Fashion Center, where they 
usually shop, Gina Barnetta and daughter Rhiannon , 17, of Santa Clarita made 
their back-to-school trip to Topanga Plaza early to avoid the weekend rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stand crowds," said Gina. "I took my other girls in the middle of the 
week, too."

CALARTS GETS $25-MILLION FEMA GRANT; REBUILDING: FUNDS WILL REIMBURSE THE 
SCHOOL FOR COSTS OF QUAKE REPAIRS. SEN. FEINSTEIN AND OFFICIALS WILL TOUR 
CAMPUS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California Institute of the Arts, which was heavily damaged during the 
Northridge earthquake, has been awarded almost $25 million in federal funds for 
repairs, officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirmed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA Director James Lee Witt and Sen. Dianne Feinstein are scheduled to tour 
the 60-acre campus at 2 p.m. today to view ongoing earthquake repair efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to give them a little tour and thank them for their support," 
said John Fuller, CalArts vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the private arts college estimated the earthquake caused $20 
million in damage to the campus, not including the cost to relocate classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Fuller credited both FEMA and Feinstein for the rapid approvals the Valencia 
college has received to reimburse money spent for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston said Wednesday that CalArts has been authorized 
to receive $24,973,574 to rebuild earthquake-damaged structures. The majority 
of the funds -- about $23 million -- will repair structural damage to CalArts' 
500,000-square-foot main building. 
</P>
<P>
 The main building houses art galleries, dance studios, rehearsal rooms, 
theaters, the cafeteria and classrooms, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The college was in its first week of the spring semester when the Jan. 17 
earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 As quake repairs began, courses were held in a variety of impromptu locations. 
Temple Beth Shalom in Newhall, a vacant Lockheed research center in Valencia, 
the Magic Moments Theatre at Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park, the Santa 
Clarita YMCA, a health club at the Vista Village shopping center and Le Studio 
in Pasadena all served as CalArts classrooms in the weeks following the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors are expected to complete the bulk of the repairs Friday, and 
new-student orientation for the fall semester is scheduled Tuesday, Fuller 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although final enrollment figures are not available, campus officials 
predicted they will be near the pre-quake level of about 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be back where we ought to be," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts was founded in 1961 by Walt Disney as a merger of the Los Angeles 
Conservatory of Music and the Chouinard Art Institute. It moved to its 
permanent campus in Valencia in November, 1971.

SCOTT HARRIS: GARDEN OF MEMORIES; MAN WITH HIV TRIES TO ADJUST TO NEW WORLD OF 
DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun has cooked the petals brown, and the branches could stand some 
pruning. But otherwise, Mario Ceremano's rosebushes appear strong and healthy. 
Mario was pleased to hear that, because there are few things he misses quite 
like his roses. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers are a comfort. One Saturday some years back, he had clipped dozens 
of roses and wasn't sure what to do with them. Then he read somewhere that 
singer Minnie Riperton was buried in Westwood Memorial Park, also a final 
resting place for Marilyn Monroe. Mario admired Riperton's music, so he decided 
the flowers should be for her. This became a Saturday routine, delivering roses 
to Minnie Riperton, sitting for hours beside her marker. The roses were for 
Minnie, the ritual for Mario. It helped him come to terms with the knowledge 
that he had contracted HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensed vocational nurse, Mario understood that HIV might affect him in a 
variety of ways. Three years ago, he rubbed his right eye as if awakening from 
a nap, but the fog didn't clear. His vision grew darker day by day, month by 
month. A few weeks ago, he awakened, rose from bed and felt his way around the 
room. "I was blind. I had totally no vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Now his days are as dark as his nights, and the only time he can see is in his 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Look around you. Take it all in. There is beauty and ugliness and everything 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Now close your eyes and keep them closed. No peeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "When guests come over," Mario says, "I'm constantly telling people: 'Do you 
have enough light? Put on your glasses. Make sure you turn on the light.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He makes other prosaic recommendations: Take better care of yourself. Use a 
condom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario's blindness was caused by CMV retinitis, an affliction that occurs 
frequently in AIDS patients, often in the later stages of the illness. Mario's 
case is somewhat unusual, for apart from CMV, he seems to have dodged other 
afflictions common with AIDS, so far. 
</P>
<P>
 His sense of humor shows itself from time to time, but Mario's manner is glum, 
a distinct contrast to the plucky, upbeat types who gamely step to the fore in 
sad causes. Mario is nobody's poster boy. He's just trying to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the roses in his garden, the decor in his neat Sun Valley bungalow 
suggests someone who keenly appreciated the visual world. Photos of family, 
friends and former lovers are exhibited in the living room. In the dining room 
are two curiosities: an impressive collection of Betty Boop memorabilia and a 
photographic shrine to actress Elizabeth Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He collects Betty Boop, it seems, because he couldn't afford Limoges china. 
"My dream was to collect Limoges, and then when I turned 40, I would open up a 
little antique store and sell it off." He'll be 40 in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the fascination for Elizabeth Montgomery? "Oh, I don't know. It was 
something about that nose," he jokes, a reference to Montgomery's trademark 
twitch in the old sitcom "Bewitched." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just always been obsessed with her," he says, more serious now. "I just 
think she's beautiful and talented, and I like these trashy movie roles she 
takes on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario had a chance to meet the actress a few years ago when she served as 
grand marshal for a gay pride parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked like we had known each other for years. She told me about her 
kids," he recalls. "She was just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario still speaks to her from time to time. She's a friend, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 He grew up in the Valley, in Shadow Hills, and figured out he was gay while 
attending Polytechnic High School. In the '70s and early '80s, he frequented 
the gay discos in West Hollywood. There was casual sex and serious, long-term 
relationships. "I really don't have any regrets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What he misses most, he says, is his independence. He doesn't like to depend 
on others, though he is grateful for the help. He receives regular visits from 
a nurse, a maid and a gardener. Family and friends come by and sometimes take 
him out to dine or shop. He is effusive in his praise for the Center for the 
Partially Sighted, a Santa Monica-based agency that has provided services, 
equipment and training to help him live as independently as possible.

 But even when visitors come, darkness is a lonely place. "If people move 
around quietly, I always ask, 'Are you there?' " he says. "Being with a group 
of people, I feel the isolation." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes in God and says he is comfortable with dying. His visits with 
Minnie Riperton helped, he says. And this week he visited Westwood Memorial 
Park once again, with his parents and sister this time, to make plans for his 
own burial.

<P>
 "I'll believe I'll go to a better place," he says. "I really do."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; LIMITS SOUGHT ON MANSION'S PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to halt allegedly massive and raucous parties -- some sporting 
1,000 guests and valet parking -- at a private Studio City mansion, the city 
attorney's office is seeking a preliminary injunction to strictly limit 
activities at the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The request filed Tuesday asks the court to ban the illegal sale or 
consumption of alcohol, any parties with more than 25 people, any parties after 
10 p.m. and advertising any events held at the house, among other limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for seeking an injunction, according to Deputy City Atty. Deborah 
Sanchez, is to place restrictions on the mansion while a suit against the 
owners and occupants works its way through the courts. Violating the injunction 
would subject the defendants to fines, jail time, or closure of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty quiet" at the house, however, since the lawsuit was filed 
Aug. 2, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors began complaining about the $2.1-million mansion at 3240 Wrightwood 
Drive as early as 1990. Party-goers would copulate and urinate on their lawns, 
neighbors said, fling cigarette butts onto the dry hillsides, run elaborate 
parking shuttles up and down the roads, and block them from using their own 
driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bolduc, an occupant of the 7,106-square-foot house, has said he is being 
harassed over parties held before he moved into the home in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court is scheduled for Sept. 26 at 9:30 
a.m. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CANOGA PARK POST OFFICE TO CLEAR BACKLOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The devastating Northridge earthquake rendered many homeless, without a place 
to go. Families. Pets. Even birthday cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canoga Park post office has a shelf holding more than 12,000 pieces of 
mail -- from personal letters to disaster-aid checks -- all addressed to 
apartment dwellers who have fled their quake-damaged buildings, but have not 
filed a change-of-address. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the post office holds mail addressed to people who have moved for one 
month. But the Canoga Park office was among those that changed their policy to 
accommodate the large number of people who have either left town since the 
quake or still do not have a permanent address. 
</P>
<P>
 But that "postal amnesty" will end Sept. 30. After that, postal authorities 
say any mail that has not been picked up or forwarded will be returned to the 
sender stamped with the message: "Moved -- left no address." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't keep warehousing people's mail (forever)," Canoga Park Postmaster 
Michael Madrigal said. He has had to hire an extra person just to accommodate 
all the people who come in to pick up their mail over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermes Sosa, a window clerk, said he takes care of about 300 such customers a 
day. "Most of them are living with friends and family. But some are (living) in 
parked cars," Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just took off and didn't leave messages with anyone," 
Madrigal said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has asked Canoga Park postal workers to ask around in an attempt to find 
out where the people may have gone. "It's scary that we don't know where they 
are," Madrigal said. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged any displaced quake victims who have not filed a change of address 
form to do so as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The forms are available at all post offices and can be dropped into the 
nearest mailbox. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; LOW-INCOME HOUSING UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a shaky start, construction has begun on a low-income family housing 
project in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-unit housing project at 7843 Vineland Ave. will take about nine months 
to complete.But officials of the L.A. Family Housing Corp., which is 
spearheading the project, are happy to get the building under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels incredible because the need is so big," said Vera Fleischman, 
director of housing for the nonprofit group. "We have at least 20 people coming 
every day wanting to be on the waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
 The project suffered a minor embarrassment in April when officials held a 
groundbreaking before the city had approved the expansion of the facility from 
14 to 18 units. The issue was settled in July, when the City Council approved 
the plans for the additional units. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility, to be called Vineland Place, will offer a variety of 
services for the homeless and for low-income families getting back on their 
feet.  
</P>
<P>
 Those services include job training and placement and instruction on how to 
manage their personal finances provided by L.A. Family Housing. The facility 
also features a play area for children, a vegetable garden and a common 
recreation room. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to cost $2.5 million. L.A. Family Housing Corp. is 
working in partnership with the California Equity Fund/LISC and the Los Angeles 
Housing Department, with additional support from the Bank of America and 
Citibank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vineland Place project is the fourth permanent housing project developed 
by L.A. Family Housing Corp. in the San Fernando Valley. The three others are 
located in North Hollywood. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; DEMOLITION BEGINS AT QUAKE-DAMAGED SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crews began razing a Sherman Oaks condominium complex today in the first 
city-sponsored effort to demolish vacant, earthquake-damaged buildings that 
could attract criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-unit complex at 14263 Moorpark St. suffered severe damage in the Jan. 
17 temblor and quickly became a danger and a blight, said Laurie Saffian, 
spokeswoman for City Councilman Zev Yaroslovsky.The councilman is sponsoring 
the demolition program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had problems with transients, (and) there was lots of graffiti, so there 
was concern over gang activity," Saffian said. "It's clear there were people 
hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the complex decided not to rebuild because the renovation would 
cost more than the building's market value, according to Saffian. But the 
owners' insurance did not cover demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the city-sponsored program, once the owners agreed to raze the 
complex, funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency went to pay for the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Razing buildings is a last resort," Yaroslavsky said.  
</P>
<P>
 "However, we are committed to help Sherman Oaks get back on its feet, and part 
of that strategy is removing blight, and especially those vacant buildings 
which are or can become attractive nuisances." ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LIQUOR STORE THIEVES FOCUS ON CIGARETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thieves who slip in through the rooftops of liquor stores to help themselves 
to cartons of cigarettes have been victimizing shopkeepers from Moorpark to as 
far away as Glendale, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one of the thefts, sheriff's investigators have narrowed their 
focus to four men who were captured on videotape as they cased Moorpark Liquors 
in the 300 block of West Los Angeles Ave., said Sgt. Terry Hughes of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Aug. 20, employees of the store discovered that an estimated 
$7,800 worth of cigarettes was missing, along with cash and some X-rated 
videos, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects could be heard on the video "making reference to cigarettes. . . 
. If you saw the tape, I think you'd see it's pretty obvious they were casing 
the place," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, thieves took an estimated $21,000 worth of cigarettes 
Aug. 9 from The Spirit Shoppe in the 300 block of Hampshire Road in Thousand 
Oaks, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $22,000 worth of cigarettes was stolen from the Liquor Chest in Agoura 
Hills the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar burglaries have been reported at liquor stores in Encino, Granada 
Hills and Glendale, all of them since the beginning of August. 
</P>
<P>
 "All indications are that there are a multitude of victims in the greater Los 
Angeles area," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he has been in contact with police and sheriff's deputies in 
both Los Angeles and Ventura counties to share information on the robberies.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY MAY ESTABLISH DISTRICT FOR CINEMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inspired by the active night life in Pasadena, Santa Monica and other 
communities that "cluster" movie theaters in a central location, Glendale is 
drafting an ordinance that would permit new cinemas to be built only along 
Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale already has two multiplex cinemas in the downtown area -- the Mann 8 
Theaters and the Glendale Central Cinemas -- but both are on side streets, off 
the beaten path. City officials say Glendale has room for at least two more 
theaters, and they want to ensure that, unlike the existing two, they face or 
adjoin the thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Armstrong, the city's redevelopment director, said the idea fits the 
long-term goal of making Brand a more pedestrian-oriented, lively retail area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are borrowing this idea from other cities that have successfully 
implemented similar restrictions," said Armstrong. "Santa Monica has an 
ordinance that says all cinemas should be on the (Third Street) Promenade, and 
that was the catalyst for them. They had cinemas trying to locate all over 
town, and so they zoned them into one location." 
</P>
<P>
 The "cinema zone" ordinance, which could be adopted by the City Council before 
the end of the year, also fits the city's ambition of becoming a theater 
district with a mix of live stage and movie entertainment. The city has already 
given financial aid to two theater groups, A Noise Within and the Colony 
Theater, to help them find homes in downtown Glendale. They will join the 
existing Alex Theater and Glendale Center Theatre performing houses, Armstrong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would not preclude the owners of the Fashion Center mall east of 
downtown Glendale from building a planned multiscreen theater. Although the 
mall recently changed ownership, plans for a theater there were approved before 
the cinema zone was conceived, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible locations for new multiplexes on Brand include the Glendale 
Marketplace, a proposed two-block retail project south of Broadway; an 
expansion of the Glendale Galleria onto Brand, south of the existing Mervyn's 
department store, and the second phase of the Glendale City Center, an 18-story 
office tower fronted by a Super Crown bookstore and several restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those three projects, only the City Center has announced any concrete plans 
for construction. Homart Development plans to break ground early next year on a 
four-story office and retail building at Brand and Wilson Avenue. But Alan 
Pyenson, the firm's marketing director, said it has not decided yet whether a 
movie house will be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the possibility of (cinemas) happening, but right now we're pursuing 
several tenants, just trying to put together the center," Pyenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he thinks the city is "going in the right direction" to restrict new 
theaters to a single area.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to get the ambience that other cities have succeeded in getting. 
You'll be able to park your car once and walk to a choice of screens," Pyenson 
said. "It's going to give Brand a cohesive front." STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; INVESTIGATORS PROBE 2 FIRES AT SAME SITE

 A suspected arson fire -- the second blaze in less than 24 hours at Caesar's 
family restaurant -- gutted the restaurant and damaged an adjacent pizza shop 
in the same building late Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second blaze at Caesar's, located in the building in the 6700 block of 
Corbin Street, broke out about 11:50 p.m. and was fully involved when Los 
Angeles firefighters arrived, said Brian Humphrey, a Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 firefighters battled the blaze for about 20 minutes before it was 
extinguished, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were able to save a vacant sushi restaurant located in the same 
building, but flames roared from window frames at Caesar's. Humphrey said the 
blaze resulted in $350,000 damage to that portion of the building and its 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went fast," said Mei-Ling Suahua, a 7-Eleven store owner who called to 
report the second fire when a customer told her that Caesar's restaurant was on 
fire again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, she pointed to the spot where firefighters tossed burned wood 
from the first fire that started about 12:50 a.m. Tuesday. That fire resulted 
in heavy damage to the roof of the building. Investigators estimated the damage 
at $14,000 from that fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Arson investigators declined to comment on either fire. Humphrey said both 
fires are being investigated. CHIP JOHNSON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; GROUP TO CONVERT RED-TAGGED BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit group is purchasing a red-tagged apartment building in Canoga Park 
to convert it into the group's first low-income family housing project in the 
west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The building at 7440 Alabama Court was condemned after the Northridge 
earthquake.But with the support of City Councilwoman Laura Chick, Los Angeles 
Family Housing Corp. will open the doors of the apartment building once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Council member Chick is looking for a way to bring back some of the 
neighborhoods that were ravaged in the earthquake and to make them more 
attractive," said Ken Bernstein, Chick's planning deputy. "That whole side of 
the street has been vacated because of the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Family Housing Corp. is now in escrow on the property, which would be 
downscaled from 39 units to 25 at a cost of about $2.25 million, said Vera 
Fleischman, director of housing for the nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 The site would also include social services for children and adults, 
Fleischman said. The apartment complex was formerly considered affordable 
housing, but had deteriorated to the point that it's now considered an eyesore 
to the community, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing in L.A. Family Housing Corp. to develop and operate the complex will 
ensure that the facility does not deteriorate further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An absentee, for-profit landlord often neglects the property," he said. "L.A. 
Family Housing has a great track record of checking tenants to make sure they 
have no problems with crime and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group operates three other housing apartment complexes in the 
Valley, all in North Hollywood. A fourth project is under way in Sun Valley, 
and the Alabama Street project would be the first in the West Valley. JEFF

 A car owned by two slain Salvadoran brothers, whose bodies were found last 
week in the Santa Monica Mountains, was found Wednesday parked along a Canoga 
Park street, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Rich Erickson of the Sheriff's Headquarters Bureau said residents in 
the 24000 block of Hamlin Street called the Los Angeles Police Department about 
the 1981 brown, two-door, Chevrolet Chevette.They told police the car had been 
parked there since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been searching for the car in connection with the slayings of Luis 
Molina, 19 and his brother Mauricio, 23, who were found along the Backbone 
Trail near a popular swimming hole. The brothers were each shot once in the 
head; one of them was also shot in the back. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COUNCIL ASKS ADVICE ON AIRPORT CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council is seeking the California attorney general's opinion 
on a recent conflict-of-interest question: Is it appropriate for council 
members to also serve on Burbank Airport's governing board? 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the Airport Authority's plans to expand an aging terminal contend 
that Burbank councilmen Robert Bowne and George Battey Jr. cannot 
simultaneously balance the interests of the airport and the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue consumed most of Tuesday's City Council meeting and much of last 
week's meeting. At last week's meeting, the council ordered a study on whether 
airport commissioners should be elected -- rather than appointed -- to give the 
public greater input. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 4 to 0, with Battey abstaining, to ask the state 
attorney general for guidance on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just an airport issue," said Councilwoman Susan Spanos. "It's 
really more of a desire to seek resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members stressed that they are not seeking outside advice to admonish 
City Atty. Joe Fletcher, who has said no conflict exists. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FEEDBACK SOUGHT ON BICYCLE ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Navigating the busy streets of Glendale on a bicycle isn't always easy. But a 
local transportation group is working to make cyclists feel just as welcome on 
the road as motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo-Verdugo Transportation Coalition, a panel of city officials and 
business people from Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena, La Canada Flintridge and 
South Pasadena, is working on a plan to create dozens of new bike paths. They 
also hope to make traveling the designated paths smoother for recreational and 
commuter cyclists alike. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish its goal, the group is looking for a few good riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need feedback from cyclists to tell us if we're on the right track," said 
Steve Adams, an assistant in the Glendale city manager's office and a 
coordinator of the bikeway project. 
</P>
<P>
 At two meetings next month, the coalition will put their preliminary plans for 
cycling routes within the five cities on display. Maps showing existing routes, 
plus proposed routes, will be shown and cyclists will be asked to critique 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be showing routes that are already planned and may or may not have 
funding, and also ideas we've come up with for possible future routes," Adams 
said. "The purpose is to get people who regularly participate in cycling to 
tell us whether these are logical routes, or if we've missed something." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making it easier for cyclists to travel in and between the 
five-city area, the plan also calls for bike racks and lockers, water fountains 
and restrooms to be built along the paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bike paths might be designated portions of existing roads, while 
others could be trails running through parks and recreation areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cycling is a meaningful transportation alternative, and this plan is 
important in meeting the needs of cyclists and creating connections between the 
communities," said Katie Nack, Pasadena mayor and chairwoman of the 
transportation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The bikeway plan is being prepared with a $32,000 grant from the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they have been posting flyers at local bicycle shops and 
sending them to cycling clubs in hopes of raising interest in the plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The two meetings on the bikeway plan are scheduled for 9 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 
24 at the Pasadena Aquatics Center, 360 N. Arroyo Blvd. and 6:30 p.m. 
Wednesday, Sept. 28 at the Burbank Library, 110 N. Glenoaks Blvd. STEVE RYFLE

2 MEN RAPE AND ROB WOMAN AFTER BINDING HER, BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old woman was raped by two men who bound her and her boyfriend in 
her apartment and robbed them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault took place in the 6700 block of Independence Avenue about 11 p.m. 
Tuesday after the two men saw the woman outside her ground-floor apartment, 
said Los Angeles Police Lt. Terry Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers forced the woman back inside the apartment and separated her 
from her unidentified 20-year-old boyfriend, tying them up in separate rooms, 
Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men sexually assaulted the woman, who feared for her life, Pratt said. 
The men also took money and other property from the home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the attackers left, the couple were able to free themselves and contact 
police, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was taken to an undisclosed hospital where she received treatment, 
Pratt said.

CITY COUNCIL SUPPORTS STIFFER FINES FOR FALSE ALARMS TO POLICE; SECURITY: 
PROPOSAL CALLS FOR AN $80 PENALTY FOR EACH UNNECESSARY SUMMONS AFTER SECOND 
CALL WITHIN A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to reduce or at least underwrite thousands of costly false-alarm calls 
to police, the Los Angeles City Council moved Wednesday to impose stiffer fines 
on residents and business owners who summon help needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of the security alarm industry, the proposal sent to the 
city attorney's office for review calls for alarm system owners to be fined $80 
for each false alarm after the second call within a 12-month period. Police 
currently impose the fine after the fourth call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two (false alarms) should be enough," Councilwoman Rita Walters said. "It'll 
be like the Auto Club: If you call them too often, they tell you to buy a new 
car."  
</P>
<P>
 Industry representatives were irate about the possibility of stricter fines, 
which they said disgruntled customers may force them to absorb.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's too drastic . . . and there's no rationale for the council to do it, 
except to make more money than they really need," said Vince Nigro, president 
of the Los Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, 95% of the 161,000 alarm calls made last year were false, 
making up nearly 20% of all calls for police service and costing the city an 
estimated $2.8 million in lost police time. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members acknowledged Wednesday that the proposed ordinance, expected 
to be enacted this fall, will not eliminate false alarms, which are generally 
triggered by human error, faulty equipment or bad weather. But the new law may 
reduce human error and put indirect pressure on the alarm companies to improve 
the technology or hasten repairs, council members said. State law prohibits the 
city from imposing the fines directly on the alarm companies, even though they 
are responsible for false alarms caused by faulty equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't solve the false-alarm problem, but it's a major step in the right 
direction," Councilwoman Laura Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, co-authored by council members Marvin Braude, Mark Ridley-Thomas 
and Chick, also would make it a misdemeanor -- punishable by a maximum fine of 
$1,000 and one year in jail -- to fail to register a residential or commercial 
burglar alarm with police, which costs $31 annually. Currently, only about 
one-third of the 300,000 systems in Los Angeles are now registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Unregistered alarm-system owners would be fined after the first false alarm, a 
slightly harsher fine than that proposed for registered owners.  
</P>
<P>
 Ending months of debate, the council also rejected a controversial earlier 
proposal by Braude that would have withheld any police response until an alarm 
company verified that the call was genuine. The proposal had originally been 
supported by police officials, but Chief Willie L. Williams testified before 
the council against it Wednesday, saying it would jeopardize public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council supported a compromise that would require police to 
respond unless a telephone call to the alarm-system owner determined that the 
call was false. 
</P>
<P>
 The security alarm industry had supported the compromise, saying the cost of 
adding security guards or surveillance cameras to verify that a call was 
genuine would make owning an alarm system too expensive for many residents and 
businesses.

ARRESTED BOOKKEEPER ACCUSED OF PERJURY, THEFT; COURTS: INVESTIGATORS SAY THE 
MAN GAVE FALSE CREDENTIALS DURING CONTENTIOUS CHILD-SUPPORT AND CUSTODY BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Calabasas bookkeeper has been arrested on suspicion of perjury and grand 
theft for allegedly claiming false credentials so he could collect an expert 
witness fee in an acrimonious child-support and custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
 During the case of Novorr vs. Novorr, heard in November in the Downtown 
courtroom of Superior Court Judge Raymond Mirales, Steven Z. Kaller allegedly 
claimed to be a certified public accountant and tenured professor of accounting 
at Cal State Northridge, police and prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, he's an unlicensed nothing," said John Benane, an investigator for 
the state Department of Consumer Affairs. "He's a bookkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 The two perjury counts stem from statements Kaller allegedly made about his 
credentials in a court declaration and during his testimony. The theft charge 
alleges he accepted a $1,000 fee as an expert witness fee when he wasn't one. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaller, 46, of Thousand Oaks, was handcuffed at his Calabasas office Tuesday 
night, booked at the Lost Hills sheriff's station and released on $90,000 bail, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino lawyer Gary J. Weyman uncovered Kaller's alleged resume-padding, court 
records say, during a case that was so hotly contested the lawyers involved 
referred to it as "a real liars' contest." 
</P>
<P>
 Weyman declined comment. But his story is laid out in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyman, who represented a man whose ex-wife was seeking higher child-support 
payments from him, asserted in a court declaration that Kaller was hired by the 
ex-wife's lawyer. Kaller's job was to audit the ex-husband's tax returns to 
determine the man's income before a hearing at which Mirales would decide 
whether the child-support payments should be increased. 
</P>
<P>
 In sworn court declarations Nov. 20 and in testimony three days later, Kaller 
stated that he was a certified public accountant, held two masters' degrees and 
was a tenured accounting professor who had taught at CSUN since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyman said in court papers that when he checked Kaller's credentials, he 
discovered that all of these claims were untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Board of Accountancy said Kaller had never been licensed as a CPA, 
and CSUN's personnel director and business school dean said he'd never taught 
there, Benane, the consumer affairs investigator, stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaller wrote to the judge after his credentials were disputed, saying, "I 
didn't believe at the time I stated I was a CPA that this was was going to 
degenerate into such a hostile situation."  
</P>
<P>
 Benane said in an interview that Kaller's expert testimony was disregarded, 
the ex-husband wound up paying less child support, and Kaller became the target 
of a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaller is scheduled to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court on Oct. 17. The 
felony charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

FIREFIGHTERS' LAWYER PLANS CLAIM AGAINST COUNTY; GOVERNMENT: FORMER ARSON 
SUSPECTS IN CALABASAS-MALIBU BLAZE SUFFER FROM STIGMA, HE SAYS. LAWSUIT MAY 
FOLLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An attorney for two firefighters named as arson suspects in the devastating 
Calabasas-Malibu fire last fall said Wednesday that he will bring legal action 
against Los Angeles County for damage to their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Feldman, who represented the 13-year-old boy who won a 
multimillion-dollar out-of-court settlement in a molestation claim against 
pop-music superstar Michael Jackson, said he expects to file a claim against 
the county within the next two weeks, a step required before a lawsuit. A suit 
can be filed only if the county fails to respond to the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Shelp, a Los Angeles County Fire Department office worker, and Nicholas 
Durepo, a volunteer firefighter in Manhattan Beach, were identified by 
sheriff's officials as suspected arsonists in one of the worst fires in Los 
Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man was charged with a crime, and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office recently announced that county officials had insufficient 
evidence to prosecute and were no longer investigating them. The announcement 
did not, however, exonerate the men, who have denied they set the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman said the department has received no formal notice of the 
action and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, who said in a phone interview late Wednesday that he was retained 
through a family friend to represent the firefighters last week, promised to 
investigate "the abuse of their civil rights and take the appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he "fully expected" to file a claim against the county within the 
next two weeks. The county would have 45 days to respond. A response from the 
county "is possible, not probable, given my 25 years of experience," Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit that could name Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, in 
addition to the county, could be filed after that period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman, who gained national prominence in his representation of a 13-year-old 
boy who claimed he was molested at Jackson's Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara 
County, blasted Block for his account of what took place on Nov. 2, the night 
the fire began. 
</P>
<P>
 Block did not mention Shelp and Durepo by name as suspects late last year, but 
said he believed that they started the fire in order to put it out and become 
heroes, which would increase their chances of gaining full-time firefighting 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking into Sheriff Block's actions," Feldman said. "By his 
statements, he has ruined two men's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still both want to be firefighters, but the stigma is just ruining their 
lives," he said. "Once you're painted with a brush of starting a fire in our 
community, it is very difficult to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp currently has an administrative job for the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department, but he has never received a field assignment, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo has resigned both his positions as a volunteer firefighter in Manhattan 
Beach and a reserve firefighter with another department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been a nightmare for them and they are two heroes who've had to go 
through this because of these unsubstantiated allegations," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're feeling is that it's irresponsible for a sheriff to go (to the 
media) and accuse them of this horrendous act when they had not fully 
investigated the incident."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3 MEN HELD AFTER ROBBERY AT HOME; CRIME: 
DEPUTIES ARE SEARCHING FOR THREE MORE SUSPECTS AFTER FOUR PEOPLE IN A LANCASTER 
HOUSE ARE TERRORIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have arrested three men suspected of invading a Lancaster 
home at gunpoint and terrorizing and robbing the four occupants, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies apprehended three suspects within minutes of the incident, which 
occurred at about 11:40 p.m. Tuesday at a house in the 45000 block of Fig 
Avenue, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other suspects were still at large Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In custody were Lavell Wright, 25; Felipe Sanchez, 21, and Jacob Witty, 25, 
all of Lancaster, Sheriff's Sgt. Bobby Denham said. Wright and Sanchez, who are 
both on parole, were being held without bail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station, while Witty's bail was set at $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All three will be charged with robbery and, possibly, unlawful imprisonment, 
Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the four occupants, two men and two women, were not available, 
Denham said. They were "roughed up" but did not require medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, who wore pillow cases with eye holes over their heads, tied the 
victims' hands behind their backs with telephone cords and made them lie on the 
living room floor as they robbed them of wallets, jewelry, purses and money, 
Denham said.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims lives at the house and the others were visiting when the 
incident occurred, Denham said.  
</P>
<P>
 The men stayed in the house only a few minutes, then fled, authorities said. A 
neighbor heard the commotion and called deputies, who arrived on the scene in 
time to see the suspects leaving in a car, Denham said.  
</P>
<P>
 The men led deputies on a brief chase before abandoning their car and fleeing 
on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 A handgun registered to Witty was found in the abandoned car, Denham said. 
Deputies found two gold necklaces outside the home, apparently dropped as the 
suspects fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects in custody, who hid in various locations around the 
neighborhood, were arrested over a period of three hours as dogs tracked them 
down, Denham said. Deputies using loudspeakers and knocking on doors warned 
neighbors to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, Jose Ruiz, said traffic and noise are common around the house 
where the robbers struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had trouble with traffic; people come all the time with motorcycles 
and some with radios really high," Ruiz said. "We thought something could 
happen and something did happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Sandy Paolone, said he and his fiancee, Paula Brodersen, 
were awakened by the sound of helicopters hovering over homes as deputies 
searched for the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula asked me, 'Do you want to go out and see what's going on?' but I said, 
'No way,' " Paolone recalled Wednesday. "When you see cops running all over the 
place, the best thing you can do is stay in your own home for your own safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Paolone and other neighbors said they were disturbed to learn of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when I found out because stuff like that doesn't happen around 
here," said Otis Edwards. "From now on, I'm keeping everything around here 
locked, night and day."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEWHALL DEPUTY ON A FAMILIAR BEAT; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: JOSEPH TREJO WILL WORK OUT OF NEW SUBSTATION IN TROUBLED 
HISTORICAL NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking the streets in the oldest neighborhood in Santa Clarita is a beat that 
Deputy Joseph Trejo took on gladly, saying it brings back fond memories of 
growing up in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has become 
a familiar sight to merchants and residents of East Newhall during the last few 
weeks as he prepares for Saturday's opening of a small sheriff's station there. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The city is paying about $150,000 a year to operate the substation, 
established in response to complaints that the historical neighborhood is 
deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo, 34, said the substation's emphasis on community-based policing is 
familiar to him. He was inspired as a youth by a Los Angeles Police Department 
officer who helped keep order in a troubled neighborhood by making the rounds 
at schools, homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was no longer the neighborhood policeman," Trejo said. "He was my buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities hope the same approach will work in East Newhall, a mostly Latino, 
blue-collar neighborhood that has been plagued recently by everything from 
trash in the streets to some of the area's worst drug and gang activity. 
Merchants said the problems have been accumulating for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 5 p.m. no old people will come here because they're scared," said Gary 
Yazgulian, 59, owner of an Army-Navy surplus store in the neighborhood's 
downtown area, which consists of several blocks of longtime businesses in 
mostly one- and two-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe (Trejo) is going to be a big help," Yazgulian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of other residents and merchants, happy for the increased police 
presence, are giving Trejo an earful as he introduces himself to them during 
his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey Haskell, 84, a lifelong Santa Clarita resident who owns several 
businesses along a single block, complained about curbside day laborers who use 
the space behind a dumpster in an alley as a restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd appreciate anything you can do to straighten this mess out," Haskell told 
the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo said the complaint has been echoed by employees at other businesses. 
Part of Trejo's walk Wednesday included a brief, but civil, talk about the 
business owners' concerns with three men seeking work on a street corner, who 
nodded understandingly as the deputy moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm not going to fix everything because I'm just one person," he 
said. "But identifying problems is a start." 
</P>
<P>
 Gang activity is a major concern to many residents and businesses alike. Four 
people were injured in separate gang-related shootings in East Newhall's 
residential area in early July. Another concern is drug activity in alleys. 
Complaints from residents led to the arrest of 11 people during a sting 
operation in August, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo said he will help out gang units and other deputies investigating such 
crimes, hoping his community ties will produce leads that otherwise would be 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got people living in fear in their own homes because they're afraid of 
their neighbors," he said. "I'm hoping that because I'm here, they won't be as 
afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is attempting to revive the neighborhood's historic character -- 
while eliminating the influx of problems -- through projects such as building a 
community center in which the sheriff's substation will be located. 
Recreational and educational programs are planned at the center, including a 
boxing program scheduled to begin when the center opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo said he plans to spend a couple of hours every day on foot talking with 
the locals, a similar amount of time patrolling the neighborhood in his police 
car and the rest of the day at the substation.  
</P>
<P>
 The substation also will be staffed by a community-services officer as well as 
a civilian selected on a rotating basis from among several residents who have 
volunteered to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be able to file police reports and get help for many routine 
problems at the substation, said Robert Elson, operations lieutenant of the 
Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station.  
</P>
<P>
 Other problems not related to police work, such as potholes or street lights, 
can also be brought to substation workers, who will notify the proper 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the employees at the substation will be fluent in Spanish, 
helping to solve a communication barrier in the mostly Latino neighborhood, 
Elson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will still need to go to the main Santa Clarita station for some 
requests, such as filing complaints against officers, meeting with detectives 
or getting fingerprinted, Elson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo said the neighborhood is better than its reputation might lead outsiders 
to believe, and he hopes the substation's presence will convince people of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this area is not that bad," he said. "It's got some problems, but 
we've really got a chance to put a stop to it."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COMMUNITY DEVOTES ITSELF TO NEW CENTER; 
NEWHALL: FREE EDUCATION AND RECREATION PROGRAMS ARE ENVISIONED. THE INCOMPLETE 
FACILITY WILL OPEN SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Volunteering merchants and residents have joined city officials in a 
7,200-square-foot leap of faith that will be launched Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the 7 p.m. opening of a community center at 24406 San Fernando Road in 
Newhall, which will include a boxing exhibition, ballet program and peek at a 
facility that officials admit is still a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still going to be construction going on; the restrooms won't be 
finished," said Chris Daste, city recreation supervisor. "We want people to see 
it from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The community center is envisioned as a place where various recreational and 
educational programs will be offered to local residents at little or no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people in downtown Newhall have been asking for help for a long 
time," said Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson. "This is also a step in the 
direction of revitalizing East and downtown Newhall." 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Newhall consists of some the city's oldest businesses, while East 
Newhall is a mostly Latino, blue-collar neighborhood of small houses and 
apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the community center and its free activities are a striking 
contrast to the many once-free public services that have either disappeared or 
for which the city has begun charging fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of it is going to depend on the response we get," Daste said. 
"Through any of our public participation programs over the past four years, 
what has come up is the community wants a community center." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have arranged an initial boxing program for youths and hope to 
offer an array of activities in the future. Aerobic, dance, music, language, 
parenting, peer counseling, interviewing and sex education classes are among 
future activities suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The community center includes a storefront office for the Santa Clarita Valley 
Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think there is a lot of good that can come out of (the community 
center)," said Mark Lenenberg, a merchant who has donated time and products for 
the center's opening. "I'm hoping for this to unite everybody, to bring all 
cultures together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents and merchants have offered support for the facility, and 
organizers say it is volunteerism that will make the center a success. 
Specifically, the center needs people willing to donate their time and skills 
to teach classes or conduct other programs there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to it is going to be the volunteer work," said Maria Fulkerson, a 
member of United Mothers of Santa Clarita -- a Newhall-based citizens group 
that has supported the center. "That means members of the community helping 
other members." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens may be an excellent resource for volunteer instructors, making 
the center a good venue for youths and seniors to interact, as well, Fulkerson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, we'd like to see it be an intergenerational community center," 
Fulkerson said.

ALL THEY CAN DO NOW IS WATCH, WAIT; PAT BARNES: FORMER TRABUCO HILLS 
QUARTERBACK IS WAITING IN THE WINGS AT CAL, LOOKING FOR HIS MOMENT OF FAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bragging rights in the Barnes family still belong to brother John. Pat Barnes, 
sophomore quarterback at California, knows this and accepts it. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Just wait. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barnes, 5 1/2 years older than Pat, was not just another UCLA quarterback 
to beat USC. He's a Bruin legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, a walk-on at UCLA, rallied the Bruins from a 14-point fourth-quarter 
deficit to beat the Trojans, 38-37, in 1992. He threw for 385 yards, 204 in the 
final quarter, and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "John keeps telling me they have renamed Brentwood, 'Barnes-wood,' " Pat 
Barnes said. "I let him go on with that, for now." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, time is on Pat's side. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot was expected from Barnes when he came out of Trabuco Hills. That hasn't 
changed. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound Barnes is merely biding his time and waiting 
his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's tough when you have the profile of Pat Barnes," Cal Coach Keith 
Gilbertson said. "He was a big kid with a big arm in high school. Then he has 
to sit here and wait. But I think the kid is going to do some great things when 
it's his turn." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a difficult burden. One heavier than that placed on John, who meandered 
through programs at Western Oregon, where they wanted him to drop playing 
quarterback, to UC Santa Barbara, where they wanted to drop playing football, 
before becoming a one-game sensation at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, on the other hand, was considered one of the top high school 
quarterbacks in the nation in 1992. Barnes threw for 6,182 yards during his 
career (1990-93), fourth best in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wanted him. Heck, he even turned down Notre Dame to go to Cal. Many 
believed it was a only four-year training stop on the way to a professional 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more difficult on Pat," John Barnes said. "The high expectations 
are on him. I had everything to gain and nothing to lose. It's the flip side 
with Pat. But he likes a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 One was given to him last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes is the Bears' No. 2 quarterback, behind senior Dave Barr -- considered 
by some scouts as the top quarterback in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnes' season can go either way. He will probably redshirt, leaving three 
full seasons as a starter. But he's only a torn ligament from being in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, I would like to redshirt, but that depends on Dave Barr's 
health," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 That little twist of fate, or rather a shoulder separation, has happened 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes was ready to redshirt last season, then Barr went down with a shoulder 
injury. Kerry McGonigal, the No. 2 quarterback, followed him onto the disabled 
list with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before playing Arizona State, the Bears were left with only one healthy 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either play Pat or have our fullback take the snap," Gilbertson said. 
"They were going to make us play with 11 people." 
</P>
<P>
 So Barnes was forced to burn his freshman season and got singed in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to complete the first pass I threw," Barnes said. "I rolled 
out and got completely drilled. I over threw the receiver." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of day. Barnes dodged and ducked, but could not move the 
team. He completed only 10 of 33 passes for 125 yards and was intercepted three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 His highlight? 
</P>
<P>
 "My claim to fame is I avoided (All-Pac-10 defensive tackle) Shante Carver," 
Barnes said. "I juked him twice and he fell." 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, it was Barnes doing the tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if there are any scars left from the Arizona State game, they don't 
show. Barnes has improved, more than Gilbertson could have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, you didn't always know just who Pat was throwing to," Gilbertson 
said. "He had a great arm and would just stand back there and fire the ball. 
He's now making good decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barnes: "The Arizona State game was a learning experience. I really had 
tunnel vision in the first half. I was getting as little gun-shy, looking at 
the rush instead of looking down field." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry from his brother's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, well, it was my last game, that was Pat's first," John Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barnes had played sparingly for the Bruins and only because of injuries. 
Still he came on and turned in a legendary performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Barnes was there, enjoying the moment. It was a family celebration. He 
even had to talk his mother, Colleen, down from the hood of the family car 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was dancing up there," Barnes said. "But it was great to see my brother 
get the success he deserved. I just have to take his advice and take my shot 
when my turn comes." Pat Barnes 
</P>
<P>
 California 
</P>
<P>
 Hgt.: 6-4 Wgt.: 200 
</P>
<P>
 Year: Sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 College career statistics: 10 of 33 (30.3%) for 125 yards with no touchdowns 
and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 California's record with Barnes at quarterback: 0-1 
</P>
<P>
 High-school highlights: Threw for 6,182 yards during his three-year career at 
Trabuco Hills. He was rated as the fourth-best quarterback in the nation one 
magazine and sixth by another . . . He was named second-team All--Orange County 
as a senior, after passing for 2,368 yards and 24 touchdowns . . . He was named 
second-team all-county as a junior after passing for 2,892 yards and 22 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Miscellaneous: He was also a three-year starter on the Trabuco Hills' 
basketball team . . . Brother John passed for 385 yards and three touchdowns in 
leading UCLA to a 38-37 come-from-behind victory over USC . . . He is a 
business major.

TITANS TO NAME ATHLETIC DIRECTOR; ADMINISTRATION: FRESNO STATE'S JOHN 
EASTERBROOK IS EXPECTED TO REPLACE BILL SHUMARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Easterbrook, associate athletic director at Fresno State, is expected to 
be named Cal State Fullerton's athletic director today. 
</P>
<P>
 University President Milton Gordon has called an 11 a.m. news conference to 
introduce the successor to Bill Shumard, who resigned in May and later became 
an assistant athletic director at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook, 55, has been at Fresno State for nine years and was hired by Gary 
Cunningham, the former UCLA basketball coach, shortly after Cunningham became 
athletic director there. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook was one of three finalists submitted to Gordon without ranking by 
a 12-member search group appointed by Gordon. The other two finalists were 
Judith Davidson, athletic director at Central Connecticut State, and Jack Mehl, 
business manager of the Rose Bowl, according to sources close to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson and Mehl said Wednesday night they had not been offered the position. 
Easterbrook, contacted by telephone in Fresno on Wednesday night, said any 
announcement would have to come from the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham declined to discuss Easterbrook until after today's announcement 
"to be fair to everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook is a past member of the Big West Conference basketball tournament 
committee and has been chiefly responsible for NCAA compliance for Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 He was president and chief executive officer for American National Bank in 
Laramie, Wyo., before he took the administrative position at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going into private business, he was an assistant football coach for 13 
years with stops at Idaho, Oregon State, Illinois and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook is a native of Champaign, Ill., and attended high school there. In 
high school, he lettered two years in football, three years in basketball and 
three years in golf and earned the school's outstanding athlete award his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook stayed in Champaign to play football at Illinois, where he was the 
starting quarterback for three years. The Illini coach at that time, the late 
Ray Eliot, frequently would mention Easterbrook in his later years as an 
athlete who played to the maximum of his ability. In college, he was 5 feet 9 
and 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He was chosen most valuable player of the Copper Bowl all-star game in Phoenix 
following his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook also was a member of the Illini basketball team his first two 
years in college before deciding to concentrate on football. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, he was chosen for an NCAA postgraduate scholar-athlete award. He 
received his bachelor's degree from Illinois in commerce and law and attended 
law school from 1960-62 before deciding to enter coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fresno State, Easterbrook's primary responsibilities were supervising the 
Bulldog baseball, cross-country, tennis and track programs as well as assist 
with men's basketball and football. He also oversaw facilities and was involved 
in event management. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook and his wife, Cynthia, have three adult children.

ALL THEY CAN DO NOW IS WATCH, WAIT; TIM CAREY: A LACK OF PHYSICAL MATURITY IS 
THE ONLY THING HOLDING BACK FORMER LOS ALAMITOS STANDOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom watched Tim Carey run the Cardinal's 
scout squad in practice last season and remembers being there himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom, who sat out in 1990 as a redshirt, was once buried on the depth 
chart, much like Carey is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, Stenstrom enters his senior season as a three-year starter 
and a Heisman Trophy candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, a former Los Alamitos High standout, enters his redshirt freshman 
season fourth on the depth chart behind Stenstrom, senior Mark Butterfield and 
sophomore Scott Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim's situation was a lot like mine when I came to Stanford," said Stenstrom, 
who played at El Toro High. "We each came in with another quarterback who was a 
little more highly touted than we were. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in the shadows right now. But I don't think it will be that way for 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, 6 feet 4 and 190 pounds, understands time is on his side as he prepares 
for his second season under Stanford Coach Bill Walsh. He knows Stenstrom and 
Butterfield graduate after this season, leaving him and Frost to battle for the 
starting job next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really good about my chances," Carey said. "We have to wait and see 
what happens this year. I definitely want to be second-string this year and 
have a shot at starting next year. I think next spring is where everything is 
going to count as far as Scott and I are concerned.' 
</P>
<P>
 Carey was rated as the nation's fourth-best high school quarterback in 1992, 
his senior year at Los Alamitos. He was considered one of the best pure passers 
to come out of high school in years when he committed to Stanford in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, Frost, the third-best quarterback prospect in the nation, signed 
with the Cardinal during the late period the following spring. He had thrown 
for 2,142 yards and 21 touchdowns and run for 1,585 yards and 33 touchdowns as 
a senior at tiny Wood River (Neb.) High. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you say "quarterback controversy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh relieved some of the pressure last season by asking Carey to sit out. He 
wanted Carey, who weighed only 175 pounds, to put on weight and learn the 
offense. He also wanted to stagger the years of eligibility between Carey and 
Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's situation also improved in pre-season when Frost, second on the depth 
chart behind Stenstrom, started working out part-time at defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 How much progress did Carey make during his redshirt season? It depends on who 
you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 'Yes, I weigh 190 pounds," Carey said. "I concentrated on my strength in the 
off-season, lifted weights and got on the right diet. By my senior year, I want 
to be 210 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was surprised when told Carey weighed 190. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tim expects that he won't see a lot of action this year," Walsh said. 
"His future is further out, and I think that's evident by his physical 
maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's his only limitation right now. He needs at least another year before 
he plays. You'll remember he was so thin in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 While Carey worked with the scout squad, Frost, 6-3 and 210 pounds, passed 
Butterfield on the depth chart and became Stenstrom's backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost is considered the strongest and most athletic of the three backup 
quarterbacks and has shown a knack for running the ball. He played in nine 
games, completing two of nine passes but running 15 times for 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tim is still a fine prospect here," Walsh said. "He'll inherit 
Steve's job at some point. Scott didn't redshirt last year and Tim did, so Tim 
has that senior year, at the least, to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey worked out with Stenstrom this summer at The Clinic, a college and pro 
athlete training camp in Del Mar. Carey spent seven weeks at the clinic, then 
returned to Orange County to work out with his longtime training coach, Jim 
Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim is doing a great job," Stenstrom said. "He is going to be a great 
quarterback. He's one of the best pure passers I have seen." Tim Carey

</P>
<P>
 College career statistics: Ran Stanford's scout squad during redshirt year. 
</P>
<P>
 High school highlights: Carey led Los Alamitos to the Southern Section finals 
as a junior and senior, with the Griffins winning the title in 1991 and tying 
Esperanza in 1992. Carey was named The Times' back of the year as a senior, one 
of several local and national awards he received that year. In two seasons as a 
starter, he completed 399 of 682 passes for 5,889 yards and 56 touchdowns. He 
was one of the most-sought after quarterbacks in the country, receiving 
interest from USC, UCLA, Texas, Notre Dame, Colorado and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Miscellaneous: Stanford Coach Bill Walsh describes Carey as one of the best 
"touch passers" he has seen, comparing him to former Raider and Brigham Young 
standout Marc Wilson. . . . Carey's uncle, Dennis Fitzpatrick, was a member of 
Cal's 1959 NCAA championship basketball team. . . . Carey also is the great 
nephew of actor Dick Van Dyke.

MANY ANGEL PLAYERS SEE NO REASON TO SAVE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's growing sentiment among Angel players, according to Gary DiSarcina, 
assistant player representative, that they prefer sitting out the rest of the 
season rather than play the final few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys I talked to don't even think it's worth coming back," 
DiSarcina said. "The season is so tainted anyway, and to come back with a few 
weeks left, it would just make a mockery out of the game. Why do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's other guys who say, 'Well, if that's what it takes in saving the 
postseason, why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a few Angel players say they have even bothered to stay in 
shape, most have not picked up a ball or a bat since their last game three 
weeks ago, Aug. 10 against the Kansas City Royals. They wonder what good it 
would do to resume playing in mid-September if games resemble little more than 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be seeing some ugly baseball," DiSarcina said. "It would be just like 
the first week of spring training. Pitchers would be going two or three 
innings, and position players wouldn't be able to go a whole game. You think 
there are some long games now, just wait. You'll really see something then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it might be a different feeling for the teams that are still in the 
race, but really, all we'd be doing is helping out teams getting ready for 
postseason. They'd be using us to get in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you show up and play for two weeks, especially if we're out of it. I 
know I can't picture myself coming back to the clubhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann concedes that injuries, particularly to 
pitchers, would be a primary concern if the season resumed. The games would be 
treated similar to spring training, he said, limiting pitchers to about three 
innings or a certain pitch count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, nobody is in baseball shape," Lachemann said, "so I don't know how 
you could pitch someone more than three innings. You've got to really be 
careful. The first time out might be the easiest, but the second and third 
times, that's what really can cause problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Said starter Mark Langston, Angel player representative: "If we're going to 
salvage any part of the season, things are going to have to happen quickly. And 
if it's resolved, it's our job to go out and play. But it'll definitely be a 
spring-training situation because nobody's really working out." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of the strike's economic effect were felt Wednesday when no checks 
arrived. This was the players' first missed check since the strike's inception. 
</P>
<P>
 While no Angel player has lost more during the strike than starting pitcher 
Chuck Finley, who already is out $363,387.97, the effect can be traumatic for 
the younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping I could save enough money where I wouldn't have to work," rookie 
outfielder Jim Edmonds said, "but you can only save so much from the beginning 
of the year. We knew what was coming, but there was a refrigerator we had to 
buy, and a washer and dryer, just stuff you need when you have a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not cheap living in Southern California. Our apartment cost $1,200 a 
month alone. We may have to move to a smaller place, I just don't know right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Players will begin receiving licensing checks from their strike fund every two 
weeks beginning Sept. 15, with veterans having accrued as much as $147,000 in 
reserve the last four years. Yet, for the rookies, all that remains is about 
$7,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to go pretty fast around here," said Edmonds, who just had three 
card shows canceled that would have paid him $8,000. "I was hoping I'd never 
have to go back to work once I made the big leagues, but that could all 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel first baseman J.T. Snow, who spent less than two years in the major

NHL TRAINING CAMPS KEEP THE DOORS OPEN -- FOR NOW; HOCKEY: HOWEVER, THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A LOCKOUT REMAINS SHOULD CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS BOG DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL training camps will open as scheduled, the league notified teams 
Wednesday, although the possibility of a lockout later has not been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the news today, but obviously, it could change at any moment after 
camp opens," Mighty Duck assistant captain Stu Grimson said. "I think from the 
players' standpoint, we're all very encouraged that things seem to be 
progressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kings' General Manager Sam McMaster called the league communique "good news." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to sit, and I'm sure Mr. (Gary) Bettman doesn't want to sit and 
I'm sure the players want a deal," McMaster said. "We just can't go on playing 
year after year without a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings report Saturday and are scheduled to take the ice on Monday at the 
Iceoplex in North Hills. The Ducks report Sunday, with their first practice 
scheduled for Monday at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that NHL players would be locked out intensified last week, after 
Commissioner Bettman received authorization from the league's Board of 
Governors to shut down camps if he believes insufficient progress is being made 
in collective bargaining talks. The players have been without a contract since 
last Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Winnipeg Jets scheduled to open camp today, a decision was necessary. 
After a five-hour meeting Tuesday with Bob Goodenow, executive director of the 
NHLPA, Bettman decided to forgo a lockout -- at least for now. The possibility 
of one later remains, and a league source said Bettman is working with the idea 
there is a "30-day window" for a lockout between now and Oct. 1, when the 
season is scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
 The league made no formal announcement that camps will open, contending that 
none was necessary since it had never announced the possibility of a lockout. 
Goodenow confirmed he has been told camps will open. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means is that the camps will go forward as planned and the 
negotiation process between the parties will also continue," Goodenow said in a 
prepared release. 
</P>
<P>
 Another meeting between Bettman and Goodenow is scheduled for today, said 
Arthur Pincus, NHL vice president for public relations. Salaries are the main 
issue, with owners seeking to tie salaries to revenue and players intent on 
having salaries set by the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Though camps are opening, the league is still imposing a series of unilateral 
rules changes, effective today -- except in the provinces of Ontario and 
Alberta, where labor laws regarding the conciliation process prevent the rules 
from taking effect until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Players must now pay for their transportation to and from training camp, and 
their $54 per diem food allowance has been eliminated for camp and the regular 
season. Other changes include roster reductions and increased player 
contributions for medical and pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman notified the players of the rules changes Aug. 1, saying it was an 
effort to make them return to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel any better about that at all," Grimson said. "But I'd say the 
players are at the point now where we accept that as part of the strategy of 
negotiating and navigating the course toward a new CBA. But we're certainly 
disgruntled about the way training camp is starting. We don't think it's fair."

SALSA EASILY DEFEATS FT. LAUDERDALE; SOCCER: STRATEGY IN THE FIRST HALF LEADS 
TO 5-1 VICTORY AND SECOND PLACE IN STANDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa took advantage of timely scheduling and a slumping opponent to move 
into second place by beating Ft. Lauderdale Wednesday night at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa, winners of five of their last six games, defeated the Strikers, 
5-1, before 2,852 in an American Professional Soccer League game. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the eighth in a row for the last-place Strikers (3-9). The 
victory moved the Salsa (8-6) past Montreal in the standings. The Salsa next 
travels to Montreal for a game Friday against the Impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Montreal idle tonight, we knew we had to win to put ourselves in a good 
position for Friday," said Salsa Coach Rick Davis. "Now the pressure is on them 
come Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 The ease of the Salsa's victory Wednesday night was somewhat surprising 
because the previous two meetings between the teams were decided by shootouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa won the first game, 1-0, and Sockers took the second, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have changed their team a lot," Salsa forward Paul Wright said. "They 
just need some time to gel." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright led the Salsa's attack, scoring two goals, but Paulinho started the 
scoring with a goal in the 21st minute. Omid Namazi added the assist on 
Paulinho's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Thor Lee scored two minutes after Paulinho, then Wright's first goal came 
seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we weren't getting the breaks early on," Davis said. "Tonight, 
we followed up on our opportunities and put them away. Also we got some big 
saves early. We just set ourselves up in the first 20 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa goalie Mike Littman made three saves in the game, two in the half. On 
several occasions, the Strikers had excellent scoring opportunities but 
misplayed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright added his second goal in the 56th minute. He took a pass from Yari 
Allmutt from about 30 yards and dribbled past defender Juan Castillo. He then 
sent a shot over the left shoulder of goalie Jim St. Andre. 
</P>
<P>
 Ft. Lauderdale's John Doyle scored in the 69th minute and the Salsa's Ray 
Fernandez ended the scoring with a goal in the 78th minute.

PREP FOOTBALL; TWO ORANGE COUNTY TEAMS TO OPEN SEASON IN HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina will kick off the Orange County high school football season at 9 p.m. 
PDT today when it plays Honolulu Damien in the Shawn Akina Prep Football 
Classic at Honolulu Aloha Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Christian also will open the season in Hawaii, playing 
Maui Kaahumanu Hou High at 10:30 p.m. PDT on Friday at Maui War Memorial 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all excited," said Tom Keim, Marina linebacker. "We're having fun here 
in Hawaii, but we know we have to work our butts off. And how many guys get a 
chance to play in a stadium like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Aloha Stadium, home to Hawaii and the Pro Bowl, probably will be the only 
large stadium the Vikings will play in this season. 
</P>
<P>
 With former Empire League powers Los Alamitos and Esperanza joining the 
already tough Sunset League, Marina is a longshot to make the playoffs let 
alone advance to the Southern Section Division I finals and a possible game at 
Anaheim Stadium. Last season, Marina finished fourth, just missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Viking Coach Dave Thompson hopes junior running back Mike Williams is ready to 
help the offense and Keim, an All-Sunset League selection last year, leads an 
experienced defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Damien High, a small Catholic boys' school, won't be at full strength for 
tonight's game because 12 players were either suspended or expelled, 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Karl Walczak of Damien said 10 players were suspended and two others 
expelled for what he called "a serious breach of discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar incident would have decimated Southern California Christian, which 
has only 18 players on its roster. But SCC Coach Bert Esposito has no such 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Esposito will be somewhat familiar with his opponent's game plan Friday 
because he played for Kaahumanu Hou's coach, Dave Morocco, at Melodyland High 
School in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave has been trying to get us over there the last couple of years," Esposito 
said. "I had a pretty good team last year with only a couple of seniors, so I 
figured this was the year to go." 
</P>
<P>
 All-Arrowhead League running back Ron Wood, who finished the regular season 
with 590 yards rushing last year, leads SCC's offense.

MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MINORS; INDEPENDENT STREAK PAYS OFF AT PRO BASEBALL'S 
LOWER LEVELS; VALLEY REGION COULD GET CAUGHT UP IN REVIVED POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fan recognized the bespectacled 6-foot-6 right-hander, a popular member of 
the Houston Astros pitching staff for three seasons. The Astrodome is located 
just up the road a spell, 90 miles from Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charley!" the fan said. "What the heck are you doing in Beaumont?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Kerfeld asks himself the same question. 
</P>
<P>
 What's cooking in Beaumont is brewing across the nation and Canada. Kerfeld is 
manager of the Beaumont Bullfrogs, a member of the Texas-Louisiana League, one 
of a growing band of independent leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 That Kerfeld and Co. have been playing three months yet remain a mystery in 
their hometown isn't particularly surprising. The Bullfrogs didn't exist until 
this summer, and more than a few folks aren't sure what independent ball is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 That might change, eventually. In many locations, Independents Day has arrived 
or is just around the corner. Some teams will be real firecrackers, some duds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the baseball world, independents are anarchists. They are self-funded and 
have no major-league operating agreement, the financial umbilical cord for 
minor-league affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time next summer, as many as nine independent leagues could be playing 
across the baseball landscape, from Alexandria, La., to Zanesville, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent leagues have found a niche and are seeking to exploit it. The 
appetite for minor-league baseball, despite distasteful labor strife at the 
big-league level, continues to grow in many parts of the country and 
independents are fueling the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike? Who cares? Organizers of independent leagues gleefully boast that they 
have side-stepped the politics of affiliated baseball and exemplify the 
entrepreneurial spirit. No agents, prima donnas or lockouts. Just plain ol' 
country hardball. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley region could soon catch the fever. The proposed 
independent Golden State League, based in Chatsworth, hopes to place a team in 
the Antelope Valley next summer. With key Palmdale officials throwing their 
support behind the project this month, the Golden State is closer than ever to 
gaining a crucial foothold. 
</P>
<P>
 The establishment of a team in the Valley region would erase a void that has 
existed almost without exception for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Gulls, an affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays and a member 
of the Class-A California League, played in 1986, then relocated. No other 
minor league team has played in the region since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of teams in other national quarters isn't news to independent 
organizers. Research conducted by the Golden State League indicates that the 
number of minor league teams fell precipitously from more than 400 in 1950 to 
144 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The independents would dearly love to imitate the success of the 
Minnesota-based Northern League, which began play with a 72-game schedule last 
summer. Attendance in '93 averaged 3,300 per game and the numbers this summer 
are even more positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Northern League announced last week that with 29 dates remaining, 
it had drawn 797,993 fans, more than any short-season league in history. Six of 
eight teams in the first-year Texas-Louisiana League are averaging a 
respectable 1,450 nightly or better. 
</P>
<P>
 A boon only in the boondocks? Even independents in large cities have defied 
conventional logic and hit the jackpot. St. Paul of the Northern League drew a 
league-high 4,700 per game in '93, though it lies in the shadow of the 
Metrodome, the Minnesota Twins and Kirby Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
 Either a responsive chord has been struck in Minneapolis-St. Paul, or some 
franchise owners are going to lose their shirts. The Minneapolis Millers (Great 
Central League) and Minneapolis Loons (North Central) began play in the area 
this summer. Both are independents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California's baseball scene is considerably less saturated -- at least for 
now. For all its fertile baseball ground, the state is represented in the 
minors only by the Cal League. 
</P>
<P>
 California has 30 million residents and 15 professional teams -- including the 
Dodgers, Angels, San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics. 
By comparison, New York state has 15 pro teams, Florida 14 and North Carolina 
nine. All are smaller in population and geography. 
</P>
<P>
 The venerable Cal League, considered one of the nation's best Class-A 
alignments, has teams in Bakersfield (Dodgers), Central Valley (Colorado 
Rockies), High Desert (independent), Lake Elsinore (Angels), Modesto (A's), 
Rancho Cucamonga (Padres), Riverside (Seattle Mariners), San Bernardino 
(independent), San Jose (Giants) and Stockton (Milwaukee Brewers). 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for the Cal League baseball buck could soon be two-fold: The 
Western League, based in Portland, has announced its intention to field four 
teams in California in 1994, including franchises in Long Beach and Palm 
Springs. The Golden State hopes to field six teams in the state next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Players on independent rosters are an eclectic mix. Most are undrafted free 
agents or players recently released by other organizations. Organizers insist 
the caliber of play is solid, and the way fans are filling the seats in many 
locations, something between the chalked lines has obvious appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are an awful lot of good ballplayers out there," said Miles Wolff, 
founder of the Northern League. "Each year, the big leagues sign a thousand 
players, so another thousand are pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those guys can play." 
</P>
<P>
 And have played before. Many owners have signed former big leaguers to boost 
the gate. The Northern League includes former major league stars Leon Durham, 
Pedro Guerrero and Oil Can Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be a few diamonds among the retreads and castoffs. Infielder Mike 
Lansing of the Montreal Expos and pitcher Tom Candiotti of the Dodgers each 
played for independents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas-Louisiana League has taken a different tack. Each of its eight 
managers are former big leaguers, including Jose Cruz and Alan Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities generally have been receptive to the independents because eams help 
establish civic identity and give the local economy a shot in the arm. Bush 
league teams can mean a bushel of money. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates made by the National Assn. of Professional Baseball 
Leagues, an affiliated Class-A team generates an average of $4 million in 
revenue for its host city through taxes, hotel and restaurant usage, etc. The 
association is the governing body for 19 minor leagues. City fathers hope 
independents can generate a comparable economic windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley, an Imperial Valley city with a population of approximately 60,000, is 
exploring the possibility of joining the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the fast track with this," said Tom Fox, director of the Brawley 
chamber of commerce and the city's economic development commission. "It's a 
good idea and we're running some numbers. It could be a big help to the 
Imperial Valley and a big help to Brawley." 
</P>
<P>
 The new teams have a familiar feel. In a manner of speaking, independents are 
a throwback to the days of flannel uniforms and jet-black spikes. In a simpler 
era, hundreds of small towns had independent teams to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of extensive farm systems more than a half-century ago changed the 
minor-league landscape -- at a hefty price to the major leagues. Big-league 
organizations instituted a multitiered player-development system that 
controlled players down to the Class-D level and essentially wiped out the 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing from the past, the independents may be the minor leagues' wave of 
the future as cost-conscious big-league teams head into the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league clubs -- which often field three teams at the Class-A level alone 
-- assume the financial burden for player development by paying for equipment, 
salaries of coaches and players, medical treatment, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 An operating agreement with a full-season Class-A team can cost the parent 
club $500,000 or more annually, one farm director said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, an independent team pays its own expenses and sells player 
contracts to interested major league organizations. A big-league club would 
spend only a few thousand dollars annually on scouts, who would be responsible 
for plucking top players from the independent ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the future of minor-league baseball in the lower classifications," said 
Bob Weinstein, president of the Golden State League. "Scouts say it, coaches 
say it, Major League Baseball says it." 
</P>
<P>
 Big-league clubs agree -- to a point. In the 1930s and 1940s, before the 
extensive minor-league player-development systems of today were in place, clubs 
signed players from small independent teams located in almost every hamlet and 
burg in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "What goes around comes around, I guess," said Charlie Blaney, the Dodgers' 
director of minor-league operations. "It's certainly a possibility (that 
independents are the wave of the future), but I don't see it in the near 
future. But there's no question that everybody is looking for ways to save 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 With the notable exception of player salaries, the major leagues have been 
lopping budgets for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Major League Scouting Bureau was pared. Umpiring crews this year were 
dropped from three to two in double-A leagues. The Montreal Expos, with the 
best record in the majors, trimmed their big-league advance scouting corps. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is a trend, keep it coming, say the independents. Bloated big-league 
salaries, strikes and organizational cutbacks make Weinstein and his brethren 
cackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got 28 owners I want to invite to my next cocktail party," Weinstein said. 
"I want to stand up and tell them how much I appreciate their stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Big league clubs have created an opening. Independents plan to carve a grand 
canyon. Play Ball, California 
</P>
<P>
 Locations of existing California League baseball teams and proposed 
independent league franchise sites. 
</P>
<P>
 (graphic) Independents Day 
</P>
<P>
 Independent leagues -- minor league baseball without major league affiliation 
-- might be the wave of the future in professional baseball. These grass-roots 
leagues are sprouting all over the country and in Canada, and the proposed 
Golden State League already has a toehold in Palmdale. A four-part series that 
begins today examines this national trend. 
</P>
<P>
 FRI.: The Golden State League, the brainchild of Chatsworth investment banker 
Bob Weinstein, is exploring the possibility of positioning teams in Palmdale, 
Vista, Brawley, Merced, Indio and an unspecified site in San Luis Obispo 
County. If everything falls into place, the leagues might begin a six-team, 
90-game schedule as soon as next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 SAT.: Miles Wolff, who formerly published Baseball America magazine, last 
summer founded the first independent league -- the highly successful Northern 
League. Attendance boomed and others took notice. Next summer, as many as nine 
independent leagues could be in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 SUN.: Independent leagues serve as a last chance for career minor leaguers and 
major league castoffs. One of the top hitters for the Sioux Falls (S.D.) 
Canaries of the Northern League is former Dodger Pedro Guerrero. Life at this 
rung in professional baseball is often unpredictable and humbling. Players are 
actually traded for bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
 As Charley Kerfeld lumbered through downtown Beaumont, Tex., the chubby former 
big leaguer drew a curious stare.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; NEW PLAYOFF SYSTEM MAKES CITY WIDE OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Kennedy High has a season in 1994 like it did in '93, the Golden Cougars 
will be in the playoffs instead of in the bleachers, thanks to a new playoff 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Kennedy tied East Valley League champion Sylmar in the opening 
week, destroyed Crenshaw, an eventual City Section 4-A Division semifinalist, 
55-12, and lost only two Northwest Valley Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the final week, the Golden Cougars tied El Camino Real, 22-22, leaving 
the teams tied for third place in the North Valley League with 4-2-1 conference 
records. Because only the league's top two teams received automatic playoff 
bids, Kennedy and El Camino Real played a tiebreaker for an at-large berth in 
the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's situation was one reason the City changed the playoff system. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, schools will not be classified as 3-A or 4-A until the 
conclusion of the regular season.  
</P>
<P>
 Teams with the best record in each of the City's six conferences will gain 
automatic berths in the 4-A bracket. A committee of coaches and administrators 
will select 10 teams in the bracket based on record, strength of schedule and 
perceived power. The committee will select the next-best 16 teams for the 3-A 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new system had been in place a year ago, Kennedy Coach Bob Francola 
said, the Golden Cougars' strength of schedule would have earned Kennedy a 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have the right basic philosophy now," Francola said. "The best 
32 teams at the end should be the ones playing. It makes much more sense. 
Nobody knows how good anybody is at the beginning of the season but they should 
at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old system, teams were assigned to a 3-A or 4-A league within each 
conference before the season started, based on recent performance. At the end 
of the regular season, sixteen teams from each division advanced to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the system hurt schools such as Kennedy. The Golden Cougars last year 
defeated the three 3-A teams in their conference by a combined score of 114-12. 
Two of those teams, Reseda and Chatsworth, advanced to the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Valley League -- Taft, Kennedy, Granada Hills, San Fernando and El 
Camino Real -- could benefit from the new rules. All but El Camino Real appear 
certain to earn a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Valley, Chatsworth, Cleveland and newcomer Birmingham all have 
reasonable shots at gaining a 3-A berth.  
</P>
<P>
 Under this plan -- which still allows for two league champions -- it is 
possible that a conference could qualify all its teams for postseason play. But 
a league champion is not guaranteed a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Northwest Valley coaches welcome the new system, although some have 
spotted a few kinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills has been a traditional 4-A school, having lost only five 
conference games in eight years before 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a real fine line with No. 16 in the 4-A and No. 1 in the 
3-A," Granada Hills Coach Tom Harp said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'd like to play for the City championship but I think there can only 
be one of them. Being in the 3-A wouldn't mean as much for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools downplay potential postseason problems. Bob Ganssle, first-year 
co-coach at El Camino Real is more concerned with the regular season. Only two 
starters return from last year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be interesting at the end of the year with all the variables," 
Ganssle said. "But now I'm just concerned about winning as many games as we 
can."

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; TAKAHASHI'S TIMING IS PERFECT AT LOS 
AMIGOS; FOOTBALL: OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, NOW COACH, TAKES OVER A WINNING 
PROGRAM THAT HE KNOWS INSIDE AND OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If timing is everything, then the timing of new Los Amigos football Coach 
Roger Takahashi is comparable to Barry Switzer's. Takahashi, like Switzer in 
Dallas, is walking into a winning program with winning attitudes and loads of 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely fortunate," Takahashi said. "Very few coaches would ever leave 
this type of situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Bolton is like very few coaches. His family was much more important 
to him than winning football games. So after three years, just when his program 
had turned the corner, Bolton walked away from Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
 And in walked Takahashi, who had been Bolton's offensive coordinator the past 
two years. Takahashi had coached La Quinta to a 40-27 record and three playoff 
appearances from 1986-1991, but left the school when his teaching position was 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Takahashi has a full-time teaching job and an experienced and talented 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be in a better position than I am now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi knows the school, knows the kids and he definitely knows offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always put together a great little package," said Rancho Alamitos Coach 
Doug Case, who was Rancho Alamitos' defensive coordinator when Takahashi 
coached La Quinta. "He mixes the ball up well and he's not very predictable. 
He's a great asset to the Garden Grove League." 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi thought he could be an asset to the South Coast and Sea View 
leagues, too. So he applied for the El Toro and Tustin head coaching jobs after 
leaving La Quinta. He was a finalist for the El Toro job and took himself out 
of consideration for the Tustin position because he didn't feel it was right 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Takahashi landed at Los Amigos when a driver's education and health 
position opened up. And two years later, the head coaching job opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 "At La Quinta I was losing my staff, but here I've got a well-rounded staff," 
he said. "But the most important thing here is the direction of the kids. Steve 
has done a tremendous job of turning around the work ethic. Things are really 
rolling here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi said he expects to have 40 players on varsity this season -- more 
than he ever had at La Quinta and eight more than Bolton had last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great summer," Takahashi said. "The kids don't know any better now. 
They're expected to work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 And Takahashi plans to continue with his aggressive offensive style. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to score as soon as possible," he said. "The longer you've got the 
ball, there are more bad things that can happen. I like to do my business and 
get off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 With two-year letterman Ape Tuato returning at quarterback and breakaway 
threat Greg Fausto at tailback, expect Los Amigos' defenders to get the bulk of 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi said Tuato should be one of the top quarterbacks in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the game," Takahashi said. "He's like a fifth coach." 
</P>
<P>
 The more Takahashi talks, the more excited he gets. And the more excited he 
gets, the more he realizes just how fortunate he is.

DIGEST: CATCHER LEADS A LIST OF 14 CSUN RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catcher Matt Ceriani, a freshman from Vacaville, Calif., leads a list of 14 
newcomers to the Cal State Northridge baseball program, the largest recruiting 
class ever under seventh-year Coach Bill Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceriani, one of five catchers on the Matador roster, is expected to battle for 
playing time with Ventura College transfer Robert Fick and two players who 
split time at the position last spring, Josh Smaler and Eric Gillespie. 
Freshman catcher Casey Cheshier (Agua Dulce Highland) also has signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Baserunners were successful on 98 of 126 stolen-base attempts against 
Northridge last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Northridge has signed seven freshmen, including pitchers Carlos 
Velazco (Sylmar High), Benito Flores (Placentia El Dorado) and Erasmo Ramirez 
(Saddleback), outfielder Jeremy Conrad (San Clemente) and shortstop Adam 
Kennedy (Riverside North). 
</P>
<P>
 Junior college transfers include pitchers Rob Crabtree (Cypress), Juan 
Velazquez (Valley) and Jim Hunter (Whittier), second baseman Grant Hohman 
(Harbor), and Pierce infielders Kevin Milligan and Heath McElwee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, Hunter and Flores are left-handers. Northridge, which finished 25-30, 
didn't have a left-handed pitcher last season. Golf

</P>
<P>
 Turner, a left-hander who played at Cal State Northridge, finished in a 
two-way tie for second in a field of 71. The Mid-Amateur is Sept. 17-22 at 
Hazeltine National and Wayzata country clubs in suburban Minneapolis. The 
Mid-Amateur is open to players aged 25 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys, Don Baker of Canoga Park and Craig Distere of 
Burbank qualified Tuesday at Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Norris of Oxnard fired rounds of 80 and 77 to win the Ventura County Golf 
Assn. Championship this week at Spanish Hills and Las Posas country clubs. 
</P>

 Norris won by a shot over Bob Smiley of Ventura and Joe Howard of Oxnard. Doug 
Ragan of Oxnard was fourth at 160. Norris was four shots behind Smiley and 
three behind Howard entering the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Goldie of Camarillo won the 14-15 division with a 75, while Brett 
Spaulding of Agoura won the 13-and-under division with a 74. Jill Kaopua of

LOCAL NOTES: LENAERTS MAKING STRIDES TOWARD RECOVERY, FAMILY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mother of La Quinta football player Aron Lenaerts, who lapsed into a coma 
last week during practice, says her son has begun walking and appears on the 
road to a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's improving every hour," said Bonnie Lenaerts."He's not hooked to 
any IVs or machines; the only thing (doctors) have to give him is some Tylenol 
for a headache, and it's like a regular headache. Every day he's more alert for 
longer periods of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenaerts collapsed on Friday during a contact drill and came out of a coma 
Saturday at UCI Medical Center; he began walking Tuesday afternoon, his mother 
said.

O.C. MUSIC; PREPARING FOR A FUTURE TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outsiders got a glimpse of the creative chaos and ferment that goes into 
writing a new piece when the Pacific Symphony on Tuesday brought Vietnamese 
traditional musicians and singers together with orchestra members and composer 
Elliot Goldenthal. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to provide a musical workshop and improvisation session to help 
fuel Goldenthal's composition of a large-scale work to commemorate the 
suffering of the Vietnam War. The hourlong piece, commissioned by the orchestra 
and as yet untitled, is scheduled to be played by the Pacific under Carl 
St.Clair's direction next April at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenthal took an active part in the proceedings, held at South Coast 
Repertory's Second Stage theater, but initially the program was dominated by 
Khoa Le, a composer, TV producer and member of the Pacific's Vietnamese 
Advisory Committee. Under Le's infectious and knowledgeable enthusiasm, 
revelations came fast for the audience of about 60 people, predominantly from 
the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bright-voiced Ngai Khoi Children's Chorus sang the jaunty "Sticky 
Rice Drum" folk song, for instance, Le explained that it had double meanings, 
which is characteristic of many Vietnamese songs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the tune is literally about a drum and its distinctive sound, 
caused by rice stuck to the inner sides of its drum heads (much as snares are 
used to modify the sound of a small side drum). 
</P>
<P>
 But because the barrel-shaped drum is carried in front of the body as it's 
played and the song is sung by a young woman, the lyrics can also cynically 
suggest something else -- an unwanted pregnancy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And where is the father?" Le said. "That is a sticky situation," Goldenthal 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's point was that Westerners not expecting double meanings might not easily 
grasp the song's complexity. Yet the music wouldn't sound completely foreign 
because, he noted, certain characteristics of Vietnamese music are universal. 
The music is based on the pentatonic scale, which you can hear by playing just 
the black notes on a piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pentatonic scale belongs to the world," Le said. "The music of this 
country before white people came is very similar." 
</P>
<P>
 And, apparently, after they came. Goldenthal pointed out that the melodies of 
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame" and "Amazing Grace" are also based on the 
pentatonic scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese have invented two instruments unique to their culture, Le said. 
These are the dan nhi (or double-stringed fiddle) and the dan doc huyen (a 
one-stringed monochord). 
</P>
<P>
 Older Vietnamese people, he added, would warn their young daughters not to 
listen to this one-stringed instrument because it was too seductive. And it was 
pretty irresistible. Le drew parallels between its sweet, pulsing tones and 
those created by bowing a musical saw. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, incidentally, a professional musician typically would be an expert 
player of at least three instruments and usually of as many as five, he said. 
Dong Tran shifted easily between two -- the dan doc huyen and the dan tranh (a 
16-string zither). 
</P>
<P>
 The others Vietnamese players were Tri Le ( dan nhi ), Trong Nguyen (electric 
guitar) and Xinh Tran (dan xen , an octagonal lute). 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific players were violinists Norm Hughes and Amy Sims, bassist Steven 
Edelman, woodwind player Allen Savedoff (saxophone and flute), and 
percussionist Robert Slack. 
</P>
<P>
 As noted, the 20th Century has already made an impact on traditional 
Vietnamese music. Not only was there an electric guitar in the ensemble (tuned 
to conform to Vietnamese modes, however), but all the instruments were 
amplified. As in some rock concerts, there were problems with feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 The amplification might be necessary, however. When someone in the audience 
asked to hear what the dan doc huyen sounded like without it, the tones turned 
out to be too weak and pale to carry very far. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the two vocal soloists -- Hung Nguyen and Hong Nguyen -- 
who sang separately, were often overpowered by the ensemble sound. Hung Nguyen, 
however, brought several people to their feet in response to his expressive 
artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenthal, dressed in jeans, cowboy boots, a black shirt and a trendy, 
oversize black sport coat, listened actively throughout, asking questions about 
the traditional instruments and their ranges, videotaping the instrumentalists 
as they played and bringing back the children to sing along with the 
instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 After the break, he became even more involved in orchestrating the 
proceedings, asking various musicians from both cultures to play together and 
slowly building up an ensemble sound. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal, he explained at one point, is "from a technical standpoint, I want 
to see if I can give future orchestras a chance to play Vietnamese-oriented 
music but with Western instruments. . . . It would be be wonderful to have 
Vietnamese musicians always play in an orchestral setting, if I chose to go 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what if I don't? What if (the work) is done somewhere after I'm dead, 
(where) there aren't these musicians available? I want to know if there's a way 
I can orchestrate it so that it doesn't necessitate having Vietnamese 
musicians. . . . But I definitely want to evoke that sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The composer also had said he's written about 20 minutes of the planned 
hourlong piece so far, picked out all the lyrics and worked out the structure 
of the piece, although he was allowing himself "a chance for a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The riskiness of the two cultures interacting -- and the whole project -- was 
perhaps best demonstrated not by the occasional missed communications (on both 
sides) or the difficulties of matching two very different musical worlds. It 
occurred when Tri Le, who played the dan nhi , offered to show Hughes how to 
play his violin in the Vietnamese style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be careful," Hughes said nervously as he handed it over. "My life savings are 
in that instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the goal of the commissioned piece is to promote "healing," in the words 
of Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. Spisto, perhaps there was more 
to "Amazing Grace" recurring toward the end of the session than just to 
illustrate another tune based on the pentatonic scale. 
</P>
<P>
 First alone and then with Barbara Johnson, a volunteer from the audience, 
Goldenthal sang the first verse of the hymn, as various instrumentalists joined 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a musical handshake," Goldenthal said. "This is the very first 
beginnings of not only a musical dialogue with our musicians here but also a 
cultural beginning as far as the community is concerned, which is the most 
important thing. . . . We got to have more than one of these."

INVESTMENT SHOPPING; WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SOCIAL CIRCLES, CLOTHES COSTS ADD 
UP TO STATUS AND CHANGE 
</P>

<P>
 When Orange County businessman and arts supporter Mark Chapin Johnson was 
quoted in a society column that he would be willing to spend $40,000 a year on 
a would-be wife's wardrobe, the buzz around some social circles was: "Is that 
all?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these ladies spend a lot more than that," said one Newport Beach 
woman, a regular on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many others found the offer to be exceedingly generous. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of money -- where's he been all my life?" quipped Barbara 
Magness, owner of B. Magness, a women's clothing boutique in Newport Beach. "If 
our customers spent half that much they would be considered good customers. 
We'd love them forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's comment touched on a sensitive topic that's often whispered about in 
social circles but seldom openly discussed: How much money do Orange County 
socialites spend on their wardrobes? 
</P>
<P>
 Ballpark estimates vary as to how much well-to-do women invest in clothes, but 
fashion watchers agree that some will go to great expense to look good. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases $40,000 is the average," says Ann Stern, a Newport Beach 
resident who occasionally attends black-tie galas where women parade their 
designer dresses. "And there are people who spend more than that. But that's 
not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Patterson says that women of means spend anywhere from $10,000 to 
$200,000 a year on their clothes. As president of Recycled Rags, a secondhand 
clothing store in Corona del Mar, she gets the women's expensive castoffs -- 
designer garments that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars and have been worn 
once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her best merchandise comes from socialites who "have to have a 
different gown for each occasion," Patterson says. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows women who buy an entire wardrobe of St. John knits every season: 
"The bill has to be $7,000 or $8,000," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real (clothes) crazy ones spend $3,000 to $5,000 a month" on clothes, 
says Joey Sims, owner of Chez Joey, a Laguna Niguel store that also sells 
secondhand women's clothing. One of her regular customers spent $3,000 on 
clothes last month. Where did the money go? "She bought an Escada suit, a St. 
John dress and a gold Chanel purse. That'll do it," Sims says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another customer has her house filled with "wall to wall clothes." She spends 
$5,000 a month on her wardrobe. Recently she bought 30 pairs of shoes, most of 
them designer brands in the $200-per-pair range. 
</P>
<P>
 "In their circles they wear something once and it's finished," Sims says. 
"It's a big status thing. Say I belong to the Marbella Country Club. Would I 
wear the same thing (to lunch) twice? No way. It's truly a contest." 
</P>
<P>
 How much is a lot to spend on clothes depends on the individual's situation, 
fashion experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some people $40,000 is astronomical. To others it's not," says Mary Dell 
Barkouras, a Newport Beach fashion consultant. "It depends on her lifestyle, if 
the woman travels a great deal or has to present herself in a wide variety of 
lights." 
</P>
<P>
 If one works or travels in circles where a fine wardrobe is almost required, 
large sums can easily be spent on designer and couture outfits. When buying 
Chanel, Donna Karan or Armani, $3,000 to $5,000 can be swallowed up by one suit 
and matching accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could spend $800 for just a little short skirt," Patterson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have unlimited clothing budgets own the keys to the county's 
upscale, service-oriented department stores and boutiques. Mi Place in Laguna 
Niguel and Fullerton, Neiman Marcus in Fashion Island Newport Beach, 341 
Bayside in Newport Beach, and Chanel and Escada in South Coast Plaza are among 
the names that crop up often when discussing the favorite fashion haunts of the 
well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women with unlimited clothing budgets go to stores with a high standard of 
customer service. That's what they're paying for," says Dianna Pfaff-Martin, a 
Newport Beach image consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these stores offer perks such as personal shoppers, phone calls to 
alert customers when a new collection arrives from favorite designers and even 
lunches at fine restaurants. Some shop owners send their clients flowers, Sims 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 341 Bayside in Newport Beach, the staff works to establish personal 
relationships with favorite customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them as soon as a new collection arrives. They come and might spend 
$15,000 to $20,000 or more at one sitting," says Mona Angell, manager of 341 
Bayside. "If you buy a whole line, it adds up." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, extravagant shopping sprees are more of an exception than a rule. Many 
women have become frugal compared to their shopping habits of the 1980s, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago they would spend $1,000 on a gown and wear it one night," 
Patterson says. "Their consciences won't allow them to do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 A punishing recession combined with troubling images of tragedy in places such 
as Rwanda have caused even the wealthiest shoppers to cut back on the amount 
they spend on clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of my clients used to spend a great deal, like $3,000 to $5,000, for one 
outfit. Now those people are spending $1,200, and the ones who spent $1,200 are 
spending $600," Barkouras says. "They're saying, 'I don't want to spend that 
anymore,' and these are people who could still spend anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Women of all economic strata are shopping at discount warehouses and 
consignment stores such as Chez Joey, Recycled Rags and Labels in Newport 
Beach, Stern says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society has taken on a more serious note, and it's reflected in our dress," 
Stern says. "Clothing has come down on the agenda of what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have found they don't need lots of money to look like they're worth a 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can look wonderful at any price. You don't have to have much -- just a 
few basic things you can add and subtract from your wardrobe," Barkouras says. 
"Just make the best statement you can afford."

FIRST PERSON: CHERISHED MEMORIES OF A FUNNY, DECENT SORT OF GUY

 The last time I saw Jay, he was dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in a bar in Long Beach just a few weeks ago. I was there, and Jay was 
there, and so were a dozen or so of our fellow actors. We had just finished a 
murder mystery dinner theater and were sharing a drink and a laugh and a rehash 
of the performance as we often did after a night's work. 
</P>
<P>
 For 2 1/2 years I have been performing on alternate weekends with Jay Mead and 
the others; some have come and gone, but a core of us remains, and Jay is part 
of that core. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also one of the most talented and funny people I've ever known. He has 
that rare combination of perfect timing, quick wit and the ability to contort 
his face, body and voice into any attitude. Even when he's offstage he never 
misses a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Aug. 20, he missed a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Jay is not only an actor, he is also a stuntman -- or was. That 
Saturday he took a routine fall off a 25-foot water tower during a mock 
gunfight at Knott's Berry Farm. Every part of his body hit the mat below, I was 
told, except his head. Now he's lying in a coma, hooked up to life support in 
an Orange hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First we were told that there was some brain activity and that there was hope 
he might recover. I imagined him suddenly sitting up in his hospital bed and 
tossing out some shockingly funny line. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Friday, I learned that he had had several seizures and that he 
"flat-lined" -- meaning no brain activity, no recovery likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay is 29. He has a wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors gathered the family to make decisions about his future. They 
decided to keep him alive for another week to see if maybe a miracle would save 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only imagine the pain his family is feeling. Jay isn't, or wasn't, my 
close friend in the call-you-twice-a-week, help-you-move and 
have-you-over-for-dinner sense. But he wasn't just somebody I worked with a few 
dozen weekends, either. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd talked to him at parties, before shows, after shows over a drink and, of 
course, onstage -- I'd slapped him across the face many times after he'd called 
me some choice names (it was in the script). 
</P>
<P>
 He knew some of the intimate details of my life, and I knew some of his. When 
he was having some personal problems earlier this year, we all tried to comfort 
him. He was the kind of person everyone was happy to be around; even when he 
was sad, he was funny. Even when he'd spent a whole day doing stunts and came 
to the show exhausted, and sometimes injured, he gave it his all and never 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the kind of person you'd want to call if you needed cheering up, not 
just because he was funny, but because he was a very decent sort of guy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It strikes me as tragically ironic that the very thing Jay dedicated his life 
to -- entertaining others -- is now taking his life away. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of his accident are being investigated. I don't know how or 
why it happened. And I don't know why we humans have an insatiable thirst for 
watching others in violent and dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
 I was watching a noon-hour circus performance last week with some co-workers. 
There were acrobats doing daring things on ropes and trapezes without nets. I 
couldn't enjoy it. I wanted to flee, but I was frozen. All I could think of was 
Jay and how I would feel if one of those highflying ladies plummeted to her 
death in an effort to amuse me while I ate my lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Jay's family has been allowed to see him, but I was thinking of 
calling the hospital to find out if they'd let me visit. Maybe to say goodby, 
or maybe so I can accept that this wonderful young man is really dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll remember him the way he was the last time I saw 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time I saw Jay, he was dancing.

THE FASHION-MINDED PROFESSOR; THEY'RE COOL. THEY'RE CASUAL. AND THEY'RE 
DEFINITELY NOT YOUR STEREOTYPICAL TWEED-WEARING INSTRUCTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There's no dress code at college, nor is there a sign posted in the ivy that 
says "No shirts, no shoes, no education." But wearing shirts, shoes and 
something in between is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Sterk, faculty president of Val ley College and notorious down-dresser, 
once admonished a student for wearing only a Speedo swimsuit to class. "I 
thought that was inappropriate, he needed a shirt," says Sterk, who in 24 years 
of teaching has never worn a suit and tie to class. 
</P>
<P>
 It should come as no surprise that some students dress as casually as 
possible, but so do some professors. 
</P>
<P>
 What seems to be missing from the class picture is the college professor who 
wears a rumpled tweed jacket with leather elbow patches. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a stereotype. First came the college professor wearing robes, then 
the tweed jacket. But even that has faded with time," says Sterk, who says 
tweed sports coats are a preppy affectation of the East Coast Ivy League. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterk prefers a more wash-and-wear kind of style, as do many of his 
colleagues. The proponents of the surf-washed West Coast collegiate look say 
they are driven to their clothing choices by the climate and economics. Some 
instructors claim a casual style works as a teaching aid, others say they use 
clothing as a personal statement. There are a few renegade clotheshorses and 
still others who position themselves as futurists, responding to the 
globalization of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart Kosko is one of the most flagrant down-dressers. He wears jogging shorts 
and tank tops to teach fuzzy logic at USC, "and I do it without apology," says 
the associate professor of engineering. "I bring down the dress code for the 
entire department." 
</P>
<P>
 Kosko didn't always dress for demotion; there was a time when he wore the 
working-stiff uniform of suit and tie -- and hated it. "I used to have a hard 
time being a free man wearing a tie," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the university directly from a job in the aerospace industry. I 
noticed there was no dress code on campus. Before long the tie came off, then 
the button-down shirt. Eventually I wondered if I had the courage to dress as I 
pleased or was I a coward? I chose to dress as I pleased and have for several 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 His minuscule workout clothes cause comment within the engineering department, 
"often jokes, often not," he admits. But rather than worry about 
intra-departmental sniping, he finds solace in his fashion leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to give fuzzy logic seminars to people in the computer industry. On 
the first day of the seminar they would all show up in coats and tie, then 
they'd see me. By noon the ties would be gone. By the second day most of the 
suits were gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kosko has found most men are eager to shed their three-piece suits for more 
relaxed clothing. He cites the business community's adoption of dress-down 
Fridays as an example of one tiny step in his direction -- only he's bypassed 
all the intermediate levels of sport clothes and gone straight to the Ts and 
sweats. 
</P>
<P>
 The changing college styles are most noticeable among men. Deviations from the 
standard suit stand out. Women, however, have always had more latitude in what 
is deemed acceptable professional attire. Still, there are those who can find 
ways to rebel. Wendy Adest, for example.  
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old Art Center instructor who wears baby doll dresses, had, until 
recently, curly baby blond hair. Now she is scalped like an Army recruit. She 
found as much liberation cutting her hair as Kosko did abandoning his ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "My old hairstyle seemed to be an old approach to beauty. I think this is high 
fashion and pretty. My style of dress is very feminine -- sheer little dresses 
and lace blouses -- and this hairstyle is a counterpoint to that. My new 
haircut is really about being who I am in a way that is not traditionally 
attractive. It's about being strong," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adest, a sculptor, teaches art history at the Pasadena school. "I don't have 
to have that traditional tweed look. Being an artist gives me license to have a 
different aesthetic. There is a code of dress, though you notice it more among 
the men. They wear khaki pants and blue work shirts. The head of the graduate 
studies program must have 200 blue work shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 One exception to Art Center's mode of chambray shirts is illustration 
instructor David Mocarski. He wears designer clothes -- Japanese designer 
clothes. "I have some Yohji Yamamoto, Comme Des Garcon, Fuji silk, Go silk and 
some Armani," he says lapsing into Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artists are about explorations and experimentation. Every aspect of my life 
is like that, whether it's the clothes I wear or where I live," says Mocarski, 
a resident of the old Pabst brewery Downtown and owner of a Lotus Esprit. His 
appreciation of the finer things in life is made affordable by his sideline 
graphic design company. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he dresses in fine style, Mocarski, like Kosko, receives negative 
reactions from the school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "During teacher reviews, they comment that I dress too well to be an art 
teacher, when they are supposed to be commenting on my teaching ability," he 
grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterk bypasses any style conflicts by dressing for the heat and humility. He 
finds his students relate to him better if he dresses like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach critical thinking, and I try and evoke comments from my students. If 
I dress too formally, they view me as an authority figure and are reticent to 
speak up," Sterk says. "It's also a matter of survival and income. Many of our 
buildings are not air conditioned, and we haven't gotten a raise in five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in more traditionally conservative scholastic environments, dress styles 
have changed. The students at Fuller Theological Seminary aren't impressed with 
coats and ties or even clerical collars, says Isaac Canales, director of 
Hispanic Church Studies and professor of New Testament at Fuller, and pastor at 
Eben-Ezer Family Church in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The generation that is preparing for the ministry is more relaxed than 
previous generations, so I am more relaxed in the classroom and the pulpit. 
It's not surprising, or strange, to see a pastor in more informal attire in the 
pulpit or conducting business in short sleeves without a tie," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Canales says the casual dress style for teachers and ministers has been 
gaining momentum since the societal revolutions of the '60s. Once we relaxed 
our dress codes, we began to assimilate global influences, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the Israeli Parliament. No one wears a tie. In Latin America, the 
guayabera is considered professional attire," says Canales, who wears the 
traditional white shirt with pin tucks and patch pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the way we shop for our clothes has changed," he says. "Years ago, you 
would never think of shopping outside Sears or JCPenney. And look at the 
massive swap meets we have today. It's more like the way the rest of the world 
shops. As we become more internationalized, it's reflected in our attire." 
</P>
<P>
 Canales says his clothing choices -- guayaberas, slacks and sandals -- are a 
result of who he is and where he lives. "The guayabera is part of my Hispanic 
culture; my sandals are more reflective of Southern California surfer attire," 
he says. But he quickly adds: "On Sunday, I wear shoes."

TAKING 'THE FIRST FEW BABY STEPS' INTO POLITICS; FUND RAISING: LIZ BERGMAN'S 
NONPARTISAN L.A. LIST OFFERS A HELPING HAND TO FEMALE CANDIDATES BY STIRRING UP 
SMALL DONATIONS FROM WOMEN WHO DREAM OF POLITICAL PARITY.

<P>
 When Judy Jordan finally made up her mind to run for reelection to her local 
school board, she knew the stakes would be high. She never knew how high until 
she went out and priced them. 
</P>
<P>
 The wooden yard stakes Jordan needed to post her campaign signs ran 99 cents 
each at the hardware store -- and she needed 50 of 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 True, $49.50 barely buys a chicken dinner in the free-spending world of 
big-time politics. But Jordan's entire campaign budget was a mere $3,500 -- and 
dwindling fast as she battled 10 candidates for three seats on the Las Virgenes 
Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired teacher and mother of three, Jordan balked at spending money out of 
her own pocket for extra stakes, silk-screened signs and desperately needed 
flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair to my family to spend our resources to get into an 
office that doesn't pay," said Jordan, 54, whose campaign nearly ran out of 
cash with weeks to go before the November, 1993, election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Jordan won, thanks in part to a last-minute donation of $300 from 
L.A. List, a year-old nonprofit organization that supports pro-choice women 
candidates for everything from city councils to school boards to mosquito 
abatement districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan L.A. List is part of a nationwide effort to help women take 
what founder Liz Bergman calls the "first few baby steps" into politics. Like 
dozens of similar groups elsewhere, it is modeled after the national Democratic 
fund-raising organization EMILY's List, which takes its name from the political 
truism "Early Money Is Like Yeast (it makes the dough rise)." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. List supports women candidates by collecting small donations from women 
all over Los Angeles County and bundling them -- similar to the way political 
action committees work. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican turned Democrat and homemaker turned political activist, Bergman 
said she realized that she had to get involved in women's politics in the 
summer of 1989. That August, the Supreme Court decided that states could write 
their own abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Bergman hardly considered herself a feminist. A UC Berkeley 
graduate in social science, she married young and never strayed far from her 
husband's political taste for Reagan-style Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But when her company turned down a proposal she had drafted to help pay for 
child care for its workers, Bergman decided enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up one day and I was 29 and they were taking our reproductive rights 
away and women weren't gaining anything in the corporate world and I realized 
we had to start taking the reins of power," said Bergman, now 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County politicians say Bergman -- now divorced and a public policy 
student at the Center for Politics and Economics at the Claremont Graduate 
School -- has done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Through L.A. List, Bergman said, she has achieved her vision of helping women 
get a seat on the dais. Beyond just raising money, Bergman and L.A. List try to 
promote cooperation among women all over Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Board of Education member Barbara Honig spent a majority of her 
campaign riddled with anxiety because "everything had to be done and paid for 
at once." But with the help of $300 from L.A. List, Honig won. 
</P>
<P>
 She credits her victory in part to women from Pasadena and Encino, Santa 
Monica and Long Beach -- women who could not vote for Honig but who sent her 
dozens of small, sometimes even meager, donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "These checks were from people who didn't know me," said Honig, 45, a 
first-timer who spent $7,000 in a tight race to win her seat in the fall of 
1993. "I realized this campaign was being touched by women from all over the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 Although L.A. List has donated only about $4,000 to candidates since it 
incorporated last summer, its ranks are growing -- from about two dozen members 
then to 290 today. Eleven of the 19 candidates it backed were elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Its successes mirror a trend emerging nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, 26 women's political action committees gave a total of $3.1 million 
to women candidates nationwide. Two years later, 35 committees donated more 
than $11.5 million, said Lucy Baruch of the Center for the American Woman and 
Politics at Rutgers University. The 9-year-old EMILY's List raised $6.2 million 
in 1992 and was credited in part for the election of 25 women to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But before they can get to Washington, Bergman said, women must gain political 
experience on city councils or school boards. Women running for the first time 
have a tough time getting elected because of a politically deadly combination 
of lack of connections and lack of wealth to fund a successful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates with few resources agreed that they could ill afford to fall into 
the money pit that swallows many politicians. Prestell Askia, who lost a second 
bid for a Cerritos council seat in April, said she kept track of horror stories 
from other races to remind her to keep campaign costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grace Napolitano mortgaged her home for $400,000 when she ran for Assembly, 
and Bob Epple borrowed $40,000 from his mother-in-law," Askia said. "I also 
watched Charles Kim spend $106,000 in a 1990 bid for a Cerritos council seat -- 
and lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to do the best she could with what she had, Askia sat down with her 
husband and children and asked how much money she should spend. The family 
agreed on a ceiling of $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman worked for Kathy O'Neill when she lost a bid for state Senate in the 
May, 1992, Democratic primary in part because she did not have access to the 
financial resources Tom Hayden did. After that race, Bergman worried that the 
next Barbara Boxer or Dianne Feinstein would never make it into even a local 
office: 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see the decade of the woman materializing, I didn't see a woman in 
the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman had reason to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 -- loudly proclaimed the Year of the Woman -- the number of women in 
the U.S. Senate tripled, from two to six. Activists agree that women have a 
long way to go before their political representation matches their numbers in 
the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Women make up 52% of the nation's population, but they hold only 10% of the 
seats in Congress -- including 54 of 535 seats in the House, according to 
figures from the Center for the American Woman and Politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Bergman held a series of what she calls "kitchen cabinets" to share 
her vision that women must give to other women's campaigns to help gain 
political parity. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of these meetings -- literally held in kitchens around town -- emerged a 
decision by Bergman, financial consultant Carolyn Woosley and controller Joy 
Janes to start recruiting members to support L.A. List in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members pay an annual membership fee of $25 and promise to make two 
contributions, of any amount, to candidates recommended by the group each year. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a daunting task to recommend candidates in 88 cities running for more 
than 500 council seats -- not to mention hundreds of other offices. The group 
joined forces with eight local chapters of the National Women's Political 
Caucus to screen candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 Both groups require candidates to support pay equity for women, to agree with 
the concept of the Equal Rights Amendment, to be pro-choice and to advocate 
quality, affordable child care. 
</P>
<P>
 After the caucuses provide L.A. List with a slate of recommended candidates, 
the group's 19-member board votes on which women it will recommend to its 
members.  
</P>
<P>
 Members are then mailed a flyer listing recommended candidates and asked to 
send contributions to a post office box. The checks are tallied, bundled and 
forwarded to each candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates -- including some who lost -- said they would not have 
received contributions from as many women without L.A. List. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a marvelous concept, it gives women the option of seeking out and 
receiving funds that normally would not be available," Askia said.  
</P>
<P>
 Askia used much of her campaign money, including $300 received from L.A. List 
members, to battle fliers from another candidate in a diverse field of eight 
contenders for Cerritos City Council that read, "Wanted: White Male for 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some Los Angeles politicos say the group needs to be more "in your 
face," they say they have received nothing but positive feedback about the 
fledgling organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Bergman has done should be copied everywhere. It has a dual purpose: It 
educates and involves while raising money," said Jill Govan Bauman, one of Los 
Angeles' busiest fund-raisers, who has helped raise money for Feinstein, 
Kathleen Brown and EMILY's List. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, dozens of similar groups are popping up as the trend catches on. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Jersey, there's Pam's List. In New York, Eleanor's List contributes to 
candidates. In Maryland, Harriet's List sends slates of recommended candidates 
to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Malcolm, who founded Washington, D.C.-based EMILY's List in 1985, said 
small spinoffs of her organization will help women gain credibility at the 
local level necessary for them to win large campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always found that the credibility gap keeps women from office. They have 
to prove themselves over and over again," Malcolm said. "When people see women 
can compete financially as well as politically, they take them more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 EMILY's List has had an informal relationship with its spinoffs so far and has 
provided information on fund-raising tactics and advice on political problems. 
Malcolm hopes, however, to mentor and encourage the smaller fund-raising groups 
more often in the 1996 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 While Malcolm is confident about EMILY's ability to keep members -- membership 
ballooned from 3,500 in 1990 to 33,000 today -- Bergman is concerned L.A. List 
members will forget to renew their pledges this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To counteract that apathy, Bergman plans a cable television show that will 
seek to educate potential donors about L.A. List by using examples of 
financially strapped candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 Other L.A. List founders add that the group's members have gotten considerable 
bang for their buck by seeing 11 new Los Angeles County women in local offices 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 And these elections will, eventually, affect women everywhere, said Woosley, 
one of L.A. List's founding members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will see that ultimately women's issues are everyone's issues," she 
said.

SHE SAID / HE SAID: LIGHTENING UP ON THE QUEST FOR 'HEALTHY COLOR' 
</P>

 W ith crop tops and cap-sleeve Ts being all the rage for summer, golden 
midriffs and biceps have become desirable fashion accessories. Nothing 
homelier, we think, than stark-white anything coming between a groovy top and 
bottom. But how much color is enough, how much too much? Is it a tan we need? 
Or just a little blush?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I'm all for my ultra-light tan, the one I got in Hawaii last week from 
wearing 30-strength sun block on the beach. It took days to earn it, natch, and 
I came back to California looking fit and healthy, not bronzed to the max. 
</P>
<P>
 But oh, those Hawaii sun worshipers. Just about every twentysomething waitress 
-- especially the blondes -- looked sixtysomething around the eyes and mouth. 
As a pal says, "a tan fades, but wrinkles last forever." What are they going to 
look like at 30? 40? 50?  
</P>
<P>
 HE: If they don't look like Gabby Hartnett's catcher's mitt (Hartnett played 
for the Cubs in the '20s and '30s, so we're talking about an OLD catcher's 
mitt), they'll probably be auditioning for Stephen King bio-horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to sound like a Cassandra, but Mr. Sun is no longer our pal. The 
ozone layer these days is about as impenetrable as a wet Kleenex, and the rays 
that are hitting us are of the nastiest sort. But we still cling to the idea 
that if you don't look like George Hamilton (a young George; he's been looking 
awfully leathery lately), you're less attractive.  
</P>
<P>
 These days, there's a piper to be paid: Get nice and brown today, look like a 
nuke survivor when you get to be middle-aged. If you get to be middle-aged. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: While I was in Hawaii, I took a peek at the underside of my upper arms 
and saw perfect, unlined, freckle-free skin. It was the first time that I 
actually made the connection between how young that area looked compared to the 
top-side of my arms. If only I hadn't baked myself like a ham when I was in my 
teens! 
</P>
<P>
 I also took the time (I had lots of it) to have a confrontation with my upper 
chest area. Did I have the "California road-map chest" that an East Coast 
friend talks about? ("Why do those California women always show off their 
weathered chests in low-cut tops?" she asks after visits here. "They look 
terrible!") Mine's so-so. If a road-map chest is at the 100-mile mark, I'm at 
about 70. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: File the following under "Kids, don't try this at home": Before I came to 
the inevitable but ridiculously obvious conclusion that I was truly 
Anglo-Saxon, I used to try desperately to turn brown in the summer like my 
dark-skinned, dark-eyed, dark-haired friends. This resulted in a series of 
once-or-twice-a-year sunburns so crimson that they could ignite cotton 
bedsheets.  
</P>
<P>
 I tried every suntan product known to man. No dice. Every June I became Elmo 
the Lobster Boy. I shed my skin like a snake.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, well into adulthood, I gave up. While my friends took their vacations 
in Mazatlan and Hawaii, I took mine in Mammoth. In January. With No. 30 sun 
block. Or Ireland. In October. On horseback, in the rain, with lots of heavy 
sweaters and tweed caps. And No. 30 sun block. These days, if anybody rags me 
about my far-less-than-bronze appearance, I pretend to study a part of their 
face, put on a worried expression and ask, "Has . . . has that mole always been 
there" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the margaritas in Galway are just as good as the ones in Lahaina. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Being California born-and-raised, I've always had a thing for the Golden 
Look. Nothing like a little time in the sun to freshen a tired face, soften a 
stark-white body. And for me, that still holds. I have a real tough time 
tossing on a bathing suit over a no-tan torso. So I head for the back yard to 
get a little color before I wear a swimsuit in public. 
</P>
<P>
 I've talked to dermatologists about this, and they say sun is fine -- even 
desirable for some skin problems -- as long as one wears a sunscreen and 
doesn't overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you like your summer women tan a la Bo Derek in the movie "10"?  
</P>
<P>
 HE: I have to admit I find a light tan attractive on some women. But I still 
have a real weakness for women with red hair, which pretty much puts the kibosh 
on even the slightest tan. To me, the trade-off is more than worth it. I just 
don't know of any real tanning options for the very fair-skinned person. Are 
there any? Any ideas on how we palefaces can compensate? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Dress like Stevie Dykstra, my red-haired grammar school friend! His skin 
was as white as a refrigerator when he joined us at Alamitos Bay in Long Beach 
for those endless childhood summers. He always wore aqua blue trunks. His 
fashion philosophy: blend in with the blue of the water and no one will notice 
that you're as white as a ghost. The kids used to tease him, but I bet they're 
not laughing now. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're a paleface, you should play up your beach look; go for bright, 
bold colors that contrast with your light skin. Pastels are also flattering to 
the fair-toned. And if you're really self-conscious, make a beach cover-up part 
of your silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: You're right about the bright stuff. Maybe that's why I instinctively 
search out aloha shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 But I don't go to the beach much anymore. I've put in enough time there. Maybe 
we fair-skinned types all ought to get together and become mushroom farmers. 
Think of the bucks we'd save on sun block.

 To create the most memorable wedding in history, many brides are going back in 
time. Theme weddings are on the rise with Lady Godiva and Juliet vying these 
days for Scarlett's exalted heroine status. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Barbara Tober, editor in chief of Bride's magazine, says she is so 
enamored with medieval and Renaissance nuptials (the periods often meld), she 
recently joined the New York chapter of the Society for Creative Anachronism in 
hopes of getting on guest lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the chivalry, the innocence of it. They were very bloody times," Tober 
concedes, "but what is being embraced in the weddings are the costumes, the 
charm, the beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the drama. Rock star Dolores O'Riordan, of the Cranberries, 
recently shook Ireland with her medieval-gone-mod wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed a "Lady Godiva wanna-be" by the British press, O'Riordan was married in 
Tipperary's 814-year-old Holy Cross Abbey in an ivory costume. It consisted of 
a lace tank top and leggings, chiffon robe, tall lace-up boots, starburst 
jewelry in her navel and a sterling silver "crown of thorns" on her head, with 
a trailing veil attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the veil and the robe, "she could have been Juliet," opines Cynthia 
Rowley, the New York designer who created the wedding outfit, collaborating 
with jewelry designer Dayne Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
 The groom, Don Burton, wore a black leather tuxedo "that looked sort of old," 
Rowley says. "But the coolest part was, he rode up with his best man on a black 
stallion." O'Riordan arrived in a freshly painted white cart pulled by a white 
horse. Her bridesmaid, however, rode beside the cart atop a white bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The priests were pretty cool, but Dolores sure shocked the whole country," 
observes Rowley, who was there. "She wasn't trying to be controversial, but she 
feels Ireland needs to make some advances. In her music, she has a lot of 
things to say, so I think this was saying something too." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach artist-actress Ena Henderson says her fairy-tale wedding was 
a way of expressing gratitude to her groom "for making me feel like a 
princess." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson married John Burrud, a third-generation California filmmaker, at the 
Hyatt Regency where her father once was general manager. With her father's 
experience in Renaissance banquets and her dogged research, the event was an 
historic marvel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used every bit of the six months before the wedding," says Henderson, who 
started the medieval ball rolling with a simple McCall's pattern. A Huntington 
Beach seamstress made a butter-yellow and ivory drop-waisted, short-sleeved 
gown with a three-foot train. Then Henderson loaded it with feathers, faux 
gems, silk braid, and a pearl-and-gold belt. She trimmed her gauntlets with 
braid and crafted a hat from watercolor paper that she covered with fabric, 
adding a fingertip veil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson selected the costumes and titles for the bridal party (her father 
was the king, her mother the queen, her stepmother a duchess). Guests had to 
come in medieval regalia. The minister, who stumbled over the ceremony 
Henderson concocted in pseudo old-English, dressed as a friar. 
</P>
<P>
 The groom wore black tights and boots; a green-leather vest, which Henderson 
ornamented with jewels and silk braid; a billowy white shirt; leather belt, and 
arm bands and a sword. He and his princess-bride sat on thrones, looking down 
as their guests feasted at long banquet tables and watched a juggler, belly 
dancer and sword-fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want it to be another wedding where you had to sit through a 
ceremony, then go to a place where you ate and listened to a weird band," says 
Henderson, 28. "I wanted people to feel they were at a great party." 
</P>
<P>
 Brides 25 and older are making theme weddings popular, says Tober, the 
magazine editor. "They have more fully formed personalities. They want to make 
a statement that says there is something special about them. When you're much 
younger, you don't have the confidence to do things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Garcia, the Long Beach florist who created Henderson's peacock-plume 
bouquet and medieval table decorations (mountains of fruits and vegetables 
accented with fresh moss, river-polished stones, herbs, daisies, cattails, 
wheat), agrees with Tober. 
</P>
<P>
 He has done three theme weddings this year -- medieval, Renaissance and 
flapper, with an antebellum wedding coming up. "That's more than I've done in 
the past 15 years. All three clients were very strong women in terms of their 
personalities and careers -- not just dreamers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People who dream of fairy-tale weddings frequently call Medieval Times Dinner 
& Tournament, the dinner theater in Buena Park where the Burruds first saw 
their sword fighters in action. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's Merrily Lennartson says most people decide to go elsewhere 
because of a lack of privacy. Wedding parties have to join everyone for the 
show and medieval dinner, which consists of roasted chicken, spare ribs and 
basted potatoes "all eaten with the hands." 
</P>
<P>
 But a 35-year-old American bride living in Australia wasn't deterred. "We did 
everything over the fax machine," Lennartson says. "She was really into 'Beauty 
and the Beast' and she wanted to have her wedding here." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, memorable medieval engagements are a common occurrence. For 
a $25 fee, a man gets a suit of armor and a hiding place. At the appointed 
moment, "he pops out of nowhere to propose," Lennartson says. "It could be in 
front of 300 people. That's really taking a chance."

BEHIND THE SCENES: FOR WOMEN OF COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Beauty Makeover Secrets for Asian and Hispanic Coloring Workshop" at 
Rancho Santiago Community College in Santa Ana recently attracted a dozen 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Taught by Betty Nethery, a color and image consultant with Uniquely You in 
Lake Forest, the workshop helped women of color identify the uniqueness of 
their skin tones and facial features.Nethery, a former model and makeup artist, 
told participants to take an honest look at their appearance and invest time to 
look their best. 
</P>
<P>
 Other points made during the 3 1/2-hour program were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Experiment with custom-mixed foundations because skin with golden, yellow, 
gray or green undertones is difficult to match with off-the-shelf foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use eye makeup to contour a flat eyelid shape if you want the illusion of a 
fuller lid, and use blush and foundation to create the look of high cheekbones, 
if so desired. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dark eyes and dark hair look best with makeup in bright tones such as pinks, 
fuchsias, reds and burgundies. Avoid warm, dull or earth tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Another workshop is scheduled for Sept. 29 at Orange Coast College in Costa 
Mesa. The cost is $29. Call (714) 432-5880 for information.

HOT PROPS: KICKIN' IT

By ROSE APODACA JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just an old model being added to the line, and it wouldn't get a 
marketing push. But trend watchers noticed it anyway, attracted to its quirky 
design that bordered on dorky. After all, what's ugly, odd or just plain sick 
is good these days in the youth culture arena. And the Kick Highs, a basic 
all-purpose family bootie developed in France in the '70s, fit the bill . . . 
and the foot. "This shoe hasn't changed a stitch since its inception," says 
Larry Dula, president of Kickers, the distributor licensed to sell the boots in 
the United States. "It was one out of 30 other models in the collection and the 
one that's getting the greatest recognition." In toddler to adult sizes 
($45-$80), Kick Highs come in basic black, brown and beige as well as in bright 
colors and pasels. Get an A

 Season in and season out, keeping "in fashion" doesn't have to mean having a 
spanking new wardrobe. A few staples can do the trick. One such expected to 
take us well into '95 is the short A-line skirt. "It's definitely an 
essential," agrees Veronique Vienne, spokeswoman for Express stores. "An A-line 
silhouette works especially great if your (figure is) a little less than 
pristine. The shorter length allows us to show our legs off again. It's not a 
mini, but it's short enough to allow a kind of freedom that we couldn't have 
with long, straight skirts." The renewed focus on the leg has in turn resulted 
in a plethora of treatments, from hosiery to high boots. Find a fall palette of 
A-lines at Express in chamois, black or hunter green suede ($49); black, 
burgundy, Greek olive or stone corduroy ($29) and black, gray and argyle wool 
($49). Young and Hip Only

 For those funky ladies who demand more out of their shopping experience than 
fabulous clothes, there's Ladies Lounge, above Lido Skate in Newport Beach. 
Upon entering the office space-turned boutique/art gallery, visitors must walk 
over a white vinyl floor that looks like tuck-'n'-roll booth upholstery at a 
swanky lounge bar. That takes them to the "closet," a room filled with a toy 
record player, blue and pink faux fur furniture and traditional "housewife" 
tools -- such as an ironing board as a shelf for baby-style Tees -- used as 
merchandise displays. Owner Michelle Ponce's picks are right on target for the 
alternative set: selections from Love, Paper Doll, Truck, Tripp, Pleasure 
Swell, Michael Seray, Brat, X Girl and others. She also stocks the store with 
second-hand finds like fitted '50s sweaters and ultra-feminine '60s dresses. 
"Fashion is about dressing up, like putting on a costume and assuming the mood 
of the clothes," says Ponce, who loves to dabble in all periods and trends. 
Most items are well under $50. "I love clothes," she adds. "But I don't like 
having to pay a lot for (them), so I try to ensure that's everything's 
affordable." ROSE APODACA JONES

CLOSET RX; PRACTICALITY IS THE POINT WITH NAIL LENGTH, HUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

 Women have always been burdened with a particular fashion rule: While guys can 
make their hands presentable just by keeping the grime from sticking beneath 
their fingernails, women have had to keep long fingernails clean and polished, 
no matter how impractical it may be.  
</P>
<P>
 Length is a major problem. Just how long is too long? "The general rule is 
that the free edge of the nail, which extends out beyond the finger, should be 
half the length of the bed of the nail," says Belva Quigley of Belva's Nails 
Naturally in Orange. "Any longer than that, and you may have problems doing 
intricate work with your fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some manicurists try to accommodate their clients' requests for long nails and 
also make them practical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since a majority of my clients, from stockbrokers to secretaries, work on 
computers, I'll give them some fake nails of different lengths to try if they 
want longer nails," says Bridget Felton, a manicurist in Santa Ana. "Some can 
work with the longer lengths, and others need to have theirs cut back." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you can work with longer nails, however, give it a lot of thought 
before trying them. "They can draw attention away from the outfit you're 
wearing," says Quigley. "And when they're out to three inches, they can look 
like talons." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone has the time or extra cash for a standing appointment 
at the nail shop. Most women give themselves a manicure, which doesn't have to 
look amateurish if they take a little extra time.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't rush; don't do them just before you have to go to work," says Felton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relax, put some music on, and get your materials ready so you don't have to 
try and open a stuck bottle of polish remover while your nails are wet.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're right-handed, start with your right hand," says Quigley. "It's the 
hardest one to paint and you'll be a little more cautious if you start out with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Use a cuticle pusher around the cuticles to keep from painting on them. It's 
best to soak your nails (as Madge did on those dish soap commercials) just 
before working the cuticles to make them easier to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like clothing, polish colors go along with the seasons. Lighter pinks and 
shades of white are seen more in the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darker tones are popular at other times of the year, especially in shades of 
red and even brown," says Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're looking for the most uniform, conservative color, go with the 
French manicure, which is often coated in a neutral or a pale polish.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: HEY, TEENS: CUTE IS OUT, BIG IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The series: "My So-Called Life" (ABC, Thursdays at 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The setup: Trials and tribulations of 15-year-old Angela Chase (Claire Danes, 
pictured right), both at home and at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The costume designer: Patrick Norris, who won an Emmy for his work on 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
 The look: Angela is good news for anyone who hates cute. Her wardrobe consists 
of oversized everything -- dresses, jumpers, overalls, plaid flannel shirts. 
You get the feeling that Angela would feel weird in anything form-fitting or 
super short. While she's no PIB (Person in Black), her palette matches her teen 
Angst -- muddy, olive-y and somber. That's not to say Angela isn't of the 
moment -- she just veers away from cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check: The girl wouldn't have a chance in "Beverly Hills, 90210." (The 
locale appears to be anywhere, U.S.A.) If you're wondering if Angela has a 
champagne budget, try Snapple instead. One of Angela's low-cost standouts, 
appearing on an episode entitled "The Zit," is her clashing plaid shirt and 
shorts statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend watch: Angela probably shops in malls, the occasional thrift shops and 
maybe the nearest Army supply for her boots. Any teen could reproduce the 
Angela look at home, and probably will (especially the overalls and plaids). 
</P>
<P>
 Good/bad hair days: So Angela's new dyed hair evokes shades of golden 
retrievers you've known and loved, but the blunt cut is simple and uncontrived. 
On the other hand, you want to reach for a scissors every time the wild Rayanne 
(A.J. Langer, pictured left) appears with Michael Jackson-esque strands falling 
in her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Just when uniforms are making a comeback in California public schools, 
two distinctly dissimilar boys at school prove how expressive clothing can be. 
Rickie (Wilson Cruz), the androgynous one, sports eyeliner and loud, off-beat 
patterned shirts and sweaters. He's undoubtedly a future candidate for Gianni 
Versace. Meanwhile, Brian (Devon Gummersall), the brainy square, is Mr. 
Button-Down Shirt. Imagine, they both coexist in the same school. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: No wonder Mom (Bess Armstrong) gets on Angela's nerves. Like a string of 
other TV matriarchs before her, she favors clothes with no character -- 
especially big, droopy sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: A series spokesperson informs that both stores and labels are "very, 
very confidential information." BETTY GOODWIN

FIRST PERSON: TRUE CONFESSIONS FROM A COSMETICS-FREEBIE FIEND

 I own lipstick in hues of grape Kool-Aid and tomato red, shimmering eye shadow 
in parrot green and flowery perfume that muddies the air like the ozone layer. 
Wait, let me explain: 
</P>
<P>
 They were free. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Through full-page ads and TV spots, famous cosmetics companies hoodwink 
weak-willed customers like me into buying up a storm to get a "free gift with 
purchase." Buy the purchase minimum -- about $16.50 -- and you get six or so 
doll-sized samples of lipstick and other products -- a $45 value for free! the 
ads irresistibly trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole shebang is usually stuffed into a makeup clutch that looks in the 
ads to be the size of carry-on luggage but is actually no bigger than a pencil 
case. Or sometimes, the freebies are stuffed into a black canvas tote bag. Four 
of these totes lie in my closet, eagerly awaiting an opportunity to tote. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't always make purchases willy-nilly just to sock away freebies. The 
gifts typically include at least one prime primping apparatus: a fold-up 
hairbrush, a mini-compact, a travel-sized foundation. In fact, I haven't paid 
for moisturizer in years because I keep getting it free. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, I'm pining for: Estee Lauder's nine-piece gift with $16.50 
purchase, including refirming creme for your refirming needs; Lancome's 
eight-piece sampler with $17.50 purchase, including a round mirror that looks 
like a Pog, and Lancaster's eight-piece bonus with $16 purchase, including an 
anti-stress eye mask, which, frankly, I could use this very minute. 
</P>
<P>
 I've accumulated so many freebies that I forget I have them. I usually find an 
unused mascara sample months later in my purse, molded sloppily shut by 
half-wrapped chewing gum. And I tuck some of my unopened bounty away, like the 
1.5-ounce tube of body exfoliating creme, in case I should ever foliate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the thrill is in the chase -- once the flush wears off, I end up 
fobbing off most of the freebies on friends or saving them for charity. I 
actually get grumpy when I buy astringent or moisturizer and there's no gift. I 
revert to a Cracker Jack mentality: Where's my toy surprise? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loves a gift," Estee Lauder spokeswoman Muriel Gonzalez said. "It's 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 I've even gotten to know who offers what in the seasonal promotion cycles. 
July? Why, that's Lancome's Bastille Day gift, which includes a shoulder bag 
with four cosmetic samples -- and a French baguette. 
</P>
<P>
 I love that baguette, in a way I can't explain. I wait for it, with a dreamy 
same-time-next-year anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so fun -- a French baguette," Lancome spokeswoman Leila Meresman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not have figures on how sales zoom during a free gift promotion. But 
even she can't wait to be alone when new product samples are passed out at 
corporate meetings. "I race back to my hotel room and rip (them) open," she 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 I always wait for the gift offers before stocking up on essentials. A tip for 
first-time freebie fanciers: Note the purchase minimums, which typically vary 
from $13.50 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent promotion, for instance, the gift came with a $17.50 purchase. But 
the cosmetics maker's most popular items are in the $14.50 to $16 range -- not 
enough to get the freebie. So you get duped into buying two astringents or two 
eye-makeup removers -- and spending more like $32 plus tax. 
</P>
<P>
 You also have to know the lingo of the freebie ads -- that eye shadow in "pure 
warmth" is brown, that "Fruition Triple Reactivating Complex" is a face cream, 
that "Brillant A Levres Blackberry Muire Mulberry" is wine-colored lip gloss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, cosmetic companies have ponied up freebies other than makeup. Gifts 
have included silver-plated fruit bowls, designer T-shirts and oversize canvas 
purses with matching knit gloves. This opens up a whole new world for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't stop at cosmetics anymore. I recently joined the World Wildlife Fund 
because, sure, I want to save the rain forests. But I also have my pure-warmth 
shadowed eyes on the gift with membership -- a little red tote bag, to keep my 
other ones company.

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; HENRY SCHIELEIN LEAVES HAWAII FOR PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's back . 
</P>
<P>
 After being chief operating officer of the Grand Wailea Resort, Hawaii, for 
one year, Henry Schielein (former vice president of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in 
Dana Point) has returned to Orange County to become president of the Balboa Bay 
Club in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawaii is beautiful, but when you live there, it's like champagne and caviar 
every day," Schielein said at the waterfront club on Tuesday. "You get tired of 
it. As beautiful as Maui is, it's the same day after day." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dave Wooten, president of International Bay Clubs Inc. (parent company of 
the Balboa Bay Club), called Schielein to ask him to recommend a presidential 
candidate for the club, Schielein told him he'd "think about it," he said, 
chuckling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about it, all right. And before Wooten and club chairwoman Beverly 
Ray could say "please," Schielein said "yes" to the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a magnificent location," said Schielein, eyeing the sun-dappled bay. 
"Where do you find something like this?" 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for the social-set -- especially for those who fancy fine foods, 
wines and elegant parties -- is that Schielein plans to help turn the club into 
a five-star resort after its $30-million expansion is complete in five years. 
(Watch for the Balboa Bay Club to become the Balboa Bay Club and Resort under 
Schielein's tutelage.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The expansion includes a 150-room, deluxe boutique hotel," Schielein said. 
That also means a huge, pavilion-style ballroom with a sweeping, poolside 
veranda -- perfect for the alfresco parties favored by the coastline crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a gourmet club, a wine festival, an epicurean society," Schielein 
said. And, yes, his famous cigar smoker will become an annual event at the 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 A gazebo, a spa and a luxurious presidential suite will also be part of the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gazebo at the Ritz-Carlton was lovely for weddings," Schielein said. "And 
one will work beautifully here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to take this famous club to new heights." 
</P>

 Billur Wallerich fills new post: Style-maven Billur Wallerich has been named 
director of community relations at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. As such, 
she will help coordinate the slew of charity events annually staged at the 
world-class retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a coup. "Never underestimate your networking ability or your 
volunteer work," said Wallerich on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallerich, who was formerly director of fashion and publicity for Neiman 
Marcus at Fashion Island Newport Beach, began her career in style and community 
relations in the late '70s when she volunteered to chair a fashion show for 
South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked with Bullock's on the show and loved doing it," she said. She told 
the fashion director of Bullock's to keep her in mind for future events. "I 
could see this was something I would enjoy doing on a regular basis," Wallerich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years went by. Finally, she received a call. The fashion director of 
Bullock's had been named fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. Would Wallerich 
like to be her assistant? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. She held that post for one year. And when the director left, Wallerich 
filled her shoes for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to Neiman Marcus in 1990, (and her work with the community caught the 
eye of mall mogul Henry Segerstrom, managing partner of C.J. Segerstrom & Sons 
-- owner of South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Wallerich is ecstatic at the prospect of acting as liaison 
for the center's community-related activities. "There is an ongoing evolution 
at the plaza," she said. "And a tremendous growth. The store mix is 
fascinating. I am thrilled to be part of it."

LIBERATING THE LEGS; WHEN BARE GAMS WON'T DO, SHEER HOSE AND SUBTLE SOCKS STEP 
IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In olden days, a glimpse of stocking may have been shocking, but today wearing 
no stockings with high heels is the real shocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the recent Richard Tyler fall fashion show sponsored by Nordstrom, the 
models wore three-inch and four-inch high heels with no hose," said Mary Dell 
Barkouras, a Newport Beach fashion consultant. "We've seen it in Europe for 
years, but now it's coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering women have been wearing dark hosiery for years, this au natural 
look takes some getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
 The coordinated look of black dress, black hose and black shoes created an 
unbroken line from torso to toe, not to mention that dark hose give the 
illusion of thinner legs. Now, designers want to liberate the leg with either 
no hose or hosiery in natural colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a few women can get away with this look, in my opinion," Dell Barkouras 
says. "It looks best with tanned legs, but we're not supposed to get tans, (so) 
a light-colored hose is needed."  
</P>
<P>
 "The nude leg is certainly a fashion option," said Carol Horowitz, general 
manager of Neiman-Marcus, Fashion Island Newport Beach. "The hosiery to wear 
for the look is ultra sheer. It gives the illusion of no hose." 
</P>
<P>
 For fall, Donna Karan, the largest proponent of black legs, has come out with 
a second-skin hose in Lycra 3-D. 
</P>
<P>
 Karan's and other designers' nude hose colors are designed in many shades to 
wear as a summer tans fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Karan's lightweight hosiery can be mixed with linen to add subtle color and 
texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Socks, too, are adopting the subtle look with heathered colors and mild 
textures for weekend wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socks look good worn above the knee and below it," Horowitz says. "The trendy 
look of above-the-knee socks and short skirts can succeed only on those who 
don't mind showing their thighs. Knee socks will also come in the natural 
shades and in outrageous ones like Gianni Versace's shiny silver ones for 
evening wear."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: BUT WHO WORE THE GLOVES AT NEVERLAND?

 It was too, too top secret. Valley clothier Rick Pallack warned at the outset 
that he could not reveal even a tiny detail about Michael Jackson or the guests 
at Saturday's much publicized wedding celebration at the Neverland Valley 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 He did want us to know, though, who had designed the wedding garb for groom 
Miko Brando -- son of Marlon and bodyguard to Michael -- and his many 
attendants (including actor Jon Lovitz, who once worked as Pallack's stock 
boy). It was Rick! 
</P>
<P>
 "Miko's a big man, so I made him a double-breasted, shawl-collar tux of super 
lightweight wool and a couple of white, pleated tuxedo shirts -- in case one 
got soiled," Pallack said. For the party at the ranch, Pallack had the groom 
change into a cream-colored dinner jacket with an ivory crepe de chine tuxedo 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about best man Michael Jackson? Pallack clammed up. "I'm not at 
liberty to discuss that." But we could tell it was killing him.

 Location, Location, Location: Inside Media has put the kibosh on rumors that 
Revlon bigwig Ron Perelman is pulling his company's ads from Hearst-owned 
magazines out of solidarity with his lady love. Perelman was supposedly 
irritated by Esquire's recent profile of Patricia Duff. (Hey, we'd kill for a 
full-page photo that made us look that fabulous!) According to Inside Media, 
the real reason for the Revlon pullout isn't so romantic: Perelman's 
displeasure is over placement of Revlon's ads. Once occupying privileged spots 
in several Hearst magazines, Revlon ads have been bumped to less desirable 
positions because the company is buying fewer and fewer of them. And as we all 
know, money talks. Just look where Estee Lauder, Cosmair and Procter & Gamble 
ads are roosting.

 Lost Our Passport: You'll have to jet up to San Francisco next month if you 
plan to attend Bullock's Passport show and AIDS benefit, until recently 
scheduled for a repeat performance at the Universal Amphitheatre on Oct. 5. The 
runway fashion show, a 12-year tradition with Macy's San Francisco, moved down 
to L.A. last October. 
</P>
<P>
 But Macy's/Bullock's spokeswoman Betty Krogh said two major sponsors pulled 
their financial support at the last minute, forcing the cancellation. "Because 
we are a company in Chapter 11, we had to be fiscally responsible," she said. 
Two local charities, the Magic Johnson Foundation and AIDS Project Los Angeles 
were to have benefited from the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, San Francisco's Passport shows -- Sept. 22 and Sept. 23 at Fort 
Mason -- will go on as planned. Krogh said the San Francisco shows have been 
sold out for weeks, whereas tickets for the L.A. event had not yet gone on 
sale. Plans are already underway to find sponsors for next year's show in L.A. 
</P>

 In Virtual Color: We were thrilled to bump into Michelle Cole at the annual 
City of Beverly Hills cocktail party Monday night honoring Emmy-award nominated 
costume designers. However, Cole, who is nominated for the second time for her 
work on Fox's "In Living Color," seemed to be missing something. Where were all 
those funky characters? 
</P>
<P>
 Other TV designers had a costumed model or two in tow, but Cole, whose work 
can currently be seen in "Blankman," was solo. Turns out Fox Studios wouldn't 
let Cole on the lot to dig out costumes from the canceled show. "When you're 
canceled," she said stoically, "you're canceled." As for the costumes, "some 
transvestite is probably wearing them now." 
</P>

 Nothin' Like a Dame: Heads up for this week's clever fashion tip, aimed at 
those of us not blessed with hourglass figures. In a word, or two, men's 
skirts. They're nice and short and cut wide around the waist. At Caliber in 
West Hollywood, we stumbled onto John Bartlett's festive prints styled as 
sarongs or pleated like Roman soldiers tunics, for about $48 each. They were as 
short as any micro-mini we lusted after on the runways. And who among us 
couldn't use a few extra inches around the waist? But better hurry, the guys 
are grabbing them like hot cakes for Labor Day pool parties. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Around Town: Even though it's so gruesome no one wants to talk about it, rumor 
has it that trendy young people are quietly snapping up green Converse tennies, 
the shoe worn by Kurt Cobain on the night of his suicide. Too bad the costumer 
for "Natural Born Killers" didn't capitalize on yet another sick aspect of fame 
and tragedy. . . . Mark your calendars for the Sept. 9 "The Adventures of 
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" look-alike party at the Hollywood Roosevelt 
Hotel. Tickets are $15 at the door, but free for anyone dressed like a drag 
queen.

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; INTERIM CITY ATTY. OKD OVER RICHARD'S PROTEST; 
POLITICS: VOLATILE COUNCILMAN CASTS ONLY VOTE AGAINST HIRING OF CRISTINA L. 
SIERRA, A PARTNER IN A WELL-KNOWN L.A. LAW FIRM. ACTION IS PRECEDED BY AN ANGRY 
BACK-ROOM DEBATE OVER THE SELECTION PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a fiery closed session that boiled over into name-calling, the Pasadena 
City Council has chosen Cristina L. Sierra, a partner in a prominent Los 
Angeles law firm, as the interim replacement for its ousted city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In the public session last week, council members voted 6 to 1, with Councilman 
Isaac Richard dissenting, to hire Sierra and pay her firm of Adams, Duque & 
Hazeltine $15,000 a month after an explosive back-room debate over the 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra was hired after allegations of sex discrimination led to the forced 
resignation of previous City Atty. Victor Kaleta. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to extend my thanks to the City Council for giving me the opportunity 
to work for the city of Pasadena," said Sierra, 37. "It will be a challenge. 
But I think we'll have a great working relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds of her speech, Sierra got a baptism by fire as Richard brought 
the closed session argument into the public arena. Even though Sierra is a 
Latina, Richard accused his colleagues of not considering affirmative action 
and including Latino and African American-owned law firms on a short list from 
which the interim city attorney was selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how qualified Ms. Sierra is, we can't get away from the fact she 
works for a white firm," Richard said. "Isn't it a pity her selection was 
tainted by the fact she didn't compete against minority firms?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the closed session, Richard could be heard insulting Councilman Chris 
Holden, who is also African American, for not taking his side on the issue. At 
one point, profanity was clearly heard before Mayor Kathryn Nack screamed at 
Richard to restrain himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra was recommended by a special council committee consisting of Holden and 
Councilmen William R. Thomson Jr. and William Crowfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowfoot, an attorney in a Los Angeles law firm, said the selection will 
encourage more large, mostly white, law firms to hire and promote minorities, 
which he said is just as important as the creation of minority-owned firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson, who is also an attorney, said the committee interviewed attorneys 
Aug. 20 from three of the best-known municipal law firms selected by a 
consultant and were unanimous in their selection of Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta was forced to take early retirement Aug. 17 after an April 
investigation bolstered the claims of female attorneys in his office that he 
had discriminated against women in making promotions. Kaleta has denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta, 55, who earned $110,894 a year, will stay on the city payroll until 
March 8, when he officially retires. A nationwide search is under way to fill 
the position permanently.

2 DOCTORS FACE CHARGES IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES; CRIME: FORMER MEDICAL RESIDENT 
IS ACCUSED OF ATTACKING TWO WOMEN AT HOSPITAL. IN SEPARATE CASE, A GLENDORA 
PHYSICIAN ALLEGEDLY RAPED A PATIENT WHILE SHE WAS UNDER SEDATION.

<P>
 Two San Gabriel Valley doctors charged separately in sexual assaults against 
three female patients face criminal proceedings in court next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pezhaman Ebrahimzadgh, 29, a former medical resident at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital, is accused of sexual assault and battery against two women who came 
to the hospital for medical care last year. He is scheduled to return Oct. 17 
to Pasadena Municipal Court for the completion of a preliminary hearing in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 On that same day, Charles Metzger, a Glendora urologist, is scheduled for 
trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on charges that he raped a woman in his 
office during medical treatment in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against the two doctors are unrelated and resulted from separate 
police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena police began investigating Ebrahimzadgh after a woman complained to 
her attending physician about a sexual assault that occurred in the emergency 
room at Huntington Memorial Hospital. Two women, a 35-year-old and a 
30-year-old, told police that they were separately assaulted by Ebrahimzadgh on 
July 15 and Oct. 27 last year. Authorities have said there might be other 
victims who have not come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women testified during the first two days of the preliminary hearing, 
which began Aug. 18.  
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials declined to comment on the case. A hospital spokeswoman 
said Ebrahimzadgh was under a four-year residency training program and was 
dismissed earlier this year by the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Metzger arose after a woman accused him of raping her 
during an office procedure a year and a half ago. Although she was sedated at 
the time, the woman said she was aware of the alleged rape, and sought a rape 
exam at Arcadia Methodist Hospital within hours of leaving Metzger's office. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA from samples of sperm found during a rape exam matched DNA from samples of 
Metzger's blood and saliva. On Aug. 11 a grand jury indicted Metzger on two 
counts: rape by use of drugs and rape of a person who is unconscious of the 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded innocent Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger denies raping the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Steven Mandell, argues that the DNA test linking Metzger to the 
sperm sample is inaccurate and that the memory of the rape is actually a 
drug-induced delusion caused by the sedative Versed. Further, Metzger's X-ray 
technician says that Metzger never had the opportunity to commit rape because 
he was never alone with the woman patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Versed, a "conscious sedative" used in outpatient procedures, does not so much 
block pain as induce amnesia, causing patients to forget what happened while 
they were under its influence, according to the drug company that manufactures 
the sedative. But Mandell insists that the drug may also cause delusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miya Cattilini, an X-ray technician for Metzger, said in an interview that she 
was in the room from the time the woman entered until she was dressed to leave. 
But Glendora Police Detective Brett Mickalson said Cattilini told him she left 
the room for various periods of up to a minute and a half to develop X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged victim says that the Versed did not make her forget what happened 
during the rape because she had been using painkillers during an extended 
illness that raised her tolerance level, allowing her to remember the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lauren Weis, who is prosecuting the case and heads the 
county's sex crimes unit, said the sperm samples in this case were analyzed by 
Cellmark Diagnostics, the Maryland lab that is studying the blood samples for 
the O.J. Simpson murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab uses a conservative method of calculation that can sometimes favor 
defendants. Yet, in this case, the lab found that the DNA banding pattern 
matching Metzger's is found in only one in17 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Mickalson said the DNA test eclipses all doubt surrounding the case.

BOOK ON MIGRATION RECOUNTS 'REMAKING OF MONTEREY PARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in the Bay Area, the only Monterey that Tim Fong knew was the city 
in which John Steinbeck's novel "Cannery Row" was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1986, he read an article about how massive Chinese migration was 
transforming a suburban city in Los Angeles County and stirring tensions among 
the longtime white and Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Fong, a scholar and journalist, decided to turn his documentary 
eye to Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, the result is a new book called "The First Suburban 
Chinatown: The Remaking of Monterey Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Published this year by Temple University Press, Fong's book traces the 
founding and history of Monterey Park, focusing on how the Chinese affected 
local politics, urban planning, Chamber of Commerce meetings, real estate 
prices and cultural values, splitting the formerly close-knit community into 
factions sparring over the speed and density of desired development. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Fong's book has drawn praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a meticulously researched piece of work that does a good job of 
providing very rich detail of the city," said Leland T. Saito, an assistant 
professor of ethnic studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Saito, who plans to use the book as a reference in his classes, possibly 
assigning his students to read selected chapters, also calls the book a window 
to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of other places is already the reality in Monterey Park, and it 
helps us understand the new sorts of suburban communities that are becoming 
more common in the U.S.," Saito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong's interest in Monterey Park began after he read the 1986 article in the 
San Francisco Chronicle. When he was asked to produce five half-hour radio 
documentaries about changing demographics in California, Fong chose Monterey 
Park for his first show. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of that research, Fong realized he had enough material for a 
book. He says most of the existing literature on Chinatowns in America focused 
either on densely packed urban enclaves such as those found in San Francisco 
and New York or on agricultural settlements such as in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park was neither. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have an image of Chinatown as being a poor, touristy, ghetto kind 
of place, and Monterey Park is a thriving middle-class suburban community, and 
that's unique in and of itself," Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up in ethnically diverse East Oakland in an assimilated Chinese 
American family, Fong found Monterey Park a cultural eye-opener. Until then, 
the closest he had come to traditional Chinese society was weekly visits to San 
Francisco's Chinatown to visit his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 36-year-old scholar decided he had to move to Monterey Park and 
submerge himself in its rhythms to understand the forces reshaping the city. In 
1990, he and his wife rented an apartment and Fong took a volunteer job doing 
oral histories for the Monterey Park Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong said he was overwhelmed by the city of 60,000 -- which at the time of the 
1990 U.S. Census had become 56% Asian -- the first city in the continental 
United States to have a majority Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience gave him a glimmer of what many longtime white and Latino 
residents must have experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was inundated with so many Chinese-language signs, businesses," recalled 
Fong, who speaks some Cantonese but conducted all his research in English. "At 
the stores, everyone would start talking to me in Chinese. I can empathize with 
how the non-Asians for many reasons felt out of place because I wasn't totally 
a part of it either; so in that sense it gave me a very good perspective of 
both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong spent one year reporting the book and another writing it. He lived 18 
months in the nation's first suburban Chinatown. Eventually, the book became 
his doctoral dissertation in ethnic studies at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong found that Monterey Park, which had large numbers of Jews and Latinos, 
was historically considered a fairly liberal city and touted itself as a 
cultural melting pot. After World War II, many families of Mexican and Japanese 
heritage moved in. When the Chinese began arriving in the late 1960s and 1970s, 
Monterey Park initially welcomed them too. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Fong quotes a 1977 column written by Eli Isenberg in the Monterey 
Park Progress: "The city should . . . call on all organizations . . . to play 
their part in offering a hand of friendship to our new neighbors. . . . They 
should be invited to join service clubs, serve on advisory boards, become 
involved in little theater and PTA." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them thought the newcomers would assimilate and become good 
neighbors just like the Japanese, but that didn't work out," Fong points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Chinese formed their own Chamber of Commerce. They bought and 
tore down many single-family homes, replacing them with large apartment 
buildings, which were quickly rented by newly arriving Chinese. A worldwide 
boom in real estate was heightened by land speculation, which drove up the 
price of land in Monterey Park and forced many old-time businesses to close, 
unable to meet rising rents. In their place rose businesses catering to 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong found that the Chinese actually revived the local economy in Monterey 
Park at a time when it was moribund. But he also writes sympathetically about 
longtime white residents who sold out to Chinese buyers rather than watch their 
community change. 
</P>
<P>
 In his research, Fong pored over national publications as well as local 
newspapers for demographic data, photos and accounts of stormy council meetings 
and tempestuous city elections. He also recorded more than 40 interviews with 
white Protestant settlers, third-generation Mexican Americans, Jewish 
residents, Nisei families and Hong Kong developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Davis, president of the city's historical society, admits she was 
skeptical when Fong first proposed his project. Davis said she thought the city 
had already received enough scrutiny from researchers who had inspected aspects 
of city life like a strange new bug under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fong's hard work and objective attitude won her over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people who are writing about this city are coming at it from a 
specific point of view and zero in on specific areas, but I thought Tim gave 
equal time to various perspectives; it was an honest evaluation," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Fong's interviews helped preserve the city's controversial 
recent history for posterity. "Sometimes we live through these things and they 
aren't documented, but in the days ahead we'll look back on this as being very 
informative as well as historic." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple University Press, known for its scholarly publications on African 
American studies and urban studies, published Fong's book as part of its Asian 
American History and Culture series and has just released the book in 
paperback. The hardcover edition of 1,000 copies is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phenomenon of Asian immigration and how it affects West Coast cities is 
an instructive story, and Tim did a very good job telling it in an interesting 
way and getting different points of view," said Janet Francendese, executive 
editor of Temple University Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong is moving to Southern California this fall to become an assistant 
professor of Asian American studies at Cal State Northridge. Asked whether he 
planned to relocate in his old San Gabriel Valley haunt, Fong admitted that he 
is seeing a place closer to his new school. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I want to keep involved with what's happening," he said.

POMONA PLAGUED BY VENDOR HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Street vendors have been the victims of a string of recent robberies 
throughout the city of Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Since April, 25 vendor robberies have been reported and police suspect many 
more crimes have gone unreported, perhaps because the mostly Latino vendors 
fear the police or because they are in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight people have been arrested for individual vendor robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona Police Detective John Falls said the hardest part of investigating the 
robberies is tracking down the vendors afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say vendors are easy targets because they work alone and don't have 
cars to jump into for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The vendors, who roam residential streets and parks from about noon until 8 
p.m., are usually dropped off in Pomona from other cities by their company's 
owners, said police Lt. Greg Hamill. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors have been threatened with guns, knives and physical force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have distributed flyers to all of the owners of the vending companies, 
warning them that their employees might be in danger. They have also set up 
surveillance.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamill said that the robbers approach the vendors in groups of two or three, 
pretending to be customers. Vendors are usually robbed in the afternoon, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a vendor was hit with a brick and killed during a robbery on San 
Francisco Street. LISA O'NEILL

FAMILIES; NORDSTROM RESTROOM SERVES 'NEW SHOPPER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Nordstrom in Santa Anita Fashion Park has brought family values to 
that most intimate domain: the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Catering to the mom or dad with tots in tow, the store, which opened last 
Friday, offers not just men's and women's rooms, but also a new "family 
bathroom," a large, private restroom with toilet, changing table, diaper 
dispenser and a lowered, child-height sink. The Arcadia store is the third 
Nordstrom to have one; stores in Maryland and Oregon already do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the idea came from was a recognition of the new shopper," said 
Nordstrom spokeswoman Caroline Brown. "It could be a parent shopping with a 
child of the opposite sex, who's too old to go in the opposite-sex restroom, 
too young to go in the (same-sex) restroom alone." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also fully accessible to the disabled, said Steve Dwoskin, the architect 
who designed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more comfortable and convenient, if that person has difficulty using 
regular toilet facilities, they can go with their attendant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it will ease the hassle for parents juggling diapers and strollers with 
shopping bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are more families shopping together," he said. "Years ago, you 
didn't see diaper-changing tables; parents just had to make do. Now you see 
more changing tables, and the family toilet room is the next step in 
convenience. . . . I think that when you're shopping with children, it's a 
necessity, and it's something that customers have asked for." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nordstrom shoppers exploring the store on opening day weren't quite sure 
what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is a family bathroom? What is it?" demanded one confused mother of two 
young boys as she searched for the restrooms. Then, warily, she added: "I don't 
know, I'd have to see. That might be kind of cute." One man, shopping alone, 
didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the men's room?" he asked. "Well, it says 'family bathroom' right 
here; I guess that's close enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Lily Cooper shied away from the unfamiliar facility, wheeling her 3 
1/2-year-old son toward the women's restroom instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt awkward because it was a family bathroom," she said. "I was just going 
to use the ladies' room." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she relented and decided to give it a try. Five minutes later she emerged 
with high praise, her son straggling behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the changing thing" and the diaper dispenser, she raved. "He's still 
having a blast with the sink; he loves it, because he was able to wash his 
hands by himself."

BUSINESS; DWINDLING LAKE TOURISM PROMPTS STORE CLOSURE 
</P>

 Crystal Lake's rustic general store is going out of business after Labor Day 
weekend because visitors to the Angeles National Forest recreation area have 
slowed to a trickle, said Armand Denis, the store's co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1993, budget cuts forced U.S. Forest Service officials to close 
Crystal Lake's campground and limit the 800-acre recreation grounds to weekend 
use.Crystal Lake Recreation Area, 26 miles north of Azusa, once drew crowds of 
more than 2,000 people on busy days to its 11 trails, rock-work amphitheater 
and natural lake stocked with rainbow trout. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the cutbacks, Denis and his brother barely broke even on the store, 
which sells firewood, hamburgers, holders for marshmallow roasting and other 
items. Since then, the store has been in the red. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't keep taking money from my pocket, trying to keep the store 
alive," said Denis, 67, who lives in a cabin behind the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Denis and his twin brother, David, who bought the store in 1983, have invested 
more than $300,000 in the business, he said. The two will try to sell the 
store, which was built in 1934, but Denis said he is not optimistic that anyone 
will want to buy a money-losing venture. 
</P>
<P>
 When the campground was open, campers used to rush into Denis' store for 
last-minute marshmallows and then sometimes invite him to dinner. Over the 
years, he has kept in touch with regular campers and has watched young visitors 
from 10 years ago return to the store with their own children. 
</P>
<P>
 Denis does not know what he will do now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get calls from people all the time, wanting to come out and camp," he said. 
"I just think it's a complete travesty."

COMMUNITY SESSION TO ADDRESS GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gang and youth violence among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the 
West San Gabriel Valley will be discussed this evening at a community meeting 
at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people from Alhambra, Rosemead, Monterey Park and surrounding 
areas are expected to attend the free session, from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. at the 
Roybal Institute Conference Room on campus. Issues include the impact of the 
"three-strikes" legislation that requires life imprisonment for repeat 
offenders and the effect of Proposition 187, which would deny public services 
and education to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum is the third in a series of four held by the Gang Violence Bridging 
Project. Previous meetings in East Los Angeles and South-Central Los Angeles 
concentrated on Latino and African American youths. A final conference Nov. 19 
at Cal State L.A. will unite all the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The free event is open to the public. Information: (213) 343-3770.

COVER STORY; PLAYING HER OWN TUNE; SALLY HOLGUIN-FALLON, A FORMER PIANO TEACHER 
AND THE FIRST WOMAN ON LA PUENTE'S CITY COUNCIL, HAS STRUCK A NOTE OF DISCORD 
WITH HER EXASPERATED MALE COLLEAGUES. 
</P>

<P>
 A recent La Puente City Council meeting ran in dignified fashion -- if you 
compare it with a food fight fueled by eighth- graders armed with mashed 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the council discussed such issues as extending elected officials' terms and 
regulating home businesses, novice Councilwoman Sally Holguin-Fallon 
continually interrupted. "But Mr. Mayor," she would say, often speaking out of 
turn and ignoring the rules of procedure. Soon, councilmen were rolling their 
eyes or cutting her off before she could go further. 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue was whether to move to a new item, Fallon asked to stay on the 
same item; when it was a proposal to take a break, Fallon wasn't ready for one. 
In the midst of a discussion over raising the cost of residential building 
permits, Fallon opposed any raise, as usual finding herself a one-woman 
minority. Mayor Joe V. Alderete exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every item that comes up here, Mrs. Fallon, you knock down," Alderete 
snapped. "You know, I'm up to here (holding his hand over his head) with 
knocking things down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon tried to interrupt -- again -- but the mayor would have none of it, 
finally concluding, "We have to pay whether we like it or not; and if we don't 
like it, move out." 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked members of the audience murmured as Fallon, clad in the trademark hat 
she says she wears for courage, called out "Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor." Alderete 
ignored her and directed the council to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The onstage bickering continued, eventually infecting the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alderete let Joyce Lingor, president of the senior citizens club, make an 
impromptu speech thanking him for reopening the club's center, resident Robert 
Mandering shouted Lingor off the floor, pointing out that her comments were as 
out of order as anything Fallon had said. Lingor grabbed her sweater and papers 
and stormed out, pausing just long enough to smack Mandering on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was actually pretty calm," Fallon said after the five-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Holguin-Fallon, a former piano teacher who unseated incumbent Manuel 
Garcia in April, made history when she became La Puente's first female council 
member. Meetings have not been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon fought her way onto the council with dreams of changing city government 
into a more feeling, innovative body that would bring people together, beautify 
the city and start a community theater. Instead, the councilmen isolate her, 
often ignore her and routinely kill off her proposals, saying that's not what 
city government is for. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon contributes to the rift by following her own style of city politics. 
Unschooled in the culture of council deliberations, she enthusiastically and 
naively plops her ideas onto the council agendas without setting up the support 
of her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never put something on the agenda if I knew I couldn't get it across," 
said Councilman Louis R. Perez, who has been on the council for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have frustrated and angered a council with its own way of doing 
things. Meetings that once marched along swiftly, smoothly, and dispensed with 
routine city business seemingly without dissent now last past midnight. Fallon 
may not get her ideas off the ground, but she is getting a community stage of 
her own to get them heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon says her council colleagues suffer from a case of male chauvinism. They 
argue that Fallon has a big mouth, with neither the experience nor knowledge to 
back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got to understand that we all have to get together in the way we act 
and vote. She's got her own little agenda," Alderete said. "It'll be a matter 
of time, and then she'll be a good girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a noticeable difference in agendas here. The councilmen talk about 
raising fees to balance the budget of the 38-year-old city. Fallon talks about 
having the city help residents swap services with each other, developing a 
community theater group and planting flowers at the entrances to the city, 
hoping it might lure business to the working-class town in which nearly 
three-fourths of the residents are Latino. All of her ideas have sunk so far. 
</P>
<P>
 At one council meeting, 18 proposals from Fallon were tabled indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just doesn't understand the correct way of doing things," said Charles H. 
Storing, who has served 29 years on the council. "I can't recall any new 
council member who was as aggressive and challenging as she is." 
</P>
<P>
 Storing, whose thin frame shakes with frustration when discussing Fallon, sees 
those traits as obtrusive and embarrassing, but Fallon sees them as weapons 
with which to fight the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want my kids growing up believing they couldn't be effective in our 
world," Fallon said of her role on the council. "They said, 'You can't fight 
City Hall, you're only one person.' I wanted to show them one person could do a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly the problem, said Alderete, who has been a council member since 
1988 and mayor since April. "She's trying to do too much," he said. "She starts 
shoving and pushing. She's got to understand: You can't change City Hall in one 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the city's residents say Fallon gets in trouble not because she is 
trying to do too much, but because she is trying to do anything at all.

<P>
 Businesswoman Shirley Hanson says she is no fan of Fallon's and disagrees with 
the councilwoman on many issues, but she thinks the councilmen clearly refuse 
to consider any change -- especially from a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They've lost one of their men," Hanson said. "And they do not like the idea 
of a woman who has power equal to theirs."  
</P>
<P>
 Hanson lives in unincorporated West Valinda but has owned a clothing store in 
La Puente for 27 years and regularly attends council meetings. She scowls as 
she describes the councilmen's behavior as "crass, abrupt, condescending, 
haughty and arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
 Storing disputes that description, saying he has never heard any councilman 
speak rudely to or about Fallon. Yet, after one of the numerous times that 
Fallon interrupted the mayor at a recent meeting, Storing leaned in to his 
microphone and referred to her behavior as "a disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Alderete freely admits that Fallon upsets him and that he sometimes shows it 
publicly. Before Fallon was elected, Alderete said, council meetings closed at 
about 10 p.m. "Now we never get out of there before midnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon keeps offering up her ideas, and her irritated colleagues generally 
table the proposals without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 On the rare occasions when her motions are seconded, they die on a predictable 
4-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente resident Penny Aguilar said Edward L. Chavez, a councilman since 
1990, told her he would never vote with Fallon, regardless of the issue, 
because he did not like her. Chavez would not comment on the accusation at 
first, then later said, "I have no idea that I would say anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Fallon proposals that vanished was a plan to create an education 
commission of parents and students to serve as a conduit between the board of 
education and the council on issues of concern to La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't discuss these ideas because I'm proposing them. I'm the new kid on 
the block and I'm a woman, so they don't want to listen to what I have to say," 
Fallon said. "I'm probably moving too fast, but I don't think we have time to 
move slow." 
</P>
<P>
 The council does not table her items because she is a new member or a woman, 
Storing said angrily during an interview, but because they are "nonsensical." 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of things she proposes are not even within the jurisdiction of 
local government," he said. "When she makes these proposals, there's no form or 
substance to them, no backup information." 
</P>
<P>
 Storing called the idea for an education commission an irrelevant issue. "We 
have absolutely nothing to do with education. That's not within our realm," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Perez and Alderete say Fallon needs to be more of a team player in the 
way she votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But La Puente resident George Henley said he wonders if being a team player 
means that a council member should not question the majority or stand alone on 
an issue. Like Hanson, Henley says he is not necessarily a Fallon supporter, 
but nonetheless appreciates her effort to challenge what he considers a 
monolith of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the arguing during council meetings takes place between 
Alderete, who holds the gavel, and Fallon, who is usually out of order, there 
is a subtle chumminess between the two. For almost 10 years in the 1970s, he 
was a maintenance worker and she was a piano teacher for the Hacienda-La Puente 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In private and between complaints, both Alderete and Fallon slip in a nice 
word about each other. "He's a sweet man," she once said. He called her "a 
wonderful lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, kind words are unusual. In fact, Fallon said she was afraid of physical 
violence from her colleagues at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 She acted on that fear in anticipation of a June 28 closed session in which 
she wanted to discuss her opposition to an ordinance directing City Clerk Linda 
Groves to answer to City Manager Robert Gutierrez, rather than to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 At an earlier meeting, Perez had said the closed session, which only council 
members and the city attorney attend, would be "no holds barred." Fallon said 
the statement made her nervous, prompting a call to police requesting that an 
officer accompany her -- a request that was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what he meant by that, and you can't take any chances these 
days," Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon clearly feels uncomfortable around the other council members. She wears 
a wide-rimmed black or white bonnet to every meeting because she said it 
"puffs" her up and makes her feel brave. Her naturally shaky voice trembles 
even more when she talks about being seen as a troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon, who has lived in La Puente since she was 18 months old, said she was 
very shy as a youngster. "I was home-schooled until high school because I had 
very bad asthma," she said. "I didn't have any friends and I didn't learn to 
have an opinion until I was 22 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon, 48, met her husband Robert, a postal worker, the day she graduated 
from community college. They have three sons, ages 23, 15 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The time spent alone in the house as a child had at least one advantage, she 
said. It gave her the opportunity to learn and fall in love with the piano. She 
went on to be a piano accompanist for both of her alma maters, the Hacienda-La 
Puente Unified School District and Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Fallon gained her self-confidence, there was no turning back. She ran for 
a spot on the school board in 1989 and on the council in 1990 and 1992 but lost 
all three races. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother said, 'Sally, you're beginning to look like a joke,' " she 
recalled. That didn't deter Fallon, who tried again and won, unseating Garcia 
with 711 votes to his 609. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign became controversial when the Highlander Newspaper reported that 
she had an associates degree from Mt. SAC. David Garcia, the son of Fallon's 
opponent, Manuel Garcia, said he called the school to confirm her degree and 
could not find any record of her graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Fallon did graduate from Mt. SAC in June, 1968, college officials 
told The Times. She was not, however, issued a degree because she did not 
maintain the school's minimum standard of a C grade point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon said she did not remember if she got her degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I graduated, because it was the day I met Robert," she said of her 
husband. "I was going to transfer my credits and continue going to school, but 
I got involved with other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, "other things" include her role as a councilwoman and her desire to 
spruce up La Puente by planting flowers by the roads leading into the city "so 
people think it's a place worth investing in." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe some of her ideas sound a little crazy," resident George Henley said. 
"But I'd rather see five Sally Fallons up there. At least she's trying."

 The Dolphins survive the choppy East, the Steelers throw a steel curtain over 
the Central, then from out West, the Raiders run away from them both to their 
first Super Bowl since 1984. WESTERN DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Raiders 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 10-6, lost to Buffalo in conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 12-4, defeat Miami in conference semifinals, defeat Pittsburgh in 
conference championship game, lose to San Francisco in Super Bowl 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Scowls, swaggers, memories of Ben Davidson, Lester Hayes and 
eye black. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: At the only Raider exhibition game in Southern California, 
against the Rams at Anaheim Stadium, Raider fans were involved in eight brawls 
requiring security intervention. But rest easy, you who come to the Coliseum to 
cheer for the other guy. Having run out of worthy opponents, Raider fans mostly 
fight each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: Before blaming the running backs for all the Raider rushing 
problems, note that they averaged 4.4 yards a carry last season running behind 
Steve Wisniewski and Gerald Perry on the left side of the line. Running 
everywhere else, they averaged 2.9 yards. Seattle Seahawks 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 10-6, lose to Miami in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Blessed with the sixth-easiest schedule in the league and one 
of the toughest young backfield combinations, they will finally make Chuck Knox 
feel nostalgic. Quarterback Rick Mirer does nothing particularly pretty except 
win. Running back Chris Warren is only spectacular when you see him steaming 
into the end zone or flying to Hawaii. You did know he made the Pro Bowl last 
year after gaining 1,072 yards? The offensive line was upgraded with free agent 
Howard Ballard from Buffalo; the defense improved the minute the Seahawks 
drafted surly Sam Adams to play next to Cortez Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: The Seahawks have already lost five players for the season 
because of injuries that have left them searching for defensive backs to assist 
Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson. Not a good thing to be missing in this 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: After losing two former Buffalo cornerbacks for the season 
because of torn knee ligaments -- Pro Bowler Nate Odomes and Kirby Jackson -- 
the Seahawks traded for New England's Darryl Wren. But he flunked the physical. 
Reason? A "laxity" in a knee ligament. Wren, as you may have guessed, is a 
former Bill. San Diego Chargers 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 9-7, lose to Buffalo in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: With Marion Butts gone, Natrone Means will lead the conference 
in rushing. With bad-apple Anthony Miller out of the locker room, young Charger 
receivers such as Shawn Jefferson will have room to grow. With an offensive 
line that suddenly looks capable of blocking somebody, quarterback Stan 
Humphries could be looking at 3,000-plus yards again. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: Despite the addition of cornerback Dwayne Harper from Seattle, 
we worry about a pass defense that was the league's worst last year. Safety 
Stanley Richard needs to play as advertised. Cornerback Darrien Gordon needs to 
grow up in a hurry. Just because Donald Frank is gone doesn't mean the 
nightmare is over. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: The Chargers' .594 winning record (19-13) since 1992 is their 
best in a two-year period since Dan Fouts' glory days, when they went 16-9 in 
1981-82. Denver Broncos 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 9-7, lost to Raiders in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: We know, we know, they have the best offense since the Lakers. 
With John Elway throwing to the likes of Anthony Miller (from San Diego), Mike 
Pritchard (from the Atlanta Falcons) and Shannon Sharpe, Denver fans may 
finally have reason to act like the wackos they have long resembled. In other 
words, throw in Leonard Russell and this is an offense truly worth watching in 
a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: The defense that ranked 27th against the pass last season added 
two cornerbacks known for their ... tackling? Ray Crockett from Detroit and Ben 
Smith from Philadelphia are tough guys, but can they cover? Nobody else can. 
Come to think of it, only one person on that defense can both rush the passer 
and stuff the run. Linebacker Simon Fletcher, the best active defensive player 
never to make the Pro Bowl, must feel like the professor on Gilligan's Island. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: The Broncos once drafted Hall of Fame defenders Dick Butkus and 
Merlin Olsen. But they couldn't sign either one. Kansas City Chiefs 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 11-5, lost to Buffalo in conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Receiver Lake Dawson, yet another rookie from Notre Dame who 
is more than ready for the NFL, is just the antidote to inconsistent Willie 
Davis and J.J. Birden. Marcus Allen can still catch that five-yard pass and 
find the end zone, while Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith can still find those 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: Guess how many games Joe Montana played last year? 13? 14? Try 
11. That number figures to drop again this season, particularly since he won't 
be tempted to force his injured body back into the lineup after injuries 
because trusted friend Steve Bono will be taking over. Now, guess how many 
members of that all-star defense departed because of free agency and the salary 
cap? Try four -- Albert Lewis, Kevin Ross, Lonnie Marts and Martin Bayless. An 
aging, inconsistent offense coupled with a reworked defense does not sound like 
the makings of a division championship encore to us. CENTRAL DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Steelers 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 9-7, lost to Kansas City Chiefs in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 12-4, defeat Buffalo in conference semifinals, lose to Raiders in 
conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: They have arguably the AFC's strongest running back in Barry 
Foster, and meanest linebacker in Greg Lloyd, and best cover guy in cornerback 
Rod Woodson. Their quarterback, Neil O'Donnell, has a chance to be a star with 
good wide receivers. He might finally have not one but two, in rising star 
Andre Hastings and flashy rookie Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: The potential for off-field commotion here is as large as Coach 
Bill Cowher's jaw. Foster could quit at any minute and who knows what 
linebacker Kevin Greene might do? Already this summer, one of their best 
players, guard Carlton Haselrig, just disappeared. At any moment over the next 
five months, this tenuous team's championship hopes could do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: In O'Donnell's first three seasons as a regular, he passed for 
nearly 2,000 more yards and seven more touchdowns than Terry Bradshaw in his 
first three seasons with the Steelers. Houston Oilers 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 12-4, lost to Kansas City in conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Well, David Williams and his wife Debi are not expected to 
have another baby this year. And well, Kevin Gilbride has only one shot at 
Buddy Ryan, on Dec. 4 in Arizona, but they will be on opposite sidelines. OK, 
if you insist, we like Gary Brown to gain 1,200 yards and Marcus Robertson and 
Cris Dishman to combine for 15 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: With Cody Carlson under center, they suddenly look like 
something out of the Southwest Conference. (Texas Tech, maybe?) And you can't 
lose Sean Jones, William Fuller, Wilber Marshall and Buddy Ryan and still have 
he league's top-ranked defense against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: Brown broke 99 tackles in 195 attempts last season for a 
league-best .508 mark. Yes, there are people who actually keep track of this 
stuff. Cleveland Browns 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Somebody told us that during training camp, Coach Bill 
Belichick was smiling and even joking. We didn't believe it, but it makes for 
good copy. That same somebody told us that the Brown secondary, only average 
last season, now has former San Francisco 49er Don Griffin and top rookie 
Antonio Langham to complement Eric Turner. Then somebody even said that running 
back Eric Metcalf was going to get 250 carries. This is when we walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: How long before the controversy begins swirling around starting 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde and backup Mark Rypien? How long before fans start 
missing linebackers Michael Johnson and Clay Matthews? How long before those 
same fans realize that even though linebackers Pepper Johnson and Carl Banks 
played for Belichick with the New York Giants, that was ages ago? 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: Under Belichick, the Browns have the following records in 
December: 1-3, 1-3 and 2-3. Cincinnati Bengals 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 3-13. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: With the addition of hotdog safety Louis Oliver, the Bengals 
led the league in end zone dances during the exhibition season. Among those 
performing was Derrick Fenner, who should be running well enough to force the 
benching of mutinous Harold Green for good. Just wait until Dan (Big Daddy) 
Wilkinson, the top overall pick in the draft, pulls down a few quarterbacks. 
Then we'll see some hoofing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: Coach Dave Shula must get tougher. A practice-field fight would 
be nice. His incredible football smarts are worthless if nobody deems it 
important enough to listen. Quarterback David Klingler must get better, 
although it would help if he wasn't sacked a league-leading 53 times. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: The Bengals scored a touchdown only nine of 45 times they were 
inside the 10-yard line last season. In the same area, the 49ers scored 30 
times. EASTERN DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Dolphins 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 10-6, defeat Seattle in wild-card playoff, lose to Raiders in 
conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Just about everything but Dan Marino. The running game is 
stronger than ever with the emergence of Terry Kirby, who catches passes as 
well as any back in the league. With Irving Fryar used to the offense, and O.J. 
McDuffie used to playing in the NFL, the receivers are also splendid. Bryan 
Cox, big mouth and all, has returned to terrorize opposing players and fans 
alike. Cornerback Troy Vincent is sound again, and the additions of free-agent 
safeties Gene Atkins and Michael Stewart ensure that the team will not have to 
live through another five-game losing streak like the one that ended last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: He's tough, he's smart, he's desparate for a Super Bowl. But 
when it comes to quarterback Marino's comeback from the Achilles' tendon injury 
he suffered in the fifth game last season, he's not convincing. He admits he 
can't step up or out of the pocket as quickly as before. He admits that for the 
first time in his career, he is playing with some uncertainty. Throwing only 
two more completions (four) than interceptions (two) in one's final exhibition 
game is not very convincing evidence that one is ready for Sunday's opener. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: This marks the 21st anniversary of the Dolphins, and Don 
Shula's, last Super Bowl championship season. Buffalo Bills 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 12-4, lost to Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 9-7, defeat San Diego in wild-card playoff, lose to Pittsburgh in 
conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Same old, same old. For the next three months we'll watch 
countless highlights of Jim Kelly handing to Thurman Thomas; Kelly passing to 
Andre Reed; and Bruce Smith knocking the stuffing out of somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: While most of the NFL's players have been trashing the salary 
cap, they should be thankful that it could keep the Bills from returning to the 
Super Bowl for a fifth consecutive January. Salary restrictions cost them their 
best offensive lineman (Howard Ballard) and two of their best defensive backs 
(Nate Odomes and James Williams). Both areas have become weaknesses, 
particularly the offensive line, threatening Kelly's streak of 32 consecutive 
regular-season starts, second-longest among active quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: The Bills have not drafted an offensive skill player in the 
first round in eight years. Indianapolis Colts 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Running back Marshall Faulk has been everything everyone 
expected. The first-round draft choice, who is already starting to resemble a 
younger Thurman Thomas, could score as many rushing touchdowns in the first two 
weeks as the Colts scored all last season--four. New quarterback Jim Harbaugh 
has been equally as impressive, if only because of his apparent inability to 
whine. Linebacker Trev Alberts, another first-round pick, is sidelined for the 
season because of an elbow injury. But new linebacker Tony Bennett has added 
old-fashioned hitting to a defense led by linebackers Quentin Coryett and Jeff 
Herrod. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: Sean Dawkins, former Cal great, needs to start behaving more 
like a wide receiver. Coach Ted Marchibroda, current great human being, needs 
to start behaving more like a jerk. Players don't respect Dawkins for dropping 
footballs, or Marchibroda for not chewing him out. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: The last time the Colt won as many as 10 games, Faulk was 4. New 
England Patriots 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: Boston fans will not soon forget the sight of Drew Bledsoe 
throwing for four touchdown passes against the Dolphins in last year's season 
finale. Now, if only young Bledsoe could ignore the rantings of Coach Bill 
Parcells long enough to remember the same image. Parcells has made it easier 
for Bledsoe this year, signing tough guard Bob Kratch and trading for bruising 
running back Marion Butts. The defense is better with first-round pick Willie 
McGinest of USC teaming with last year's rookie star Chris Slade, and Parcells 
disciple Myron Guyton added in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: Butts was hurt during training camp, forcing the acquisiton of 
Leroy Thompson. Neither seems capable of matching Leonard Russell's 300 carries 
and 1,088 yards of last season, numbers he took with him to the Denver Broncos 
after a salary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: Last season, the young Patriots committed a league-low 64 
penalties, 32 fewer than the league average and 47 fewer than in the previous 
season. Who says Parcells still can't inspire fear? New York Jets 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Year: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Looking Good: The league's eighth-ranked defense should get even better if 
former first-round selection Marvin Jones returns from a hip injury. Defensive 
end Jeff Lageman is one of the league's unknown stars. Running back Johnny 
Johnson is coming off the best year nobody saw, with 1,462 total yards despite 
making only nine starts. And if nothing else, refreshing new Coach Pete Carroll 
is a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Look: Is it just us, or does it seem like Boomer Esiason and Art Monk 
and Ronnie Lott have been around for 20 years? And are starting to play like 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 * It Figures: An offensive line that gave up a league-low 21 sacks last season 
had better not yawn. Esiason's quarterback rating before his first sack in a 
1993 game was 93.1 ... and 69.8 afterward.

 It's been five years since Bolsa Grande won more than three games in a season 
and eight years and four coaches since the Matadors won a Garden Grove League 
title. Graves replaces Gary Stephens, who compiled a 4-16 record in two 
seasons. With only five starters returning from last year's team, Bolsa 
Grande's luck doesn't figure to change much. Two-way senior starters Sung, 
Price, Shaner and Jun should give Bolsa Grande some leadership and stability, 
but it probably won't be enough to challenge for a playoff spot. Once again, 
depth will be a problem for the Matadors, who return 15 lettermen. However, 
most of the starters probably will have to play on both sides of the line of 
scrimmage. Bolsa Grande's biggest loss is Brian Baughman, who threw 20 
touchdown passes and netted 2,266 yards, the most of any quarterback in the 
county last year. Price will be given the task of replacing Baughman. Also gone 
is Baughman's favorite wide receiver, Love Jefferson, who caught 36 passes for 
571 yards and eight touchdowns.

 Steve Bolton, now Takahashi's assistant, set the foundation with a 
second-place finish last season. Now it's Takahashi's job to finish what Bolton 
started. The ingredients are there for another run at the league title as most 
key players are back. The biggest key figures to be Tuato (1,250 yards, 52.4%, 
nine touchdowns), an all-league player who figures to improve on last year's 
solid season. Tuato will have an experienced line protecting him and a burner 
in Fausto running through holes, but he will be throwing to a new group of 
receivers. The Lobos' defense should be strong, especially in the secondary, 
where three of four starters return. SCHEDULE

 The Vaqueros made a great playoff run after finishing third in league and they 
should be back for more. Frank (1,956 yards, 21 TDs) figures to be one of the 
county's top quarterbacks. Allen might be the area's most electrifying player. 
But Young, a transfer from Edison, will get most of the carries and Allen could 
play more flanker than tailback. "Young's a quick learner and an exceptional 
athlete," Case said. "He fits right into my type of scheme." The Vaqueros' 
weaknesses are the offensive line and overall depth. SCHEDULE

 After winning only one of its first four games, Rancho Alamitos rebounded to 
reach its second consecutive Southern Section Division VII title game. The 
Vaqueros finished third in league, losing to Los Amigos and league champion 
Kennedy. But led by the running of Kevin Allen and the passing of John Frank, 
the Vaqueros defeated Troy, Baldwin Park Sierra Vista and Arroyo Grande before 
losing to Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, 29-17, in the final. Allen, who had run 
for 640 yards in his first three playoff games, was held to minus-10 yards in 
11 carries against Mira Costa. Frank set a school record for touchdown passes 
in one season (21) and is already second on the school's career yardage list 
with 1,957 after his sophomore season. Frank threw five of his six playoff 
touchdown passes to junior Jeff Turbarg, who was hurt much of the season and 
had only 10 receptions. Frank was given time to throw thanks to a massive 
offensive line that averaged more than 250 pounds. Tackle Jeremiah Ross, who 
went to Fresno State on a scholarship, anchored the line. Kennedy swept through 
the league season undefeated, won its first two playoff games by a combined 
score of 56-7, and reached the semifinals before losing to Mira Costa, 23-19. 
Quarterback Chris Clark (1,239 yards, nine touchdowns), running back Charlie 
Marino (882 yards, 15 touchdowns) and wide receiver/kick returner Wesley Morris 
led the Fighting Irish attack. Los Amigos, led by first-year Coach Steve 
Bolton, linebacker/fullback Junior Leofa and quarterback Ape Tuato, finished 
second in league and lost to Arroyo Grande, 21-13, in the first round of the 
playoffs. In one of the season's best games, Los Amigos defeated Rancho 
Alamitos, 14-12, on a late pass from Tuato to a stumbling Noah Tagatauli, who 
regained his balance and ran 56 yards for a touchdown. Pacifica, led by 
quarterback Jeff DePippo (602 yards rushing, 12 touchdowns) and tailback Damien 
Cook (794 yards, eight touchdowns) finished 4-3 in league. Bolsa Grande won 
only three games but had the county's passing yardage leader in Brian Baughman 
(2,266).

<P>
 Haley could have one of the more difficult coaching jobs in the county, 
rebuilding a winless team that returns only three starters. But Haley helped 
turn around a dreadful Orange program a few years back. In 18 years of 
coaching, he has never had a losing season. In Cortez, Haley has one of the 
league's better athletes. Cortez will move from quarterback to fullback. "I'm 
afraid his productivity would go down if we had him at safety and quarterback," 
Haley said. "If I put Christian at fullback, I know he's going to scratch and 
claw for at least three or four yards. He knows where the hole is going to be. 
And we won't lose much with Octavio, who's more of a pure passer than 
Christian." Haley is also excited about Callari, who didn't play last year. 
"He's a man's man." SCHEDULE

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens takes over a team from former coach Jeff Buenafe that started five 
sophomores. The Argonauts should be strong at the skill positions as the entire 
starting backfield returns. But they might be weak on the offensive line, where 
Dear and Frei are the only starters more than 200 pounds. The playoffs are not 
out of the question for the Argonauts, who haven't reached postseason play 
since 1991. SCHEDULE

</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs could be the league's most improved team if their young offensive 
line can give their quarterbacks (Gondringer and Livernois) some time to find a 
quality group of receivers. Bautista and Nguyen (17 receptions) had great 
summers in the passing league and should make defensive backs nervous with 
their speed. Gondringer (1,142 yards, 5 TDs), a drop-back passer, and 
Livernois, a roll-out, play-action type, will alternate for the third 
consecutive season. Delgado, the only returning offensive lineman, could start 
alongside four sophomores. The defense is also young, but the strengths are at 
middle linebacker with Tiger, a second-team all-league performer, and in the 
secondary, which features Livernois at free safety. SCHEDULE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY TO OFFER STORE SALES TAX INCENTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to offer an Orange County auto parts company a 
partial refund of sales tax collections as an incentive to open an outlet store 
and service center in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will refund half of the annual sales tax revenues above $50,000 
that it receives from Fountain Valley-based Auto Expo for the next 15 years if 
the company agrees to build a store at the southeast corner of Redondo Avenue 
and Willow Street, said Susan F. Shick, the city's director of community 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Expo projects $20 million in sales a year for its first five years in 
operation, according to documents from the Department of Community Development. 
If that estimate proves accurate, the city would receive $200,000 a year and 
refund $75,000 to Auto Expo.  
</P>
<P>
 The city estimates that the 50,000-square-foot store will create about 35 
jobs. The company operates stores in Fountain Valley and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax refunds are part of an overall strategy to compete with other cities for 
large retailers, Shick said. HomeBase and Food 4 Less opened Long Beach stores 
in the last year after receiving similar inducements. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; POLICE MAY USE NAVY HOSPITAL FOR TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers with guns and dogs could soon be roaming the halls of the 
defunct Naval Hospital on Carson Street near the San Gabriel River Freeway, 
using the empty building for training exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed Tuesday to support the Police Department's plan to use 
the main hospital building and grounds for training SWAT and K-9 teams and new 
recruits.The council directed staff to forge an agreement with the U.S. Navy 
that will give police a six-month license to use the hospital. There would be 
no cost to police, Chief William C. Ellis said in his report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Naval Hospital closed this year, a victim of cuts in defense spending. 
City officials are hoping to create a discount mall on the hospital site, but 
neighboring cities have raised opposition to the plan, stalling the city's 
efforts and leaving the hospital site unused. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; COUNCIL MAY CUT SOME ADVISORY COMMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN COX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A City Council committee is considering a proposal that would save money by 
consolidating or eliminating some of the city's 37 advisory commissions.  
</P>
<P>
 The commissions consumed $3.1 million last year, mostly in staff costs, and 
some council members believe that it's time to cut them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council tended to christen a commission and send it on its way and 
then forget about it," said Councilman Jeffrey Kellogg, who is chairman of the 
committee that is drawing up a list of possible consolidations.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jenny Oropeza, a member of the committee, said she agrees that 
some commissions could be consolidated, but she warned that the elimination of 
too many could jeopardize the level of public involvement in city government. 
More than 300 people serve on the city commissions, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissions range from the three-member Board of Plumber Examiners, which 
tests beginning plumbers and issues journeyman certificates, to the 
seven-member Board of Health and Human Services, which delves into public 
health matters and social services. Some commissioners receive no pay for 
attending meetings, others are paid up to $100 per meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the boards, including the powerful Harbor and Planning commissions, 
were created by city charter and may not be eliminated. The other 31 were 
created by the council, however, and could be done away with or consolidated.

'91 SCHOOLS AUDIT CITED SHODDY BOOKKEEPING; FINANCES: A REPORT THREE YEARS AGO 
WARNED OF POSSIBLE ABUSE IN THE EL RANCHO UNIFIED DISTRICT, WHERE FUNDS ARE 
MISSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years before the Los Angeles district attorney's office began 
investigating the disappearance of student activity funds at a Pico Rivera high 
school, auditors warned that student money was being managed poorly and 
conditions were ripe for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors said they found chronic shortages of funds, shoddy bookkeeping 
practices and inadequate controls of student funds at El Rancho High School 
during the 1990-91 school year. Officials said the district apparently used 
general school funds to make up deficits of about $75,000 in the student 
activity account.  
</P>
<P>
 Auditors recommended the district transfer some bookkeeping duties to its 
central office, increase supervision over those handling student money and 
develop a plan to repay the student activity deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems apparently persisted. When auditors were called in to look at 
the account again late last year, they reported as much as $100,000 was missing 
and urged El Rancho Unified school officials to contact outside authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors cited new irregularities. They said employees were extremely lax 
about depositing cash, waiting months after money was collected before making a 
deposit. Some records also were missing, including books that showed how much 
cash had been collected from students, according to the auditors' report. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm of Vicenti, Lloyd & Stutzman of La Verne performed both audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, investigators searched the home of school board member Eleanor 
C. Cole, a former bookkeeper at the high school. Cole resigned from her job 
when she won a seat on the school board last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole has refused to comment about the investigation, but her supporters showed 
up in force at a recent school board meeting. Several parents pointed out that 
student activity accounts had been in shambles years before Cole became the 
school's bookkeeper in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Moran, a parent and former instructional aide at the high school, said 
parents would raise money for events or scholarships, only to be told later by 
school officials that the funds were not available. When parents asked to 
examine financial records, high school officials often were unresponsive, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors gave the first official alert that something was amiss in 1991. 
Auditors found a number of problems at the school, including missing paperwork 
as well as lax bookkeeping practices and shoddy handling of student money. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the student groups had no idea how much money they had in the bank 
because faculty advisers did not monitor budgets or exercise control over 
spending, auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, about 20 of the 60 student organizations spent more money during 
the 1990-91 year than they raised. The school's yearbook operation lost $3,000 
that year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 High school officials had also improperly spent at least $52,000 in student 
funds over several years to pay for bus transportation for band and drill-team 
members to athletic events and other performances, the auditors said.  
</P>
<P>
 Former Supt. Fernando R. Elizondo, who headed the district at the time, said 
he advised the school board simply to erase the shortages in the student 
activity accounts and start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo hired Cole to supervise bookkeeping and assigned an outside 
accountant to meet with her and other school officials every week. He 
recommended that a committee of school officials, including Cole, monitor 
student spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo left the El Rancho district soon after that to head a school system 
near Fresno. He said he did not know whether the school board ever followed 
through on his recommendations. All of the school board members have refused to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo's successor, John T. Sherman, said he ordered last year's audit of 
the student activity fund after he found discrepancies in the school's records. 
It was at that time that auditors discovered that as much as $100,000 was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, who was fired in February, said he arranged for the district's 
central office to take over bookkeeping at the high school.

LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE CANCELS NON-CREDIT COMMUNITY CLASSES; EDUCATION: LOW 
ENROLLMENT IN THE 156 COURSES CAUSED A BUDGET SHORTFALL, TRUSTEES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing two years of financial losses, Long Beach City College trustees have 
canceled all non-credit community classes for the upcoming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people have taken these courses over the years, paying fees to 
learn more about gardening, repairing cars and reducing stress, or to brush up 
on such job skills as bookkeeping, computer training and appraising real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But declining enrollment and rising administrative costs created a $263,000 
deficit in the program the past two years, officials said. They estimated the 
program would lose an additional $86,000 if the classes were offered in the new 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless those classes support themselves you just can't offer them," said 
William Millington, college board of trustees president. "I just don't think 
there was the interest in the community. I guess there are just too many things 
for people to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 156 non-credit classes offered last year had an average enrollment of 
about 12 students. At least 25 students are needed per class to break even, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Roemer, an art instructor at the college, criticized the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes were "a way we could interact with the community, and this is a 
forced withdrawal from the community," Roemer said. "The bean counters are 
taking over, and the role of the community colleges is changing. They're going 
back to being junior colleges that concentrate on (preparing students for) 
four-year institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Francus, vice president of planning and governmental relations, said 
the school has not received complaints about the canceled classes. He noted 
that similar classes are available through the city's Parks and Recreation 
Department and at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said, however, that they hope to restore the non-credit classes next 
year after studying how other community colleges administer similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleges, as a rule, cancel community classes that don't have enough 
enrollment to be self-supporting. Administrators at Rio Hondo College in 
Whittier make sure the fees paid for a class are sufficient to cover the 
instructor's salary and other costs, said Timothy M. Wood, interim college 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach City College, however, the decision whether to cancel a 
non-credit class generally is left to instructors. "That's not a good way to do 
it," said Kamiran Badrkhan, vice president for academic affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Community course offerings vary widely at the three other community colleges 
in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Hondo College offers about 100 non-credit courses a year, a spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Community College offers just 10 courses on such topics as managing 
finances, losing weight and stopping smoking, said Associate Dean Ulis 
Williams. "Interest in community service classes has dwindled in the 
lesser-income communities," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos College operates one of the largest community service programs in the 
California Community College system, offering about 500 courses a year in 1,395 
sections. Total enrollment is about 28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The college mails out seven brochures a year listing the various offerings. A

BURIED BUT NOT FORGOTTEN; CANINE HEROES ARE LAID TO REST IN POLICE ACADEMY 
CEMETERY 
</P>

 Tucked away in a quiet, immaculately landscaped corner behind the Long Beach 
Police Academy, guarded by the sprawling branches of an old and gnarled tree, 
the final resting place of some of the department's most beloved heroes can be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that black headstones, polished to gleam like a rookie's shoes on 
his first day at the job, pay tribute to a small legion of officers that 
expected no more than a pat on the head for saving their partners' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the Long Beach Police Department buries its police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think it's kind of silly to have this place," said Officer Robert 
Stuart, whose partner of eight years, a German shepherd named Kon, was buried 
last month in the unnamed graveyard. "But anyone who likes animals, or just 
appreciates life, can see that it's a respectful way of laying them down to 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve police dogs and an academy mascot -- a beagle named Snoopy -- lie at 
the cemetery, south of Carson Street near the vacant Long Beach Naval Hospital. 
The monuments bear names of dogs that are as unique as the stories officers 
swap about them: Justice, Kazan, Pax, Zeus, Bondo, Canto. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Argos, who once dashed through a crowd of 150 people to save an 
officer who was about to lose his gun to an assailant. Another time, after 
Argos nabbed a robbery suspect, the man called the German Shepherd a 
nice-looking dog and asked officers if he was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeus, who died in 1985, once baffled trainers when he captured a man who had 
cut himself while trying to rob a woman at knifepoint. The man left a trail of 
blood droplets that stopped after a few feet, but the animal continued on for a 
block and a half, up an apartment staircase and barked at a door that had blood 
on its handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dogs can (recognize) scents, but they aren't bloodhounds," said Sgt. Mike 
Kinrade, a 15-year veteran of the K-9 unit, who now heads the program. "What 
that dog was tracking, nobody quite knows." 
</P>
<P>
 The police department's K-9 program was established in 1978. When the first 
dog, Kazan, demonstrated an ability to search an area much faster and more 
thoroughly than humans could, the program's popularity quickly spread. Five 
teams were added by 1980, and today the program has 12 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazan died while in retirement at age 14, and was buried in this green grove 
in 1988. But the first dog buried here was Bondo, a 4-year-old German Shepherd 
who died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondo was chasing a man suspected of burglary when the man hit the dog's head 
with a large pipe wrench. The dog was put to sleep after a series of seizures, 
the result of scar tissue that had formed near his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Police-dog burials are handled in different ways by various departments. The 
Los Angeles Police Department buries police dogs on a hill behind its academy. 
Police dogs from several cities in Los Angeles and Orange counties are laid to 
rest at a general pet cemetery in Huntington Beach called Sea Breeze. Some 
cities cremate police dogs after memorial ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the Long Beach graveyard on a recent hot summer morning, 
Kinrade, 50, is dressed casually in sweat pants and a T-shirt. His shirt has a 
picture of a large black Rottweiler and reads, "A true and trusting friend." 
Kinrade's first dog, a Rottweiler named Argo, was killed in a three-story fall 
while chasing a burglary suspect on the roof of the old Newberry's building 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dogs, however, retire at age 10 and spend their remaining years at 
home with their handler. At that age, "they begin to show the effects of police 
work almost overnight," Kinrade said. Currently, eight police dogs are retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the dogs are purchased from Germany and various Scandinavian 
countries at age 2, usually at a cost of about $4,000. They have had some 
obedience training, which gives officers a better foundation to begin the 
rigorous preparation for police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot tougher to find a good dog that's bred here," Kinrade said, adding 
that American breeders tend to in-breed to develop good-looking dogs, but the 
practice can cause health and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs end up with hip, back and even brain problems from all the 
in-breeding. They may look good, but you'll get a psycho dog on your hands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperament is a key concern of trainers. Kinrade said that only one in 100 
dogs -- even of the right breeds -- qualifies for police work. "You can't have 
a dog that's a biting machine or bites out of fear," he said. "Or think about 
the 4th of July, when dogs go nuts. We can't exactly have a dog that's afraid 
of gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the K-9 teams' work is searching for suspects hiding from police 
-- in residential areas, under houses, in buildings or near freeways. Most 
officers can cite numerous instances when their dogs have directly saved their 
lives by alerting them to a suspect who might be armed.  
</P>
<P>
 In July, which Kinrade called a fairly typical month, the teams conducted 52 
searches that resulted in 19 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The K-9 teams serve other functions as well. One dog is specially trained to 
detect drugs. Another can sniff out weapons that have been recently fired.  
</P>
<P>
 To participate in the K-9 program the officers must purchase the dogs 
themselves. The Long Beach K-9 Officers Assn., an independent nonprofit group 
that boasts more than 400 members, helps pay some food and medical costs, 
through donations and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs and their trainers live and work together, which officers say helps 
the animals in social situations, such as community and school demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter and son grew up with Kon," said Stuart, referring to the German 
shepherd that died recently. "That dog was part of the family,"  
</P>
<P>
 Kinrade added: "You spend more time with them than you do with your family." 
However, he said, "you can't really look at this as a pet relationship. You 
have to rely on the dog to protect you, and the dog will lay down his life for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, officers say, is the reason they spend about $500 apiece for 
headstones, which have laser-inlaid photos of the dog and handler. 
</P>
<P>
 "In eight years," Stuart said, "the only reward Kon ever asked for was a pat 
on the head or rub on the stomach. This is just a way of showing our respect 
for what they did for us."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; STORE STAFF UNDETERRED BY STRING OF 5 HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Employees of a neighborhood market that was robbed five times in less than 
three weeks returned to work recently, nervous but determined to keep the store 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of Hanson Market in central Long Beach gave employees a day off last 
week to recover from the stress of seeing the same gun shoved in their faces 
five times. But the following day, they all were back at work at the market, 
which was destroyed in the 1992 riots and recently reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all gotten comfortable working together," store manager Tinh Nguyen 
said of his six-member staff, which includes Asians, African Americans and 
Latinos.  
</P>
<P>
 The market -- a neighborhood fixture since 1966 -- had been held up only once 
in 26 years. Then on April 30, 1992, it was looted and burned during the riots 
that swept parts of Long Beach. The owners finally reopened the store at 2001 
Atlantic Ave. in June. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 6 the robbers hit the store the first time, holding clerks at gunpoint 
while grabbing cash. The second holdup occurred five days later. The robbers 
hit again on Aug. 17, 21 and 23. Sometimes only one man held up the store. 
Other times, a second man or teen-age boy would participate, said police 
detective Richard Birdsall. The same handgun was used in all the holdups, 
Birdsall said. They averaged about $200 per robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 23 police arrested Larry Scott, 29, and a 17-year-old youth as they 
fled the store. Kevin Eddie Moore, 36, was arrested within 24 hours. Police 
said Moore and Scott lived in the same block as the market. The youth's 
identity was not released because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, Moore and the teen-ager are suspected of at least 25 and as many as 40 
robberies, mostly in central Long Beach, in about two months. "These guys were 
more prolific than anyone we've come across in a long time," Birdsall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the market was robbed repeatedly, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 All three suspects have pleaded not guilty to charges of armed robbery. 
Moore's bail was set at $500,000, while Scott is being held in lieu of $290,000 
bail. The 17-year-old is being held at Los Padrinos juvenile facility in 
Downey. EMILY ADAMS

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO; COUNTY REJECTS SCHOOL BUDGET OVER PAY CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County school officials have rejected the Montebello Unified School District's 
budget, which included pay cuts for teachers and non-teaching employees, 
although negotiations are continuing with unions representing those employees. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the district could not include such pay cuts until it 
reaches contract agreements with its two employees unions.The district was 
ordered to come up with about $6.2 million in other cuts to balance the budget 
for the new school year.  
</P>
<P>
 The pay cuts were included in a $91.7-million spending plan that the school 
board approved and submitted to the county. The board voted to cut teachers' 
pay by 5.3% and reduce salaries of non-teaching employees by 2%. Administrators 
have already accepted a 5.3% pay cut to help balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say salary cuts are the only way to reduce spending. The 
district has already trimmed spending in other areas, including custodial 
services, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Montebello Teachers Assn., which represents about 1,300 teachers, has 
vowed to fight any salary cuts, union President Kathy Kohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district must submit a new budget to the county by Sept. 8, business 
manager Glenn J. Sheppard said. County education officials could send in a team 
of fiscal advisers to order cuts if the new spending plan is unacceptable.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; MAN WHO SHOT OFFICER IS SENTENCED TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man convicted of attempted murder in the 1993 shooting of a city police 
officer has been sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Sims, 21, was given an additional eight years for shooting into an 
occupied vehicle and for leaving Officer Abel Dominguez with serious injuries, 
Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty.Barbara Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dominguez family was there," Turner said. "They were very pleased that he 
got a life sentence and that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Sims may be eligible for parole in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, 31, was shot three times by Sims -- once in the head -- during a 
routine traffic stop last August in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims and another man who was in the car, 19-year-old Cashus Ward, pleaded 
innocent to charges of attempted murder and lynching. On Aug. 3, a Superior 
Court jury convicted Sims of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual charge of lynching was filed on grounds the two men tried to take 
somebody from police custody, which is the legal definition of lynching. Ward 
was found guilty of releasing a friend from the back of Dominguez's patrol car. 
He was sentenced recently to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez is paralyzed on the left side of his body and must use a brace and a 
cane to walk. He may never regain complete vision in his left eye.

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; COMPTON COLLEGE TO TIGHTEN SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Compton Community College is tightening its spending practices in an effort to 
end its probationary status, President Byron R. Skinner said in a report to 
state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said the college is eliminating two widespread practices that drew 
criticism: hiring new employees and putting them on the payroll before trustees 
approved, and officials bypassing the purchasing office to buy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said such practices contributed to a $350,000 deficit last 
year at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner's report was submitted to the community colleges chancellor and the 
accrediting agency, the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges. The district was 
placed on probation in June by the association, which said the college needed 
more financial controls and administrative stability. 
</P>
<P>
 The college has also assembled a new management team, ending a period in which 
many acting administrators held key positions, Skinner said.  
</P>
<P>
 A new vice president of business affairs, director of human resources, 
director of institutional research and a public relations officer have been 
chosen. Skinner said a vice president of academic affairs will be selected by 
October and a vice president of student affairs should be hired by January. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's accreditation commission is scheduled to review the 
college's status in January. Skinner is scheduled to submit another progress 
report in October. JOHN D. WAGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance businessman Sam Fuji wants to bring Japanese culture to America, and 
he thinks Frank Sinatra -- or at least the crooner's songs that are karaoke 
favorites -- can help. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronics executive is one of the founders of Nikkei International 
Assn., a nonprofit group that plans to use the culture and traditions of Japan, 
such as karaoke, to promote cultural understanding.The group will hold its 
organizational meeting Sept. 25 at Sambi of Tokyo restaurant in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 In karaoke contests, at least one verse of a contestant's song must be in 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 'My Way,' they sing the first part in Japanese and the second in English 
or Spanish," Fuji said. "A lot of American people start learning Japanese that 
way. . . . That's what we are aiming for." 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans a national karaoke contest but also will provide a business 
network, educate people about Japanese culture and raise money for charity.  
</P>
<P>
 Fuji stresses that people of all races and cultures are welcome to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "To understand each other through culture is the biggest goal for us," Fuji 
said. "We always welcome other people to join us too."

COVER STORY; LIFE IN A BEEHIVE OF URBAN WOES; THE RENT IS CHEAP AND THE WALLS 
ARE GRAFFITI-FREE. BUT CRIME HAS ALSO FOUND A HOME IN CARMELITOS, THE COUNTY'S 
OLDEST AND LARGEST HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, it looks like a fine place to call home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Carmelitos public housing project in North Long Beach, working mothers 
take their children to day care at a community center filled with books and 
computers. Buildings are spotless, lawns manicured. Graffiti is nowhere in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents have lived there 20 years or more, enjoying comfortable 
apartments for prices that can't be beat. Families today pay an average of $131 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet behind its pleasant exterior, Los Angeles County's oldest and largest 
housing project is a troubled place. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs are sold openly day and night. Gunfire sometimes erupts within feet of 
the project's playground, sending children scurrying for cover. The U.S. Postal 
Service at one time suspended mail delivery after a postal carrier was 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complain that the violence has grown worse in recent years. Some 
anxious parents now keep police scanners by their bedsides and equip children 
with pagers to summon them home when trouble flares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Survival is the name of the game," said Vickie Rael, 46, who bought her 
12-year-old son a pager recently. "When I page him, he knows he's to be home in 
five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and police blame much of the trouble on gangs from Compton and 
South-Central Los Angeles who openly deal drugs in Carmelitos' maze of parking 
lots and apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have identified six active gangs in the project -- five from 
outside Long Beach -- and more than 520 gang members. The gangs lay claim to 
different parking lots where they have been known to sell marijuana and cocaine 
to buyers, who also come primarily from outside the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Carmelitos' two main roadways provide easy access to the 64-acre 
project. Acres of tree-lined areas and countless nooks between buildings offer 
ample cover for drug dealers, who are known to post children as lookouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reputation of Carmelitos is that you can come in here, score your drugs 
and leave," said Betsy Lindsay, a security consultant for the county agency 
that runs the project. "It's easy in, easy out." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been reluctant to speak up for fear of being labeled snitches, 
which they say can lead to reprisals by the gun-toting drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Community meetings on crime and other pressing issues frequently attract fewer 
than 50 people, a fraction of the development's 1,815 residents. Just 14 people 
turned out for a meeting in July to discuss postal security. The gathering had 
been organized by activists in Carmelitos' senior citizens' complex after a 
letter carrier had been robbed in front of the central mail drop earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract participants for a Neighborhood Watch, a group of tenants changed 
the name to the more benign Friends Helping Friends, and allows fellow renters 
to air problems confidentially. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know about shootings, but they don't dare speak up for fear of 
retaliation," said Wanda Flagg, a counselor who has worked closely with 
Carmelitos residents on job training and other programs. "They feel like 
they're on front street alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelitos' designers hadn't envisioned such problems when the complex opened 
in 1941. At the time, they saw an affordable alternative for the poor, where 
struggling families could get back on their feet, then move on to permanent 
housing, said Sam Lucchese, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Community 
Development Commission, which owns the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But plans didn't work out as envisioned. Successive generations of the 
families settled into the complex. Gangs and drugs began to appear. By the late 
1970s, Carmelitos earned a violent reputation, a place even Long Beach police 
were reluctant to enter alone for fear of being shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran tenants say things took a turn for the worse, ironically, after the 
complex underwent a massive $24-million renovation in the mid-1980s. Parts of 
the project were emptied during three years of remodeling. As units reopened, 
several undesirable tenants moved in. These newcomers also attracted friends 
and relatives who caused more trouble, police and residents said. Officials 
said they screen new tenants, but are prohibited from asking about criminal 
backgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first moved here, you could leave your doors unlocked," recalled 
Margaret Mangahas, a 30-year resident who raised her six children in 
Carmelitos. "You never worried about anyone stealing anything. We had problems 
like any neighborhood, but it wasn't like now." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Community Development Commission has deployed various law 
enforcement agencies -- including its own security force -- to crack down on 
crime and protect residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The county now contracts with Long Beach police to patrol the project and 
provide undercover gang and narcotics investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a private outfit, Platt Security & Event Services, that spends the 
most time in Carmelitos. Two to four armed officers patrol the complex on daily 
shifts of eight to 10 hours, bolstered by bicycle patrols five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 While Platt is widely praised by Long Beach police and other authorities, 
residents say they are reluctant to trust the security officers, contending 
that the guards ignore trouble in the complex and occasionally curse residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents mockingly refer to Platt personnel as "rent-a-cops" and joke that 
the letters in the company name stand for "Police Lacking Adequate Technical 
Training." 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them jackasses," said Ray Fox, an 18-year resident. "They don't take 
us seriously. Our fondest hope is to get rid of Platt." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Platt, the company's vice president, insisted that his staff of reserve 
and retired police officers has good relationships with most Carmelitos 
tenants. But the officers at times are overwhelmed by the amount of illegal 
activity occurring in the development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very active, but there are times when you might have to move past a 
(minor) offense to get to a more serious offense," said Platt, who started 
bicycle patrols in July to help officers establish closer ties in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are now taking additional measures to make Carmelitos safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The county recently directed all tenants to remove back-yard canopies and 
overgrown foliage to cut down on hiding places for illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year, the county plans to impose a nightly curfew on minors and to 
close Carmelitos to through traffic at night by installing gates on the 
project's two thoroughfares, Via Wanda and Via Carmelitos. The curfew times 
have yet to be decided.  
</P>
<P>
 Six-foot fences will seal areas between buildings to eliminate hiding places. 
A fence will also be put up along the complex's western boundary, an alley that 
offers an open door to trespassers from Atlantic Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, three-foot fences extend out from apartment buildings to keep 
passersby from walking across tenants' front yards. County officials believe 
the fences, along with front-yard gardens, will provide renters with a "sense 
of ownership and pride," motivating them to report criminal activity around 
their units. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to establish territories so families will care about what's going 
on," said Carolyn Hutchinson, one of Carmelitos' property supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the new measures have received mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents complain that they are being barricaded inside Carmelitos and 
worry that clever drug dealers will still find a way around the fences and 
gates. Others contend that the barriers will hinder security and police, as 
well as ambulances and other emergency vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're locking us in with the people already doing the damage," complained 
Joyce Blake, a 23-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake and others also say they doubt that the small front-yard fences will 
engender pride or prompt residents to be more vigilant. And some say the 
overall approach will inconvenience visitors and intrude on the parklike 
atmosphere of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to take our life away and make this a concentration camp," said 
Valeria Tariq, a 25-year resident and chairwoman of the Carmelitos Tenants' 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Tariq's sentiments are shared by only a handful of 
residents. The officials said they decided on the new measures only after 
receiving strong support from about 200 tenants who attended meetings over the 
last year to discuss the security issues. Many at the meetings asked the county 
to take firm steps to rid Carmelitos of drug dealers and other criminals, 
residents recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to save the children from this gang violence," said Marcella 
Thompson, 31, a mother of five and an ardent supporter of the county's efforts. 
"They're trying their best." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials insist that the new measures will make the complex safer and 
won't hinder residents, guests and emergency vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people have difficulty with change," said Maria Badrakhan, who 
oversees Carmelitos and other housing projects for the Community Development 
Commission. "Every time we have made improvements, we have encountered 
resistance at some level." 
</P>
<P>
 The new measures appear to have strong support among the project's vocal 
senior citizens, who live in a 155-unit complex on the Carmelitos grounds and 
have an active Neighborhood Watch of their own. Many say that opposition to the 
new security comes from a handful of outspoken tenants who regularly complain 
about county policies but refuse to take action on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of these people will not tell management what they want, but 
once management does something they are very willing to challenge and 
criticize," said Mae Lane, 52, an eight-year resident who is president of the 
Carmelitos Senior Complex Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane and others say, however, that Carmelitos gets an unfair rap as a violent 
place and that its honest families and many positive aspects are often 
overlooked amid the attention paid to lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fenced in by stigma," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, housing officials and police say the crime rate in Carmelitos has 
remained about the same the past seven years. Police also say Carmelitos is no 
more violent than dozens of other areas in Long Beach, although they do not 
keep crime statistics by neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants and county officials point out that the $24-million renovation in the 
mid-1980s drew national recognition, including an award from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 They also talk about the vast network of services at Carmelitos that allow 
residents to earn high school diplomas and learn computer, landscaping and 
other job skills. 
</P>
<P>
 They also speak of new recreation facilities, including a new tennis court at 
the complex where tournaments are occasionally held. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths will be able to play soccer on a new field that will open soon in the 
complex and tenants will be able to plant their own vegetables in a new urban 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to provide alternatives," Badrakhan said. "This is much more 
than any private landlord would offer. We are investing millions of dollars in 
improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its problems, some tenants say Carmelitos is the best home they have 
ever known -- a jewel of public housing that provides low-income families -- 
three-quarters of whom earn less than $10,000 a year -- with reasonable rents 
and comfortable dwellings. In this tightly knit melting pot, residents of 
different races mix comfortably and say they enjoy racial harmony absent in the 
world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you mention Carmelitos on the outside, everybody says, 'You live in that 
place?' Lane said. "But there is nowhere you can live that is so economical and 
so well maintained. Carmelitos is too clean to look like a project." Carmelitos

 Behind the pleasant and well-tended exterior of Carmelitos, Los Angeles 
County's oldest and largest housing project, is a troubled place. Drugs are 
sold openly and gunfire sometimes erupts near the project's playground. Much of 
the trouble is blamed on gangs from Compton and South-Central Los Angeles. 
Officials are taking steps, such as screening new tenants and ordering 
stepped-up security patrols, in an effort to make Carmelitos safer, but not 
everyone agrees that enough is being done.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FRESH FISH WORTH REMEMBERING AT THE SAND CRAB CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN The Sand Crab Cafe is at 11402 Old River School Road, 
Downey. (310) 927-0232. Open Sunday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and 
Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

<P>
 Sometimes, a dining experience turns out so memorable that you can't get it 
out of your mind. I remember the first time I went to a great restaurant: I was 
16 and my dad took me to Perino's, at the time widely considered to be the 
premier restaurant in Southern California. It left a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rita and Sandy Crabbe -- owners of, quite fittingly, the Sand Crab Cafe in 
Downey -- it was a dinner in Orlando, Fla., where they dined at a New 
England-style seafood restaurant complete with mallets (to crack the fresh 
shellfish) and bibs (to keep the cleaning bills down). They had such an 
enjoyable time that they remembered that meal 10 years later, when they moved 
to San Diego to see their grandson more often. Soon, the first Sand Crab Cafe 
was born in Escondido. Business went well and recently the second Sand Crab 
Cafe opened on Old River School Road in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 The location, formerly a Sir George's Smorgasbord, has been redone in a 
nautical motif -- fish nets hanging about, models of sea captains and sailing 
ships, posters of ships and various knots. Perhaps of more immediate interest 
to the diners is a large tank filled with live Maine lobsters, and another with 
crabs from Alaska, Texas and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find complex fish and sauce preparations here. The pride of the 
house is a range of fresh seafood simply boiled in water and seasoned with 
salt, white pepper, garlic, cayenne and a few spices. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular order is the fisherman's sampler ($24.95 for two), which 
includes shrimp, clams, snow crab, crawfish, New Zealand mussels, stone crab 
claws and slipper lobster tail, served with corn on the cob, new potatoes and 
sourdough bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the appetizers are a baked crab cake ($2.95), fried calamari rings 
($3.95) and a clam chowder full of fresh clams ($3). 
</P>
<P>
 A children's menu features fish and chips ($2.95) and spaghetti with meat 
sauce ($2.95). MICHAEL KRIKORIAN The Sand Crab Cafe is at 11402 Old River 
School Road, Downey. (310) 927-0232. Open Sunday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 9 
p.m. and Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

BASKETBALL HAS BECOME MORE THAN A GAME TO VAROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Varos is going on vacation over Labor Day Weekend, but, as always, 
basketball won't be far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Varos works full time as a shipping and receiving supervisor at Cal State L.A. 
After work, he officiates basketball games as many as six nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be any officiating for Varos this weekend, but he will have some 
coaching to do when he takes his family to Phoenix -- along with Varos' 
traveling basketball team East Los. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, comprised of players recruited by Varos from games he has 
officiated, will play in the 14th annual National Hispanic Classic. The 32-team 
double elimination tournament will feature Latino teams from throughout the 
United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could call me a basketball fanatic," Varos, 47, said. "I don't 
look at it as a tournament, I look at it as a vacation. It's a family thing. 
The fun and the people you meet outweigh the expenses involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Some fun. His wife is in charge of washing the uniforms. Daughters Nancy, 23, 
and KimRene, 21, help with statistics and the scorebook during games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually look forward to the tournaments," Varos' wife Martha said. "We are 
a tight family and we all like to root for the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monterey Park family has had a lot to cheer about. East Los has won 
tournaments in Flagstaff, Ariz., San Francisco and Coachella, Calif. The 
2-year-old team is made up of players that range in age from 21 to 36. 
</P>
<P>
 The team includes former Rio Hondo College players Tony Rubio and Chris Allen 
as well as Tony Stevens, who played at Cantwell High and East L.A. College. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Espinoza played at East L.A. College and Alex Del Hierro played at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. Jerry Espinosa and Ricardo Lopes from Bell High are 
members of the 10-player team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al brings in guys with the same intense desire for basketball as himself and 
puts together a team with chemistry," said Stevens, 36, an assistant football 
coach at South Pasadena High. "He gives players an opportunity to continue 
playing in an organized way and for younger players to get experience to play 
in college." 
</P>
<P>
 And after college. Steve Leary, who played on East Los last year, is playing 
in the Continental Basketball Assn. Varos' son Mike, 25, who played at Schurr 
High and Cal State L.A., is playing professionally in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It was through his son's youth leagues in Montebello that Varos first became 
involved with officiating 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could do a better job than the officials were doing," Varos said. 
"In retrospect, I wasn't really ready. The very first time I was not really 
knowledgeable with the rules. " 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when he made the jump to the high school level in 1982. Varos had 
to pass a written test and a field exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to do high school games, you have to go to classes, you have to know 
the rules. You can't just go out there and think you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Varos, who officiates both City and Southern Section games, has proven his 
credentials over the past decade. He is a board member on the San Gabriel 
Valley unit of the California Basketball Officials Assn., the governing body 
for high school referees. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, he officiated the State Southern California Regional Division 
semifinal between Pacific Hills and Campbell Hall. He has also been a referee 
in the Police Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the excitement of high school games the most," Varos said. "As a 
spectator, I prefer the college game. When I walk into a game or look at a box 
score, I don't look at the players. The first thing I look for is to see who 
the referees are and if it's somebody I know." 
</P>
<P>
 Varos, though, has no plans of joining his colleagues at the collegiate level. 
Instead, his ultimate goal is to someday serve as an assistant coach for his 
son at a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good officials who want to move up have to work hard, and to move up in the 
ranks you have to really pursue it," Varos said. "And it's something I really 
never pursued. In the back of my mind, I'd say I might have wanted to but I 
enjoyed watching my son playing more." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the bulk of Varos' officiating is done in parks and recreation and 
other adult leagues in L.A. and Orange counties. He usually makes about $60 
officiating three games a night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I meet a lot of different guys just by word of mouth," Varos said. "There's 
basketball going on every day in every city. If you do a good job and they like 
your work, they usually call you back. But officials don't do it for the money. 
It has to be a hobby, a passion. If I wasn't officiating, I'd be watching a 
game somewhere."

NOTEBOOK / KIRBY LEE; PATH CLEARED FOR L.A. COURT TO HEAR LAWSUIT ON BASKETBALL 
PLAYER'S DEATH

 The state Supreme Court has cleared the path for a Los Angeles court to hear 
the lawsuit filed by the mother of former Lynwood High and Oregon State 
basketball player Earnest Killum. The court denied a review of an appeal by the 
state of Oregon, which argued it had jurisdiction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Killum, 20, died Jan. 20, 1992, while on a trip to Los Angeles, three days 
after suffering his second stroke in six months. Killum, who suffered from a 
rare vascular disorder, had been cleared to play a month earlier by university 
doctors, who reduced his dosage of anti-clotting medication that increased his 
susceptibility to bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit against the university, a Portland hospital and the state of Oregon 
filed by Thelma Lillard claims Killum was not properly informed of his 
condition, was allowed to play prematurely and was not diagnosed and treated 
properly.

 A minor league baseball franchise is coming to Long Beach as part of the newly 
formed Western Baseball League. The double-A team, part of an eight-team 
league, will play a 90-game schedule running from May through September. 
</P>
<P>
 Home games will be played at Long Beach State and nearly $1 million in 
renovations are planned to the field by 643 Sports Inc., the ownership group of 
the Long Beach franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Team owners have agreed to install lights at a cost of about $250,000 and 
temporary bleachers to accommodate as many as 5,000 spectators. Permanent 
seating will be installed in upcoming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teams in the league include Palm Springs, Salins, Rohnert Park, 
Winnatchee, Wash., Tri Cities, Wash., Aberdeen, Wash., and Surrey, British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Players for the league will be selected from tryout camps and a draft. Teams 
are restricted by a $92,000 salary cap and a maximum of six players with more 
than four years of professional experience and a minimum of six players who 
have not played professionally.

REGIONAL REPORT; JOB DREAMS FLY HIGH AT AVIATION CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 16-year-old Ayinde Mitchell, the dream of flying started when he was a 
toddler. "I've always had an infatuation with how planes fly," said Mitchell, 
an honor student at Westchester High. 
</P>
<P>
 As he got older, Mitchell's dreams became more ambitious and his goals turned 
toward business and government. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never lost interest in aviation, and after spending a week at the 
Aviation Careers Education camp flying Boeing 727 simulators, learning the 
history of African Americans in aviation and landing a single-engine Cessna at 
Santa Monica Airport, Mitchell made a career decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a CEO, a politician and I like aviation -- so I came up with 
airport manager," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what the organizers and backers of the ACE camp, which is based at the 
Museum of Flying at Santa Monica Airport, like to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong program run by the Federal Aviation Administration is aimed at 
encouraging minority students to find jobs in aviation, from airline pilots and 
mechanics to airport managers and astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't the youth excitement about planes today," said James 
Whitehead, an FAA safety manager and retired Air Force general who helped start 
the ACE program in Los Angeles. Flying today is taken for granted, he said, and 
the ACE program is designed to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the program has more than 80 camps across the nation, this is the 
first year an ACE camp has been located in the Los Angeles Basin, said FAA 
spokesman Hank Verbais. The 31 students who participated this year were chosen 
by local community groups, including Young Black Scholars and the Inglewood 
Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The camp was started in 1971 by a former military pilot turned judge who was 
tired of sending teen-agers to prison. It has evolved into a hands-on training 
session that takes students out of the classroom and puts them in the cockpit, 
Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA requires regional directors to strive for at least a 50% minority and 
female enrollment in the camps. In its first year here, the minority enrollment 
was more than 95%, almost exclusively African American, Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
 During camp, students spend some of their time attending lectures on the 
history of aviation and the basics of flying, plus group discussions with 
industry professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 But students spend the majority of the week touring passenger and cargo 
terminals at Los Angeles International Airport, the control tower at Santa 
Monica Airport and several types of aircraft -- including a customized, luxury 
727 owned by MGM Grand and an MD-11 wide-body hollowed out to ship packages for 
Federal Express. Students also operated Boeing 727 and 737 simulators through 
takeoffs and landings. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, flying a single-engine Cessna -- with an instructor -- was the 
highlight of the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would be able to fly," Westchester student Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that the camp can cost as much as $50,000 to operate -- far 
more than the $1,000 provided by the FAA. Some ACE camps charge up to $100 to 
participate, Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 But donations by local companies and organizations have made up the difference 
and allowed the camp to run without charging students tuition in Los Angeles, 
said Fred Richards, an FAA employee who directs the class.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, camp officials are optimistic about running the camp next year, but 
Whitehead keeps a realistic attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are tough times and it's all based on funding," but there is widespread 
private interest in supporting the program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to turn kids on to flying, and you can't do that in a 
classroom," he said.

AUTOS: PLAN FOR $200-MILLION TRACK, RESEARCH COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Pook, who founded the highly successful Long Beach Grand Prix, has 
proposed, with Long Beach City Council members reacting enthusiastically, a 
$200-million auto racetrack and research complex that would be built on 200 
acres of unsightly land straddling the cities of Signal Hill and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 (Pook) should forget Signal Hill as a partner in his latest endeavor, due to 
the escalating friction as the cities compete with each other to attract retail 
and industrial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mr. Pook and his dream team wish to make his vision a reality, they should 
devote their expertise to creating an alternate plan and location to construct 
the racetrack and research project in Long Beach at the downtown shoreline and 
beach area that could provide unlimited parking and seating for racing fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook should, to control costs, eliminate any additional hotels in his master 
plan, as the downtown area is already saturated with vacant hotels, motels and 
apartments. He will eventually need their support both politically and 
financially, to get his grandiose plan off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's proposed racing events should continue to utilize the proven, existing 
Grand Prix format, with a few route variations that could include racing around 
the existing port facilities and a newly constructed beach circular speedway to 
Belmont Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 If feasible, Pook should consider adding an Indy-style 500-mile race as a 
grand year-end finale to the racing festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected justifiable protests from residents due to noise and traffic could be 
offset by the addition of a $1.2-billion-a-year cash bonanza to the local 
economy and the employment of 13,000 racetrack employees, plus additional 
thousands due to the anticipated $557-million Queensway Bay tourist attraction 
redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 This should revitalize the downtown business economy, including the revenue 
from the rental by new employees of apartments and motels in the depressed 
Ocean Boulevard area. 
</P>
<P>
 If this racing complex becomes a reality, the expected thousands of 
free-spending, avid racing spectators will have created a monstrous, expensive 
debris cleanup problem. This could be easily solved by dumping the debris in 
the ocean. Under its present condition, nobody will notice the difference.

PEOPLE: HELP FOR GRANDPARENTS ON 2ND GO-ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Life took on new meaning for Barbara Wasson at age 53, when she suddenly 
became a parent again. Just as she and her husband were preparing for 
retirement, their son's children came to live with them.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Wasson became mom to an 11-month-old girl, and eight months 
later, a 4-month-old boy.  
</P>
<P>
 "My life completely changed. I couldn't do what I wanted to do any more, go to 
lunch or go shopping. You don't have time or energy to play cards or go out to 
dinner because you can't ever find a baby-sitter. We lost most of our friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The children's mother, who is not married to Wasson's son, was recently 
released to a drug rehabilitation program after a nine-month jail sentence for 
selling drugs, Wasson said. Wasson said her son, who also lives with them, has 
legal custody of his two children but is unable to support them on the salary 
he earns as a manager of a service station. So Wasson and her husband Grady, a 
computer programmer, stepped in.  
</P>
<P>
 The grandchildren have shown Wasson something her own children never did, she 
said, "how precious life can be. I never understood that before."  
</P>
<P>
 The understanding came three years ago when Wasson joined Grandparents as 
Parents, a Long Beach-based support group for the ever-growing number of 
middle-aged and elderly people raising grandchildren, Wasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she is one of five directors of the private, nonprofit organization, 
which also has groups in West Los Angeles, Glendale and Bellflower. "My 
greatest accomplishment in life has been working with the grandparents," she 
said. "I now know I was put on this earth to do something like this. I have 
meaning. I feel fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 She added quickly: "I also feel tired. Children give us a reason to get up in 
the morning. And God knows they give us a reason to go to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1990, the number of grandparents raising grandchildren more than 
tripled, from 988,000 to 3.2 million nationwide, according to U.S. Census data. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a Long Beach therapist noticed a need for a local grandparents 
support group and started Grandparents as Parents, Wasson said. Since then, 
nearly 50 similar organizations have started throughout California, with many 
more around the nation, Wasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have new friends all over the country. Whenever I need to talk to somebody, 
I can pick up the phone and call. When you know you're not alone, that somebody 
else understands, you tend to flock together." 
</P>
<P>
 The group helps Wasson and other grandparents cope with situations that they 
never encountered when raising their own children. Between four and 20 
grandparents meet weekly in Long Beach to share parenting problems. They 
discuss how to cope with being thrust into their circumstances by spousal 
murder, drug abuse, suicide, gangs and a host of other problems that are 
leaving more and more children in the care of people other than birth parents.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest problem grandparents face is guilt, she said. "Sometimes 
they feel it's their fault, they feel guilty about what they did with their own 
children. How can (people) say it's your fault? When kids are in their 20s and 
30s, they make their own choices." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wassons will continue taking care of their grandchildren for as long as 
the children need them, Barbara Wasson said. "We have no date in mind. They'll 
stay with us until (my son) feels like he can handle them." Even if they move 
to a new home, the children will always be in their lives, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I look at our grandkids and see that they are the future," she said. "We want 
to protect our future and theirs."

 Curbside recycling -- The Bellflower City Council approved a curbside 
recycling program earlier this month by a 3-2 vote. Council members Art Olivier 
and Ruth Gilson opposed the measure. An Aug. 18 story incorrectly reported the

MUSIC REVIEW; BLOMSTEDT AND S.F. SYMPHONY BRING THE BLAHS TO THE BOWL

 The summer season at Hollywood Bowl is beginning to wind down. But while our 
own Philharmonic tours to conquer Europe, the parade of visiting orchestras 
grinds on at Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 This week we are playing host to Herbert Blomstedt -- a solidly professional 
old-school maestro -- and his San Francisco Symphony -- a perfectly competent 
orchestra that can be considerably more than that under the right conditions on 
the right night. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night apparently was not the right night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing went seriously wrong in a conservative program (the first of three 
consecutive conservative programs) devoted to Rachmaninoff's semi-somnolent 
quasi-valedictory Symphonic Dances and Beethoven's hardy Seventh Symphony. 
Unfortunately, nothing turned out to be genuinely memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just another opening, another show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda began with rather odd attention to the obligatory "Star-Spangled 
Banner." Ever courteous, Blomstedt waved his stick directly at the sing-along 
throng, turning his back on the orchestra. No problem. The players obviously 
know how their boss looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Any innocent patriot out front who tried to follow Blomstedt sign-language, 
however, was in trouble. Even allowing for the automatic confusion enforced by 
sonic time delay in the wide open spaces, the beat seemed erratic, the melodic 
impetus jerky. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one approached the real music on the agenda with a 
little trepidation. Not to worry. Early in the concert, it became clear that 
the San Franciscans understand what Blomstedt wants. After nine years under his 
no-nonsense leadership, they have had a lot of practice reading his complex 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachmaninoff's melancholic, sometimes bloated, occasionally poignant Symphonic 
Dances of 1940 didn't exactly soar on this occasion. Still, the pacing was 
always logical. The stresses all came in the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the abiding murk of the "improved" amplification system (it hasn't 
been a good summer for the microphone engineers), the orchestra sounded bright 
and tight. That is more than could be said for the itinerant ensemble from 
Detroit last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Blomstedt managed to turn Beethoven's indomitable Seventh 
into something like an extended academic exercise. There were no exaggerations 
here, and no distortions. Nor was there much inspiration or excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro, ever cool, took no chances. The internal repetitions emerged 
dutiful rather than climactic. The secondary voices tended to get buried in 
textural mush. The tempos were brisk yet rigid. The ultimate cadence brought 
relief rather than resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 We probably can thank Beethoven more than Blomstedt for the inevitable 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Blomstedt had the good sense to resist any temptation to add an encore. 
Beethoven is a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1994-95 season will be Blomstedt's last as music director in San 
Francisco. The mood and the mode will no doubt change drastically when Michael 
Tilson Thomas takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although a stellar soloist might have made the occasion more festive, and 
the bill more attractive, the concert reportedly attracted an audience of 
9,215. The crowd didn't look that big to the untrained eye. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was a buzzingly busy night in the sky, with eight aeronautical intrusions 
-- most of them obliterating Beethoven's pianissimo passages, of course. One 
wonders what happened to the official system that used to route planes away 
from the Bowl on concert nights.

GEARING UP FOR FIGHT NIGHT ON TUESDAYS; TELEVISION: WHO'LL WIN THE 'FRASIER' 
VS. 'HOME IMPROVEMENT' MATCHUP? IT WON'T BE VIEWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The NBC comedy "Frasier," a spinoff of "Cheers," came flying out of the chute 
last season and in no time at all became a member of the ratings elite. 
</P>
<P>
 The big surprise, however, was how confident and stylish the show looked for a 
brand-new entry. The writing was snappy and smart. The cast, headed by "Cheers" 
veteran Kelsey Grammer, seemed like a closely knit veteran ensemble with 
several seasons already under its belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Paired with "Seinfeld," "Frasier" gave NBC a potent Thursday one-two punch, 
with both series almost automatically finishing in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 A network dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC had bigger dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck in third place in the ratings, NBC decided that "Frasier" was the lethal 
weapon it needed to build another strong night and boost its prime-time 
momentum on the long road back. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, NBC stunned the industry last spring by announcing that its new hit -- 
in which psychiatrist Frasier Crane returned home to Seattle to start a 
radio-advice show -- would switch to Tuesdays and challenge ABC's entrenched 
"Roseanne" series head-on this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some "Frasier" executives and cast members say they were "shocked," 
"horrified" and yet also flattered at the network's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more of a shake-up to come. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, probably sensing that "Roseanne" would still win but that the series was 
aging and vulnerable, last week yanked it from Tuesdays, switched it to 
Wednesdays and counterprogrammed "Frasier" with its big bazooka, "Home 
Improvement." Their first battle will be Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the seemingly invincible "Home Improvement," last season's No. 1 show, 
demolish "Frasier," as it did "Seinfeld" in the past? Will "Frasier" hold its 
own? 
</P>
<P>
 NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield thinks ABC has blinked. He 
quotes an advertising executive as saying: "The first big battle of the season, 
'Frasier' vs. 'Roseanne,' is over. The result: 'Frasier, TKO." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe. But "Roseanne" could also wind up No. 1 if "Frasier" and "Home 
Improvement" cut into each other's audience. It won't have any comedy 
competition at 9 p.m. Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield dismisses the notion that "Frasier" could get hurt by "Home 
Improvement," saying: "It won't. It's too popular a show. It's a rocket ship 
right now. Nothing can stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Counters ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert: "NBC picked this fight by 
moving 'Frasier' to Tuesday night at 9. Since they picked a fight, we'll finish 
it. I felt provoked to take action to protect the long-term interests of ABC on 
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 'Frasier' is very well done," he adds. "But everybody likes 'Home 
Improvement' -- all age groups and demographics. They don't get nearly the 
creative credit that they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back at the "Frasier" offices. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense mincing words," says Peter Casey, one of the creators of the 
series. "We were not happy at all being moved out of Thursday nights. We felt 
we earned that spot and performed incredibly well. We wanted to remain there. 
It bugged us because (NBC) moved our other show, 'Wings,' too" -- also to 
Tuesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds David Lee, another of the creators of "Frasier" and "Wings": "We don't 
mind being a good soldier, but we don't want to be the entire army." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne" looked tough enough to the "Frasier" producers. And then came the 
howitzer called "Home Improvement." But Lee, Casey and co-executive producer 
Christopher Lloyd (not the actor) maintain that they will not alter the series 
to adjust to the ABC competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did sophisticated stories," says Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to change the show at all," says Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 They also vow to avoid a lot of stunt casting. But former "Cheers" star Ted 
Danson is mentioned as a possible guest performer. Bebe Neuwirth, another 
"Cheers" regular whose character was once married to the stuffy Dr. Crane, was 
a notable guest-star on the "Frasier" series last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at NBC's strategy, Lee concedes that the move of "Frasier" is in a 
sense "flattering. They (NBC) made this bold move" -- and "Roseanne" was 
switched. "So they (ABC) blinked, and that's kind of neat." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we held 'Home Improvement' to a draw" in the ratings, cracks Casey, "I 
don't think you could find enough champagne in these halls. I understand what 
NBC is trying to do. They don't want forever to win (only) one night a week. In 
that case, I think NBC made a very good point. I wish they'd made it with 
'Seinfeld' and 'Mad About You' instead of us." 
</P>
<P>
 James Burrows, who directed 13 of the 24 "Frasier" episodes last season, says 
that NBC's move of the series "shocked" him "initially, and then I applauded." 
He thinks it's a smart tactic, "akin to moving 'The Simpsons' opposite 'Cosby.' 
I know they (NBC) did a lot of research. The fact that they made ABC screw up 
two of their nights is significant because TV-watching is a habit." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, of course, it comes down to networks' using hit shows as weapons, 
often to the chagrin of viewers who have to choose between highly popular 
series -- as with "Frasier" and "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two shows have distinctly different appeal, VCR use might 
increase during the competition, and overall network viewership conceivably 
could rise as people tune in the competing hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams, co-creator of "Home Improvement," isn't happy with the move of 
his series either. He says "Frasier" has "an appealing cast and it's 
well-written and that puts it in the front of the pack. It's funny and it's 
considered smart, and it is."  
</P>
<P>
 An NBC spokesman said Grammer declined to comment on the latest network moves. 
But Littlefield says that when he told Grammer that "Frasier" was being 
switched to Tuesdays, the actor had a positive response, saying he wasn't 
surprised and that he was confident the show would do well wherever it played. 
</P>
<P>
 If quality was all that counted, "Frasier" would indeed hold its own anywhere. 
It's one of the most consistently satisfying series to come along in years. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hyde Pierce, who plays Grammer's slightly askew psychiatrist brother, 
and Jane Leeves, the home-care worker, think a key reason the show has 
succeeded is the professional rapport that quickly developed among the cast 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the NBC and ABC program-switching, Pierce says: "Basically, everything 
that's happened has been a compliment. The fact that NBC would want to build a 
night around us is a compliment, and the fact that ABC had concerns about what 
kind of threat we might pose is a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sizing up "Frasier's" appeal, Leeves says: "It has a little bit of everything. 
There are these two intellectual windbags (Frasier and his brother) for the 
intellectuals. There's the working class -- me and Martin (the crusty, ex-cop 
father of the brothers, played by John Mahoney). And there's a dog (Eddie) for 
the kids. What more could you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing her own confidence in the show's future, Leeves says: "I think 
'Frasier' has its own legs. It doesn't need 'Seinfeld' as a lead-in. Obviously, 
ABC is worried." 
</P>
<P>
 "What stands out to me," says Mahoney, "is I don't think we ever had a bad 
script. Over the summer, I've watched the reruns, and I'm constantly struck by 
the level of the writing." 
</P>
<P>
 When the show was moved -- at first against "Roseanne" -- he says, "I was 
horrified. I thought, 'Well, you don't get very long to rest on your laurels.' 
" As for now going up against "Home Improvement," he says: "I don't think we 
have the same audience. We don't have any children on our show. We're a more 
cerebral show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly think that we'll have an audience. It's not going to be as big as the 
one we had, but I don't think we're going to go down the tubes. I think we're 
going to have legs of our own. I really don't think it's going to be as 
devastating as when I first heard about it."
